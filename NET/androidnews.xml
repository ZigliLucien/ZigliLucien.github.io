<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You've ever found yourself in need of a second monitor — either while traveling or otherwise — or just need a monitor that's easy to bring anywhere. It even has a kickstand!</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't like IPS displays. I'm not sure why else you wouldn't want this monitor.</p><p>I particularly love the included case that doubles as a stand. Like I said before, it makes the thing look like a tablet — which tells you how portable it is — so it's easy to slap in a travel bag and not look like a weirdo who carries a monitor around with them.</p><p>Most tablets, smartphones, laptops, Chromebooks, and even some consoles support USB-C display out, so it's likely whatever you're looking to plug the monitor into will just work. Don't try it with a Nintendo Switch, though, because that needs to be plugged into the dock to output to a monitor or TV.</p>

<p>As described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-solo-4-review">our glowing Beats Solo 4 review</a>, these wireless headphones succeed in balancing warm, balanced sound with a lightweight, versatile design and up to 50 hours of battery life on a single charge. I&apos;d recommend buying these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> at full price, but with a 50% Cyber Monday discount?

You even get a few surprising features out of the deal, such as spatial audio support (that actually works) and some ultra-fast charging capabilities. The Beats Solo 4 are all about balance and value, and in those regards, they&apos;re an absolute triumph.</p>

The major highlight of this report is the possibility that Qualcomm could increase the price of the 2025 flagship chip by a "significant" amount.</p><p>The chip has been dubbed the Snapdragon 8 Elite "Gen 2," with the report alleging that "various internal and external factors" are the situation's primary catalyst.</p><p>It remains to be seen how this affects the end-user (consumers); however, the publication claimed "component suppliers have been notified." It seems like OEMs and suppliers will feel this price hike first as the post states such suppliers will "raise base prices" or enter "intense" negotiations.</p><p>Those at Android Police spotted a rumor from Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/P2FgMulRq">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS), who offered insight into the 2nd-gen's potential changes. According to their post, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite "Gen 2" may be based on TSMC's N3P process. This is reportedly an enhanced version of its 3nm process, per the publication.</p><p>DCS alleges the chip could see a ~20% "performance improvement" and feature "built-in single-frame-level power consumption reduction technology."</p><p>We're likely almost a year out from another flagship Qualcomm debut, but the idea of a price hike <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-rumored-price-hike-sour">echoes what we've heard</a> about the Galaxy S25 series. Rumors in September said Samsung's next flagship series could see a ~20% price increase due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. The purchasing cost for the chip was reportedly around $190. It's no hiding the fact that Qualcomm boosted its 2024 chip with the Oryon CPU cores.</p><p>The report from KiPost adds that Samsung could get hit pretty hard by this SoC price increase, similar to what we've heard about its upcoming phone trio.</p><p>The SoC delivers a 44% efficiency boost and a 45% performance increase for flagship models. The graphics processing capabilities have also gone up, but the cost for doing it again might cost <em>even more</em>.</p><p>Nothing is for sure right now, so we'll have to keep calm about what this <em>could </em>mean for consumers. It's also unclear if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tsmc-us-investigation-breakdown">what's been going on with TSMC</a> is affecting Qualcomm's 2025 outlook already. What we can turn to now are recent rumors about Qualcomm's next toned-down flagship chip: the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8s-elite-power-changes-rumored">Snapdragon 8s Elite</a>." Tipsters claim the chip sits somewhere between the SD 8 Gen 2 and the SD 8 Gen 3. It also seems that it could debut in Q1 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google was spotted working on a new AI-backed feature Chrome that could bring some peace of mind when shopping.</p><p>The feature was noticed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Leopeva64/status/1862472230849917178">Leopeva64</a> on X, who states Google Chrome on desktop could pick up AI-sourced "Store Reviews" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-store-review-feature-3504394/">Android Authority</a>). According to the tipster, this feature is reportedly preparing to show users a complete "summary" of reviews grabbed from popular websites like "Trust Pilot, ScamAdvisor, and more."</p><p>They were able to surface the feature's basic structure in the deep dive. It was discovered that Google may pop "Store Reviews" into the "View Site Information" button on desktop. Currently, clicking this expands on your site permissions and settings. However, "Store Reviews" may find themselves featured at the bottom of this small menu.</p><p>Clicking on that will supposedly open a quick blurb of the review alongside Google's usual explainer that it's powered by AI.</p><p>The tipster states that clicking on it now — since it's early in development — doesn't offer an AI-generated review. However, it seems that the quick summary will appear in this short menu. Moreover, the post states Google is also working on a button that produces a "side panel" in Chrome. This panel will supposedly host "all of the reviews" for a given website.</p><p>So, for users who want to really dive in to what other's are saying, that might be your best bet. Since things still need figuring out, we'll likely have to wait a while before this hits Chrome.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google is preparing another AI-powered feature for Chrome called “Store reviews,” this feature will show you a “summary of reviews from independent websites like Trust Pilot, ScamAdvisor, and more,” this summary will be displayed in the page info bubble:https://t.co/yDCBBbfzg4 pic.twitter.com/pMOXymaNum<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1862472230849917178">November 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Google started down a path to AI-ify Chrome earlier this year when it highlighted the launch of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-bringing-ai-to-chrome-but-in-the-right-way">experimental features</a>. Among the features was the ability to "Create with AI' to make customized themes in Chrome. Another feature was the ability to leverage AI to group your tabs, which users could tell the browser to place "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-update-brings-better-organization-of-tabs">similar tabs</a>" together. That feature has since rolled out on desktop and Android, giving users more ways to stay organized.</p><p>Other AI features include "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-222-12pm-et-google-chrome-update-brings-help-me-write-and-generative-ai-to-any-website">Help me write</a>" within Chrome. Users can utilize this feature in any text box when using the browser through Google Workspace. The feature utilizes the context of the page you're on to help you create a piece of text alongside your added description.</p><p>The company is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-project-jarvis-ai-agent-report">reportedly working to bolster</a> Chrome's AI even further with a new agent. A report claimed that Google is creating an AI agent called "Jarvis" that can enable automatic tasks inside Chrome. Jarvis allegedly works by taking screenshots of what you're doing so it can "interpret" the next best course of action and get it done for you.</p>

<ul><li>In a blog post, OnePlus confirmed that it will launch the new OnePlus 13 globally next month.</li><li>First releasing in China in October 2024, the rest of the world will get the OnePlus 13 in January 2025.</li><li>It's unclear whether the rumored OnePlus 13R would launch at the same time as the OnePlus 13, or get a staggered release.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus' CEO Pete Lau officially confirmed that the company will launch the OnePlus 13 globally in January 2025 in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1734446167443374088" target="_blank">blog post</a> today, Dec. 2. While Lau didn't share a more specific release date, this confirms that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> is headed to more markets soon. The latest flagship from OnePlus, sticking to tradition, launched early in China in October.</p><p>While the OnePlus 12 launched on Feb. 6 of this year in the US and global markets, it stands to reason that the newer model might debut much sooner than that. For reference, the OnePlus 12 released in China on Dec. 5, 2023. The company moved up its China release for the OnePlus 13, and the global launch is expected to follow suit. OnePlus could reveal the OnePlus 13 to the world sometime in early-to-mid January, almost syncing up with the expected launch timeline for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung's Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XSzAZDXTpRYXADiJvSPikh" name="OnePlus-13-launch-teaser.jpg" alt="OnePlus 13 launch tease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XSzAZDXTpRYXADiJvSPikh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the phone already launched in China, we know what the OnePlus 13 will bring when it debuts next month. You'll get Qualcomm's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite"><u>Snapdragon 8 Elite</u></a> platform, up to 24GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of storage. Additionally, the phone will ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15 (based on Android 15)</a>, with a slew of new AI features.</p><p>Aside from the brief mention in OnePlus' blog post commencing the 11th anniversary of the brand, OnePlus also shared the news in a promotional email, shown via a screenshot below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.56%;"><img id="jdkSbGrhG75P9yaqFuQBD6" name="OnePlus-13-Coming Soon" alt="An email promo from OnePlus about the OnePlus 13." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jdkSbGrhG75P9yaqFuQBD6.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1072" height="1614" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is something left to mystery, though. While there have been subtle confirmations and major leaks regarding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-rendering-additional-specs-leak">OnePlus 13R</a>, we don't know whether this midrange phone will launch alongside the flagship OnePlus 13. If it launches in China this month, there's a good chance we could see it debut sometime in January 2025 worldwide. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-upcoming-global-launch-rumors">OnePlus Watch 3</a> is another upcoming OnePlus product to watch out for.</p>

In addition to record-smashing discounts on Pixel phones and 50% off one of the best unlimited plans in the United States, the T-Mobile-owned (and Ryan Reynolds-approved) MVNO carrier is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mintmobile.com/phone-plans/3-month-plans/"><strong>giving away a FREE month of wireless</strong></a> when you sign up for three months of the 5GB plan. </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>Mint Mobile's Cyber Monday sale is LIVE — see the full list of deals</strong></a></li></ul>
<p>That means that for one upfront payment of $30, you&apos;ll get unlimited talk, text, and 5GB of data on T-Mobile&apos;s vast 5G network for three full months, not to mention Wi-Fi calling, free calls to Mexico and Canada, and a free mobile hotspot. The offer is merely the latest in a long line of seemingly illogical Mint Mobile deals to drop around this year&apos;s Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale events, but I&apos;m certainly not complaining.</p>

<p>Curious about Mint Mobile? Join the carrier today on the 5GB plan and you'll get one month of your first three months for completely free. That knocks the price of the plan down to only $30 for three months! Not too shabby for one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carriers</a> in the business. </p>

<p>If you're okay committing to a full year of wireless in one fell swoop, forget everything I just said and check out this Cyber Monday deal that carves a whopping $500 off the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> AND 50% off one year of the top-rated Unlimited plan when you purchase the two items together at Mint.</p>
<p>That means you could get one of the best phones released this year alongside a full 12 months of Unlimited wireless for a single payment of $479 (or $20/month with affirm). There's a reason why I keep calling this the best Pixel deal of the year. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e521f192-353c-4739-8bc1-0a8122fa2858" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want great wireless coverage and great phone support without the hassle or complicated contracts of a Big Three carrier; you&apos;re Ryan Reynolds.</p><p><strong>❌Skip Mint Mobile if: </strong>you don&apos;t like the idea of buying phone service in bulk; you&apos;re happy with your current wireless plan.</p><p>To put it bluntly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a> works by selling T-Mobile-powered data to users in bulk. The plans are simply named after how much data you&apos;ll receive: 5GB, 15GB, 20GB, or Unlimited, and you pay for your service in 3, 6, 12-month increments of time. Once your data allotment runs out for the month, Mint doesn&apos;t cut you off, your speeds just slow down. </p><p>Still, if you&apos;re a particularly heavy data user, Mint Mobile may not be the right carrier for you. After all, even the Unlimited plan slows after 40GB. For other folks, Mint&apos;s buy-in-bulk system may not be as convenient as the modular plan systems offered by other MVNOs. But if you simply want an affordable T-Mobile-powered wireless service that doesn&apos;t skimp on premium features, Mint Mobile&apos;s Cyber Monday sale is ready to hook you up with long-term coverage for dirt cheap.  </p>

<ul><li>A report supposedly details the changes/improvements consumers could've expected from the Pixel Tablet 2.</li><li>The device might've debuted with an LCD with 120Hz refresh rate, 550nits brightness, and 4K resolution DisplayPort support.</li><li>Several changes to its cameras might've met users out of the box, as well as the Tensor G4.</li><li>The Pixel Table 2 was reportedly canceled by Google, which paints a rather uncertain future for the company's large display device.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The uncertain future of Google's Pixel Tablet continues as a report purports what could've been for its second model.</p><p>The latest Pixel Tablet 2 report stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-canceled-pixel-tablet-2-3504100/">Android Authority</a>, which claims the device had several "small improvements" in the pipeline. Supposedly, the Pixel Tablet 2 was eyeing an LCD with a 120Hz maximum refresh rate. In citing a Google source, the publication adds the tablet could've seen its peak brightness rise from 500nits to 550nits.</p><p>Speaking of displays, the report adds Google was "planning" to upgrade the Pixel Tablet 2's DisplayPort output to support 4K resolution.</p><p>The selection of cameras was also supposedly in line for upgrades, such as a purported swap from Sony to Samsung for the primary lens. It seems Google would've dropped the old 8MP main camera for a Samsung S5K3J1 11MP sensor. The camera would've given the Pixel Tablet 2 the ability to support autofocus while its selfie camera jumped to 10MP (Samsung) from 8MP.</p><p>Other highlighted improvements include a new 5G modem, which is reportedly the same one inside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">the Pixel 9 series</a>. However, the publication states this only would've brought GPS capabilities to the 5G variant, not the Wi-Fi.</p><p>We've heard this before, but the Pixel Tablet 2 would've sported the Pixel 9's Tensor G4 chip — just a little differently. The report states the tablet would've seen the chip implemented using the IPoP method, instead of FOPLP. The major difference is that the former is usually "thicker and larger," meaning it would generate and retain heat more than the latter. It <em>could </em>impact performance, which is something we've heard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9a-modem-tensor-g4-rumored-changes">rumored for the Pixel 9a</a>, too.</p>

<p>Of course, this report comes a couple of weeks after Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-future-pixel-tablet-cancellation-rumors">reportedly canceled the development</a> of the Pixel Tablet 2 for 2025. The company supposedly kicked a device with the codename "Kiyomi," which Mishaal Rahman states refers to the Pixel Tablet 2, not the third-generation model. Rahman's initial report echoes several aspects that we're hearing today, such as Wi-Fi and 5G support and the use of the Tensor G4 chip.</p><p>What's more, Google was supposedly in the early stages of the Pixel Tablet 2's development with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-2-accessory-prototype-rumors">some key accessories</a>: a keyboard and stylus. So, it's strange to see how things have quickly regressed in terms of this second-generation tablet.</p><p>Aside from these alleged "small improvements," the overall design of the device was rumored to have remained the same as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">the original</a>.</p><p>It's not entirely clear where Google is going with its Android tablet series. Curiously, rumors state the Pixel Tablet 3 <em>isn't </em>canceled, which paints a rather strange picture moving forward. That device is expected in 2027.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A recent round of rumors claim Qualcomm's "Snapdragon 8s Elite" will feature a power that sits between two past-gen SoCs.</li><li>The chip is rumored to see a power that's greater than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, but weaker than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</li><li>Rumors claim the chip could see a Q1 2025 debut alongside another midrange-focused SoC.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With Qualcomm's flagship chip appearing in the wild, rumors are appearing about its flagship spinoff.</p><p>As rumors spring from various avenues, known X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1863520728752009380">Yogesh Brar</a> states the (assumed) Snapdragon 8s Elite could see a notable swap in cores (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/snapdragon-8s-elite-gen-4-leak-3504625/">Android Authority</a>). According to Brar, Qualcomm could switch out its powerful Oryon CPU cores in favor of several ARM-based cores. There's very little information floating about concerning the exact power-level of this chip.</p><p>The publication spotted Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/P2YTeAcV6">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) posting their two cents, stating the chip is "stronger than the SD 8 Gen 2 and weaker than the SD 8 Gen 3."</p><p>On the other hand, Brar says the next toned-down flagship variant will be joined by a "Snapdragon 7 Plus" SoC. Speculation for a supposed launch isn't consistent as Brar claims March 2025 while DCS purports April 2025. So, we're either looking at the very end of Q1 2025 or the beginning of Q2. Although, a leak spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/snapdragon-8s-elite-could-launch-by-march-next-year-tipster/">SmartPrix</a> from Smart Pikachu on Weibo suggests Q1 2025, so we'll have to wait and see where things fall.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Next gen SoCsSM8735 Snapdragon 8s \ SM7775 7+March 2025 releaseLikely based on ARM, instead of Nuvia (Oryon) cores<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1863520728752009380">December 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>It's a little strange to hear rumors suggest the "Snapdragon 8s Elite" will sit between the SD 8 Gen 2 and the SD 8 Gen 3. Qualcomm detailed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a> in March, but that device <em>already </em>sits between the previously mentioned chips. The chip clocks in slightly slower than its flagship version with a single high-performance core at 3GHz. Moreover, the OEM pushed the SoC's capabilities in on-device AI with Quad HD Plus display and 144Hz refresh rate support.</p><p>What's more, DCS states Qualcomm's next flagship variant chip could be preparing to debut in phones rocking a massive ~7,000mAh battery. That statement <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/2025-might-bring-the-first-android-phone-with-an-8-000mah-battery">brings us to another rumor </a>that claims such devices are in the works. Realme is supposedly testing a phone with several batteries ranging from 7,000mAh to 8,000mAh.</p><p>The company is also rumored to launch the phone in 2025.</p><p>What a "Snapdragon 8s Elite" could look like is still anyone's guess; however, it'll likely fall under the flagship that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">offers a dramatic power boost</a> for phones. Qualcomm states its new Oryon CPU cores deliver a 45% single- and multi-core performance boost alongside a "44% efficiency boost" when compared to its predecessor. More specifically, the SoC features two 4.32GHz prime cores.</p><p>Unfortunately, with rumors claiming a swap from the Oryon cores, perhaps the boost will be minimal. But, as always, we'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a large and capable Samsung tablet with a Qualcomm processor; you don't have a Galaxy Tab S9 or S10 series tablet; you aren't considering an iPad.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a compact tablet; you'd rather buy the M4 iPad Pro at $850 for Cyber Monday; you'd rather buy the newer Galaxy Tab S10 Plus at $850 for Cyber Monday.</p>
<p>So, don't make a mistake this Cyber Monday. Samsung is marketing the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus as an "AI tablet" with plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">great Galaxy AI features</a>, and that's true. However, you get many of the same Galaxy AI features on the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus, too. That's the story of these two tablets. There may be small tweaks here and there between models, but you'll get the same experience regardless of which one you choose. If that's the case, why spend more?</p><p>The biggest reason to go with the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus over the newer Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is the processor situation. The brand-new tablet packs the Mediatek Dimensity 9300+, and in benchmarks, it hangs with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor in the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus. Usually, we expect a new tablet to <em>at least</em> offer a spec bump and slight performance jump over its predecessor, and that's part of what makes the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus so odd.</p><p>If you're in the market for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">great Android tablet</a> on Cyber Monday, I'd recommend either the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9</a> or Galaxy Tab S9 Plus. Remember, Samsung didn't launch a Galaxy Tab S10 this year, so the Galaxy Tab S9 is still the newest normal-sized tablet in its lineup. The only reason you might want to jump for the newer model is if you need seven years of OS upgrades, which only the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus provides.</p><p>Whichever model you prefer, you can find deals for the Galaxy Tab S9, Galaxy Tab S9 Plus, and Galaxy Tab S10 Plus below. Act fast, because Cyber Monday is quickly coming an end.</p>
