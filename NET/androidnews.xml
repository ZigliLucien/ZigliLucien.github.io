<p>The Meta Quest 3S is here as a low-priced alternative to the Quest 3. If you compare the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 closely, you&apos;ll note a ton of similarities. Although it looks like a Quest 2 with new cameras, it shares more in common with the newer headset, from performance to accessories.</p><p>If you&apos;re a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest 2</a> owner, you might have been put off by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a>&apos;s higher price and held off on upgrading. Now, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Quest 3S</a> has the same price and many of the same upgrades; however, Meta has also discounted the Quest 3 512GB from $649 to $499 — the original price for the 128GB Quest 3 — and now&apos;s a good time to choose the mainline headset, too.</p><p>Based on our year testing out the Quest 3 and our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Quest 3S hands-on demo</a> at Connect, we&apos;ll break down every main similarity and difference between the Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3!</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37" name="Meta-Quest-3S-vs-Meta-Quest-3-front-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Meta Quest 3 to the Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Meta Quest 3 (left) and Quest 3S (right) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S is essentially a hybrid between the Quest 2 visuals and Quest 3 hardware. Before breaking down the specific downgrades, we&apos;ll explain every way that the Quest 3S will modernize things for Quest 2 users.</p><p><strong>New CPU & extra RAM:</strong> Both the Quest 3 and 3S share the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip and 8GB of RAM. Meta says this combination delivers twice-as-fast GPU performance for faster loading times. </p><p>Even though the Quest 2 and 3 share most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">same games</a>, the Quest 3 version will often have an exclusive patch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/which-quest-2-games-have-quest-3-enhancements">graphical enhancements</a> like higher refresh rates, reduced fog, better lighting and shadows, more enemies or environmental objects on screen at once, better colors, and improved textures. </p><p><strong>Quest 3 exclusives:</strong> Most developers try to target both the Quest 2 and Quest 3, but some upcoming AAA games will be Quest 3 exclusives because they&apos;re too graphically demanding for the Quest 2&apos;s headset.</p><p>So far, we know of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-hands-on">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a>, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and the recently-released Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded. Aside from those, many other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Quest games</a> are Quest 3-exclusive because they need full-color passthrough with high mixed-reality resolution to work well. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QHNC96jpPMEUCSG9zpoaC8" name="Meta-Quest-3S-vs-Meta-Quest-3-side-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Meta Quest 3 to the Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QHNC96jpPMEUCSG9zpoaC8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Full-color passthrough: </strong>Despite the different camera configuration, the Meta Quest 3S has the same 4MP RGB camera with 18 pixels per degree (PPD) passthrough resolution, letting you see your living room in full color, if not at quite the same resolution as full virtual reality.</p><p>Mixed-reality games were gimmicky and unpolished when the Quest 3 first launched, but these games have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/mixed-reality-games-getting-good">improved significantly in 2024</a>; on the hardware end, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/an-update-just-fixed-the-biggest-quest-3-mixed-reality-problem">fixed mixed-reality warping</a> and made MR apps <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-news-recap-july-26-2024">use 80% less GPU processing</a> in software updates over the summer. With the Quest 3S, you&apos;re getting a better MR experience right from the start.</p><p><strong>Controllers: </strong>The Meta Quest 3S uses Touch Plus controllers, the same controller generation as the Quest 3. These controllers remove the bulky tracking ring, relying on LEDs around the controller body for inside-out tracking. They also add improved haptics.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AYo2LSz9WiCQozNoVZBuPF" name="Meta-Quest-3S-hands-on-wearing-06.jpg" alt="Wearing the Meta Quest 3S at a hands-on event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AYo2LSz9WiCQozNoVZBuPF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Weight: </strong>Even though the Meta Quest 3S is thicker than the Quest 3, it weighs 1g less (514 vs. 515g), making the fit experience pretty darn comparable. </p><p><strong>Accessories:</strong> We were surprised to learn that most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Quest 3 accessories</a> should carry over to the Quest 3S. According to Meta, its first-party carrying case, Elite Strap, Elite Strap with Battery, Touch Plus Active Straps, Compact Charging Dock, and Link cable will work with the Quest 3S, too. We assume that our favorite third-party Elite Straps will work as well; we&apos;ll test this as soon as we have our Quest 3S review unit.</p>
<h2 id="meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3-design-and-lens-changes-2">Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3: Design and lens changes</h2>
<p>The obvious aesthetic difference with the front cameras aside, both the Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3 look very similar to one another, with the white plastic frame, sensors along the edge, and Meta label in front. </p><p>One small design difference is that Meta removed the Quest 3&apos;s 3.5mm headphone jack from the left arm and moved its right-side USB-C charging port to the left. That gives you fewer headphone options than before; your best bet is wireless earbuds with a USB-C dongle that allows for charging passthrough, so you can still use a battery pack.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bMNrBuaRgJYvq2VwgMBXV7" name="Meta-Quest-3S-vs-Meta-Quest-3-lenses-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Meta Quest 3 to the Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bMNrBuaRgJYvq2VwgMBXV7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Quest 3 (left) and Quest 3S (right) lenses </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 was the first to use pancake lenses, with a flattened, reflective design that takes up less horizontal space but also requires more brightness. Most other VR headsets use thicker Fresnel lenses that make them front-heavy and have a noticeable "sweet spot" at the center. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3 reviewer</a> specifically praised the pancake lenses for eliminating that sweet spot for better visual clarity.</p><p>One of the Quest 3S&apos; cost cutbacks is using a Fresnel lens. Meta managed to make the Quest 3S 19.3mm thinner than the Quest 2, but it&apos;s still 11.6mm <em>thicker</em> than the Quest 3, shifting the weight forward. Just as many people upgraded the Quest 2 with an Elite Strap for better support and security during fast-paced VR games, you&apos;ll probably want the same for the Quest 3S.</p>
<h2 id="meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3-display-and-ipd-2">Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3: Display and IPD</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4rem2vuhUaTRgFPekLjg9g" name="Meta-Quest-3S-hands-on-breathable-facial-interface-03.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the new breathable facial interface for the Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rem2vuhUaTRgFPekLjg9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Quest 3S with its Breathable Facial Interface, which won't fit the Quest 3 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, the Quest 3 and Quest 3S both use LCDs, but the Quest 3 (2,064 x 2,208) gives you 30% higher resolution than the Quest 3S (1,832 x 1,920, or the same as the Quest 2 display). That, combined with the Fresnel sweet spot, will make the visual experience familiar to Quest 2 owners and detract a bit from the next-gen graphics.</p><p>Also, the Meta Quest 3S shares the Quest 2&apos;s shorter and narrower field of view (FoV) compared to the Quest 3. </p><p>Unfortunately, the Meta Quest 3S brought back the Quest 2&apos;s interpupillary distance (IPD) system to save money. You can slide the lenses to three preset distances — 58mm, 63mm, or 68mm — instead of the IPD wheel and 1mm gaps from 53mm to 75mm you get on the Quest 3. </p><p>During our hands-on, we found you could slide the Quest 3S lenses in-between those three IPD presets (about 60mm or 65mm), in case your personal IPD doesn&apos;t match one of those three presets; it&apos;s just trickier and less exact than on the Quest 3.</p><p>Because the Quest 3S made these lens and design changes, Quest 3 facial interfaces won&apos;t work with the Quest 3S; Meta will sell a unique "Quest 3S Breathable Facial Interface" if you want a comfort upgrade for VR workouts. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1545px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="snZ3fLKwjauXok7d3vfEuX" name="meta-quest-3s-press-photo-10.jpeg" alt="The Meta Quest 3S sitting on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/snZ3fLKwjauXok7d3vfEuX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1545" height="869" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta started out selling the Quest 3 in 128GB and 512GB versions, but it&apos;s phasing out the 128GB model and making 512GB the default. The Quest 3S will ship in 128GB and 256GB sizes, matching the Quest 2 before it went out of stock. Most casual VR gamers will happily make do with 128GB of space; your average VR game takes up 5GB or less, though some of the major titles are 10GB or more.</p><p>Both headsets use camera sensors to track your controllers or hands and map your surroundings so you don&apos;t hurt yourself, as well as a 4MP RGB camera for full-color passthrough. The only camera difference is that Meta gave the Quest 3 a physical depth sensor to determine how close or far away things are, while the Quest 3S uses software to detect it (as the Quest 2 did).</p><p>Both the Quest 3 and 3S burn through battery quickly because of the Snapdragon XR2 and 8GB of RAM. But even though the Quest 3S (4,324mAh capacity) has a smaller battery than the Quest 3 (5,060 mAh), Meta estimates that the Quest 3S lasts about 18 minutes longer per charge (2.5 hours versus 2.2 hours). </p><p>We assume that the Quest 3&apos;s higher resolution and brighter pancake lenses require more power, making the Quest 3S more efficient. We&apos;ve asked Meta for confirmation on this.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1688px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="oBQpBiP2rphESrJYzgJEEa" name="meta-quest-3s-press-photo-12.jpeg" alt="A man puts on a Meta Quest 3S VR headset." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oBQpBiP2rphESrJYzgJEEa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1688" height="950" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you own the Quest 2 and want a new VR headset, then you&apos;re probably already happy with the level of immersion the Quest 3S will offer with the same resolution and lens. The Quest 3 resolution and storage boost would certainly be nice to have, but maybe not nice enough to justify spending another $200.</p><p>Because it has the same CPU and memory, the Quest 3S will handle all the same VR and MR games equally well, receive support for the same amount of time, and do slightly better for battery life. It may feel more front-heavy, but an Elite Strap will fix that; frankly, we think the Quest 3 needs an Elite Strap for long-term comfort too, so you&apos;ll have to spend the extra money either way.</p><p>Even though we&apos;ll still rank the Meta Quest 3 as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headset</a> today, the Quest 3S will be good enough for everyone who skipped the pricier headset.</p>

But while the improved lenses, processing power, sleeker form factor, and mixed reality capabilities have been amazing, the $500 price was difficult for many people to stomach.</p><p>Queue the Meta Quest 3s, a new headset from Meta that&apos;s designed to deliver the next-generation graphics at a reduced price tag. It&apos;s an impressive $200 less than the regular Quest 3, putting it in real reach of people this Holiday season.</p><p>In a way, Meta&apos;s new strategy is similar to Microsoft&apos;s with the Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X by offering a $300 and $500 entry for gamers. Thankfully, it fixes the one big problem with Microsoft&apos;s strategy: both headsets have the same processor, helping to ensure that *all* games built for the Quest 3 work on the Quest 3s without developers having to visually downgrade things for the cheaper system, unlike the conundrum developers have to go through with the underpowered Xbox Series S.</p><p>I got hands-on time with the new Quest 3s just before Meta Connect 2024 in California, and I came away impressed with what Meta has been able to offer while keeping the price at a surprisingly affordable level.</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S retails for $299 for the model with 128GB of storage. The $399 Meta Quest 3S upgrades the storage amount to 256GB but includes all the same hardware, so you&apos;re just paying more for extra storage.</p><p>Meta also runs a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/quest/play-now-pay-later/">play now, pay later</a>" program that&apos;ll get you the Meta Quest 3 family headset, 24-month subscription to Meta Quest Plus, and Meta warranty plus coverage</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3s features a new hardware design that looks somewhere between an Oculus Go and the Oculus Quest 2. It&apos;s 20% smaller than a Quest 2—73.9mm vs 93.1mm—but bigger than the Quest 3&apos;s more svelte 62.3mm profile. The main reason is because Quest 3S uses the same Fresnel lenses from the Quest 2. Those lenses are larger and require more space than the pancake lenses in the Quest 3.</p><p>In fact, the display inside Quest 3S is identical to the Quest 2, packin in dual 1832 x 1920 resolution panels. Comparatively, the Quest 3 sports dual 2064 x 2208 resolution panels, so while Quest 3 is higher resolution, it&apos;s not orders of magnitude higher.</p>

<p>But while the headset looks different on the outside, wearing it felt identical to the Quest 2 from my recollection. The lenses and display are identical—including that annoyingly small "sweet spot" to get the clearest view—and adjusting lens spacing is done the same way by physically pushing them closer or further apart.</p><p>The lenses have three total preset distances you can switch between but, unlike the Quest 2, there&apos;s no physical numerical indicator on the headset to show which one is currently selected. Thankfully, the UI in the headset shows the number if you put it on fast enough. Since adjusting the IPD is the same as Quest 2, you can use the "halfway trick" I described in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-adjust-eye-distance-ipd-oculus-quest-2">Quest 2 IPD adjustment guide</a>.</p>

<p>The six cameras on the front include two RGB cameras for stereoscopic color passthrough, two 4MP VGA sensors for space tracking and hand tracking—an identical resolution to Quest 3&apos;s cameras—and two flood LEDs to help with improved hand tracking and better tracking in dark environments. Two additional VGA sensors for spatial tracking are included on the left and right sides of the headset.</p><p>The Quest 3s still ships with a cloth headstrap, something that&apos;s become common on Quest headsets since the Quest 2. I still prefer the original Oculus Quest&apos;s firmer headstrap as the default option but at least headstraps are easily hot-swappable with great alternatives. Thankfully, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Quest 3 accessories</a> should mostly all work with the Quest 3S. That includes headstraps, but facial interfaces are different from Quest 2 and Quest 3. We&apos;ll put it through further tests once we have a final unit.</p><p>At 514g, it&apos;s 1g lighter than Quest 3 and 11g heavier than Quest 2. Most of the weight difference comes from the battery, as Quest 3S has a 20% larger battery than the Quest 2 and Meta states this helps it last up to an hour longer on a single charge than Quest 2.</p><p>To me, the fit felt identical to Quest 2, although I haven&apos;t used that headset with a cloth strap in years. I&apos;ve always got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oculus-quest-2-head-strap-elite-strap-alternatives">Quest 2 headstrap alternative</a> on my unit at home.</p>

<p>Something to note is that Meta removed the 3.5mm headphone jack on the Quest 3s, meaning you&apos;ll need to pick up a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Low-Latency-Connection-Compatible-Playstation/dp/B0CDH3SMDW/">Vega T1 earbuds</a> if you want to enjoy more private audio. Of course, the speakers built in to the headstrap arms still deliver great audio quality with plenty of volume, so there&apos;s no need to pick up a pair right away if you want to save money.</p><p>Most of the time I don&apos;t even bother with headphones or earbuds on my Quest 3 and I can&apos;t see that changing here. If you do want to change the volume, it&apos;s done with the volume rocker buttons on the underside of the headset which are located in front of a new action button.</p><p>This round action button acts as an easy way to quickly switch between immersive and mixed reality modes, replacing the haphazard double-tap gesture on previous Meta Quest headsets. This is an immensely better design than that old gesture as it works every time you press it, unlike the unreliable gesture of old.</p>

<p>One of the best upgrades when moving from Quest 2 to Quest 3 was the color passthrough vision. Thankfully, the Meta Quest 3s also features color passthrough vision, meaning when you put your headset on, you see the room around you in full color just as your eyes do.</p><p>This makes it easy to put the headset on and walk around your house, take a drink, or even talk to someone without having to remove it. In general, it reduces friction and makes it feel less like you&apos;re wearing a headset and more like you just stepped into a virtual world.</p><p>Visual quality of the mixed reality looked identical to a Quest 3 I had side-by-side at the event. The room was in color, resolution was high enough so that I had no problem seeing what I was doing or talking to the people in the room while wearing the headset.</p><p>The biggest difference is the lenses, which aren&apos;t as clear as the Quest 3&apos;s pancake lenses and have a very small sweet spot. If you&apos;ve used a Quest 2, you&apos;ll be familiar with this.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iuQMC9PZNvAXowaEwqrjYe" name="starship-home-gameplay.gif" alt="Mixed reality gameplay of Starship Home as played on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iuQMC9PZNvAXowaEwqrjYe.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="320" height="180" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creature)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Quest 3s supports all mixed reality games from the Quest 3, so excellent titles like Starship Home — which turns your room into a spaceship in a 5-6 hour long intergalactic adventure — are fully playable here. That also means existing games that make use of mixed reality to enhance safety and immersion can be fully enjoyed on Quest 3s as they can on Quest 3.</p><p>Booting up Racket Club will let you place the court right in your room, making you feel good about giving it your all when you swing without worrying about hitting something since you can still *see* the room around you. Other games like Smash Drums take advantage of the same concept, putting the drum set in your room and letting you go ham while playing popular songs — again, all without having to worry about smacking the dog or your kid with a controller when you&apos;re in the middle of a jam session.</p>

<p>Meta representatives also showed me a new Breathable Facial Interface that helps enhance mixed reality content by helping you see the room around you in your peripheral vision. A breathable mesh is sandwiched between the padded silicone face pad and the headset connection points, which both enhance ventilation and let you see the room around you in a subtle way.</p><p>It&apos;s an interesting alternative to the open periphery Quest 3 facial interface I also got to see at Meta Connect 2024 as it solves problems without being as jarring as a fully open periphery may be for some folks.</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S ships with the same excellent Meta Touch controllers that debuted with the Meta Quest 3. This means you not only get the same great ergonomic improvements over the Quest 2&apos;s controllers, but they also remove the annoying ring around the controller and include much better haptics.</p><p>Each controller is powered by a single AA battery. I personally use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Rechargeable-Batteries-8-Pack-Pre-charged/dp/B00CWNMV4G/">these cost-efficient rechargeable AA batteries</a> from Amazon in my Quest controllers and have been happy with their multi-week battery life.</p><p>The battery door on each controller connects via an ingenious little button that makes it easy to swap out for any number of controller accessories. These <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Compatible-Quest-Accessories-Adjustable-3/dp/B0CJRK7B8J/">AMVR controller grips</a> have long been my go-to controller accessory for everyday use.</p>

<p>Everything you can do on a Meta Quest 3 can be done on a Meta Quest 3S. No exceptions.</p><p>Like the rest of the Quest lineup, the Meta Quest 3S runs Meta&apos;s Horizon OS, an operating system built on Android without all the Google services and apps. Meta recently minted the new name <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">back in April</a> when it announced it would be offering the OS to other manufacturers to make their own VR headsets, including companies like Lenovo, ASUS ROG, and Microsoft Xbox.</p><p>Meta has updated its OS monthly since the first Oculus Quest debuted, adding new features and services with each release. Just last month, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-quest-1-end-of-new-app-support">finally pulled support</a> for the aging Oculus Quest after over five years of updates. Meta will no longer be selling the Quest 2 at the end of this year but previously comitted to three additional years of updates before it pulls the plug on that headset.</p><p>That means you can likely expect the Quest 3S to be supported with updates until 2030 or so if things stay the same.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Meta has done something truly impressive with the Quest 3S, shipping Quest 3 power in a headset that&apos;s hundreds less. It plays the same games as the more expensive Quest 3, has the same quality color mixed reality vision, and even uses the same controllers with advanced haptic feedback.</p><p>The worst part remains the lenses with their small sweet spot and hazy peripheral view. But if you can get past this, you can save $200 and still get all the same great experiences which, alone, is a mighty feat that&apos;s nearly impossible to achieve in any technology category.</p>

<hr>
<p>Say hello to Meta&apos;s new entry-level mixed-reality headset designed for those getting into the gaming/entertainment space.</p><p>During Meta&apos;s keynote, the company debuted a headset called the Quest 3S, packing the same power as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a>. The entry-level headset features Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor and full-color Passthrough capabilities.</p><p>To fit in with the Quest 3 family, the Quest 3S doesn&apos;t shift its design much. The headset is similar in size to the Quest 3; however, the sensors in the front are arranged like a honeycomb. The Quest 3S also features a slightly narrow field of view compared to the flagship Quest 3.</p><p>Meta states its "soft, durable" Y-strap was created to fit seamlessly onto your face while considering your hair for comfort.</p><p>Hand-tracking with the Quest 3S takes advantage of Meta&apos;s "Advanced Hybrid Computer Vision." Machine learning also plays a heavy role in helping the headset track your hand&apos;s movements with fluidity. Meta states that "Direct Touch" lets you swipe through your content library and tap on digital objects like icons.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1398px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="apmYBQwc8LT9nyQEszdVVY" name="meta-quest-3s-press-photo-3.jpeg" alt="The Meta Quest 3S and Touch controllers sitting on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/apmYBQwc8LT9nyQEszdVVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1398" height="786" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the Touch Plus Controllers with haptic feedback offer a ring-free design for the Quest 3S. Meta states the controllers should aid in producing a more natural experience when moving your hands in the virtual space. The TruTouch haptics was upgraded to deliver even more sensations when touching, moving, and reacting.</p><p>Aside from gaming, the Meta Quest 3S will bring users multi-screen browsing, fitness/wellness personal training, productivity tools, and more.</p><p>Users can even put their Quest 3S into "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-travel-mode-launch">travel mode</a>" for in-flight entertainment. This feature originally arrived for the Quest 2 and Quest 3 in May, but now the entry-level device can use it, letting users watch movies and shows on a "giant" screen right before their eyes. After connecting to Wi-Fi, Meta states the Quest 3S can detect if users are on a plane and launch Travel mode.</p><p>After that, you can enjoy a personal viewing experience in a private, digital movie theater.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8Pje47FGeQLfrUzR2ohrHf" name="meta-quest-3s-press-photo-2.jpeg" alt="A close-up of a man sitting on a couch wearing the Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Pje47FGeQLfrUzR2ohrHf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What&apos;s more, Meta has revamped Horizon OS to support "essential" 2D apps like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. The software also picked up upgraded spatial audio for the various panels in your mixed-reality space.</p><p>Other specifications include a 20% reduction in thickness compared to the older Quest 2 and a 4,324mAh battery. Meta estimates consumers can grab 2.5 hours of "average" use with the Quest 3S. The headset features 8GB of RAM for an estimated 33% boost in system performance.</p><p>There are two versions of the Quest 3S available for pre-order today (Sept 25): a 128GB and a 256GB storage variant. The former can be purchased for $299, while the latter runs for $399. However, there&apos;s a little incentive for those interested in the Quest 3S, and that&apos;s the Quest 3 and Quest 3S-exclusive game Batman: Arkham Shadow.</p><p>Users purchasing either of the Quest 3S variants or the 512GB version of the Quest 3 can get in on a free copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow. The Meta Quest 3S will hit the market on October 15, ahead of the game&apos;s October 22 launch. Those purchasing the Quest 3S today (and until April 30, 2025, at 5 p.m. PT) are eligible for a free copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow.</p>

The phone also has 7.5W wireless charging.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="how-much-charging-speed-can-you-get-on-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-2">How much charging speed can you get on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold?</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold&apos;s charging speed is the slowest of the entire Pixel 9 lineup. The Pixel 9 Pro XL has a wired charging speed of 37W and a wireless charging speed of 12W with the right Qi wireless charger. Similarly, the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro also have a wired charging speed of 27W and a wireless charging speed of 12W with the right Qi wireless charger.</p><p>Unfortunately, the entire Pixel 9 series doesn&apos;t have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-google-pixel-9-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Qi2 chargin</a>g, the latest charging technology that gives compatible devices magnetism and a wireless charging speed of up to 15W. Even if you get a Qi2 compatible charger, you won&apos;t get the desired charging speeds since the Pixel 9 Pro Fold doesn&apos;t support the charging technology.</p><p>Another charging disappointment is that the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is incompatible with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-stand-2nd-gen-charger-review">Google Pixel Stand (2nd Gen)</a> since the charging coils do not align correctly as they would on a traditional Pixel. Google encourages users to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/googles-new-45w-usb-c-charger-for-the-pixel-9-series-in-europe-surfaces">in-house 45W fast charger</a>, but Google does not put one in the box when you buy the Pixel.</p><p>Additionally, you can only use a USB-C cable with your Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold. A USB-C cable will give you the best charging speed, as USB-C provides faster charging speeds than the older USB standards. Your Pixel phone will charge faster when using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cable</a>, allowing you to get a full charge in less time. Another advantage of using USB-C is removing the risk of damaging the port or the cable since they are more durable.</p><p>USB-C cables have faster data transfer speeds and let you connect various types of devices using adapters or cables. Another benefit of using a USB-C cable is its reversible design, eliminating the frustration of plugging it incorrectly.</p><p>Besides the Pixel 9 phone lineup, Google also announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a>, which comes in a bigger 45mm model. It isn&apos;t very reassuring to see that an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> starting at $1,799 doesn&apos;t have a great wired charging speed, but maybe next year&apos;s model will have a faster charging speed. The slow charging speed may not be a problem if you regularly access a power source or vigilantly monitor your phone&apos;s battery levels.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ 
<p>With the launch of Google&apos;s new Find My Device network, all the best brands rushed to release updated versions of their item trackers. The Pebblebee Clip for Android was Pebblebee&apos;s answer to the revamped Find My Device network.</p><p>You can grab <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">Pebblebee&apos;s Bluetooth trackers that work with the Google Find My Device network</a> in various shapes and sizes. There&apos;s card-shaped ones for your wallet and even a slim little oblong one that goes into a pet collar or sticks to remotes.</p><p>The Pebblebee Clip for Android is my favorite form factor for various reasons. This Bluetooth tracker comes with a metal keyring out of the box. It&apos;s one of those upscale keyrings that have a foldable clasp, not just a regular old spiral-shaped keyring. This makes it super easy to attach it to anything out of the box, no accessories or add-ons required.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3531px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="V5FH6M5hinMGoe6h9tFuMK" name="Pebblebee-Clip-google-find-my-device-tracker-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Pebblebee Clip for Android compatible with the Google Find My Device network, attached to a car key." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V5FH6M5hinMGoe6h9tFuMK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3531" height="1986" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pebblebee Clip has a big button like any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">other Bluetooth tracker</a>. Pressing it helps you find your phone. Unlike most trackers, however, it also sports a USB Type-C port for charging and LED lights on the side to indicate charging. Replaceable batteries are great, but I find USB-C charging to be even more eco-friendly as there&apos;s less electronic waste being produced in the form of disposable batteries.</p><p>The Pebblebee Clip for Android is really small and just nice to attach to common household items such as keys, bags, and pet collars. It&apos;s also really lightweight, has a Bluetooth range of 500ft or 152m, and has a robust IPX6 waterproof rating. Unfortunately, there&apos;s no dust resistance on this tracker.</p>

<p>Pebblebee makes a separate iOS version of the Clip, so the Pebblebee Clip for Android does not work with iOS devices. You still get notified about unknown Pebblebee Clip for Android units on your iPhone though, as I discovered during my testing.</p><p>Setting up the Pebblebee Clip is a breeze. You get to choose between setting it up on the Pebblebee app or the Google Find My Device app, which was am annoying limitation. If you choose the Pebblebee app, you can only use the Pebblebee network to track and locate the Pebblebee Clip.</p><p>Tracking aside, features like the melody of the ringer and the ability to find your phone with the Pebblebee Clip are only available through the Pebblebee app. You forgo these options if you set up the tracker on the Google Find My Device app.</p>

<p>Compared to trackers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/motorola-moto-tag-hands-on-review">Moto Tag</a>, it&apos;s much easier to use the Pebblebee Clip out of the box. It is also far simpler to unpair, reset, and repair with other devices. This is because of the button, which presses exactly when you want to and never when you don&apos;t.</p><p>For the low price of $29.99, anyone can get the Pebblebee Clip for their tracking needs. It rings really loud, with high enough volume levels that I could hear the ringer from the other side of my apartment.</p><p>The real draw here is USB-C charging. It carries out the same functions as other Bluetooth trackers, but what really stands out is the Type-C port built into it. Pebblebee even includes a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cable</a> for free, adding more value to the product overall. I only wish it worked with both Google Find My Device and the Pebblebee app simultaneously.</p>

<p>Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/galaxy-buds-2-pro-launch">announed</a> on August 10 and go on sale for general purchase September 26. They’re available via Google’s website and other online retailers for $229 in the U.S., €249 in Europe, and £219 in the UK.</p><p>It should be noted that the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are launching for $30 more than the previous generation buds, but with the improvements and new features, we don’t think that’s a terrible thing.</p><p>You can pick them up in four colors: Porcelain, Peony, Hazel, and the color we’re reviewing here, Wintergreen.</p>

<p>I’m calling this an “early review” because I’ve spent a solid amount of time testing audio and call quality. However, including AI and all that it enables requires more time to sit with and experience its many potential practical applications. This is the early stage for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">truly intelligent, conversational AI assistance</a>. With that said, there’s a lot on offer here, so let’s get some background out of the way because it will inform the rest of the review.</p><p>To fully experience the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you&apos;ll need a Pixel phone. For some features, that means a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> or later, and none of the “A” series phones are included.</p><p>Enabling the intelligence is a first for Pixel Buds, thanks to the inclusion of one of Google’s proprietary chipsets, the Tensor A1, which also bolsters the noise canceling and call quality by processing audio 90 times faster than the speed of sound, according to Google. I couldn’t test that, though, as my supersonic fighter jet is in the shop this week. Additionally, the more efficient processing means better battery life despite the buds being smaller than last year. </p><p>Bluetooth 5.4 is along for the ride, with support for Bluetooth LE. Hopefully that means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast</a> is in the Pixel Buds Pro 2’s future. Google also overhauled the acoustic housing and the driver, so this year you get a custom 11mm dynamic speaker in the tiny, tiny buds. </p><p>The USB-C charging case is wireless charging enabled and is rated IPX4 for water and dust resistance, while the buds are rated IP54.</p>

<p>It’s the technical things we briefly touched on that power what I’ve experienced during this review. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are better than the previous-gen Buds Pro in every way. I tested the noise-canceling with 80dB of airplane cabin noise and walked in busy metropolitan areas during rush hour. </p><p>The Buds Pro 2 <em>definitely</em> hush a broader spectrum of sound than before. That’s lows and highs! They don’t cancel quite as much as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">Sony</a> or Bose, which are both $70 more, but the Buds Pro 2 aren’t a slouch in this area either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yK89DwgAi6dLgeD7Ps9VU9" name="google-pixel-buds-pro-2-side-view-in-case.JPG" alt="Google Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yK89DwgAi6dLgeD7Ps9VU9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are welcome refinements that help get to the place where I could test that improved active noise canceling with Google’s Silent Seal 2.0 tech. Removing the buds from the case is easier than ever, thanks to them sitting above the deck of the area they’re seated in. It sounds like a small thing, but I can’t tell you how many earbuds I’ve dropped trying to wiggle and finagle them out of their magnetized housings.</p><p>Walking around the city and testing these for hours has been supremely comfortable, with a locked-in feel. Google put a lot of research into their new twist-to-adjust stabilizer fit, and it shows—er, feels.</p><p>I’ve yet to experience any ear fatigue, and I’ve worn them during my entire eight-hour shift at the day job. Though not continuously streaming music or working all day with ANC activated, they’ve easily lasted that entire eight hours with plenty of battery life left. I’ll need more testing to understand better how hard I can push them before placing them back in their case for a top-up. Five minutes of charging in the case provides 1.5 hours of listening time with ANC off if I need it. That said, there’s a footnote to this experience.</p><p>I’ll need more time testing the battery in real-world use as firmware upgrades may change things. Sitting at my desk for some focused testing today, an hour of ANC use at 50% of max volume kills roughly 20% of the battery in the right earbud and 10% in the left. Google claims up to eight hours of listening time with ANC on, but at that rate, somewhere around 5 hours would kill one earbud, leaving you with 50% left in the other, and that doesn’t quite add up.</p><p>The touch controls are very responsive, and to Google’s credit, they don’t suffer from an issue that many do: false touches. I’ve adjusted them in my ears a few times here and there while listening to music, and not once have I paused or skipped a track accidentally. Those adjustments were while getting used to the fit and feel and finding the right feel for me. Once I had that right, they didn’t budge during a 3.2-mile ruck (a hike or brisk walk with a weighted backpack or plate carrier), even as I got sweatier during my city march.</p><p>Admittedly, I was impressed with the consistency of the press and hold action for switching between the ANC and Transparency modes when my hands were dry and when they were a bit moist from wiping sweat from my brow.</p>

<p>I ran into an interesting phenomenon when putting sound quality to the test. While I’d like to see LDAC or AptX Adaptive support, another hi-res coded, Opus, is supported. When I played tracks and went into developer mode, Opus was an option. But every time I tapped on it, I’d see it switch for a nanosecond, then default back to AAC.<br>
The other interesting item was the sound quality of different apps. Playing .flac files via VLC media player sounds just ok. Tidal is solid sometimes, then just ok at other times. I’ve said it before with other earbuds; many times on Android, YouTube Music has the most volume. I even had to double-check developer settings to be sure that Opus hadn’t finally kicked in and stuck because the muddiest track known to humankind, Method Man’s “Biscuits,” was reproduced with nuances in the track, vocals, and backing vocals that I’d forgotten about. Playback from YouTube Music has an interesting level of range and clarity you don’t quite get with playback from other apps.</p>

<p>I used that app in my testing, and the Pixel Buds Pro 2 don’t disappoint on any level with any genre.</p><p>The bass and sub-bass extension are beautiful when listening to Skrillex’s “Mumbai Power.” The Buds Pro 2’s give you solid rumble and growl, delivering that deep, dark sub-bass. If it’s air and clarity you’re after, then listening to Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” is it! Ladysmith Black Mambazo’s a capella solo, and Paul Simon’s vocals are big and airy, while the drums and guitars all fill their space and frequencies just like they should. Charles Mingus’ Mingus Big Band ‘93 “Nostalgia in Times Square” played back as a vibrant big band jazz romp with beautiful instrumentation, layering, and separation in the stereo image.</p><p>Sylosis’ “Poison for the Lost” is a death metal delight when played through the Pixel Buds Pro 2, as is “Toxicity” from System of a Down. Changing speeds, “Violin Duel” from the Chevalier OST is wonderfully reproduced. You get the string and bow tension in those mids and highs, along with the occasional fingering of the frets. Oh, wait. Violins don’t have frets. You get the point.</p><p>Along with the new acoustic architecture and dynamic driver, the solid choice of listening customizations makes the audio experience special. Using the 5-band EQ, I created a custom preset that honed in on the music the way I like to hear it and elevated the listening experience. And while the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are definitely warm at the bottom, they are still very good about clarity in the mids and high-end frequencies.</p><p>Spatial audio with head tracking is very well implemented, as evidenced when I cued up “An Unexpected Element” from “Blue Eye Samurai.” Taiko drums were boomy, the dialogue was clear and crisp–as were the clangs of the sword sound effects–and the effect of surround imaging was well rendered. To be frank, this was one of the best mobile listening experiences of that episode of Blue Eye Samurai, aside from watching it on an iPhone with Apple earbuds and their spatial audio implementation.</p><p>One final note on the music and entertainment experience: Far too many earbuds have weak output over Bluetooth but the Pixel Buds Pro 2 really don’t need to be turned up much past 50% of max volume to be at a comfortable listening level. If you want to immerse yourself in some audio, there’s plenty of headroom to crank things up a bit and hear as much sonic nuance as these earbuds can convey. It isn’t audiophile grade, but it is one of the best experiences I’ve had this year with a pair of earbuds that weren’t utilizing a Hi-Res Bluetooth codec.</p>

<p>Computer: Who’s the best captain in the Star Trek series, and why is it Benjamin Sisko? Using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a> with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 and Pixel 9 was a revelation. Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa are all cool, but they do not carry on a useful, functional conversation.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live is now a free function</a> that allows you to have free-flowing conversations, which includes the ability to interrupt when you have follow-up questions/queries. On the way to work one morning, I queried Gemini regarding a venue where my wife is going to be holding a pop-up event this week and got very useful background info on it. Another time, a status light that I hadn’t seen before turned on in the dashboard of my car, so I queried that, and Gemini told me all about it, including multiple reasons why it might be on and what to do based on which potential reason the light was activated.</p><p>The standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> query doesn’t involve a running conversation and is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>-like but more intelligent. Both of these implementations of AI can draw from other apps on your device, like Gmail or Google Maps, so there’s plenty of functionality to be had. I’ll need more time to really play with and test this out in different driving or working scenarios, but at this time, early in the life of this technology, it is absolutely amazing. For the most part. I’ll touch on some of the pitfalls in a moment.</p>
<h2 id="pixel-buds-app-2">Pixel Buds app</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kPtJY8twPzy2NYbCbaFSpB" name="google-pixel-buds-pro-2-ecosystem-hero-cu.JPG" alt="Google Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kPtJY8twPzy2NYbCbaFSpB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The last chapter in this audio novella is about the Pixel Buds app. It’s full-featured and gives you many options to tailor your overall experience, from the gesture interactions to the experience with the digital assistants and the sound quality. There are five EQ presets in the Sound menu, with the ability to customize one. You can’t save multiple customized presets, but at least the one you can have is saved to the earbuds themselves, so if you connect to another device that doesn’t use the Pixel Buds app, your sound will still be tailored to your liking.</p><p>Then, there’s the option to turn on Conversation Detection. Using AI, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 will hear when you’re talking and automatically pause your music and switch to Transparency mode if necessary. Then, when you’re done speaking, they’ll go back to ANC (if that was the mode prior to detecting speech) and resume your music. This feature works flawlessly in my testing, with one caveat: rocking out! Yes, when you’re so into your music that you begin singing with it, your music will pause. This happens to me often when I’m out for a more leisurely walk and really get into my music. In the future, I’d love a quick setting or voice command to deactivate this feature on the fly.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="waJQVMQqgnRGQ5iM3TANZP" name="google-pixel-buds-app.JPG" alt="Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/waJQVMQqgnRGQ5iM3TANZP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The app also contains settings for customizing the digital assistant, Spatial Audio, and touch controls. Here, you’ll also find the feature that allows you to use the local “Find device” feature to ring each earbud independently. However, to locate them on a map, you’ll have to go to the separate Find Device app.</p><p>The app also has a Hearing Wellness menu that shows you your current level in dB and whether it’s safe for your hearing. You’ll also see when you’re getting close to your overall exposure limit for the last 24 hours and the last seven days. Then, there’s a toggle to turn on or off volume-level notifications so that you’ll be alerted when you exceed the recommended exposure limit.</p><p>Last note for this section: call quality is solid. My voice is always clear, despite rush hour traffic whizzing by me on the streets, and I don’t sound like I’m in a tunnel, according to callers on the other end. I also used the stock sound recorder app on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, and the microphone audio recorded clearly and without any background traffic noise. The real question is: how often do you use your pocket computer as a phone?</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-buds-pro-2-what-s-not-so-good"><span>Google Pixel Buds Pro 2: What's not so good</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FdnSbvNWPZ6KB2uTG8YLnA" name="google-pixel-buds-pro-2-buds-compared.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FdnSbvNWPZ6KB2uTG8YLnA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Top: Google Pixel Buds Pro

<p>The experience with the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 has been overwhelmingly positive, but there are some areas where improvements can be made. I’m going to work on this Opal hi-res audio implementation, but as I mentioned before, I’d love to have seen LDAC or AptX Lossless support.</p><p>The fit has been very comfortable, but it’s also a bit of an anomaly. The posts the ear tips are connected to must be very small because I have to do something I never do with earbuds: use large ear tips. Normally, I have to use small or extra-small ear tips. I have tiny ear canals, so I wonder if those with larger ear canals will find the fit with the large ear tips too small.</p><p>This is less of an issue with the buds, but Gemini can have that split personality that your favorite person born under the Gemini Zodiac sign has. Yes, you. One evening I queried it about the best turkey burger in a particular city. It gave me amazing information, and I was ready to go. Out of curiosity, I tried the query again and got completely different results. Add to that, because I was using Gemini Live, it required me to then tell Google Assistant the name of the restaurant so that I could get GPS driving directions. You don’t have to perform this step with the standard Gemini query, but with Gemini Live, I found that I did. </p><p>I should also note that as this article is being published, I’m working with Google to sort out an odd issue. The Find Device app consistently shows an old location from a few days ago. It won’t update the location of the buds and I don’t yet know why. Sticking with finding your buds, the ringtone played through the buds themselves, using the “Find device” feature in the Pixel Buds app is pretty low, so if the buds are between some couch cushions, you may not hear them. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-buds-pro-2-competition"><span>Google Pixel Buds Pro 2: Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ANFmNNxZNMoD5U9PpxDn5T" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-bud.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ANFmNNxZNMoD5U9PpxDn5T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">competition in the TWS earbud space</a>, but for now, I’ll focus on those that are part of an ecosystem of products. That means competition comes from Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review">Nothing Ear (2024)</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a>, and, technically, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">Sony WF-1000XM5</a>, though their phones haven’t been huge sellers. </p><p>This is an interesting comparison because the “competition” really depends on which phones and watches you’re fond of as well. On features alone, Samsung and Nothing, with their AI implementations, are direct competitors, but Nothing comes out ahead in price, costing almost $80 less than Google’s offering and $100 less than Samsung’s. Nothing’s Ear has been one of my favorite buds of 2024 for its value, but Google’s Gemini implementation one-ups its ChatGPT integration. In terms of sound quality, they’re all solid, but by degrees, I’d give that win to Nothing and Samsung. The difference isn’t good enough to be a deciding factor, though.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 if…</strong></p>
<ul><li>You own a Pixel 6 or later (not an “A” series device)</li><li>You’re invested in the Google ecosystem</li><li>You want high-quality, lightweight earbuds</li><li>You have a Pixel phone that supports Gemini and Gemini Advanced</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn’t buy the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 if…</strong></p>
<ul><li>You don’t care about the AI integration</li><li>You aren’t in the Google ecosystem</li><li>Your budget is around $150 or less</li></ul>
<p>Google has done it with its Pixel Buds Pro 2 TWS earbuds. They are light, comfortable, and feature-packed, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> is the digital assistant many of us have been waiting for since the first time we watched an episode of Star Trek. Most importantly, though, the sound quality is top-tier for this space. </p><p>Google continues to improve its mobile products and, ultimately, its ecosystem, making this a space to watch as both these buds and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> have been much-welcomed improvements over previous generation devices. </p><p>Thanks to these latest innovations, the competition in the ecosystem space is heating up, with wonderful options at different price points, which is always good for us consumers.</p>

<ul><li>Wear OS 5 is now arriving on the Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 alongside the September 2024 update.</li><li>Google encourages users to update the device as it brings new features, several bug fixes, and the standard security patches.</li><li>Google previewed Wear OS 5 earlier this year, which showed users are in for major health features, watch face updates, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rolling out Tuesday (Sept 24) is a major OS upgrade for Google&apos;s Pixel Watch series that you won&apos;t want to delay.</p><p>Google detailed in a press release that the Pixel Watch and the Pixel Watch 2 are now receiving the Wear OS 5 upgrade. The company adds that it encourages device owners to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/13044412">update their devices</a> as soon as possible as it brings several system improvements. Watches rocking Wear OS 3.5 and 4 are eligible to grab OS 5.</p><p>Those with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> will receive version <strong>AW2A.240903.005.A1</strong>, while those with the original model will get version "<strong>A2.</strong>"</p><p>Joining this Wear OS 5 upgrade is the (late) September 2024 security update for the Pixel Watches. Google states there are "numerous" bug fixes and performance updates for the smartwatches. Additionally, the company noted "new features" with the update, and while it did not specify the new features, it did point out the new grid-view app launcher, upgraded camera controls, and Pixel Recorder functionality.</p><p>Those eager to dive into the specifics regarding the security patches can check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel-watch">Android Security Bulletin</a>.</p><p>The rollout for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> begins today (Sept 24), but Google states it will continue "over the next week." The update will appear in phases, meaning we won&apos;t all see it on our respective devices simultaneously. Google adds that you will receive a notification about the update&apos;s availability.</p>

<p>In May, Google clued us into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces">host of new goodies</a> to consume with Wear OS 5 during its I/O event. Those who love running (and marathons) might enjoy the software&apos;s power efficiency as those longer outings consume 20% less power. Health upgrades are a large part of Wear OS 5 as Google worked to add "debounced goals" and Guided Workouts.</p><p>What&apos;s more, watch faces pick up new "Flavors" and complications so you can tailor your Pixel Watch to your needs and tastes.</p><p>With Wear OS 5 arriving for Google&apos;s previous two watches, hopefully, this is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">sign of more consistency</a>. The company&apos;s past shows that its wearable software often takes a back seat compared to its work for smartphones. Google has also launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, which shows it&apos;s taking its wearable hardware a little more seriously — as many users have hoped.</p>

<p>The Pixel Watch 3 comes in and cleans up whatever you thought could've been better with the second version. Google upgraded this watch with a better battery that should take you a little further beyond 24-hours. More importantly, Wear OS 5 makes a world of difference in terms of UI and health features.</p></p>

At this time, the price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C791819Q" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic has crashed 30% to its lowest price ever at Amazon</strong></a>, marking a savings of $120. The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is our favorite last-gen watch option, and users especially love it for the return of the Classic&apos;s physical rotating bezel.</p><p>This particular deal is for the black Hybrid Leather T-band version of the smartwatch, and for the Bluetooth-equipped configuration. While this deal is pretty impressive for those who are willing to go with that color and spec, a few other options are also on sale if you need something different. </p>

<p>Amazon has cut 30% off the price of our <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-best-last-gen-option">favorite last-generation smartwatch</a>, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. The deal comes ahead of the retailer's two-day Big Deal Days event, and it brings this great device to its lowest price yet. Will the price drop even further when October Prime Day officially arrives? Only time will tell, but I wouldn't chance it. </p>
<p>This Galaxy Watch 6 Classic comes in black with a hybrid leather band, and this deal is for the Bluetooth-only version of the watch. If that's not a problem for you, then $120 off might be worth considering.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C791819Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b7445f52-ea12-4463-8225-f1d71bbb9b66" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for something affordable and don&apos;t mind going with a last-generation option; you like the Classic&apos;s physical rotating bezel; you want a watch with multiple promised upgrades.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;d rather upgrade to a Watch 7, Watch 6 Classic with Bluetooth and LTE, or would prefer other colors and band types; you&apos;re looking for a current-gen watch option or something with dual-band GPS; you want a lightweight smartwatch.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6">Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> and the regular Watch 6 were our former picks for the best Android watch, and they remain our favorite option as far as earlier builds go. For one, we loved the reintroduction of the physical rotating bezel on the Classics, and you can get them at a wide range of price points depending on what specific features you&apos;re looking for.</p><p>The only real downsides of this deal are that, at this price, you&apos;re looking at the Bluetooth-only option, and this specific deal is only for the Hybrid Leather T band option in all black. If you&apos;d rather go with other options, you can still flip around Amazon&apos;s other colors and configurations of the Watch 6 Classic to see what other discounts are available.</p>

<ul><li>Following the Ear (Open) launch, Nothing OS 3.0 was detailed in a highlight video alongside CEO Carl Pei.</li><li>The OS 3.0 update packs a revamp to the UI's typography, a complete lock screen overhaul with customization options, and AI sneaks it.</li><li>Nothing OS 3.0 is set to begin its beta in October with the company expecting to hit "general release" by December.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing&apos;s recent product launch is cool, but the company also detailed what&apos;s next for its major OS release.</p><p>Nothing took viewers through a guided tour of OS 3.0 in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV3Ch2lEr9Q&t=350s&ab_channel=Nothing">YouTube video</a> featuring CEO Carl Pei following the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">Ear (Open)</a>. Initially, the company stated the next software iteration would take its animations up a step to improve the user experience. Users can expect smoother transitions/animations for the lock screen, Quick Settings, and the home screen.</p><p>The lock screen is the next area of improvement for Nothing OS 3.0. The opening display is said to undergo a major rework that lets users "edit things in a very direct way." Long-pressing the lock screen brings up its customization menu. Nothing states that users can edit the clock face, which features pre-existing options like N-Style, N-Dot, and more.</p><p>The widget space includes a new "expand area" option. The on-device description states users can expand this space to "hide the main clock face."</p><p>The Quick Settings menu offers even more customization options. Nothing says users can quickly add or remove icons and expand them if desired. AI enters Nothing OS 3.0 to assist with app discovery alongside "Shared Widgets," which is described as a "portal" between you and a friend&apos;s phone.</p><p>The new Nothing Gallery and how AI will affect it were also detailed in the highlight video. Fear not as Nothing states users can expect the OS 3.0 beta to kick off in October. The company expects to hit "general release" by December.</p>

<p>Nothing OS 3.0 is expected to rock Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> software beneath the bells and whistles. AI is also expected after the company&apos;s CEO Carl Pei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1798369533889302576">teased more of it</a> for its OS earlier this year. Pei posted a video on X (formerly Twitter) in June where he talked about the "hype" surrounding AI and that Nothing OS would adopt more of it.</p><p>Unfortunately, the company&apos;s newfound interest in artificial intelligence comes at the price of the Phone 3. The net flagship device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">will not arrive in 2024</a>, but will instead fall back to 2025 where AI will be at its heart. Pei stated the company will take time to hone its AI so that it arrives in a useful manner.</p><p>The Nothing OS 3.0 highlight video gave us a taste of what&apos;s coming for the major update, but there&apos;s undoubtedly more to unpack.</p><p>Stealing our sights (other than software) is the Nothing Ear (Open). These are the brand&apos;s first open-ear style buds that deliver powerful bass and excellent call quality. The device&apos;s form factor might appeal to those with a more active lifestyle who enjoy running or biking. There&apos;s even a bit of ChatGPT integration if you need AI assistance.</p>
