<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is upgrading ChromeOS with Android tech to unlock more AI features for Chromebooks, but these changes will take some time to appear.</li><li>ChromeOS will adopt key Android components, like the Linux kernel and frameworks, to speed up AI integration and enhance device compatibility.</li><li>Google assures consumers, businesses, and schools that the integration will be smooth, with regular updates and no disruptions to future hardware plans.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is changing ChromeOS under the hood by borrowing tech from Android to supercharge your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">beloved Chromebooks</a> with new AI features, but it&apos;ll be a while before you see them.</p><p>In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/06/building-faster-smarter-chromebook.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Prajakta Gudadhe and Alexander Kuscher, the directors of engineering and product management for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-update-chromeos">ChromeOS</a>, shared a new plan to speed up the rollout of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-must-balance-ai-features-with-privacy">Google&apos;s AI features</a> to Chromebooks. Their strategy involves blending key parts of the Android system into ChromeOS. This combined approach is meant to bring advanced AI capabilities to Chromebooks faster than ever.</p><p>Google has detailed which Android parts ChromeOS will be adopting, including the Android Linux kernel and its frameworks. This move goes beyond just adding AI features; Google believes it will bring two big benefits: simplifying engineering work and improving how well Chromebooks, mobile devices, and accessories work together.</p><p>Google wants to reassure users—whether they’re consumers, businesses, or schools—that this integration will go off without a hitch. The usual four-week update cycle will stay on track, guaranteeing a steady rollout of new features. Future hardware plans are also unchanged. The biggest change to expect is a future where new features are delivered more often and with a bigger impact.</p><p>While we&apos;re still figuring out the long-term impacts, merging Android and ChromeOS kernels is a pretty exciting idea. This foundational shift might soon create a more seamless and unified experience for users across both platforms.</p><p>Google acknowledges that it will take a while before consumers and organizations can enjoy the benefits of this unified technical foundation. However, it&apos;s committed to ensuring a smooth transition when the time comes.</p><p>Meanwhile, the regular software update schedule will stay in place, so users will continue to receive the latest features and improvements without interruption.</p><p>This joint effort is another step in the ongoing collaboration between the ChromeOS and Android teams. Their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chrome-os-m124-may-update-changes">past successes with integrating Android apps</a> and Bluetooth features into ChromeOS may give us confidence that this new initiative will be executed smoothly.</p>

<ul><li>Fitbit will remove the web version of the dashboard for users starting July 8.</li><li>This move will push users to move from the web to their phones, allowing them to access features exclusively designed for an in-app experience.</li><li>Fitbit says that this move aligns with its mission to be one "combined Fitbit and Google team."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Fitbit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Fitbit-com-Dashboard/Fitbit-com-web-dashboard-is-transitioning-to-the-Fitbit-app/td-p/5613159">announced</a> on Tuesday (June 11) that it will discontinue the web dashboard starting July 8. This comes after Fitbit made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-minimal-app-changes">several changes </a>to its app last year, including a "Today page" and a "Discovery page" with much larger information cards.</p><p>The company stated that this transition aligns with its mission to be one "combined Fitbit and Google team."</p><p>It looks like the Fitbit team is trying to integrate all its health and wellness features into the Fitbit app. This move will push users to move from the web to their phones, allowing them to access features that have been exclusively designed for an in-app experience. </p>
<p>Users will no longer be able to access the dashboard after the set deadline, but the company says that all the previous data stored online, including details on nutrition, sleep, and activity until that date, will be made available to users via the Fitbit app.</p><p>While having all the data stored in one place seems like a good move, several Fitbit users seem not too excited about it. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Fitbit-com-Dashboard/FitBit-Dashboard-being-phased-out/td-p/5588977">separate community thread</a>, a user who spotted this change in April said, "So now the web or &apos;browser&apos; dashboard has an interstitial message that pops up telling me I can use the app on my phone."</p><p>"I have the app on my phone - I don&apos;t need telling. I&apos;m logging in to use the web dashboard because it&apos;s more convenient for me."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MzufXAujfeCTfTd5GDbzmS" name="fitbit-desktop-dashboard-march.jpg" alt="Fitbit dashboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MzufXAujfeCTfTd5GDbzmS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another frustrated user said they didn&apos;t want the change and never asked the company to remove the dashboard, complaining that the company doesn&apos;t appear interested in listening to consumer needs.</p><p>"If anything there&apos;s hundreds of people saying how important that was for their HEALTH goals, but yet you ignore us and just do what you want," the user added.</p><p>Some users pointed out that the Fitbit app doesn&apos;t show your Lifetime Achievement stats, Best Achievement stats, and Calories Left Estimate.</p><p>"If Google Fitbit suggests that the mobile app has the features of a web dashboard, they are wrong." Additionally, things like creating a meal and customizing food, such as the way in the web dashboard, continue to be missing in the app. </p><p>On the other hand, Fitbit acknowledged that change can be difficult, "but we appreciate your patience as we build Google Fitbit to be better than before." Users have approximately another month to download the app and sync their fitness data.</p>

<ul><li>Dave Burke announces that he's moving away from his role leading Android engineering, but will continue as an advisor.</li><li>Burke is seeking new "AI/bio projects" within Google, although details on his successor have not yet been revealed.</li><li>Burke is one of the latest Android leads to transition away into a new role following the major Platforms & Devices reorg earlier this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>In a surprise announcement on Wednesday, long-time Android engineering VP Dave Burke revealed that he is stepping away from his role. Burke said in a post on X that "it&apos;s time for a change" after 14 years leading Android engineering and that he&apos;ll continue as an advisor for the time being.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So... after 14 yrs leading Android engineering, I've decided it's time for a change. An awe-inspiring ride helping build the biggest OS on the planet (+ many Nexus/Pixel). I'm forever grateful for the opp. Continuing as advisor while figuring out what's next in AI/bio. More here:…<a href="https://twitter.com/davey_burke/status/1801044329097818137">June 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Burke further elaborates on his decision to depart from his role in a lengthy email to his colleagues that he <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daveburke5_thanks-for-the-memories-android-sharing-activity-7206809311837052928-ZeH5/">shared via LinkedIn</a>, explaining that he is "exploring AI / bio projects" within Google with the help of CEO Sundar Pichai.</p><p>"AI has the potential to play a pivotal role in accelerating drug discovery, with wide applicability, including in hard-to-treat pediatric cancers, a topic close to my heart," Burke says in the post.</p><p>Burke started working at Google in 2007 and became VP of Engineering for Android in 2014. He had a major hand in various products, as outlined in his post, and helped shape <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android</a> into what it is today. He&apos;s also a major presence at Google I/O, where he has demonstrated the latest features coming to the platform. "But at the end of the day, what I&apos;m most proud of is the team I helped build as we scaled Android users 3000x from 1 million to over 3 billion."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sEEr36MyAG8SVTp3kuPZLW" name="Google-Pixel-Fold-split-window.gif" alt="Dave Burke multitasking on a Google Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sEEr36MyAG8SVTp3kuPZLW.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Burke&apos;s departure seemingly underscores major changes happening within Google. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-hardware-team-restructuring-merge">announced in April</a> that it was restructuring and combining its software and hardware divisions into one Platforms & Devices team under the leadership of Rick Osterloh. During the announcement, it was revealed that long-time Android lead Hiroshi Lockheimer was stepping away from his role and moving onto an advisory role during the transition before kickstarting a new executive sponsor role for Google in Japan.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/12/android-reorg-dave-burke-reorg/">9to5Google</a> learned from sources that Burke&apos;s departure may be part of a reorganization of the newly formed Platforms & Devices team. Android Central reached out to Google for a comment on Burke&apos;s departure and the alleged reorganization, but a spokesperson said they had nothing to share.</p><p>Meanwhile, Burke&apos;s announcement did not mention who would succeed him, but he said more details would come soon.</p><p>"It&apos;s important for me to leave you in good hands with a well thought out succession plan. We&apos;ll be following up shortly with some additional specifics about this change, so please keep an eye out for that."</p>

<ul><li>Tipster Digital Chat Station has come up with interesting information regarding the Mix Flip.</li><li>Xiaomi's long-rumored first clamshell phone could soon see the light of day.</li><li>The device will likely have a solid battery capacity alongside the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC underneath.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The rumors of Xiaomi&apos;s first clamshell foldable phone trail back to last year, when we first heard about its existence through a render, followed by an IMEI database registry. Prolific tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/u/6048569942">Digital Chat Station</a> is back again, sharing some exciting details of Xiaomi&apos;s clamshell phone tentatively named Mix Flip.</p><p>According to the tipster&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OitwqEDUc?pagetype=profilefeed">recent Weibo post</a>, Xiaomi&apos;s first vertical folding phone, popularly called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">clamshell phone</a>, is coming soon. It will be powered by the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, which appears to be a step up as other f<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">oldable phones</a> that it competes with have used Snapdragon 8 Plus series chipsets, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a>, and not the flagship SoC. However, the 2024 Razr Plus model gearing up for the release is rumored to equip a Snapdragon 8s Gen 3.</p>
<p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/u/6048569942#:~:text=Snapdragon%208Gen3%20flagship">interesting details</a> of the phone include the launch of the foldable, which is likely to happen in July, notes Tipster. If it turns out to be accurate, it will be placed right next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, which will also be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. </p><p>That, however, happens when Xiaomi chooses to launch the Mix Flip globally, unlike the Mix Fold phones, which don&apos;t launch worldwide. In terms of design, the tipster further indicates that the device will incorporate a metal middle frame paired with a glass body. The battery capacity is also said to be one of the significant aspects of the foldable to look forward to.</p><p>In other news, the Mix Flip has also been spotted in the hands of Xiaomi CEO (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-mix-flip-nbtc-certification/">91mobiles</a>). The device shown through images on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5043415945840915">Weibo</a> indicates the CEO walking around with the Mix Flip in a folded state. While the shared photo is unclear, it still hints at a foldable clamshell phone.</p>

<p>On the other hand, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/xiaomi-mix-flip-nbtc-certification/">MySmartPrice</a>, the Mix Flip phone has also been found on a Thailand-based NBTC certification site that confirms the device&apos;s model number, <strong>2405CPX3DG</strong>, right next to the device moniker, Xiaomi Mix Flip. Alongside the moniker, the certification also reveals the device&apos;s support for 5G connectivity. </p><p>Besides, early this year, the device also hit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-mix-flip-to-get-satellite-connectivity">MIIT certification</a>, indicating that the upcoming clamshell phone supports Satellite Connectivity. </p><p>As for the looks of the Mix Flip, nothing concrete about the device has come up yet aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-mix-flip-spotted-imei-database">render</a> and an alleged hands-on experience with the device. Both reveal a cover screen aided by a separate camera module featuring dual primary cameras. While the design certainly strikes differently, the cover screen will likely measure less in size than the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Razr Plus 2023 external displays.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (June 12), Samsung announced the start of its One UI 6 Watch beta program for U.S. users.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Tips/1st-Beta-Software-Update-Jun-12th/m-p/2917871#M6">community post</a>, Samsung states that its first One UI 6 Watch beta gives users a glimpse into what&apos;s coming up for its Galaxy watches. As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-6-watch-beta-program-galaxy-watch-6/">SamMobile</a>, consumers with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 or 6 Classic</a> should be able to enroll in the Samsung Members app. It seems as though only the Bluetooth variant can join the beta for now. LTE device support should come at a later date.</p><p>A few health-related features, backed by Galaxy AI, headline this first beta. The initial One UI 6 feature helps users "monitor energy levels." Samsung Health is picking up a new "energy score," which shows a user&apos;s physical and mental readiness based on their sleep and physical data.</p><p>Users will receive "personal insights" to advise them to rest if their score is low or push ahead with a high one.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, Samsung&apos;s sleep analysis now offers a "detailed" report. The company states its One UI 6 Watc beta will display your heart rate, respiratory rate, and how long it took to fall asleep the previous night.</p><p>The health features conclude with a new option to create a "custom workout routine." The Korean OEM states users can combine a series of different workouts and set targets for sets, reps, "and more."</p>

<p>The gesture controls on the Galaxy Watch 6 and 6 Classic are being upgraded, beginning with a double pinch. Samsung states users can pinch their index finger and thumb to answer calls, dismiss alarms, sift through notifications, control music, snap photos, and more.</p><p>Galaxy watches are also gaining the ability to determine which apps can ping your wrist without opening the Wearable app. Additionally, Galaxy Watch Modes have been upgraded to control more settings on your device based on "what you&apos;re doing or where you are."</p><p>Samsung states its watch Modes can control Do not Disturb, Always On Display, Raise Wrist to wake, Touch Screen to wake, Touch Bezel to wake, Sound mode, and Disconnection alerts.</p><p>Universal gestures are entering the One UI 6 Watch beta, giving users access to an action&apos;s appropriate controls quickly without manually changing focus. Tapping the bottom of your watch&apos;s UI will display ongoing activities like phone calls, exercise sessions, and music.</p><p>The rest of the One UI 6 Watch beta patch notes are as follows:</p>

<p>Samsung warns users that some of their Watch apps may need to be updated after installing the beta program. More information is reportedly available in the program&apos;s recruitment notice.</p><p>Interested users can enter the Samsung Members app and head to <strong>Notices > Registration for One UI Watch Beta Program </strong>to begin preparations.</p><p>Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/one-ui-5-watch-beta-available-now">last year</a>, Samsung is getting its next wearable software beta going in June ahead of its summer Unpacked. It&apos;s worth remembering that Samsung&apos;s One UI 6 Watch beta is based on Google&apos;s Wear OS 5 software. Moreover, the upcoming Galaxy Watch 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-google-reportedly-testing-wear-os-5">has been rumored</a> to feature this new OS once it launches this summer.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 6 continues a trend that Samsung has become known for with its wearables. The device boasts a slight performance boost over last year's but features a larger and brighter display.

<ul><li>Meta and LG planned to challenge the Apple Vision Pro with a new "high-performance XR headset," likely called the Meta Quest Pro 2.</li><li>An LG spokesperson said that LG has relocated most of the team from the project, essentially signaling that the headset has been canceled.</li><li>Meta and LG will continue to partner for R&D on VR headset components, meaning we'll likely still get LG-made components in upcoming Meta Quest headsets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Just as the Apple Vision Pro made its debut in February of this year, Meta and LG announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-lg-rumored-to-join-alliance-for-quest-pro-2-and-ai-projects">a strategic partnership</a> "to release the highest-performance XR headset that surpasses Apple&apos;s &apos;Vision Pro&apos; in the first quarter of next year." But it turns out that things weren&apos;t going according to plan and LG is canceling work on the aforementioned headset.</p><p>A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20240612000169?mc=em_008_00001">ET News</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/lg-meta-xr-partnership-on-ice/">Road to VR</a>) confirms that earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2-new-display-delay">rumors of a shaky partnership</a> were true. Per an LG electronics official, the company has "recently finalized the policy of relocating personnel in charge of the XR business. The relocation will be carried out for about a month in consideration of the desired departments and workplaces, as well as the demand for additional manpower from other departments."</p><p>It&apos;s said that LG moved specifically because industry growth for a premium XR headset didn&apos;t align with the company&apos;s internal projections. Apple pulled in around $630 million dollars during the product&apos;s launch but reports since then have shown that demand for the company&apos;s $3,500 headset has significantly slowed down.</p><p>One year ago, it was said that Meta scrapped its own plans for an internally-developed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2">Quest Pro 2</a>, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/156fnjx/meta_cto_heavily_implies_that_quest_pro_2_is_not/">Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth said</a> that just one prototype headset was canceled and that the company works on several prototypes at any given time. Likewise, the report from ET News notes that Meta and LG&apos;s partnership isn&apos;t dissolved and that the companies will continue to partner on R&D for XR headset components in the future.</p>

<p>This means that LG-made displays and other important components should still be used in future Meta Quest headsets. Perhaps this means the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Meta Quest 4</a> will use an LG-made OLED panel or that one of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">Meta Horizon OS-powered headsets</a> made by Asus and Lenovo might use other LG components.</p><p>Meta has neither confirmed nor denied its own plans for a Quest Pro 2 although, as said before, the company regularly tests out prototype devices that could one day become a proper consumer device. Whether one of these turns out to be called the "Quest Pro 2" or something entirely different will all depend on the circumstances.</p><p>We know that the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung XR headset</a> made in partnership with Samsung and Google plans to challenge the Apple Vision Pro by attempting to beat it at its own game. Largely, that means providing super high-resolution displays <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-meta">and millions of apps</a> available at product launch, which is currently expected for sometime in 2025.</p><p>Google also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-magic-leap-partnership">recently announced a partnership</a> with AR glasses maker Magic Leap, which is likely to use the same Android XR operating system as the Samsung XR headset. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">quietly showed off XR tech</a> at this year&apos;s Google I/O show, helping showcase what could become a mainstay in future human communication.</p>

Spatial audio uses the Immersive Video and Audio Services (IVAS) codec, part of the next-generation 3GPP standards. While we&apos;ve all heard spatial audio before, doing it over a cellular connection is an industry first.</p><p>Nokia is a big contributor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nokia.com/standardization/technology-standards/multimedia/#immersive-voice-and-audio">IVAS codec</a> standards, which are part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2023/01/how-5g-advanced-will-deliver-the-next-big-boost-to-mobile-broadband-experiences">5G Advanced</a>—the next generation of 5G that companies and researchers are hashing out to give us even more capability when it comes to using both our phones and other products like VR and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming devices</a>.</p>
<p>I&apos;ll admit, I think things like this are cool because I love seeing what smart people with huge budgets can come up with. But this is also the kind of news that needs a bit of explaining.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-spatial-audio-2">What is spatial audio?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="oQUstZRZbe8oumEW8jFVU7" name="DropTHX-Panda-headphones.jpg" alt="Drop THX headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oQUstZRZbe8oumEW8jFVU7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;ve probably heard or read about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-android-users-need-know-about-spatial-audio">spatial audio</a>. You&apos;ve also experienced it even if you didn&apos;t know it at the time.</p><p>The easy way to describe spatial audio is by giving an example—you&apos;ve almost certainly listened to music through a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">pair of headphones</a> and have noticed different sounds coming from each ear. That&apos;s an example of spatial audio at work.</p>
<p>Spatial audio is multidirectional sound that lets your brain think sound is coming from a certain direction, and we see it in movies or games. It&apos;s well supported by Apple, Microsoft, and Google, so almost any device you buy can do it. Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-might-add-spatial-audio-to-chromebooks-in-a-future-chromeos-update">adding the feature to Chromebooks</a>, too. </p><p>Some communications software already uses spatial audio, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-10-google-meet-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Meet</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-microsoft-teams-chromebook">Microsoft Teams</a>. As long as you have hardware that supports it and software that can deliver it, things can sound like they are coming from the proper direction in real time.</p>
<p>Right now, the supporting "software" isn&apos;t available for use over a phone&apos;s voice connection. You might be able to experience it via apps like Meet mentioned above, but those use your phone&apos;s data connection, not the regular voice channel.</p><p>Incorporating the IVAS codec into the 3GPP (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.3gpp.org/">3rd Generation Partnership Project</a>) standards means every phone on every network can use spatial audio in both voice calls and "standard" video calls through your phone provider.</p>
<h2 id="do-we-really-need-this-why-is-this-important-2">Do we really need this? Why is this important?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BBmzDtp8uTLRDpnHrQFcPi" name="gamesir-x2-bluetooth-mobile-controller-with-phone-4.jpg" alt="Gamesir X2 Bluetooth Mobile Controller With Phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BBmzDtp8uTLRDpnHrQFcPi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Jennifer Locke / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Do we need this? No. We also don&apos;t need <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomis-first-android-phone-4k-display-could-be-way">4K displays on phones</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-dollar3000-marq-carbon-watches-make-epix-2-pro-look-affordable">expensive smartwatches</a>, or phones that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">fold in half</a>. Just like you may want to use one of these things, someone else can want to use spatial audio over a phone call.</p><p>Spatial audio in a phone call does sound like an unnecessary gimmick. Do you need to know which direction a passing car is coming from when someone is calling you, or do my coworkers need to know which shoulder my screaming parrot is sitting on? Nope. But it could be handy in conference calls where more than one person is in the room or in some other imaginary scenario that probably isn&apos;t going to happen.</p><p>But that&apos;s not why this is being worked on or why it might matter. </p>
<p>Think back to before we had 5G and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-explained">all the promises we heard</a>. 5G isn&apos;t just about your phone. 5G is about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-kills-android-things-adding-yet-another-product-its-ever-growing-graveyard">Internet of Things</a>.</p><p>I hate that phrase as much as you do, but just because it gets abused and thrown around until we&apos;re sick of hearing it doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not a real thing. Plenty of the products we use now could benefit from spatial audio over 5G, like a security camera with audio enabled. Other things could just be a little cooler with it enabled, like a gaming handheld that uses a SIM card. </p><p>With a standard in place, we wouldn&apos;t have to depend on support from the people who make the products and the software that powers them. As long as they follow accepted worldwide standards, it will work.</p>
<p>I&apos;m not going to get hyped over a spatial audio call like The Finnish Ambassador of Digitalization and New Technologies did because I don&apos;t feel a need for immersive and rich phone calls. Maybe I&apos;m old-fashioned that way.</p><p>I do look forward to seeing the next cool stuff tech companies can invent, and the more tech available for them to leverage, the better. Bring on the immersion!</p>

<ul><li>India is proposing a DMA-like law called the Digital Competition Bill, which aims to prevent companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon from dominating the market through anti-competitive practices.</li><li>The bill outlines rules for data handling, platform neutrality, and user control. Violations could result in tech giants paying hefty fines of up to 10% of their turnover.</li><li>The Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is set to hold two meetings on Thursday (June 13) and Tuesday (June 18) with different tech companies to address "serious concerns" and consider the interests of all parties involved before going ahead with the bill.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While Google and other tech companies are battling to keep up with the EU&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a>, they&apos;ll have to watch for a new bill from India that&apos;s set to hit them soon. </p><p>The act, which has yet to be put into motion, is called the Digital Competition Bill (DCB), which could restrict Google, Meta, Apple, and Amazon from following practices that would benefit them in monopolizing the market. The bill also seeks to impose heavy penalties, which could amount to billions of dollars for violations. If the DCB were to be implied, these tech companies would have to make major changes to their platforms (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/draft-digital-competition-bill-big-tech-opposes-9330370/">The Indian Express)</a>.</p><p>In May, U.S. lobby groups representing Google, Amazon, and Apple are pushing India to rethink this bill, citing that the regulations against data use and treatment of partners could raise user costs for these companies. </p><p>After receiving backlash, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is set to hold two meetings on Thursday (June 13) and Tuesday (June 18) with different tech companies to address "serious concerns" and consider the interests of all parties involved before going ahead with this bill, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/draft-digital-competition-law-urgent-meeting-this-week-amid-industry-concerns/article68277966.ece">official sources</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-bill-and-who-does-it-impact-2">What is this bill and who does it impact?</h2>
<p>India’s Ministry of Corporate Affairs released the Draft Digital Competition Bill on March 12. The bill aims to promote fair competition practices, especially for large tech companies. The focus remains on social media sites and search engines, which will be designated Systematically Significant Digital Enterprises (SSDE) based on their user base, market influence, and revenue. </p><p>The quantitative parameters for a company to be designated an SSDE are:</p>
<ul><li>If in the last 3 financial years, its turnover in India is not less than Rs 4,000 crore, or its global turnover is not less than $30 billion, or</li><li>Its gross merchandise value in India is not less than Rs 16,000 crore or</li><li>Its global market capitalization is not less than $75 billion or</li><li>These companies' core digital services should have at least 1 crore end users or 10,000 business users.</li></ul>
<p>This bill takes what&apos;s called the "ex-ante" approach, meaning it aims to prevent anti-competitive practices even before they happen, unlike the current laws that intervene after the fact. </p><p>The Indian government <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-eu-like-antitrust-law-worrying-technology-firms-2024-06-11/">says</a> these new regulations are needed as the digital market is "increasingly becoming concentrated," with a few large companies having "immense control over the market." According to the panel, this bill favors smaller digital firms and startups that rely on big tech giants, prompting an "imbalance of power."</p><p>The bill aims to stop companies from monopolizing the market, controlling prices, and excluding competition. It also addresses data collection, preventing large tech companies from using data collected on one platform to benefit another. For instance, Facebook cannot use the data collected on its platform to benefit Whatsapp/Instagram unless user consent is given.</p><p>The bill also addresses other aspects like allowing users to download third-party apps on their platforms (like installing a non-App Store app on an iPhone), and companies would have to give the users more control of their data, allowing them to freely choose default settings making it easier to transfer data to other platforms. </p><p>If this bill is passed, the new law will require companies to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-eu-like-antitrust-law-worrying-technology-firms-2024-06-11/"> pay a penalty</a> of up to 10% of a company&apos;s global turnover for violations. </p>

<p>While this bill promises several potential benefits, some stakeholders are also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/draft-digital-competition-law-urgent-meeting-this-week-amid-industry-concerns/article68277966.ece">raising concerns</a>. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www2.itif.org/2024-india-digital-competition-bill.pdf">argues</a> that the bill&apos;s benefits of an ex-ante regime will outweigh its harms, "and in particular a reduction in the dynamic competition that is often the best corrective to market failure in fast-moving digital markets."</p><p>They also argue that the bill might put a compliance burden on these tech companies, pushing them to increase the cost of their services to users. Some argue that the regulations could stifle the relationship of international companies with India, hampering economic growth. </p><p>According to Reuters, companies like Amazon and Flipkart are being <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-top-court-says-antitrust-probe-amazon-walmarts-flipkart-should-continue-2021-08-09/">examined</a> for promoting select sellers on their e-commerce platforms, hurting rivals. Many times, Google has been brought into the ring of fire and faced antitrust fines in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/india-antitrust-body-orders-probe-into-googles-billing-dispute-2024-03-15/">legal battles</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/indias-antitrust-directives-android-that-have-spooked-google-2023-01-12/">abusing</a> its position in the Android mobile operating system market, restricting users&apos; ability to remove pre-installed apps.</p><p>The law proposal and feedback received will now be reviewed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and its minister, Nirmala Sitharaman. </p>

<ul><li>YouTube has started a "Test & Compare" experiment, which lets creators upload multiple thumbnails for a video.</li><li>The platform will alternate up to three thumbnails "evenly" for viewers on YouTube as an engagement test to see what catches their eyes and boosts video engagement.</li><li>YouTube launched a "Remix" test for Shorts creators earlier this year while also expanding its AI-backed "jump ahead" test for viewers in May.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube announced a test for creators that will let them determine which thumbnail attracts the most viewers.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/279488115">Team YouTube</a>, creators on the platform will soon pick up access to the "Thumbnail Test & Compare" test feature (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/12/youtube-video-thumbnail-testing-tool/">9to5Google</a>). Partaking creators can then upload "up to three" thumbnails for a singular video. The purpose is to gauge which of those three entices viewers the most to click on your video.</p><p>The post states that the platform will "show your chosen thumbnails evenly across your video’s viewers." After the test, creators will see a "Winner" label on whichever thumbnail outperformed the others. YouTube states a winning thumbnail&apos;s performance is calculated based on "watch time share."</p><p>However, if a thumbnail "likely" outperformed the other two based on watch time, YouTube will display a "Preferred" tag. If there is no clear winning thumbnail, the platform will display the first photo a creator uploaded to their audience.</p><p>YouTube states a test could vary from a few days to a few weeks. The amount of time taken is reportedly due to a "variety of factors" like the amount of impressions a video receives and the number of thumbnails uploaded.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:599px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.17%;"><img id="tiBDqRzHXccB6xxwZct9TJ" name="youtube-creator-test-and-compare-experiment.jpg" alt="YouTube is kickstarting a "Test & Compare" experiment for creators, allowing them to upload multiple thumbnails for a video." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tiBDqRzHXccB6xxwZct9TJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="599" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The platform allows creators to go back and upload a couple of extra thumbnails to older videos if they choose, as well.</p><p>As stated on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13861714">support page</a>, the Test & Compare experiment is rolling out to a "limited set" of content creators on YouTube. Those lucky enough to get in will notice a Test & Compare button when putting the final touches on your content in YouTube Studio. Those interested in (hopefully) getting chosen should ensure that their account is eligible by hopping into <strong>YouTube Studio > Feature eligibility > Enable "Advanced Features."</strong></p><p>Earlier this year, YouTube started a test for creators making Shorts, which let them "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-remix-music-video-rollout">Remix</a>" their content using music videos. Users could grab the video&apos;s audio through the "Sound" option, "Collab" with it by featuring their content next to an artist&apos;s music video, and more.</p><p>A more user-facing experiment rolled out for wider availability earlier in May called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtubes-jump-ahead-experimental-ai-feature-is-here-in-wider-test">jump ahead</a>." The test, backed by YouTube&apos;s AI, lets users automatically skip through a video to its best parts to save you time. Speculation suggests that YouTube needs a rather large sample size of viewers clicking on a video and watching to determine what those "best parts" are.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you want one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> currently on the market at a record low price; you want a great clamshell foldable that isn&apos;t by Samsung; you want a foldable with a nice cover display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you can wait until the Motorola Razr Plus (2024) comes out later this year; you want a phone with great battery life.</p><p>As senior editor Derrek Lee described in his glowing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus (2023) review</a>, the Motorola phone "outclasses just about every flip-style phone on the market". You get two gorgeous displays (with refresh rates of up to 165Hz), surprisingly loud stereo speakers, and a stylish clamshell design that could send the best Samsung devices running for the hills. </p><p>Of course, as with many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, not everything is sunshine and rainbows with the Razr Plus (2023). The cameras are only so-so, and it&apos;s not a great device if you need loads of battery life. It&apos;s also worth noting that the phone&apos;s Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset was already a bit old in 2023, so even though it still performs very well in most situations, it may not be the best choice if you like using the newest processors on the market. </p><p>Despite those issues, the Motorola Razr Plus (2023) remains one of the best devices in its class. If you&apos;ve had your eye on the phone for a while, there&apos;s never been a better time to buy than right now. </p>
