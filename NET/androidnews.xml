<hr>
<p>Samsung gives users confirmation that a boost for the Galaxy S24&apos;s Instant Slow-mo feature is on the way.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theonecid/status/1798809104267534352">TheOneCID</a> on X posted a screenshot of a Samsung community moderator informing users that HDR10 Plus for Instant Slow-Mo will arrive soon (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-instant-slow-mo-soon-get-hdr-upgrade/">Android Police</a>). This will let users record videos in the higher-quality setting and apply Galaxy AI&apos;s slow motion effect to it without sacrificing dynamic range.</p><p>There are several other Slow-mo updates inbound, too, such as .mov file type editing support for such videos. This will reportedly be done through the editing feature found within the Gallery app on supported Galaxy devices.</p><p>Additionally, the publication notes that Samsung will soon let users share their Slow-mo videos.</p><p>Tapping the "Share" button on any video with the Slow-mo effect will let users quickly send it out to other people. This should toss away the current method of doing so, which involves a waiting period as your device exports it for sharing purposes.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-s/%EC%9E%90%EC%84%B8%ED%9E%88-%EB%B3%B4%EA%B3%A0-%EC%8B%B6%EC%9D%80-%EC%88%9C%EA%B0%84%EC%9D%80-%EC%9D%B8%EC%8A%A4%ED%84%B4%ED%8A%B8-%EC%8A%AC%EB%A1%9C%EB%AA%A8%EB%A1%9C/m-p/27431950#M1097631">community moderator&apos;s post</a> states that the HDR 10 Plus support for the Galaxy S24&apos;s Instant Slow-mo will arrive in the "next SW update." Users will most likely see the updates roll in during the One UI 6.1.1 software patch.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING‚ÄºÔ∏èSamsung has finally achieved HDR10+ videos Instant slow-mo capability and are bringing it soon via a SW update üéâüòéüòé pic.twitter.com/desOGhQRgA<a href="https://twitter.com/theonecid/status/1798809104267534352">June 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The tipster responded to some user concerns, stating the updates to Instant Slow-mo, specifically HDR10 Plus, should arrive for all devices that support it.</p><p>In February, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-confirms-galaxy-ai-slow-mo-feature-past-gen">started rolling out</a> its S24 Instant Slow-mo to older devices like the Galaxy S23 series, the Flip 5, Fold 5, and the Tab S9. The feature piggybacks off Galaxy AI to "naturally" slow down a video frame by frame. Its capabilities are activated by long-pressing a section of a recorded video while watching it. Users can then take it into the editor to spruce things up.</p><p>The Galaxy S23 supports varying ranges of HDR, including its plus variant, so users rocking that device should (ideally) pick it up without a problem.</p><p>One UI 6.1.1 is shaping up to hold quite a few improvements as it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-set-to-bring-vertical-scrolling-back-to-the-app-drawer-in-one-ui-611">recently confirmed</a> in March that Samsung is changing the app drawer. When One UI 6 launched, the vertically scrolling app drawer on Galaxy devices disappeared. A Samsung moderator confirmed that the function will return during One UI 6.1.1 for its Good Lock modules.</p><p>We&apos;re also expecting quite a large <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/next-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-upgrade-might-be-on-hold-for-a-bit">camera update</a> for the Galaxy S24 series. The patch should solve some disappointing HDR and telephoto issues users have encountered. After a delay, it&apos;s been rumored that Samsung could roll out the update in June. It&apos;s unclear if this will be tied to the camera additions in One UI 6.1.1 or not.</p>

<p>As Samsung pursues "perfection," the Galaxy S24 Ultra arrives as yet another step above its 2023 version.

<h2 id="when-is-prime-day-2">When is Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Although official dates haven&apos;t been announced quite yet, Amazon has confirmed that Prime Day 2024 will occur sometime in July.¬†</p><p>Last year&apos;s event happened on July 11th and 12th, while the 2022 sale occurred on the 12th and 13th. If those past events are any indication, we can safely assume that Prime Day 2024 will happen sometime in the middle of next month.¬†</p><p>I&apos;ll update this guide as soon as the dates are revealed, so check back later for news.¬†</p>
<h2 id="what-is-prime-day-xa0-2">What is Prime Day?¬†</h2>
<p>Prime Day is Amazon&apos;s biggest sale of the year, offering Prime members some of the most epic discounts this side of Black Friday. It started back in 2015 and runs for 48 hours each summer (usually in July). In addition to regular discounts, Prime Day is chock full of flash deals, invite-only opportunities, and much more.¬†</p>
<h2 id="is-prime-day-only-for-members-xa0-2">Is Prime Day only for members?¬†</h2>
<p>Pretty much. Prime Day was specifically designed to benefit Prime members, so the vast majority of deals on the site will only be available to those who sign up for the subscription service.</p><p>If you aren&apos;t a Prime member yet and you aren&apos;t interested in paying the $14.99 monthly fee, it&apos;s worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon offers a 30-day free trial</strong></a> that you can cancel at any time. In other words, you could sign up on July 1st, enjoy all of the money-saving benefits of Prime Day 2024, and cancel your account before the month ends.¬†</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-find-the-best-prime-day-deals-2">How do I find the best Prime Day deals?</h2>
<p>In addition to simply monitoring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/deals">Amazon&apos;s deal home page</a>, Prime members can also stay on top of the best Prime Day deals by signing up for the Prime Insider newsletter and creating alert notifications on their favorite product categories.¬†</p><p>I also recommend using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">Camelcamelcamel.com</a> for price tracking and, of course, watching this guide (and Android Central in general) for up-to-date deal coverage and shopping advice.</p>
<h2 id="is-prime-day-only-at-amazon-2">Is Prime Day only at Amazon?</h2>
<p>Prime Day is technically exclusive to Amazon shoppers, but you&apos;ll likely find that all of the retailer&apos;s biggest competitors ‚Äî including Best Buy, Walmart, and Target ‚Äî will be launching sales of their own around the same time. Just like past years, we&apos;ll be covering all of the best rival sales that are relevant to Android users, so check back later for news.</p>

<p>If there&apos;s one complaint I have when it comes to being able to do this for a living, it&apos;s the constant neck and shoulder pain. Looking down at my phone, tablet, or laptop for years has done a number on me. While I have a home office with plenty of monitors, that doesn&apos;t really help me if I&apos;m away from home or just want to sit in another room.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I became a dad for the first time, so needless to say, I haven&apos;t left the house much. However, I recently had to take a sporadic, last-minute trip out of town. While I was trying to figure out what to bring with me, I opened a drawer and saw the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-air-2-series-launch">Xreal Air 2s</a> staring at me. So I tossed the case in the bag, not really thinking that I would actually use them, but they would be there if I wanted to.</p><p>Being that this was a last-minute trip, I didn&apos;t really have the best seats in the house. I sat in the middle seat of the last row, so needless to say, there wasn&apos;t much room for spreading out. After a bit of turbulence, I grabbed my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/steam-deck-oled-vs-steam-deck-lcd-what-are-the-differences">Steam Deck</a> and the Xreal Air 2s. In no time, I was entrenched in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hades-2-faq-main-character-early-access-and-other-questions-answered">Hades 2</a>, and before I knew it, we were landing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="jy3EFAxcd53zakb7vPXe6R" name="hades-2-steam-deck-xreal-air-2.jpg" alt="Playing Hades 2 on Steam Deck looking through Xreal Air 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jy3EFAxcd53zakb7vPXe6R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5105" height="2872" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After grabbing some grub and getting to the hotel, I tried to settle in but realized I had left my trusty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">Chromecast</a> behind. Some hotels have smart TVs so it just stays in the bag, but this one in particular didn&apos;t have any "smart amenities." I&apos;m not much of a channel surfer these days, so I lamented in my disappointment and decided to sit down and get some work done.</p><p>One of the neat things about the Xreal Air 2s and other smart glasses is that they are essentially just "plug-and-play." This means you don&apos;t need to install anything if you plan on using them as a monitor. However, if you have a phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> or MacBook, Xreal&apos;s Nebula app can be installed to add even more versatility. That said, I didn&apos;t even bother, as I just needed to not be crouched over my laptop screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Aza6qgdpLnrxGtknahqhFD" name="xreal-nebula-app-on-mac.jpg" alt="Xreal Air 2 settings in Nebula app on Mac" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Aza6qgdpLnrxGtknahqhFD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead, I just plugged the glasses into my MacBook and started working. All of the audio came through the built-in speakers on the glasses, so I didn&apos;t need to worry about my music being too loud to disturb those staying in adjacent rooms. A little while later, I closed up my laptop, grabbed my Steam Deck, and plugged in the Air 2s.</p><p>The one problem, if you want to use these kinds of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-all-different-types-smart-glasses-and-ones-are-best">smart glasses</a> with many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a>, is that you&apos;ll eventually need to charge. Unless you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a>, which sports two USB-C ports, you&apos;ll either need to stop using the glasses or rely on some type of adapter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="vZk5ZTB8ET4sqHhHgQbPD9" name="xreal-hub-with-xreal-air-2.jpg" alt="Xreal Hub with Xreal Air 2 smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vZk5ZTB8ET4sqHhHgQbPD9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, I thought about this when packing, so I made sure to toss the¬†<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XREAL-Adapter-Glasses-Charging-Android/dp/B0CZ6PX17L/" target="_blank">Xreal Hub</a>¬†into my tech pouch. This was only recently released, and it allows you to charge your device and use your glasses at the same time. It supports up to 45W charging speeds, but more importantly, you don&apos;t need to worry about video degradation, as the Hub supports 120Hz pass-through.</p><p>Another realization that I&apos;ve come to is that I really could have left almost all of my tech gear at home. Instead, I could have just taken the Xreal Glasses, my Galaxy Z Fold 5, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">Bluetooth controller</a>, and a Bluetooth keyboard. Then, I&apos;d be able to enjoy a larger screen, get work done with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a>, and still be able to play some games, all from a single device. I mean, that&apos;s kind of the dream, and it is something that I plan on trying the next time I take a trip.</p><p>There is one glaring trade-off that I continue to find when using different AR/XR glasses. I have yet to find a set that stays on the bridge of my nose without needing to constantly be pushed back up. It&apos;s really more of an annoyance than anything else, but I figured it was worth pointing out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NomupyCFFTnWVm9BjX7PSH" name="xreal-air-2-galaxy-z-fold-5-desk-setup-2.jpg" alt="Desk setup with Xreal Air 2, Galaxy Z Fold 5, and Mokibo keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NomupyCFFTnWVm9BjX7PSH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Along those same lines, I always feel like the glasses aren&apos;t close enough to my face. I don&apos;t mean in the sense that the virtual screens aren&apos;t large enough, but that there&apos;s just too much of a "gap" between the glasses and what I can see out of my peripherals. Obviously, this isn&apos;t a problem with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a>, but that&apos;s much more bulk to bring onto a plane that I didn&apos;t want to deal with.</p><p>I have yet to try out the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/smart-glasses-mwc-2024">Viture Pro Glasses</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-challenges-apple-vision-pro-with-air-2-ultra-ar-glasses">Xreal&apos;s Air 2 Ultra</a> glasses won&apos;t be shipping until sometime in July. I&apos;m not convinced that either of those would solve my peripheral light bleed "problem." Maybe I&apos;ll just 3D print some blinders or see if the community has come up with any solutions.</p><p>In the meantime, this trip taught me that I need to add the Xreal Air 2s to my everyday carry backpack.

Fortunately, the Big Three carrier is running a promo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s24/"><strong>that&apos;ll get you the flagship phone for 100% free</strong></a>, and all you need to do is add a line with an eligible data plan.

<p>Are you a Verizon customer in search of a sweet new phone?

<p>As of writing, nearly 400 people have the Galaxy S24 in their Verizon cart, so if you're interested, I wouldn't wait too long to make your move on this deal.¬†<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s24/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ed4cac43-541b-42b5-9e60-0e1d96013c71" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

These two data plans start at $80/month and $90/month for a single line, respectively, but the discounts stack up considerably when you add additional lines. For example, four lines on the Unlimited Plus plan drops the price to $45/month per line, rivalling some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-are-cheapest-data-plans-you-can-buy-us">best cheap data plans</a> on the market.</p><p>If you weren&apos;t familiar, the Samsung Galaxy S24 is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> on the market, coming packed with the latest AI-powered software features, a gorgeous 120Hz AMOLED display, and seven years of Android OS updates guaranteed.¬†</p><p>There are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s24-deals-of-the-month">Samsung Galaxy S24 deals</a> that&apos;ll get you the flagship phone for less than the retail price, but it&apos;s not often that you see a device like this go for free ‚Äî <em>especially</em> when you aren&apos;t doing a trade-in.

<hr>
<p>Another alleged batch of Samsung Unpacked promotional renderings has leaked, further cementing what&apos;s already expected.</p><p>Evan Blass <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Dienotmedia/status/1799094656481087657/photo/1">posted the latest round</a> of renders, which have been given the mosaic treatment to avoid Samsung&apos;s stern gaze (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/07/samsung-galaxy-foldables-watches-ring-leak/">9to5Google</a>). The first set of images seems to tease the upcoming Galaxy Ring in silver, black, and gold finishes. Next, there&apos;s an image of the Galaxy Watch 7 with an orange color scheme across its band and second hand.</p><p>The image seems to show the Watch 7 splashed in water, and as the publication notes, Samsung could look to promote its water resistance capabilities.</p><p>There&apos;s another image, a top-down view, that seemingly shows off every device ranging from the Galaxy Z Flip 6 to the Fold 6 and the Watch 7. That photo is a little harder to unpack (no pun intended) regarding the wearables.</p><p>However, it <em>looks </em>like the Galaxy Watch 7 will pick up a gray or maybe black color option for consumers.</p>

<p>Blass <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MoisesElPro2/status/1799033786451329208">also shared</a> a much closer but pixelated look at the Flip 6 and Fold 6. We won&apos;t have to squint our eyes at this one, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-spotted-in-an-ad">Samsung leaked those images</a> a few days ago. The company&apos;s Asian-based website accidentally posted promotional imagery for the upcoming foldables early.</p><p>It seems confirmed that the Fold 6 is in line for a slight redesign as it boasts sharp edges and flat sides. Its cameras will also be stacked vertically in a single camera visor. Compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">the Flip 5</a>, the new Flip 6 seems to feature the same design theme, which isn&apos;t <em>too </em>surprising.</p><p>While it&apos;s hard to tell which Galaxy Watch 7 we&apos;re looking at in those leaked materials, there have been rumors about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">Watch 7 Ultra</a>. Speculation states Samsung could throw out an all-new design for the device, providing it with a squarish body beneath the classic circular watch face.</p><p>With these leaks continuing, it&apos;s worth remembering that Samsung is rumored to host its summer Unpacked event on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is introducing a few new ways advertisers can start taking advantage of its TV network to reach new target audiences and access more channels.</p><p>As detailed in a press release, the Google TV network (GTV) is giving advertisers even more ways to "personalize" their ad campaigns to users. Ads under the FAST category (free ad-supported TV) have continued to rise, catalyzing the newest updates. The post states that the GTV offers in-stream video inventory for more than 125 channels built into Google TV.</p><p>These channels include live sports, TV shows, and movies. Beginning today (June 7), the new network will give advertisers access to CTV ad formats, including non-skippable ads and six-second bumper ads. Google states that there are more ad formats to come.</p><p>To reach new audiences, Google adds that advertisers its services deliver targeted, in-stream inventory across 20 million active TV and Android TV OS devices.</p><p>The company&apos;s new TV network is available to advertisers through Google Ads and Google Display & Video 360. Advertisers can purchase, plan, and measure their Google TV campaigns alongside "existing digital video campaigns."</p><p>The post states that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">Google TV&apos;s</a> newest ad offers will give advertisers access to 10,000 apps involving live TV, shows, and movies. More importantly, through its free channels, viewers spend an average of 75 minutes per day watching FAST ads. A study conducted by Deloitte in 2023 showed that roughly 60% of U.S. households view free, ad-supported TV content through streaming.</p>

<p>The company&apos;s announcement reiterates the ad offerings available to advertisers through YouTube. On that platform, brands can take advantage of non-skippable ads and other buffer ads that play before video content. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/9224914?hl=en">YouTube&apos;s ad campaign</a> support page, these ads are anywhere between six and 15 seconds.</p><p>Moreover, Google has expanded ads for advertisers to continue to reach new audiences <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-machine-learning-vertical-ads">through Shorts</a>. The company introduced new tools for companies to create "unique" vertical ads through customized templates and Machine Learning techniques.</p>

<ul><li>Max's Ad-Free tier pricing now starts at $16.99, and the 4K plan at $20.99 per month.</li><li>The yearly plans of the same tier have also been increased, now costing $169.99 and $209.99 per year, respectively.</li><li>New plans will apply to Max's subscribers starting July 4.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Max, formerly known as HBO Max, has released updated rates for its current ad-free plans. The rates show a $1 bump in the cost of the tier plans overall and the ad-free ones in particular.</p><p>According to Max&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.max.com/US/Answer/Detail/000002547">support page</a>, the Ad-Free plan starts at $16.99 per month and $169.99 per year, a significant bump from the previous $15.99 per month and $149.99 per year, respectively. Similarly, the Ultimate plan, also known as the 4K plan, will now cost $20.99 per month, and the annual plan will see a $10 rise, making it $209.99 per year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:550px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.18%;"><img id="Zvtyk5GizdywnZVBcvr3HV" name="westinghouse-roku-tv.jpg" alt="Smart TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zvtyk5GizdywnZVBcvr3HV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="550" height="364" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Westinghouse)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Users must bear in mind that these prices don&apos;t include applicable taxes. The plans with ads will remain the same, costing $9.99 per month and $99.99 per year. For people who opt for the streaming subscription directly through Max or from the app store, the new rates are applicable after July 4.¬†</p><p>However, some carriers like Verizon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/verizon-rumored-to-combine-max-and-netflix-cheaper-plans">also offer</a> Max streaming subscriptions ‚Äî they individually will let users know about the change in subscription prices whenever applicable.</p>
<p>To make up for its losses in 2022 and 2023, Max, like most other streaming providers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/max-prepares-password-sharing-crackdown">announced</a> intentions to restrict password sharing for its users early this year.¬†</p><p>Max believes that Netflix&apos;s password crackdown strategy has been successfully adopted, and Max also ought to make plans to crack password sharing later this year with a larger rollout scheduled for next year. Shoppable advertising will be among the "ad format enhancements" that users may see, as Max is also considering introducing them.</p><p>The hike in pricing has been a common trend across the streaming giants over the past year. More recently, Peacock has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/peacock-raises-monthly-subscription-price-two-dollars">announced</a> a rise in subscription plans just in time for the Olympics, as users would have to shell out more starting from July 18 (for new consumers), which is applicable for existing consumers on August 17.</p>

<hr>
<p>If you had been hoping to see what the Nothing Phone 3 has in store, this week was probably a disappointing one. Nothing CEO Carl Pei took to X (formerly Twitter) to give an update on the company&apos;s mobile plans. Unsurprisingly, it involves a whole lot of artificial intelligence. But Pei also mentioned the existence of Phone 3 for the first time, albeit in passing, and said it won&apos;t be coming this year.¬†</p><p>That&apos;s a departure from the yearly release schedule for Nothing phones that the company established during its brief history as a brand. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Nothing Phone 1</a> debuted in July 2022, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> was a neat follow-up in July 2023. Unfortunately, there won&apos;t be a Nothing Phone 3 coming out next month.¬†</p><p>"For the last two months, we‚Äôve been designing and prototyping AI interactions. Today, I want to show you some initial concepts to give you a better idea of what I‚Äôm talking about," Pei wrote in the post. "Expect this to be improved and gradually introduced, starting with Phone (3) next year. It‚Äôs important we get the product right, integrating hardware and AI in a way that is both useful and brings a smile to people‚Äôs faces."</p>

<p>Based on these comments, it feels like Nothing is delaying the release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-qualcomm-chip-price-rumors">Phone 3</a> to make sure its ambitious AI features are ready to go. That isn&apos;t a bad strategy, per se. In fact, it&apos;s a lot better than the approach other companies have taken ‚Äî¬†I&apos;m looking at you, Humane and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit</a> ‚Äî¬†which began with underwhelming and expensive products and culminated with potentially-dangerous batteries in the hands of AI Pin users.</p><p>Still, I think it&apos;s worth questioning whether Nothing is making the right call here. Despite being a fairly young company, Nothing already has made three phones and five pairs of earbuds by its main brand. Throw in the CMF by Nothing sub-brand, and you&apos;ve got more earbuds, a smartwatch, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothings-cmf-phone-1-might-have-a-little-surprise-in-store">a to-be-released smartphone</a>. I have to wonder whether the company would be more successful if it just stuck to one or two product categories while it grew, rather than trying to tackle so many different products and markets at once.</p>

<p>A few companies have tried to create standalone products with AI as the centerpiece, but it hasn&apos;t worked out too well so far. To be fair, companies like Humane and Rabbit aren&apos;t entirely wrong. There&apos;s so much less money to be made in an AI app than there is in a hardware product. However, as the launch of the Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1 have shown, rushing AI products to be "first" doesn&apos;t mean anything if they aren&apos;t actually any good.¬†</p><p>Nothing is saying out loud what many in the industry have been speculating for a while. When the dust settles, we won&apos;t be using AI apps or other hardware devices. The artificial intelligence will be incorporated right into your mobile operating system, whether that&apos;s stock Android, iOS, or a skin like Nothing OS. In a way, we&apos;ve already seen this concept in action with ChatGPT integration on Nothing devices.</p><p>The company is likely making the right move in trying to make AI the focus of its smartphones. "It‚Äôs great to see new companies rethinking the user experience and form factors," Pei wrote. "However, there is no doubt that smartphones will remain the main consumer AI form factor for the foreseeable future. With over 4 billion users and over 1 billion smartphones shipped every year‚Äîthe numbers speak for themselves."</p><p>The question is whether delaying Phone 3 to make AI features instead is the right move, and that remains to be seen.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N6ar7DdLJ7GdNFfCtgzLXY" name="Nothing-Phone-3-Teaser.jpg" alt="An example of an AI-based UX on Nothing Phone 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N6ar7DdLJ7GdNFfCtgzLXY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Carl Pei / Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing only showed off a proof-of-concept of what AI might look like in Nothing OS. It looks a lot like OpenAI&apos;s implementations of AI-based voice assistants. There is one white orb that becomes the UI for the initial AI voice assistant setup, just like the voice mode for ChatGPT. However, Nothing also takes notice of what Rabbit aimed to do with the R1 and its large action model concept.¬†</p><p>"The way we use our smartphones needs to be redefined. The current user experience hasn&apos;t evolved for more than a decade," said Pei. "The next era needs a highly personalized, dynamic, and cross-device interface. One that also creates a human connection that makes tech feel more at ease to interact with."</p><p>Eventually, Nothing wants to create a mobile OS experience that frees you from apps, but it notes that won&apos;t happen immediately.</p>
<h2 id="delaying-phone-3-might-be-proof-nothing-is-spread-too-thin-2">Delaying Phone 3 might be proof Nothing is spread too thin</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xDqritNrp2g3PCarh9HXVS" name="nothing-phone-2a-3.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xDqritNrp2g3PCarh9HXVS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ideally, Nothing could work on adding AI features to Nothing OS while also releasing Phone 3 on its usual annual schedule. Assuming that most of the company&apos;s planned AI features don&apos;t run on device, like its competitors, there&apos;s no reason they couldn&apos;t be shipped as a software update later. The delay could mean Nothing is trying to bring on-device AI processing to the Phone 3, or that it wants AI features to be the main reason you go out and buy Phone 3. Either way, it seems weird that Phone 3 appears to be delayed while Nothing devotes its time to AI software and budget CMF products instead.</p>
