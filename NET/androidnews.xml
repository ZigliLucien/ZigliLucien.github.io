<ul><li>T-Mobile announced Wednesday that it had completed its purchase of Ka’ena Corporation, which owns Mint Mobile, Ultra Mobile, and Plum. </li><li>The company made a commitment to keep Mint Mobile's entry-level plan priced at $15. </li><li>Mint and Ultra Mobile users will also get access to select T-Mobile features, like scam screening and free Canada roaming.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As of today, T-Mobile officially owns and operates Mint Mobile, the company announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/t-mobile-closes-acquisition-mint-and-ultra-mobile" target="_blank">press release</a> Wednesday, May 1. T-Mobile closed a $1.35-billion deal to acquire Ka’ena Corporation that was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-mint-mobile-acquisition">originally announced in March 2023</a> but was held up due to regulatory concerns. Aside from Mint Mobile, the Ka’ena Corporation is also the parent company of Ultra Mobile and Plum, and all three brands will be folded under <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-t-mobile-everything-you-need-know">T-Mobile</a>. </p><p>T-Mobile finally got approval from the Federal Communications Commission to move forward with the deal last week and swiftly completed the acquisition, which was more than a year in the making. Concerns that Mint Mobile&apos;s budget-friendly offerings might be changed by joining T-Mobile appear to have been settled since T-Mobile is pledging to keep a $15 per month Mint Mobile plan available.</p><p>"We are excited to maintain the unique style and entrepreneurial spirit that make Mint and Ultra truly special, while also finding ways to supercharge their growth and leverage some of the secrets of that success into other areas of our business," said Mike Katz, who is T-Mobile&apos;s president of marketing, strategy, and products.</p><p>While the price of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a>&apos;s $15 plan isn&apos;t changing, it is gaining new features from T-Mobile. Mint Mobile users will now get access to the company&apos;s call screening technology, which identifies calls associated with known scammers with a "Scam Likely" caller ID. Additionally, Mint Mobile customers can use unlimited talk, text, and up to 3GB of data while in Canada for free. </p>

<p>Ultra Mobile users will soon get an "enhanced data roaming option" while in Mexico on most plans, too. T-Mobile says that it will keep looking for more ways to add features to Mint Mobile and Ultra Mobile plans over time.</p><p>A few prominent Mint Mobile figures will be joining T-Mobile, including celebrity and former partial Mint Mobile owner Ryan Reynolds. The company says Mint founders David Glickman and Rizwan Kassim will join T-Mobile, leading their respective teams previously under Ka’ena Corporation. </p><p>For T-Mobile, closing this deal marks the company&apos;s biggest acquisition since it bought Sprint in 2020.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Qualcomm announced its FY Q2 2024 financial earnings.</li><li>The company's revenues were slightly up year over year, while net income was up by 37%.</li><li>Qualcomm has been expanding its presence in the PC market while readying new smartphone chips with its new Oryon cores.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm started off the month by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4a01bea9588542baeb69985a30cfbe82/qualcomm/db/773/7396/file/FY2024+2nd+Quarter+Earnings+Release.pdf">posting</a> its fiscal year Q2 2024 financial earnings on Wednesday. While revenue was relatively flat, the company reported $9.39 billion in revenue for the quarter, an increase of 1% over the same quarter in 2023.</p><p>Qualcomm&apos;s headset business, which makes up most of its overall revenue, also saw a 1% increase during the quarter, reaching $8.03 billion. While this may not seem like a large gain, it signals healthy growth in the smartphone industry after a bit of a slump just a year ago. By comparison, Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-fy-q2-2023-earnings">FY Q2 2023 earnings</a> revealed a 17% drop in headset and overall revenue, so the recent numbers are encouraging.</p><p>"We are excited about our continued growth and diversification, including achieving our third consecutive quarter of record QCT Automotive revenues, upcoming launches with our Snapdragon X platforms, and enabling leading on-device AI capabilities across multiple product categories," says Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon in a statement.</p>

<p>During the quarter, Samsung launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>, which is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s latest chipset. While Qualcomm no longer has global share with Samsung&apos;s flagships, Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala also highlighted the company&apos;s strong presence in the Chinese market, which includes new devices from companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">OPPO</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi</a>.</p><p>"We saw year over year handset revenues from our Chinese OEM increased by greater than 40% in the first half of fiscal &apos;24, reflecting our strong competitive positioning and recovery of demand," Palkhiwala said during the earnings call.</p><p>Amon adds that Qualcomm has "not seen signs of weakness in the Android premium market in China, especially with our OEMs, so a lot of strength really coming from premium devices from Xiaomi or OPPO, OnePlus, Vivo."</p><p>Qualcomm also notes that while its FY Q3 expects to see seasonal dips given the lack of major hardware launches, it looks forward to the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> later this year, which will feature the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">new Oryon CPU cores</a>. Qualcomm is also looking to the launch of new AI PCs powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/what-is-snapdragon-x-elite">Snapdragon X Elite chip</a>, which promises to compete with the likes of Apple&apos;s M-series chips.</p><p>As with the current batch of phone chipsets, Qualcomm is betting big on AI, which it expects will enable more use cases in various devices, be they phones, PCs, or cars. The company highlights its AI hub for developers to help drive this adoption.</p><p>"I want to step back and say, in general, I think AI is going to benefit all the devices," Amon says. "I think AI, when extends to running on-device—besides the benefit of working alongside the cloud—they have completely new use cases privacy, security, latency cost, personalization, etc."</p><p>"It&apos;s an exciting tailwind, I think, for our strategy of actually driving computing and connectivity at the edge."</p>

It&apos;s so easy to fill up your Android phone with junk files, but the good news is that there are easy things you can do to regain that space. </p><p>The steps are similar whether you&apos;re trying to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-free-space-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">free up storage space</a> on one of the best Android phones or not. In the following guide, you&apos;ll see integrated options and a Google app you can use to help you free up that much-needed storage space.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-check-the-available-storage-on-android"><span>How to check the available storage on Android</span></h3>
<p>First things first, we should check how much space is left on your phone. It&apos;s a good idea to go through and clean stuff up every now and then, regardless of how much space you have, but if you still have a lot of room to go, there&apos;s no sense in going overboard.</p><p>1. Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Storage</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.11%;"><img id="VVU76bCRsB9KCSUfXpwhFh" name="Free-up-storage-space-Android.jpg" alt="Android setting that show storage option" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VVU76bCRsB9KCSUfXpwhFh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2160" height="2400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Judy Sanhz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the very top of the page, you&apos;ll see how many gigabytes of storage you&apos;ve used, along with a percentage to help put things in perspective. Although devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> offer 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB of storage out of the box, you can fill that up astonishingly quickly with junk files if you&apos;re not careful.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-uninstall-unused-apps"><span>How to uninstall unused apps</span></h3>
<p>Unused apps on your Android device take up a lot of storage space. The steps to uninstall an app might differ depending on your phone, but they are not too different.</p><p>With a phone running stock Android, like the Motorola G14, you can long-press and drag the app icon to the top toward the Uninstall option.</p><p>Meanwhile, long-pressing on a Galaxy phone will give you the uninstall option but won&apos;t show it when you drag the app icon to the top. It&apos;s not the quickest way, but you can also go to the Google Play Store > search for the app > tap the uninstall button.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Clearing an app&apos;s data resets it to factory default settings, erasing all personal data and settings.</p><p>To erase app data, you&apos;ll need to do this one app at a time.</p><p>1.

<hr>
<p>Google is in the middle of a wave of layoffs at the office as the company is reportedly letting people go from its "Core" teams.</p><p>The report about Google&apos;s layoffs comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/google-cuts-hundreds-of-core-workers-moves-jobs-to-india-mexico.html">CNBC</a>, who state the company has laid off nearly 200 employees from its "Core" teams. Google confirmed the layoffs, with a spokesperson adding that those affected can reapply for other roles within the company.</p><p>The "Core" teams are responsible for the "technical foundation" behind many of Google&apos;s products and services for security and online safety. The company has also reportedly started a "reorganization" that moves roles to India and Mexico. This was a future Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/23/google-search-boss-raghavan-warns-employees-of-new-operating-reality.html">told employees in March</a> as it hoped to "move closer" to other markets, including Brazil.</p><p>Documents obtained by the publication suggest that Google&apos;s vice president of its Developer Ecosystem, Asim Husain informed employees in their team of the impending layoffs. During a town hall meeting, Husain informed staff that "this was the biggest planned reduction" for the team in 2024.</p><p>Husain said, "announcements of this sort may leave many of you feeling uncertain or frustrated" and added that the cuts "are in service of our broader goals" at the company. AI has continuously been a top priority for Google, with Husain informing employees that they are at an "inflection point."</p><p>Google&apos;s Core teams are said to be affected by layoffs in its governance and protected data group, which works directly with the company&apos;s regulatory side. The group&apos;s vice president, Evan Kotsovinos, informed team members about the cuts, stating there is a strong focus on "moving faster."</p><p>This is reportedly due to an "escalating regulatory focus" on Google.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google for a statement regarding the recent layoffs, but they did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<p>These cuts come at an interesting time, as Alphabet stated in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/alphabet-q1-2024-earnings">Q1 earnings report</a> that it obtained $80.5 billion in revenue with "strong performance" across services. Per its CEO Sundar Pichai, areas like Search, YouTube, and Cloud were stated to have done well in the first quarter. AI was weaved throughout everything Alphabeta talked about as Google&apos;s race to inject more of Gemini throughout its ecosystem.</p><p>Additionally, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-hardware-team-restructuring-merge">announced its reorganization</a> in mid-April, stating that it had merged its hardware teams with its software side. The idea was to bring teams closer together in the same space to quickly create products and services for consumers.</p><p>Moreover, Pichai stated the move will create a "deep AI experience" across all of Google&apos;s devices and platforms.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/alphabet-googles-parent-company-is-going-to-cut-about-12000-jobs">Alphabet cut 12,000 jobs</a>, around 6% of its workforce, early in 2023. The decision was made as Google&apos;s parent company sought to "tighten its belt" and move into a more "efficient" era of spending.</p>

<hr>
<p>Mobvoi is back to shake up the week in wearables with an announcement of an announcement. In a teaser posted to X (formerly Twitter) early Wednesday, the company says, "The future arrives in days," hinting at a new smartwatch reveal. The post doesn&apos;t reveal much, but it includes an outline of a smartwatch that closely resembles the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a>. As such, we could be seeing a successor debut soon or at least a new variant of the current model.</p><p>Yearly smartwatch releases are becoming the norm, with Google and Samsung finding a rhythm with an annual update schedule. Mobvoi released the TicWatch Pro 5 at the end of May 2023, so we&apos;re due for an upgrade if the company is eyeing an annual upgrade. This, plus the teaser&apos;s graphic, seems to suggest that a TicWatch Pro 6 reveal could be just days away. </p>

<p>While casual smartwatch buyers might not recognize Mobvoi or TicWatch as a household name, it&apos;s clear that the TicWatch Pro 5 is a seriously impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a>. Aside from true multi-day battery life, the watch features a clever dual-screen design. Additionally, it is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s best smartwatch chip, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen1 platform</a>, which also powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>.</p><p>The issue that Mobvoi hasn&apos;t been able to solve to date is software support. The TicWatch Pro 5 still doesn&apos;t have official Wear OS 4 support, even as we&apos;re looking ahead to Wear OS 5. TicWatch Pro 5 users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-4-beta-recruitment-opens">beta test Wear OS 4 soon</a> — but they have to complete a questionnaire and agree to an NDA. If hardware is the limiting factor here, a new TicWatch Pro 6 could debut with Wear OS 4 and might even include a path to Wear OS 5 when it releases. </p><p>Speaking of Wear OS 5, the operating system upgrade is slated to be released this summer, as Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">basically confirmed in its I/O 2024 event schedule</a>. More recently, there have been signs that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wear-os-5-software-testing-spotted">Samsung is testing Wear OS 5</a> right now. </p>

<p>Still, this is all mostly guesswork at the moment.

<hr>
<p>It seems that Samsung has started developing its Wear OS 5 software for its line of eligible smartwatches.</p><p>The supposed test firmware was spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MatthewReiter05/status/1784930167539814554">Matthew Reiter on X</a>, which could indicate Samsung&apos;s beginning of Wear OS 5 software testing (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-6-wear-os-5-update-development/">SamMobile</a>). The software, bearing version number <strong>R965USQU1BXD8</strong>,<strong> </strong>was spotted in development for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> series several days ago.</p><p>Moreover, the software seemingly only pertains to the carrier-locked version of the smartwatch in the U.S.</p><p>While more in-depth information about the software is still unknown, Google is slated to talk about the update during I/O 2024.</p>

<p>Google is preparing for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">annual I/O event</a>, which is slated for May 14 this year. We&apos;re expecting a few reveals and insights from the company, one of which will be Wear OS 5, as the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">revealed its preliminary schedule</a> for developer sessions last month. The session is said to contain an early look at the software as its description reads, "Building for the future of Wear OS."</p><p>This is good news for wearables, as it seems Google is getting on top of a yearly release cadence for the major Wear OS software updates.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s apparent development of its Wear OS 5 (likely One UI 6 Watch) skin potentially appearing now makes sense. Last year, the company originally planned to begin its beta for Wear OS 4 in May <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/one-ui-watch-5-beta-officially-delayed">but faced a delay</a>. Testing didn&apos;t <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/one-ui-5-watch-beta-available-now">start until June</a>, so there&apos;s a chance Samsung isn&apos;t looking to repeat last year&apos;s unsightly problems.</p><p>More importantly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-google-reportedly-testing-wear-os-5">rumors have suggested</a> that the software could debut in time for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> series, likely later this summer. There were multiple sightings of an "unreleased Android 14 build" that could indicate the upcoming Wear OS software. Additionally, Samsung is likely jumping to a headstart to ensure that the new watch, powered by the Exynos 5535, can support the firmware properly.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 6 continues a trend that Samsung has become known for with its wearables. The device boasts a slight performance boost over last year's but features a larger and brighter display.

<p>When I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a>, I found that it truly does it all. With a generous number of features, unbelievable battery life, and tons of fitness tracking perks, it&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> going — and why it&apos;s still a daily watch for me. </p><p>What you&apos;ll probably notice first, though, is the uniquely brilliant display. The TicWatch Pro 5 uses layered display technology, which helps extend the battery life even further. For example, Daily Mode allows you to use all of your watch&apos;s features, but you&apos;ll need to charge it every night. There&apos;s also Extended Mode, which allows you to use essential features and will only require a charge every couple of days or so.</p><p>When it comes to features and tracking, there&apos;s a lot to unpack. For starters, you&apos;ll love having voice-activated Google Assistant, mobile payments with Google Pay, built-in GPS, heart-rate monitoring, activity/sleep tracking, smartphone notifications, and more. While the design is slimmer and more lightweight than previous Pro models, it still comes in a 50mm case. This might be too large for some wrists, so that&apos;s something to think about. The price tag isn&apos;t in the value category, but if you can swing it, this is one of the best TicWatch smartwatches out there.</p>

<p>Based on the price, I was hesitant about how much the Ticwatch E3 could offer. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mobvoi-ticwatch-e3-review">once I reviewed the watch</a>, I quickly realized that it was a fantastic wearable. This is especially true if you&apos;re a budget shopper who doesn&apos;t want to spend a fortune on a smartwatch. </p><p>You get the older Snapdragon Wear 4100 chipset which still delivers amazing performance, for starters. The lightweight design will look familiar as it loosely follows what we&apos;ve seen in previous TicWatch E models. You get a 1.3-inch HD display with a large bezel around the watch face. This model is compatible with 20mm interchangeable bands, and comes with IP68 water resistance that&apos;s suitable for pool swimming.</p><p>There&apos;s also a great selection of health/fitness features on the TicWatch E3. You&apos;ll have built-in GPS, activity/sleep tracking, heart-rate monitoring, blood oxygen tracking, and more. There&apos;s also a built-in mic and speaker for Google Assistant and NFC for Google Pay. You&apos;ll also have to accept the mediocre battery life, other than the love-it-or-hate-it bulky bezel. It&apos;ll typically last for two days on a single charge, but you can opt for Essential Mode. This will limit certain features to help extend battery life when necessary.</p>

<p>You won&apos;t find a better smartwatch for your outdoor lifestyle than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ticwatch-pro-3-ultra-gps-review">TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra</a>. Wherever you go, the Pro 3 Ultra can go too. During my review of the watch, I took it on camping trips, cutting down trees on my property, and through various workouts, and it kept going. When you combine this level of durability with unlimited tracking abilities, including proactive sport modes, swim monitoring and swim style detection, a built-in GPS, heart rate sensor, and sleep tracking, there&apos;s not a whole lot that the Pro 3 Ultra can&apos;t do.</p><p>The proactive sports modes allow you to keep going at your own pace without slowing down to mess with your watch. It&apos;s powered by TicMotion, which is Mobvoi&apos;s suite of proprietary AI algorithms. It proactively detects your motion, tracks your swim activities, and provides your fitness records without you having to press or do a thing. The dual-layer display will ensure you always have the important information visible and stretches the battery to up to 30 days in essential mode. Simply get going, and it will follow suit.</p>

<p>It&apos;s not much, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ticwatch-gth-review">TicWatch GTH</a> is the best entry-level TicWatch around. For starters, it costs roughly $25 at most retailers, which is an insanely cheap price for any wearable. The fitness tracker looks pretty neat and you also enjoy plenty of other perks such as heart-rate monitoring, activity tracking, SpO2 measurement, a skin temperature sensor, and more.</p><p>Although you don&apos;t enjoy fancy features such as NFC payments, the battery lasts up to 10 days which is super useful for a busybody. There&apos;s also sleep and stress tracking onboard, enabling you to get quite a bitof use out of the modest TicWatch GTH.</p>

<p>It&apos;s been over a decade since the first smart ring was introduced, giving people another option to track their health, but it wasn&apos;t until recently that the tech caught on. Now, there are quite a few different options on the market, but you may find yourself comparing two of the most popular ones at the moment: the Ultrahuman Ring Air and Oura Ring Gen 3.</p><p>You may have tried <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness trackers</a> or one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> to get the job done, but if you don&apos;t want a shiny display distracting you, then one of these smart rings might be the solution since it gives you the info your smartwatch does but without the diversion. So, how do these rings compare? Hopefully this will help you decide on your next wearable.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vMPRBuPqBEmv2StvX6UTHa" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-next-to-regular-ring.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air next to a typical ring to show its size, surrounded by other jewelry." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vMPRBuPqBEmv2StvX6UTHa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to wearables, one question that always comes up is how comfortable it will be. Ultrahuman&apos;s smart ring has a uniform and spartan design, and according to Micheal Hicks&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air review</a>, you don&apos;t feel like you&apos;re wearing a ring but something tech. The design is more functional than stylish, and at 2.5 millimeters thick and weighing just 3 grams, it&apos;s thinner and lighter than the Oura Ring Gen 3. </p><p>Overall, it has a sleek look, with a tiny sensor bump at the bottom that makes it more comfortable to wear. The ring is available in Raw Titanium, Aster Black, Bionic Gold, Matte Grey, and Space Silver. Regarding sizes, the Ultrahuman Ring Air goes from a size five to a size 14. You&apos;ll need to try the sizing kit ring and wear it for one day to get the right size, but to speed things up, you can try Ultrahuman&apos;s e-sizing system. The sizes may differ slightly from US ring sizes, and they don&apos;t offer half sizes.</p><p>The Oura Ring Gen 3 features three sensors or bumps that might feel uncomfortable to some but go largely unnoticed. It&apos;s available in a bevy of colors and styles, including matte black, Gold, Rose Gold, Silver, Titanium, and Dark Gray. The ring comes in two designs: the Heritage and the Horizon. The difference between the two is that the Heritage design has a little ridge on the top that is meant to face the dorsal side of your hand, while the Horizon design is fully circular and has a small dimple-type design meant to face the palmer side of your hand. Also, the Oura Ring Gen 3 is the heavier of the two models.</p><p>In sizes, the Oura ring one-ups the Ultrahuman since it&apos;s available in sizes six to 13, which is two fewer than the Ultrahuman. The Oura ring sizes may differ slightly from US ring sizes, and they also don&apos;t offer half sizes. You can also go to your nearest Best Buy and buy it there, which makes it easier, so you don&apos;t have to wait for a sizing kit to come in the mail.</p><p>The weight and dimensions are 2.55mm, weighing around four to six grams, depending on your ring size. Due to its larger size, using the Oura Ring Gen 3 for activities such as weightlifting may be uncomfortable, as mentioned in Derrek Lee&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3 review</a>. However, it still manages to squeeze in a discreet design and makes quite a statement.</p>
<h2 id="ultrahuman-ring-air-vs-oura-ring-gen-3-sensors-2">Ultrahuman Ring Air vs. Oura Ring Gen 3: Sensors</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3659px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZzZ9w48Ygxh6RbrNi64DRH" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-in-hand.jpg" alt="Oura Ring (Gen 3) in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZzZ9w48Ygxh6RbrNi64DRH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3659" height="2058" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One crucial factor when choosing a smart ring is the sensors. You might get one to track certain things, so specific sensors are necessary. For example, the Ultrahuman Ring Air has sensors such as Infrared PPG (Red, Green, and IR LEDs for HRM and SpO2), non-contact skin temperature, and 6-axis motion. It also uses optical sensors to monitor sleep and all their stages (i.e., REM or deep).</p><p>The Photoplethhysmogram (PPG) sensor will measure your heart rate and oxygen saturation. Still, in Michael Hick&apos;s review, he mentions how the Ultrahuman Ring Air never showed him oxygen levels under 99% or 100%. However, his smartwatch showed him that over the years, his average percentage would be between 96-98%. If this is essential for you, then this could be a reason not to get the smart ring. The smart ring does lack critical data such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 max</a> and respiratory rate. The Ultrahuman Ring is still getting beta features and making improvements in response to the criticism it gets. With temperature readings, the smart ring will give you a precise reading and measure while you&apos;re asleep and awake. </p><p>The Oura Ring also has sensors for heart rate, sleep, activities, morning readiness, and blood oxygen. But Oura has a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-resilience-metric-tracks-stress-recovery">Resilience</a> metric you won&apos;t find in its competitor. This metric lets the ring assess your resilience in stressful situations. It&apos;ll track your daytime, overnight, and stress recovery trends during the day.</p><p>Regarding reading your temperature, the Oura ring shows a relative change compared to your baseline. So, to get an accurate reading, you need to wear the ring for at least a few days, and it only measures while you&apos;re sleeping. You&apos;ll also notice that when using the app, the Oura Ring says it&apos;s showing you the body temperature, while the Ultrahuman Ring app will say Skin temperature. Both rings can be worn on any finger, but the company advises you to wear them on the index finger for a more accurate reading.</p>

<h2 id="ultrahuman-ring-air-vs-oura-ring-gen-3-activity-2">Ultrahuman Ring Air vs. Oura Ring Gen 3: Activity</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YfqvMSCCxKbLw7zSnUdfPb" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-showing-logo.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air held in fingertips to show the Ultrahuman logo engraved inside." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfqvMSCCxKbLw7zSnUdfPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both rings detect activity such as skin temperature, sleep, and heart rate. Each smart ring has an app that allows you to get the readings you need. With the Oura Ring Gen 3 app, you can specify your activities, such as a hike and 20-minute spinning class, while the Ultrahuman Ring Air will count two activities as one. The Oura Ring Gen 3 features automatic activity detection, such as dancing or gardening, while the Ultrahuman Ring Air comes in manual and is still in beta. The rings also lack irregular heart rhythm (AFib) detection.</p><p>On the Ultrahuman Ring Air, tap the Movement screen to view your movement information, such as active hours, minutes, and calories burned. The apps for the two smart rings focus on two different things. For example, the Oura&apos;s focal point is recovery and rest. The app makes information such as your readiness score, activity goal, and sleep score easy to read. You can see tips on the best time to sleep and bedtime tips. The app will have sections such as Sleep, Readiness, and Activity.</p><p>The Ultrahuman Ring Air focuses more on stimulants and sleep. It advises when and when not to drink caffeine-containing beverages like coffee. You&apos;ll also see important information about your range. Oura&apos;s app has a better design and is easier to read. The information is in a more logical order than the Ultrahuman app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3589px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="wGoKZDegpdeQkpNxAwUnFi" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-smartphone-app.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring (Gen 3) and the companion app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGoKZDegpdeQkpNxAwUnFi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3589" height="2019" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One big difference between the two rings is that Oura has a $6 subscription attached to it. It&apos;s not required, per se, but you will need it if you want more detailed information about your metrics beyond your sleep score. This can be a deterrent for some, although it&apos;s worth keeping in mind that Oura is constantly improving its ring with new features.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ultrahuman does not require a subscription to view your data.</p>
<h2 id="ultrahuman-ring-air-vs-oura-ring-gen-3-price-and-availability-2">Ultrahuman Ring Air vs. Oura Ring Gen 3: Price and availability</h2>
<p>Both the Oura Ring Gen 3 and the Ultrahuman Ring Air are available to purchase now. The Oura smart ring is priced at $349 for the Horizon design and $299 for the Heritage version. The Ultrahuman Ring Air is priced at $349.</p><p>Both rings are eligible to be purchased through your FSA or HSA, which can make them easier to buy for some.</p><p>You can buy both rings from their respective websites or Amazon, while the Oura Ring is also available at Best Buy stores in the United States.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3718px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="u2spFUWezzbN2fh3YLtEwE" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-phone-app-1.jpg" alt="Oura Ring (Gen 3) on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u2spFUWezzbN2fh3YLtEwE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3718" height="2091" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oura is a well-established brand that has been in the game for a long time. The app is also easier to understand and navigate, but after your free trial, you have to pay $5.99 a month. Oura&apos;s longer existence might incline people to try it despite the monthly subscription.</p><p>If you don&apos;t want to pay a monthly subscription, you&apos;ll be tempted to go with the Ultrahuman Ring Air. It&apos;s lighter, and its readings provide a lot of information. It&apos;s new to the smart ring area, and it&apos;s a brand that not many may have heard of, which may deter some. It still has things to learn from Oura, but it&apos;s still a very capable smart ring that will get better over time.</p>

<hr>
<p>Fitbit is starting to send emails to users utilizing its Pay app that the program will soon disappear on July 29 as its Google ecosystem integration continues.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2024/04/30/fitbit-pay-to-google-wallet-end-date-to-switch-nears-impacted-device-list/">DroidLife</a>, the company&apos;s email states that it is updating its contactless payment feature "from Fitbit Pay to Google Wallet." The notice adds that users are likely to benefit from the change as the number of available banks and cards increases, thanks to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet"> Google Wallet</a>&apos;s support.</p><p>The email adds that users have until July 29 before Fitbit Pay officially becomes Google Wallet on its devices. With that, users will retain the ability to utilize their cards until the app disappears on the previously given date. The option to <em>add </em>new cards will no longer be available at this time.</p><p>This decision will impact a wide range of Fitbit&apos;s devices, and those watches/trackers are as follows:</p>

<p>Fitbit advised users to begin switching to Wallet and taking their cards with them. As the publication notes, Google&apos;s digital wallet started rolling out in the Fitbit app through version 4.14.1 and later. The company&apos;s email states users can initiate the switch by tapping the "devices" icon in the app and then tapping the "Wallet" icon.</p><p>Fitbit started picking up Google Wallet support in 2022 when it launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Versa 4</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Sense 2</a> smartwatches. Since then, the company has continued to forgo its own Pay app in favor of Google&apos;s, as we&apos;ve seen with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-vs-fitbit-charge-6-disneyland-test">Charge 6</a> tracker. Wallet has continued to gain support for even more banks and their cards, and the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-wallet-push-continues-as-30-new-banks-are-added-in-the-us">added support for 30 more</a> in March.</p><p>The app now supports over 5,000 banks and bank cards, following approximately a hundred additional ones from December and January.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google has continued to move Fitbit more and more into its aura. Last week, Fitbit&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-redirects-fitbit-store-purchases">standalone store was shut down</a>, and now, it directs consumers to the Google Store instead. The company will likely continue producing devices, but its software is truly what Google is after, as we&apos;ve seen with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch</a>. It&apos;s a move that reminds us of when Apple acquired Beats, which was also for its audio software.</p>

It&apos;s important to know which apps work with it in order to keep ears open and eyes on the road without unnecessary technical distractions. The overall number continues to grow but these are the best apps to help you enjoy every ride in the driver&apos;s seat.</p>

<p>While Waze is an option, Google Maps is arguably the most widely used app in Android Auto. It handles turn-by-turn directions well when getting to a destination, but is also equally great at routing requests by voice via Google Assistant. You can also search and set up your route on your phone in advance before connecting in the car, where Android Auto then takes over.</p>

<p>Spotify has a massive library of songs, and is available to use free (with ads and restrictions) or as a Premium subscriber for unfettered access and offline playback. It works really well with Google Assistant, right down to the track or playlist you want, and offers a user-friendly interface to boot. It will also seamlessly pick up where you left off listening to when connecting to your car.</p>

<p>It's a little easier to keep up with any active chat on WhatsApp when speech-to-text actually works, which it does. You can respond to incoming messages and send them out as well. Group chats might be a little harder to initiate with a message, but at least you can respond when someone else chimes in. Use it to make calls to other users, which is great if you want to avoid long distance charges.</p>

<p>Where Google Maps can be good for longer trips, Waze excels at avoiding the worst of traffic and gridlock. The crowdsourced system essentially lets drivers help each other by reporting hazards or problems that pop up on the map. The map is also dynamic, allowing it to reroute you to get around with fewer obstacles. Plus, it also works with Google Assistant when you request a destination.</p>

<p>Pandora has been around for a long while now, and its original claim to fame remains its bread and butter.

<p>If you're a self-respecting audiophile driving around with a nice car audio system, Tidal's lossless HiFi subscription service might be the option for you. Streaming it will take up considerably more cellular data, so you may want to offload some of your favorites to the phone, but the sonic boost should be evident with good speakers. The library is large, and you can try it for 30 days.</p>

<p>If you want to tap into the vast reservoir of music YouTube has to offer, a Music subscription gives it all to you in the car, too. That means you can listen to millions of standard tracks, as well as all the live performances and remixes the platform has been home to for years. Create playlists that mix things up, or listen to a long DJ set on a road trip.</p>

<p>SMS messaging isn't for everyone, but cross-platform communication still needs it, and this is one of the best on Android Auto. That's on top of how it already works on various platforms, like iOS, MacOS, Windows, Wear OS, Android TV, Linux and more. Receiving and sending messages is straightforward, even by voice, letting you keep in touch with ease.</p>

<p>Still have a library of songs you downloaded years ago on a computer or hard drive? You can save some on your phone and listen to them through Plex, or set up a media server on your computer to stream from the entire library, no matter where you're driving. Plex also offers baked-in access to Tidal's library through a subscription, as well as a long list of free podcasts.</p>

<p>TuneIn is Internet radio covering the furthest reaches of the globe. If there's a radio station somewhere, you can probably find it here within the 100,000 available, letting you listen to a station in another city or country while cruising or commuting. Doing that won't cost a dime, whereas live sports, ad-free listening and commercial-free music stations will cost you.</p>

<p>Android Auto has expanded a lot in the last few years with more apps <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">supporting the platform</a>. Not to mention <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-auto-accessories">dongles and adapters</a> to help you go wireless with it. Google Maps stands out for how useful it is to use, no matter where you&apos;re driving. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-waze-android-auto">Waze</a> is great, too, giving you some excellent redundancy when it comes to mapping.</p><p> The same goes for music, where the options are so varied, the whole collection above could be made up of music apps. Spotify is great for both its library and excellent integration with Google Assistant. Do a search for Android Auto music apps, be it streaming or playing local files, and you will see several to browse through.</p><p>The same goes for messaging, podcasts and radio — the things you would want to do most in the car. No matter what collection of apps you go with, the odds are good you&apos;ll find something that works for you.</p>
