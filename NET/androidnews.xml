<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a> formerly ranked as one of the best Android phones on the market, and two years on, it still holds up as a stellar option for most people, with Tensor processing power and some truly next-level camera software.

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="why-should-i-buy-a-refurbished-phone-2">Why should I buy a refurbished phone?</h2>
<p>There are two big reasons why you should consider buying a refurbished smartphone: <em>sustainability </em>and <em>value</em>. </p><p>Regardless of what mainstream smartphone manufacturers claim, the only truly sustainable smartphone is a refurbished (or used) one. Companies may reduce their footprint by incorporating recycled materials into their devices or by offsetting their energy use, but this is merely harm reduction, not true sustainability. Raw materials are still being mined to go into these new phones, and a large number of emissions are still being generated through the manufacturing and distribution process. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-refurbished-phones">Refurbished phones</a>, on the other hand, extend the life of existing devices and, in most cases, provide the user with a nearly indistinguishable experience. And since refurbished smartphones are considerably cheaper than new devices, it&apos;s a good chance for the budget-conscious consumer to experience some of the best Android technology without breaking the bank. </p><p>For example, the innovative Galaxy S23 Ultra hit store shelves in February 2023 with a steep $1,199.99 price tag. Fast-forward a year later and you can get the still-excellent device refurbished at a $320 discount, no trade-in required. Simply put, instead of ordering a new phone every single year, buying your next device refurbished might be a great way to help your bank account and the planet in one fell swoop.  </p>

<p>Generally speaking, "renewed" and "refurbished" are marketing terms used by merchants to describe the identical process of inspecting and repairing a used device to meet like-new standards. </p><p>No matter which term the retailer uses, it&apos;s important to do your research and read reviews to make sure that the company is participating in proper refurbishment protocols. You should also double check that the refurbished phone comes with a warranty before finalizing your purchase. </p>

<p>Lynn writes:</p><p><em><strong>I&apos;m being inundated with spam email. I signed up for FairEmail in the hope it would unsubscribe me but that resulted in receiving even more spam. It&apos;s mostly dating crap with no unsubscribe at the bottom. What should I do?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Lynn, and everyone else who has written to me with the same problem. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gmail-spammers-are-winning-the-war-on-your-inbox">Spam in your inbox</a> sucks, I know it does because it happens to me, too!</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure it happens to everyone, and that makes it both a significant problem and a clue that it must be working for the spammers who love to send it out. Nobody would bother if people weren&apos;t clicking on it.</p>
<p>Clicking it is something you should never do, even though everyone does it from time to time, because the subject line tricks us into thinking it&apos;s not spam. These guys and gals are good sometimes.</p><p>Two reasons why you shouldn&apos;t click it? It&apos;s almost always someone trying to steal money. If that&apos;s not enough of a reason, clicking them will tell your mail provider to show you more like it instead of shipping it off to the spam folder.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PAdAkSQQjLHtyczY2d6w2M" name="Gmail-spam.JPG" alt="Gmail spam folder on desktop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PAdAkSQQjLHtyczY2d6w2M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is something all online email providers do — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-improves-gmail-spam-detection">filter your incoming mail to try and weed out the spam</a>. Your IT department probably does the same if you use email for work. Some third-party services will filter your mail, too, if you feel like you need even more help. If you want to use one, check the reviews and make sure it&apos;s trustworthy before you give it access to your inbox.</p><p>The best two tools to fight spam in Gmail are right in the app, though: marking a message as spam and building a filter.</p>
<p>Anytime you see spam that didn&apos;t automatically get sent to the spam folder, you should mark it as spam in Gmail (or your specific email provider). This will send the message out of your inbox and tell Google that you think it is spam. When enough users say messages from a particular sender are spam, the servers will learn to filter them out automatically.</p><p>You rarely need to look in your spam folder. Messages stored there don&apos;t count against your mail storage space, and they are automatically purged after a certain amount of time. The only time you should have to interact with the mess in the spam folder is when a message you&apos;re looking for doesn&apos;t show up; it could have accidentally been filtered out.</p>
<p>A note about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/unsubscribing-from-mailing-lists-in-gmail-for-android-just-got-a-lot-easier">unsubscribing</a> — only use this feature when it&apos;s not spam! An example would be signing up for a newsletter from an online store, then seeing the company send you email after email and making you wish you hadn&apos;t done it.</p><p>For "regular" spam, you&apos;re probably not subscribed to anything. Your mail program just gets confused when it sees a list of recipients because it <em>looks</em> like a subscription email. Since opening a spam message tells your email program you read it, I don&apos;t bother most of the time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:863px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.69%;"><img id="gskauaqe8soysnRCE6T2AX" name="gmail-filter.png" alt="Gmail filter settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gskauaqe8soysnRCE6T2AX.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="863" height="541" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of filters, they are a heckuva powerful tool for fighting spam and sorting your email any way you like. They aren&apos;t difficult to create, but it can be confusing the first time you dig into it all. The best resource I&apos;ve found to explain the process <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en">comes straight from Google</a>.</p><p>What you can do is build a filter that deletes any mail from a sender or an entire domain. It will skip the inbox, it won&apos;t be marked as read, and it won&apos;t get downloaded to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a>. Be sure to build the filter so it <em>deletes</em> the message, not archives it.</p>
<p>We&apos;ll never be able to stop spam. We can use the tools at our disposal to kill as much of it as we can, though.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has been spotted rolling out a new UI change to its bottom toolbar in Meet for desktop users.</p><p>The bottom row of available options and features in Google Meet now features an up arrow beside the microphone and camera buttons. As Android Central&apos;s Nick Sutrich spotted, clicking the arrow produces a small, pill-shaped floating UI right above the toolbar.</p><p>For microphones, this menu shows which device manages your voice while the other is for audio. Users can click on each of the shown devices to open a submenu full of all available hardware that can get the job done. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-10-google-meet-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Meet</a> displays the default microphone/audio source of your desktop computer or laptop. Beneath, users will find auxiliary devices like headphones.</p><p>There is also an option to test the device if something isn&apos;t working properly. Clicking on the camera option will reveal a menu that mirrors the microphone&apos;s selection.</p><p>Google popped in a small cogwheel for additional settings when opening the floating UI action bar. Opening this brings users to Meet&apos;s general settings page. The company hasn&apos;t brought any changes to this, aside from users finding a more convenient spot to access it.</p><p>Users can still open the app&apos;s settings by clicking on the three-dot menu at the end of the toolbar near "end call."</p>

<p>Users on desktop using Google Meet should begin seeing its subtle UI changes in the bottom toolbar. Additional internal tests show that the UI is appearing on more desktops and laptops, signaling its widespread reach.</p><p>Google has been slowly updating Meet since 2024 began, with features like video effects and portrait touch-up. The former, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-combining-backgrounds-and-filters">launched in January</a>, delivered goofy backgrounds, filters, and appearance adjustments to Meet. The Workspace app also gained some AI assistance, courtesy of Duet AI, for its Studio lighting and sound on desktop.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-web-gains-portrait-touch-up">Portrait touch-up</a> rolled out in March, bringing with it two modes: subtle and smoothing. Google stated the features were designed to make users feel "comfortable and confident" when using a webcam in Meet. There were other appearance-based features like under-eye lightning and eye whitening, as well.</p>

<ul><li>A hidden feature in the Meta Quest v64 update upgrades the headset's automatic room scanning feature.</li><li>Objects in the room will be automatically identified and named, like tables, screens, and couches.</li><li>The upgrade makes mixed reality experiences better and easier to use than ever before.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Mixed reality experiences on the Meta Quest 3 are about to get a lot better thanks to an upgraded room scanning feature that can automatically identify and name objects in your room. Previously, objects like tables, couches, windows, and other objects in the room would need to be manually measured and mapped.</p><p>The update comes hidden inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-v64-update-improves-passthrough-casting-and-microphones">V64 firmware update</a> and was initially posted found by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Squashi9?t=MlAnLFoWud9VPA5Jx4b_5A&s=09">X (formerly Twitter) user Squashi</a> and posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1779243399897350223">by X user Luna</a>. Meta didn&apos;t document the feature but had posted about it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-aria-automatic-room-mapping">in late March</a>, showcasing a research project it finalized that could automatically map objects in a room. No one expected the feature to be implemented so quickly after the initial announcement.</p><p>To try it out for yourself, open settings on your Meta Quest 3, tap Physical space, then launch the setup tool found under the spaces tab.</p>

<p>Meta announced enhanced passthrough quality as part of the V64 update but hasn&apos;t officially documented the new automated room scanning feature. I tried the room scanning feature on my Quest 3 and was blown away by the results.</p><p>Not only did it perfectly identify every supported object in my living room, but the names and categories of each object made them uniquely usable in mixed reality. For instance, my dining room table can automatically be used as a desk in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/facebook-launches-virtual-office-app-horizon-workrooms-oculus-quest-2">Horizon Workrooms</a>. Additionally, sitting on a couch can automatically launch seated mode to make casual gaming or video watching easier.</p><p>This is the latest move in Meta&apos;s strategy to make playing VR and mixed reality experiences as effortless as possible. The company just launched a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-horizon-worlds-instant-replay-feature">instant replay feature</a> in its social app, Horizon Worlds, which automatically captures great gameplay moments in supported worlds, eliminating the need for manual gameplay recording.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new set of rumors suggests Google is switching up its naming behavior for the Pixel 9 series, which may change its upcoming Fold.</p><p>Information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-name-3433990/">Android Authority</a> suggests Google will move away from the "Pixel Fold 2" title in favor of calling it the "Pixel 9 Pro Fold." An alleged Google insider was attributed to this rumor, which states the supposed device has retained its "comet" codename internally.</p><p>Moreover, it seems that Google had continued to refer to its next foldable as the "Pixel Fold 2" until "a relatively recent point." There&apos;s also a possibility that this new name won&apos;t stick around for launch, so we&apos;ll have to wait and see what happens.</p><p>This apparent name change for the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Fold</a> appears to be part of a bigger branding shift for Google. The publication states the upcoming series will see the following names: Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>" alongside the newly rumored Fold name change.</p><p>While not explained, rumors add that Google software for its 2024 devices seems to double down on these sudden name changes.</p>

<p>Curiously, Google&apos;s rumored change from the "Pixel Fold 2" to the "Pixel 9 Pro Fold" could mean the device will launch later this fall with the rest of the Pixel 9 series cast. The publication noted the same, speculating the company could treat its next foldable like a proper flagship phone.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review#section-google-pixel-fold-should-you-buy-it">our Pixel Fold review</a>, the original foldable shined as a device for those big-screen lovers. However, it fell off with its battery life, graphical performance, and UI. More importantly, the Pixel Fold featured the Tensor G2 instead of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3</a> that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8</a> series offered only a few months later in 2023.</p><p>A rumor from February stated the next Fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-fold-2-tensor-ram-rumors">could feature</a> Google&apos;s Tensor G4, which could (potentially) delay its launch. This past rumor and what we&apos;re hearing now sort of line up, with speculation pushing the foldable beside the Pixel 9 series for the fall of 2024. The Tensor G4 was rumored to use Samsung&apos;s 4nm process and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-likely-to-bring-satellite-connectivity-to-pixel-9-series">a new modem</a> but would only offer "minimal" improvements over the G3.</p><p>Additionally, the upcoming Fold could deliver 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.</p><p>We&apos;ll have to wait and see what Google&apos;s true plans are later this year. The company&apos;s usual I/O event is coming up in May, so if we don&apos;t see the Fold there, these rumors might hold water.</p>

The phone features a 5.8-inch external display and a 7.6-inch internal display, both of which sport welcome fluidity.

<hr>
<p>Today (Apr. 15), Instagram is rolling out a feature just in time for the next leg of Coachella in partnership with a popular K-pop group.</p><p>According to Instagram, as part of its collaboration with K-pop girl group LE SSERAFIM, the platform is rolling out "Frames" for Stories. The feature is stated to let users turn their photos into polaroids with a single tap. Photos saved to your camera roll can be given this new Story sticker.</p><p>Instagram adds that those wanting to see your photo will have to "shake their phone to reveal the content inside."</p><p>To get started, users can initiate Story creation on Instagram and then tap the "sticker" icon. Tapping the "Frames" sticker option will open your phone&apos;s gallery to select which image you&apos;d like to use. Instagram states that only one image can be framed at a time using the Polaroid Frame.</p><p>After deciding, users can throw in a caption. The company states this will automatically imprint the date and timestamp for when the photo was originally taken.</p><p>When using the Polaroid Frame, others will see a "shake to reveal" option at the bottom of your Story. This will "develop" the image (how a real-life Polaroid works), revealing the photo users want to share.</p>

<p>Instagram is rolling out "Frames" today (Apr. 15), so users can start utilizing it through Coachella&apos;s part two. The musical event will run once more from April 19 to April 21 at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California.</p><p>This is the second update to reach Instagram recently as, last week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-cutouts-notes-additions-detailed">the platform rolled out</a> "Cutouts" and teased more for Notes. The former was touted as a feature that lets users turn themselves into unique, usable stickers in Instagram Stories. Cutouts could also be used in Reels. However, users could grab their videos and turn them into animated stickers.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-cutouts-notes-additions-detailed">Notes</a> are getting a few upgrades, such as "Prompts" and more visibility in Instagram profiles. Prompts are an interable variant of Notes that lets others interact and respond with emojis, quick blurbs, and more.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Pixel 9 Tensor G4 may debut a new Samsung Modem 5400.</li><li>The modem will support 5G non-terrestrial networks (NTN), bringing satellite connectivity to the next Google flagships.</li><li>A new 5G tablet is reportedly in the works, along with the same SoC and modem.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Pixel 9 is Google&apos;s highly anticipated flagship series, which will likely be launched this fall. Ahead of the launch, the devices are tipped to bring satellite connectivity, which could help popularize the feature on Android after Apple launched it on the iPhone.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-sos-satellite-connectivity-3433498/">Android Authority</a>, which has gathered information from a Google insider, the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series will see some essential modem upgrades, likely bringing satellite connectivity to both flagship models.</p>
<p>The publication notes that the new modem will also make its way to the next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> and an unknown 5G tablet from the search giant — the details of which are yet to be determined. </p><p>While we already figure that the Tensor G4 will power the Pixel 9 series and the Pixel Fold 2, it will feature this new satellite-enabled modem dubbed Samsung Modem 5400. For now, apart from the moniker, very little is known about the new modem, and it is expected to be significantly faster and more power-efficient than the current iteration, the Samsung Modem 5300, which is seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3</a> chipset.</p><p>However, the new modem supports 3GPP Rel. 17, which translates to support for 5G non-terrestrial networks (NTN), bringing satellite connectivity. </p>

<p>The latest findings come in conjunction with an alternative satellite messaging service, which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-satellite-based-text-messaging-spotted">recently spotted</a> in Android 14 beta and is likely to be included in Android 15, which presumably debuts with the Pixel 9 series out of the box. We have also seen proof that Google Messages is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-pixel-feature-spotted">preparing to support satellite messaging</a>.</p><p>It is encouraging to see satellite connectivity possibly arriving on upcoming flagship Android phones after Apple debuted the feature on its latest iPhones. While satellite communication isn&apos;t likely the defining factor of the Pixel 9 series for users who want to buy them, it is still a welcome addition.</p><p>As for the unknown tablet from Google, Android Authority states that it is still in the early stages of development and is codenamed "clementine." It is believed to have the identical Tensor G4 next to the aforementioned new 5G modem. The launch timeline of the Android tablet also needs to be determined.</p>

I used Xiaomi&apos;s Pad 6 for the better part of a year, and its large 11-inch screen served as the ideal dashboard for monitoring smart home devices in my house.</p><p>So when Honor said it was launching a budget tablet with an even larger 12.1-inch screen, I was interested. The Pad 9 doesn&apos;t look like a budget tablet at a first glance; it has a metallic chassis and a thin profile that belies its price tag, and the IPS panel gets plenty bright.</p><p>The hardware isn&apos;t the best you&apos;ll find in this segment, but I didn&apos;t see any issues in daily use, and the Pad 9 is particularly well-suited as an entertainment device. So if you need a good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">budget Android tablet</a>, here&apos;s why the Pad 9 may just be the ideal option.</p>

It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HONOR-12-1-inch-Protection-Display-Speakers/dp/B0CST8ZHBC">selling for £249 ($311) in the U.K.</a> for the 8GB/256GB version, which is £50 less than its usual retail price.</p><p>The Pad 9 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Bluetooth-Keyboard-12-1-Inch-Extended-Snapdragon/dp/B0CY2QL1JR">available for ₹24,999 ($300) on Amazon India</a>, and you get the 8GB/256GB variant as standard. What makes the Pad 9 a particularly good choice in India is that it comes with the Bluetooth keyboard bundled with the package, which is an optional extra that costs £100 ($124) in the U.K.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-pad-9-what-i-like"><span>Honor Pad 9: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="okgKEc3W8qbbe8CNPcrqvF" name="honor-pad-9-12.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/okgKEc3W8qbbe8CNPcrqvF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor knew what it was doing with the design of the Pad 9, and the tablet&apos;s aluminum chassis gives it a premium look. The thin 7mm profile also makes a difference in this regard, and you don&apos;t get the feeling that you&apos;re using a budget tablet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KGuo2sAxX8YTubdE4JwcPE" name="honor-pad-9-5.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KGuo2sAxX8YTubdE4JwcPE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The metallic grey color option looks good, and while the tablet is on the heavier side at 555g — mostly down to the metallic chassis — it has good weight distribution, and it doesn&apos;t feel heavy. By contrast, my iPad Pro 12.9 is noticeably heavier at 682g. The back doesn&apos;t get smudged, and there&apos;s enough room to hold the tablet with ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FZ9H6Vew3yXBMbwjJxmRHF" name="honor-pad-9-9.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FZ9H6Vew3yXBMbwjJxmRHF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the Pad 9 has uniform bezels around the screen, with the camera located on the longer edge, ideally positioned when you need to make video calls. The screen is the star of the show here, and the 12.1-inch IPS LCD display has good color vibrancy. The panel has an anti-glare coating that makes it ideal for watching movies and TV shows, and I didn&apos;t notice any issues with brightness levels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rtMrvTaZrMPn69d6j6zheD" name="honor-pad-9-2.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rtMrvTaZrMPn69d6j6zheD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pad 9 has a resolution of 2560 x 1600, and again, that&apos;s decent enough in daily use. What I like the most about the panel is that it has 120Hz refresh rate; this gives the Pad 9 a distinct edge over the likes of Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Tab A9+. Colors and contrast levels are good in general, and there are no issues with the panel while streaming content or playing games.</p>

<p>Onboard sound is pretty good too, and that&apos;s down to the eight drivers located around the tablet. It is more than adequate if you&apos;re just streaming the occasional video on YouTube, but I&apos;d suggest using earbuds if you&apos;re watching a movie.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Zo6Nn3HJpteAzuC8Ny6vjG" name="honor-pad-9-17.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zo6Nn3HJpteAzuC8Ny6vjG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With Honor offering 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage as standard, there&apos;s more than enough memory for multitasking, and you&apos;re not likely to run out of storage. Honor did a good job optimizing the hardware, and the tablet has plenty of fluidity while navigating the interface and scrolling in Chrome — I didn&apos;t see any problems in this particular area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ty3qzcPCn4ZYmUThFu2eDE" name="honor-pad-9-4.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ty3qzcPCn4ZYmUThFu2eDE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a lot to like on the battery front as well, with the Pad 9 featuring a 8300mAh battery that lasts up to eight hours of use consisting of video playback and web browsing. Honor bundles a 35W charger in the box, and it takes the Pad 9 just under two hours to fully charge the battery. That&apos;s on par with the best Android tablets, and considering the battery life on offer, you won&apos;t need to plug it in before the end of the day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HHCtTfs7CpxicBx5MCzirE" name="honor-pad-9-7.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HHCtTfs7CpxicBx5MCzirE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Pad 9 is geared toward entertainment, it has a few productivity features that come in handy. Launching multi-window mode is about as easy as it gets, and you get the option to have three windows active on the screen at once. MagicOS needs a polish, but on the whole, there are customized software extras that make a difference in daily use.</p>

<p>Oh, and talking about productivity, Honor&apos;s bundled keyboard is terrific; it connects via Bluetooth, and the keys have good travel. It&apos;s not as good as the Magic Keyboard, but then again, it doesn&apos;t cost anywhere as much. The case that includes the keyboard has decent protection as well.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-pad-9-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Honor Pad 9: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gDCKQKqFDf3RF8M4MgncnF" name="honor-pad-9-11.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gDCKQKqFDf3RF8M4MgncnF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hardware is the clearest indicator that the Pad 9 is aimed at the budget segment. The tablet is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 6 Gen 1, and it doesn&apos;t have the requisite power to run demanding games. Sure, it is adequate for mundane tasks that include browsing the web and playing casual games, but it has its limitations when it comes to heavy workloads.</p>
<p>The tablet misses out on Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, a 3.5mm jack, and MicroSD slot. Of course, most phones don&apos;t have a 3.5mm jack or MicroSD slot either, but it&apos;s just easier to add these features into a tablet, where there&apos;s considerably more real estate. On that note, you don&apos;t get a fingerprint sensor either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="v63CPNkaj9MmymLbiK3sbF" name="honor-pad-9-10.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v63CPNkaj9MmymLbiK3sbF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the biggest issue is the software; as of April 2024, the Pad 9 still runs Magic OS 7.2 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a>, and that just isn&apos;t good enough. Most brands do a good job delivering timely updates to their phones, but tablets are still a distinct afterthought, and that needs to change.</p>
<p>On the subject of change, Honor says it will deliver just one platform update to the Pad 9 along with three years of security updates; that means the only update rolling out to the Pad 9 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, which it should have launched with.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-pad-9-the-competition"><span>Honor Pad 9: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HzdkqeGetZqioR3886tezH" name="honor-pad-9-24.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HzdkqeGetZqioR3886tezH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like Xiaomi&apos;s Pad 6, and it also has a large screen and a metallic chassis that&apos;s built to last. It is significantly faster in daily use, has a larger battery, and has better onboard audio. That said, coming in at £399, the Pad 6 is noticeably costlier than the Pad 9. The cost differential isn&apos;t as high in India — where the Pad 6 costs ₹26,999 — but you don&apos;t get a keyboard in the box.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-pad-9-should-you-buy-it"><span>Honor Pad 9: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gt7tr7Bmyf6c8uBog3ioUD" name="honor-pad-9-1.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gt7tr7Bmyf6c8uBog3ioUD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need an Android tablet to stream content</li><li>You want a large screen that gets bright</li><li>You want a tablet with great battery life</li><li>You need good onboard sound</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a tablet for gaming</li><li>You want biometric authentication</li><li>You want great onboard sound</li><li>You need long-term updates</li></ul>
<p>On the whole, the Pad 9 brings a lot to the table. You get a larger screen than most budget tablets, and the panel itself has good colors and adequate brightness levels. I understand why budget tablets use LCD panels in lieu of AMOLED, and to Honor&apos;s credit, the brand did a good job with the screen. The pixel density isn&apos;t the best you&apos;ll find, but it holds up incredibly well for streaming content.</p><p>The battery life is also among the best of any budget tablet, and you get a charger in the box. I like the productivity features in MagicOS, but the UI is in need of a fresh coat of paint, and Honor needs to do better with updates — the Pad 9 is still on Android 13 in Q2 2024. And the fact that it will only get one platform update will be a deal-breaker to many.</p><p>The hardware isn&apos;t designed for gaming either; the Pad 9 does a good job in casual titles, but it struggles in demanding games. That said, there are no issues with entertainment, and the tablet is one of the best around if you&apos;re interested in a budget option that lets you stream your Netflix library.</p><p>Ultimately, that&apos;s the biggest differentiator for the Pad 9. The tablet manages to deliver a better design, battery life, and larger screen than its rivals, and that makes it a decent choice in this category — in spite of the update situation — particularly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HONOR-12-1-inch-Protection-Display-Speakers/dp/B0CST8ZHBC">considering it costs £249</a>. </p>

<ul><li>Android users can manage their location-sharing settings in each app that supports them right now, but that might be changing soon. </li><li>A recent Google Play Services update revealed a new Google Location Sharing page in the settings app, which requires manual activation.</li><li>This menu will house all settings related to Google's location-sharing offerings, including six apps. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Location sharing is used in a handful of Google apps, but managing location permissions is currently done on a per-app basis. However, it looks like Google is preparing to add all these location-sharing settings to a new menu called <strong>Google Location Sharing</strong> in the settings app. Android leaker AssembleDebug revealed the unreleased page to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/13/google-location-sharing-revamp/" target="_blank">PiunikaWeb</a>, which became available for manual activation after the latest Google Play Services update.</p><p>Version <strong>24.15.14 </strong>of Google Play Services introduces the settings menu, which is behind the <strong>Location Services</strong> tab. For now, if a user navigates to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Location</strong> > <strong>Location Services</strong> > <strong>Google Location Sharing</strong>, they will only be able to follow a link to a webpage that manages these shares with approved people. Of course, this is after the page is activated. Presumably, there will eventually be toggles and options related to location shares directly on this page at some point. </p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-share-your-location-in-google-maps">location sharing</a>, Android users can let people they trust view their real-time location information. However, there are multiple apps where users can start sharing their location (or their device&apos;s location) with others. They include Google Maps, Personal Safety, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-google-find-my-device-network-works-why-you-should-care">Find My Device</a>. As such, if a user wants to rescind location-sharing permission, they&apos;ll need to remember which app was used to initiate the share.</p><p>The Google Location Sharing menu would eliminate this necessity. As the company explains in the blank settings page, Android users will be able to "manage any existing location shares regardless of which app they were created in."</p>

<p>AssembleDebug poked around in the Google Play Services update and found a list of six apps, encoded in base64, that are whitelisted to appear in the Google Location Sharing menu. The known apps are Google Maps, Find My Device and Personal Safety. However, there are reportedly six total apps that will be supported, and there&apos;s a good chance the Family Link app will be one of those. </p><p>Google is clearly testing this new menu, but we don&apos;t know when it&apos;ll be publicly released for Android users. It could be shipped through a future Google Play Services update or included in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. </p>

<ul><li>Approximately 576,000 Roku accounts were accessed through a credential stuffing attack, the company confirmed in an April 12 statement.</li><li>The latest attack comes a month after about 15,000 Roku accounts were breached through the same method of attack. </li><li>While the hackers couldn't access "sensitive user information or full credit card information," they successfully made purchases within Roku using fewer than 400 breached accounts. </li></ul>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/roku-tv-to-gain-new-enhancements-in-the-coming-months">Roku</a> suffered a limited security incident last month that left roughly 15,000 user accounts vulnerable, and now, another 576,000 have been impacted by a second attack. The company announced that over half a million accounts were fraudulently accessed through credential stuffing in an April 12 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roku.com/blog/protecting-your-roku-account" target="_blank">statement</a>. While hackers were unable to access sensitive information, they were able to make purchases using a very limited number of Roku accounts. </p><p>Credential stuffing is a method of attack in which hackers use previously leaked login credentials on popular sites. That&apos;s why cybersecurity experts warn against using the same password on two different websites. If the password to one account is leaked in a hack, bad actors can try to use that same username and password combination to log in to another. Roku says that since this was a credential-stuffing attack, it was not the source of the login credentials used to breach the 576,000 accounts.</p><p>"There is no indication that Roku was the source of the account credentials used in these attacks or that Roku’s systems were compromised in either incident," the company explained in the statement. "Rather, it is likely that login credentials used in these attacks were taken from another source, like another online account, where the affected users may have used the same credentials."</p><p>Roku says that the hackers did not access sensitive information or full credit card information. However, in less than 400 incidents, the bad actors were able to purchase Roku hardware or subscribe to streaming services. In those cases, Roku refunds the users or reverses the transactions. </p>

<p>Roku will notify customers directly if they&apos;ve been impacted by either account breach. Moving forward, the company will make two-factor authentication mandatory on all accounts to try to nix credential stuffing. After logging into Roku next, users will be prompted to verify their login with a link sent via email.</p><p>Since the company has 80 million active users, this breach is fairly small in the grand scheme of things. Still, if you have a Roku account, it&apos;s worth checking to see if you were affected. However, Roku automatically resets account passwords for affected users. Even if your account wasn&apos;t affected, be sure to practice good online security habits and use different passwords for each account you create. To make it less of a hassle, you can start using one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-password-managers-android">best password managers</a>.</p>
