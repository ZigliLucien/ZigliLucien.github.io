One such deal includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRZCMPMW" target="_blank"><strong>25% off the OnePlus Buds 3</strong></a>, bringing these cheap earbuds down to the lowest price they&apos;ve ever been.</p><p>To be sure, these OnePlus earbuds are one of our top picks for those who aren&apos;t looking to go with first-party Samsung or Google options, and for those who want the highest quality for the lowest possible price. They&apos;ve got the basics like ANC, mobile app customization, and a charging case that the company says will net you up to 44 hours of battery life.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-3-review">OnePlus Buds 3</a> are a great pair of value earbuds, offering casual users more than enough features to get buy.

<p>While they're affordable, you'll still get IP55 water and dust protection, audio features including ANC, and stem navigation gestures (though they can be a little wonky).<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRZCMPMW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7cdef627-44a1-41a2-aff2-35aa6327cc58" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$99.99" data-dimension48="$99.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

They come in either gray or blue, and they offer up to 44 hours of battery life with the charging case. Like many modern earbuds, they also make it easy to customize audio and use some of the personalization features with the mobile app. Plus, they include an IP55 water and dust resistance rating.</p><p>The main downside to the OnePlus Buds 3 is the absence of wireless charging, despite the fact that many earbuds at even lower price points include the feature. Still, if that isn&apos;t a dealbreaker for you, these are still a pretty solid product.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I have dozens of GaN chargers, and most of them have the same broad design: a wall plug, a square or rectangular chassis, and two or three USB ports. UGREEN decided that wasn&apos;t enough for its chargers, so the brand came out with a unique design that resembles a robot. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-rg-65w-review">reviewed the 65W Uno charger</a> when it debuted last year (it was called the Nexode RG back then), and it continues to be one of my favorite GaN chargers.</p><p>The design is clearly meant to grab attention, and you get dual USB-C ports alongside a USB-A port. There&apos;s also a tiny LED panel that changes based on how much power is going through a charging port. The Uno charger usually costs $49, but it is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0C6DX66TN">selling at just $32 for Prime Day</a>, so if you need a 65W GaN charger that looks quite different to anything else available today, you should buy this right now.</p><p>Need more power? There&apos;s also a 100W variant of the Uno charger, and that&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0D3XR6S47">down to $48 on Amazon</a>. The 100W Uno charger has three USB-C ports and a USB-A port, and the LED panel is much more detailed. Conversely, if you need a single charging port, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0BZHZ56M9">30W Uno charger is just $18</a> — making it a great portable choice.</p>

<p>UGREEN's 65W Uno charger is one of the best around — you get three charging ports, and the cute design is unlike anything else available today.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0C6DX66TN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5abdbb9a-ed7e-4ad6-9b87-ad6955814b63" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$32 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$32 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need a high-quality 65W GaN charger with two USB-C and a USB-A port. The Uno 65W is one of the smallest chargers around, and that design is unlike anything else on the market today.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need 65W charging on more than one USB-C port.</p>
<p>The 65W Uno charger ticks all the right boxes when it comes to charging potential. The main USB-C port goes up to 65W, with the second USB-C port able to hit 30W. The USB-A port goes up to 22.5W, and if you&apos;re charging two devices at once via USB-C, the power budget is split — 45W goes to the main port, and 20W to the secondary.</p><p>With all three ports in use, you get a total power budget of 60W — 45W on the main USB-C port, and 7.5W each for the other two ports. The ports combined with the charging ability makes the 65W Uno one of the best GaN chargers, and it is distinctly smaller than other 65W chargers I used.</p><p>Of course, a big part of the allure is the design; UGREEN styled the charger to look like a robot, and it just looks cute. The magnetic feet hide the charging prongs, and while the LED panel doesn&apos;t show real-time wattage, it cycles through emoji to indicate when a device is charged.</p><p>With the 65W <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0C6DX66TN">charger down to just $32</a>, now is the best time to pick up this adorable GaN charger if you need a reliable way to charge devices on the go. And if you need additional charging ports, the 100W Uno is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0D3XR6S47">terrific choice at $48</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The "Pixel Watch fully charged" notification was first launched with the Pixel Watch 2 last year to signal when the watch is ready to unplug.</li><li>Initially, not everyone received the notifications, but they're now reaching a broader audience.</li><li>A recent server-side update seems to have expanded access to the notifications, which serve as a helpful reminder to return the watch to the dock after charging.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>More Pixel Watch users are now getting handy notifications on their smartphones, letting them know when their watch is fully charged.</p><p>First <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-full-charge-phone-notification">introduced with the Pixel Watch 2 last year</a>, the “Fully charged” notifications are meant to let users know when their smartwatch is fully charged and ready to be unplugged.</p><p>Initially, though, not everyone got the Pixel Watch fully charged notification, but it’s now reaching more users. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1fylbix/fully_charged/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> user recently spotted the alert on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> when their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> hit full charge, showing the feature is rolling out to a wider audience (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/07/pixel-watch-fully-charged/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>A recent server-side update appears to have widened access to the notification for more users. While it doesn’t ask you to take your watch off the charger right away, it&apos;s a handy reminder to return your watch to the dock when it’s fully charged.</p><p>Multiple users are reporting that the &apos;Pixel Watch fully charged&apos; notification is showing up on their devices. Since the Pixel Watch works with a wide range of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, you don’t need a Pixel phone to get this alert.</p><p>Even with more users getting the feature notification lately, Google hasn’t made any official announcements about this feature yet.</p><p>Soon after the first sightings of the notification late last year, a few users said they’d been getting these alerts until early 2024, when the feature seemed to disappear for a while.</p><p>The Pixel Watch isn’t the first smartwatch lineup to have a fully charged notification. Apple has had a similar feature for Apple Watch users for years. With so many smartwatch users expecting this kind of alert, it’s a bit surprising that Google took its time to launch it, even if they did it under the radar.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Early adopters in the U.S. are starting to get access to Google Photos' "Ask Photos" feature, with reports that the rollout is already happening for some.</li><li>The AI search is currently limited to a select group of users but works across all versions of Google Photos since it’s server-side.</li><li>It replaces the current Search tab, but you still need to kick off searches through Ask Photos.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Photos is rolling out a Gemini-powered update that could totally take over how you remember your life’s moments.</p><p>In May, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-is-letting-you-chat-with-your-pictures-thanks-to-gemini">Google introduced "Ask Photos,"</a> a new feature in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> powered by Gemini AI. It lets you search for specific images just by asking in plain language, revamping how you browse your photo collection.</p><p>Now, it looks like early adopters are getting access to the feature now, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/05/google-ask-photos-ai-rolling-out/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> reporting that Ask Photos is already rolling out to a lucky few.</p><p>Right now, though, the AI-powered search feature is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">available to a limited group of U.S. users from the waitlist</a>. Apparently, it&apos;s rolled out on the server side, so it works regardless of the version of Google Photos you&apos;re using.</p><p>As the name hints, Ask Photos lets you use descriptive queries to find specific photos and videos in your collection, leading to more precise search results. Thanks to Google’s Gemini AI, this feature picks up on the context of images in your gallery, including details like people and food preferences.</p><p>Ask Photos essentially supplants the current Search tab in the app&apos;s bottom bar. Once you give Google access to the required data, this feature will work smoothly with Photos on all your devices. While the classic search option will still be available, you’ll need to kick things off with Ask Photos to use it.</p><p>Though it’s mainly built for questions about people, Ask Photos also serves as a handy travel buddy. It taps into your visual history to help remember important details like hotel names and license plates. For instance, it can pinpoint where you took those camping gear photos or even recognize dishes from your restaurant snaps.</p><p>Besides answering your questions, Google previously mentioned that Ask Photos can help with various tasks, like creating a quick recap of your latest vacation or picking the best family photos for a shared album.</p><p>Google Photos has come a long way from just being a simple photo organizer to becoming a smart AI-powered memory hub. With the launch of &apos;Ask Photos,&apos; the search features have taken a big leap forward. While this new feature is great for lots of users, some folks might find it a bit too nosy for their liking.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Judge James Donato <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-legal-setback-could-open-the-door-for-more-app-stores-on-android">has ruled</a> that Google will be forced to allow third-party app stores to be tied to Google Play as part of the remedy for its anticompetitive practices.</p><p>This is the "penalty" phase of the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/epic-games-vs-google-antitrust-witness-list">Epic v. Google trial</a> from 2020, where Google was found to be an illegal monopoly concerning how it regulates the Play Store and its policies towards developers.</p>
<p>There&apos;s a list of things Judge Donato has ordered Google to do regarding its billing requirements and payment policies, but the headline is, of course, about how Epic has cracked the Play Store open. </p><p>Some of what Google must change is great, including things it never should have done it in the first place. Some of what&apos;s in the order is unfair to Google (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220491/epic-google-android-app-store-monopoly-remedies-hearing">Donato has stated</a> he is willing to make Google financially suffer as a punishment), and some of it will never happen. As of right now, nobody knows which part is which. Google has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/">started the appeal process</a>, as expected.</p><p>Anyone who has any predictions is speculating. An appeals court could toss the whole thing. It probably won&apos;t, but like everyone else, I have some predictions of my own.</p>
<p>Everything in regard to how Google treats third-party payments is going to stay as ordered. And it should. It&apos;s unfair for Google to not allow a developer to tell you how you can close the Play Store, visit a website, make a purchase, and enter a code inside an app. Google wants this because it wants 30% of the money involved. (hint — you can do this for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-use-youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> and save money, too)</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7" name="Google-Play-Store-home-page.jpg" alt="Google Play Store home page on Android and Chrome OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2293" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The "opening of the Play Store" <strong>can&apos;t</strong> work as described. As ordered, Google must allow Epic (for example) to put the Epic Games store app in Google Play, have access to every app on the store, and collect payments without going through Google <strong>unless a developer opts out of this process</strong>. It sounds good and is certainly a way to make Google pay for its sins, but it&apos;s a technical nightmare that will never work as described.</p><p>Some of this ruling shouldn&apos;t stand — Google <em>should</em> be allowed to compensate developers for exclusive access the same way Microsoft, Sony, Apple, and Epic Games do. But these are the small potatoes stuff compared to Google being forced to grant Play Store access to any third party for three years.</p>
<p>Of course, you&apos;re going to see a lot of people mention Apple. It&apos;s the low-hanging fruit because it can get away with doing the same things Google is in trouble over. Even Google is talking about Apple in its blog post, telling the world how unfair this ruling is.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen a lot of explanations about how Apple was able to get away with it. Apple is not a monopoly. Apple never said it was open. Apple doesn&apos;t license its software. Probably all valid points, but the best explanation I&apos;ve heard is, "<em>Apple had a different judge</em>."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.30%;"><img id="nrUC9Mp4DMWEN5wKimsuvM" name="google-pixel-9-pro-magic-eraser-apple-store-after.jpg" alt="Magic Eraser - Apple Store - After" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nrUC9Mp4DMWEN5wKimsuvM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1506" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s important to remember. Judges, even district court judges, are very qualified arbiters of the law (usually). But a Master&apos;s Degree in the Arts and a law school degree from even the best school doesn&apos;t mean you understand tech. They do their best and sometimes it works. Other times, it doesn&apos;t.</p>
<p>We knew this was coming, and Donato&apos;s demeanor towards Google meant that this wasn&apos;t a big surprise. We&apos;re also set to hear <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-v-google-there-are-no-good-guys">yet another case</a> from Epic against Google and Samsung and will likely keep seeing them until Epic can get what it wants.</p><p>In the meantime, expect this one to be the same as Epic v. Apple was: a long, drawn-out appeal with a final ruling that doesn&apos;t have the same bite to it as the original did. Either way, Google and Epic are both going to be fine and still able to grow their wealth.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has been ordered to share its entire app catalog with rival app stores and promote those third-party app marketplaces on the Play Store.</p><p>In a landmark decision, U.S. District Judge James Donato has ordered Google to loosen its hold on the Android app ecosystem. The court says Google must allow competitors into its app store for the next three years and make it easier for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Android apps</a> to be available through other app stores (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores" target="_blank">The Verge</a>).</p><p>Epic Games&apos; victory means Google must now share its app library with other app stores and even promote them. This ruling wraps up a four-year antitrust showdown between the two.</p><p>The injunction requires the search giant to make it easier for users to install rival app stores right from the Play Store. Plus, Google has to allow third-party app stores to distribute apps from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play</a> unless developers choose to opt out.</p><p>Google is also prevented from doing things that could hinder competition, like paying companies to avoid challenging its app store dominance. Also, Google can’t make deals that require its app store to be preinstalled on new devices.</p><p>Further, the injunctions tackle Google’s old rule that forced developers to use Google Pay Billing for app sales in the Play Store. That requirement is now gone, allowing developers to offer other payment options that bypass Google’s revenue-sharing model.</p><p>App developers can now include links to other installation options right in their apps, making it easier for users to choose how they download and install software. They can also share information about different ways to make purchases.</p><p>A three-person committee will be set up to keep an eye on how well Google follows the court’s injunctions and tackle any tech issues that pop up. This team will include representatives from both Google and Epic Games.</p><p>Google has to stick to these changes for three years starting November 1, 2024. However, Alphabet plans to appeal the rulings, with Google&apos;s VP for regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/" target="_blank">citing</a> competition from Apple and security issues. This could push back major changes to Google’s business practices by several months or even years.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Mountain View-based company can still charge fees for necessary measures to protect user safety and security for apps from Google Play.</p><p>The court&apos;s ruling is a major milestone that could set a precedent for future antitrust cases against Google. It’s part of a larger wave of lawsuits aimed at the company&apos;s monopolistic practices, highlighting the ongoing push for competition and consumer welfare in the digital marketplace.</p><p>The latest ruling follows a similar case from December, where a jury <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-loses-antitrust-court-battle-against-epic">unanimously agreed that the Play Store and Google Play Billing service were illegal monopolies</a>. They also found that various deals between Google, game developers, and phone manufacturers amounted to anticompetitive behavior.</p>

<p>Although it feels a bit dated compared to some 2024 smartwatches, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-review">Forerunner 945</a> is still an excellent choice for athletes who want super-accurate health metrics and GPS. In fact, when the watch came out back in 2021, our only major complaint was its price. Thanks to this epic $300 discount from Walmart, that's no longer a problem.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Forerunner-945-GPS-Running-Smartwatch-in-Black/219688585" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="28f209b9-305b-43b0-8fc7-003e006c695a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$599.99" data-dimension48="$599.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s latest entry to its cheaper Android phone segment is getting a flagship-level treat that might make you swoon.</p><p>The Korean OEM&apos;s latest A-series phone, the Galaxy A16 5G, has seemingly received a quiet launch as it appeared on Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/nl/smartphones/galaxy-a/galaxy-a16-5g-blue-black-128gb-sm-a166bzkdeub/">Dutch website</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidplanet.nl/nieuws/samsung-galaxy-a16-officieel/">Android Planet</a>). This is the company&apos;s next iteration following the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-listed-on-walmart">A15 5G</a>, which debuted in November 2023. The device takes this further with a slightly larger 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Similar to its predecessor, the Galaxy A16 5G sports a triple camera array, consisting of a 50MP primary lens, a 5MP ultrawide, and a 2MP macro camera. The selfie camera arrives at 13MP.</p><p>The internal processing and software of the A16 5G are turning heads as Samsung states it features an improved Octa-Core processor with 2.4GHz. More importantly, the device runs Android 14 with the promise of delivering six years of OS updates to consumers who purchase the device.</p><p>Samsung states on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/nl/smartphones/galaxy-a/galaxy-a16-5g-blue-black-128gb-sm-a166bzkdeub/">website</a> that the A16 5G is "future-proof" as users can grab six generations of major Android OS updates <em>and </em>security updates. Those who grab the 2024 budget device can expect updates until October 31, 2030 — if it&apos;s still in your pocket. It&apos;s worth mentioning that Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S24 series observed seven years of Android OS updates and security patches.</p>

<p>Other internal specifications include the device&apos;s 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The company advises that only 109.3GB of that 128 number is "available." Additionally, the A16 5G has a microSD card slot with support of up to 1.5TB.</p><p>The battery remains unchanged as Samsung provides a 5,000mAh capacity brick with 25W charging. The company estimates this should give consumers around 16 hours of Wi-Fi and roughly 18 hours of video playback.</p><p>In the Netherlands, the Galaxy A16 5G arrives in dark blue, light green, and light gray. It seems there&apos;s also a gold hue available, but appears restricted to another unspecified region. Samsung&apos;s Dutch website states the device can be purchased for € 229, which is roughly $250. Unfortunately, the company has yet to debut the budget device in the United States nor has it officially declared its price.</p><p>The A16 5G is truly a "budget" device, much more so than Samsung&apos;s recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-google-pixel-8a">Galaxy S24 FE</a> from September. What&apos;s more, we&apos;re still waiting on Android 15 (One UI 7), which will be the latest budget phone&apos;s first major OS update. Samsung confirmed the update will roll out in 2025 alongside the Galaxy S25 series. However, those interested can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">check out this demo</a> showcased on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a> at SDC 2024.</p>
