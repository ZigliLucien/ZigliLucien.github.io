                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If you think about it, a Chromebox is a weird product. They make for a great desktop computer for most people, excelling at things like web browsing, social media, online shopping, and entertainment. If you want a cheap and easy-to-use computer for your living room so you can watch Netflix and browse Instagram on a big screen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebox">a Chromebox</a> is great.</p><p>The drawback is that they&apos;re not mobile; a good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/buy-a-chromebook-not-a-chromebox">Chromebook and USB-C Hub does everything a Chromebox can do</a> and has the benefit of being able to unplug everything and go along with you.</p>
<p>Having said that, there are a few reasons why a Chromebox could be a better choice. The Aopen Chromebox Mini 2 excels at both because of how it was designed and built: its made for enterprise applications. </p><p>Very few people in a Fortune 500 company use a Chromebox as a server or desktop, so what does that mean? A look at the Chromebox Mini 2 tells the story.</p>
<h2 id="xa0-a-typical-chromebox-2"> A typical Chromebox</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2009px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YmFQ3a9v2FhTZinSLaNMiM" name="chromebox-hero.jpg" alt="Chromebox" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YmFQ3a9v2FhTZinSLaNMiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2009" height="1130" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aopen.com/US_en/products_info/AOPEN_Chromebox_Mini_2/">Chromebox Mini 2</a> is like using any other modestly spec&apos;d Chromebox. It runs the Chrome Browser like a champ, having plenty of memory for literally hundreds of open tabs.</p><p>Support for two 4K monitors means the video looks great. The Celeron processor isn&apos;t the strongest chip out there, but it has adequate power for decoding streaming media or any other sort of entertainment you can imagine while being efficient—it isn&apos;t going to get too hot.</p><p>Because it runs the same Chrome OS as every other Chromebox, you have support for many Android applications as well as Chrome-centric apps. If that&apos;s not enough for you, many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-install-and-run-linux-apps-on-a-chromebook">Linux apps</a> will install and run great, thanks to the Intel X86 architecture. </p>

<p>You could use the Chromebox Mini 2 the same way you use any other Chromebox. From a software and usability point of view, not much stands out. Chromeboxes, no matter the manufacturer, are all designed to work the same seamless way and have mostly the same set of features.</p><p>So what makes a Chromebox "Enterprise-grade?" Are companies really using these? How? Why? That&apos;s a lot of questions, and a few of the Chromebox Mini 2&apos;s features tell the entire story.</p>
<h2 id="ready-for-business-2">Ready for business</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LvmdnCXgq3AAam66cdYqJm" name="Aopen-Chromebox-Mini-2-2.jpg" alt="Aopen Chromebox Mini 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LvmdnCXgq3AAam66cdYqJm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Buried among the specs are a few things that you won&apos;t find on most Chromeboxes or Chromebooks. Let&apos;s have a look at each for a better idea of what makes the Chromebox Mini 2 ready for commercial use:</p><p><strong>MIL-STD, fanless construction</strong>. The Chromebox Mini 2&apos;s body is a solid chunk of aluminum that acts as a heatsink. Combined with a low-power chip like the Celeron N4500, that means as long as you provide ambient air, it&apos;s never going to overheat. </p><p><strong>50,000-Hour MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)</strong>. That means the Chromebox Mini 2 was designed to run for 5.7 years without interruption. Attach the power supply to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-767-powerhouse-review">UPS solution</a>, and it will run until it&apos;s time to be replaced five years from now.</p><p><strong>External Power Switch</strong>. The front panel has a set of connectors, so a normally open remote switch can be wired in. This will act as a power button that you can mount remotely, allowing the Chromebox Mini 2 to be placed out of the reach of curious fingers like mine.</p><p> <strong>APAR (AC Power Auto Recovery)</strong>. If the Chromebook Mini 2 loses power, it will return to the state it was in once power is restored. The board has a rechargeable battery and software to enable this, eliminating the need for a technician to be present during start-up.</p>

<p>You&apos;ve probably seen a Windows error screen on a sign or menu somewhere. These features are all designed to make sure you only see what a company wants you to see.</p><p>You&apos;ll find Chromeboxes used for things like POS terminals and control/informational displays in factories. But they&apos;re <em>really</em> popular for powering digital signs. You may not know it, but you&apos;ve likely seen a sign or menu powered by a Chromebox because it&apos;s easy to set up and well-designed for the task.</p>
<p>When you hear the words "enterprise Chromebox" this is what you should think of. Commercial grade is probably a better term because a Chromebox is perfect for many commercial applications. One designed especially for the task, like the Chromebox Mini 2, makes things even better.</p><p>A simple-to-understand but common scenario: I want to place a menu above the bar in my establishment. The best way to do it is to create a simple backend that builds a viewable webpage in any browser because it&apos;s easy to make quick adjustments.</p><p>If I place a Chromebox behind a large display, I can point the browser to that webpage. I can even use two monitors for another view, an ad, or a menu at the other end of the bar. </p><p>If I can wire a remote switch, know that I won&apos;t have to attach a keyboard and do anything if it accidentally loses power. Know it will run for five years without any issues and that you won&apos;t ever have to worry about cleaning a dusty fan intake. When things aren&apos;t more expensive—the Chromebox Mini 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdw.com/product/aopen-chromebox-mini-2-intel-celeron-n4500-fanless-8-gb-ram-32-gb-e/7868777">retails for $260</a>—I know which model I am buying.</p>
<h2 id="also-ready-for-your-living-room-2">Also ready for your living room</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1765px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.60%;"><img id="HYg7PEQNCEYFHmDvWdsnrV" name="disney-plus-hulu-integration-announcement.jpg" alt=""Hulu on Disney Plus" announcement." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HYg7PEQNCEYFHmDvWdsnrV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1765" height="946" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Disney Plus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You probably don&apos;t own an establishment with a bar, so you don&apos;t need a digital sign or menu. But I&apos;ll bet you own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fire-tv-edition-televisions">a television</a>. Everything that makes the Chromebox Mini 2 perfect for a business also makes it great for your entertainment center.</p><p>Maybe you have gone all-out with a surround system and built-in audio receiver stored inside a dedicated media cabinet in your house. Or maybe you just have a big television on a stand in the living room. A Chromebox is a great way to make the most out of it all.</p>
<p>With a Bluetooth or wireless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Backlit-Keyboard-Touchpad-Wireless-Multimedia/dp/B07QNPX8C2/ref=pd_ci_mcx_pspc_dp_d_2_t_5">keyboard combo remote</a>, you should have a full desktop-class web browser attached to your television and audio system that&apos;s also a Chromecast target. I love my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidias-shield-tv-pro-is-still-the-best-streaming-device-in-2024">Nvidia Shield TV</a> and use one in the bedroom, but this is how I control my media in the living room.</p><p>It would be great to have a Chromebox that never needs to be dusted and will run forever as long as I give it a little bit of air. I could even wire in a switch mounted on the outside of the cabinet, allowing me to mount the Chromebox to the television or inside a cabinet out of sight. </p><p>I get access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">streaming services</a> and my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/beginners-guide-plex">own media</a>, minimal network latency thanks to an Ethernet connection, and a great 4K picture on the television I spent too much money on.</p><p>A<del>n Enterprise</del> Commercial Chromebox is just what I&apos;ve been looking for I just never wanted to spend more money for one. Now I don&apos;t have to.</p>
<p>This isn&apos;t a "regular" review of the Chromebox Mini 2. If it were, I&apos;d tell you that if you need a Chromebox and are interested in any of the extra features designed for commercial use, this one is for you. <strong>Five stars all the way</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Rand Fishkin of SparkToro received and published documents detailing Google Search's internal APIs, search ranking factors, and Google's data collection practices.</li><li>Some leaked information contradicts Google's public statements about search algorithms and ranking factors.</li><li>The documents were accidentally made public on GitHub from March 27 to May 7 and later indexed by a third-party service.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A massive leak of what seems to be thousands of internal documents offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/5-cool-google-search-features-you-didnt-know-about">Google Search</a>, suggesting that Google may have been misleading the public about its search engine operations for years.</p><p>The documents were handed over to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/" target="_blank">Rand Fishkin</a> of SparkToro, a software company, who then made them public. Fishkin, a seasoned SEO expert with over a decade of experience, says a source gave him 2,500 pages of documents, hoping to debunk the "lies" Google employees had said about how the search algorithm actually works (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166177/google-search-ranking-algorithm-leak-documents-link-seo" target="_blank">The Verge</a>).</p><p>The documents spill the beans on internal APIs and break down what impacts search results. From these leaked papers, you can get a general sense of what works and what doesn&apos;t for ranking on Google, highlighting the key elements that matter most.</p><p>These leaks cover a wide range of topics, such as Google&apos;s data collection, which sites get a boost for sensitive issues like elections, and how Google treats small websites.</p><p>Interestingly, some information conflicts with what Google has publicly said. For example, Google has denied treating subdomains differently in rankings and claimed they don&apos;t use click-centric signals for content indexing, yet the leaks suggest otherwise, according to Fishkin.</p><p>Other surprises include using a sandbox for new sites, giving sites an "authority score" to bump them up in search results, and more.</p><p>Google has yet to respond to Android Central&apos;s request for comments, but we&apos;ll update this article when we do.</p><p>It looks like Google accidentally made these documents public on GitHub around March 27, and they were taken down by May 7. However, a third-party service indexed them, so they&apos;re still accessible.</p><p>Even though these documents reveal potential ranking factors, they don&apos;t specify the importance of each one in the final ranking, as SEO expert <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak" target="_blank">Mike King</a> highlighted in his overview.</p><p>Earlier this year, Google launched a major Search update that prioritizes "helpful" content. The new algorithms are designed to determine if a webpage is made for search engines or real people.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update"><span>Update</span></h2>
<p>In an emailed statement to Android Central, a Google representative cautions the public not to jump to conclusions without all the facts.</p><p>"We would caution against making inaccurate assumptions about Search based on out-of-context, outdated, or incomplete information," the spokesperson said. "We’ve shared extensive information about how Search works and the types of factors that our systems weigh, while also working to protect the integrity of our results from manipulation."</p><p>Google also mentioned that it does not traditionally comment on the specifics of its ranking systems. Sharing such sensitive information could help spammers and bad actors manipulate the results, as per the company.</p><p>Search is always changing, and Google says it&apos;s constantly tweaking its systems to provide the best results. The spokesperson added that while Google&apos;s core ranking principles stay the same, individual signals can change often, be dropped, or just be tested and never used.</p><p>The search giant also reiterated its commitment to providing accurate information while protecting the integrity of search results. Finally, Google highlighted the potential for misinterpretation of the leaked documents.</p>

<ul><li>Google is shutting down its Business Messages features, which allowed users to chat with businesses via Search or Maps.</li><li>The shutdown will happen in two phases, starting July 15, users can't send new chats to businesses and businesses will stop receiving texts from July 31.</li><li>Customers can still contact businesses through other modes like phone call, emails or through their websites listed on the Business Profiles.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>On Tuesday (May 28), Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/14919062">announced</a> that it will shut down the Business Messages feature on Google Maps and Search. This feature allowed users to chat directly with businesses through their profiles. Businesses could respond to users either themselves or via a chatbot.</p><p>The tech giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/28/google-business-messages-shutting-down/">emailed</a> several business owners, saying they will not be able to receive messages from their Google Business profile starting July 31. </p><p>"We acknowledge this may be difficult news—as we continually improve our tools, we occasionally have to make difficult decisions that may impact the businesses and partners we work with," Google said in the email.</p><p>The removal of Business Messages means users can no longer initiate quick chats with businesses they find on Maps and Search. This feature could negatively impact communication, as instant conversations will no longer be accessible. Google says users can still reach out to establishments via calls or emails.</p><p>On the user&apos;s end, beginning July 15, customers won&apos;t be able to start new chat conversations with your business from Google. And people in existing chat conversations will be notified about the feature phaseout.</p>

<p>The company assures that customers can still find and contact businesses through Google Search and Maps through website links, business descriptions, photos, and anything else shared on the existing Business Profile.</p><p>"It&apos;s important to us that Google remains a helpful partner as you manage your business, and we remain committed to this mission," Google added.</p><p>Why Google chose such a route with the Business Messages feature remains a mystery. The Google Maps Messaging button launched in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-killing-off-the-messaging-service-inside-google-maps/">2017</a> and was called "Google My Business Chat." The messaging button would launch the phone&apos;s SMS app or a Google Allo (remember this?) chat box.</p><p>Earlier this year, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-shutting-down-business-profile-websites">shut down</a> websites created with Google Business Profiles.

<ul><li>Google stated that Chrome users on Android are in line to receive "minimized custom tabs" for in-app browsing.</li><li>When opening a link, users will notice a new down arrow in the in-app Chrome window, which will shrink it into a floating UI window.</li><li>From there, users can quickly re-tap the window to get back into what they were looking at.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest update for Chrome on Android brings "minimized custom tabs" to developers to better the user experience.</p><p>According to a Chromium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/multi-tasking-with-minimized-custom-tabs.html">blog post</a>, Chrome&apos;s minimized custom tabs are a feature that lets users multitask effortlessly and seamlessly in apps. The post states developers will see this change occur automatically during the roll-out of update M124 in Chrome. On the other hand, users will notice a "minimize" icon when opening a link.</p><p>Using Gmail as an example, Google states that Chrome will open at the bottom of their UI when users click on a link.</p><p>From there, the window can fully expand to the length of a device&apos;s display. The top left corner holds a down arrow, which will minimize the Chrome window into a floating square on the bottom right of your display. Users can quickly tap this box to re-open the Chrome window they were just in.</p><p>Google hopes this "enhances the in-app browsing experience." The company adds that this custom tab method is integrated to help users open links and browse better "across surfaces." Essentially, these custom tabs should work well with other apps across Android.</p><p>When minimized, the custom tab only displays the webpage name and site domain. The site&apos;s logo can also appear, though that depends on the website you&apos;re accessing. Otherwise, it seems users will see the Chrome browser logo in its place.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs">Chrome for Developers</a> explains that minimizing custom tabs ensures that users can put them away and re-open them without losing their place. Additionally, a user&apos;s saved passwords, payment methods, and more will appear as if they were using the main Chrome browser.</p><p>Google had originally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-chrome-custom-tabs-feature-might-add-picture-in-picture-support">started playtesting</a> this update for Chrome&apos;s custom tabs in March during version 122 on Android. Most of the feature&apos;s functionality has remained consistent throughout its beta, with the picture-in-picture style tabs acting as a way to help users stay on task. The beta showed that these multitasking custom tabs don&apos;t work well with YouTube.</p><p>However, the YouTube app already lets users hop out of the app with the video continuously playing in a floating window on their UI.</p><p>Refinements are still pouring in for Chrome&apos;s Custom Tabs as the most recent update for them involved "Read Aloud." Chrome Canary users picked up the ability for the browser to read a page&apos;s contents out loud for them earlier this year.</p>

Taking things forward, the Special Edition Phone 2a blends in all three colors at the back as part of a new design, making the first Nothing product to feature more than a single or couple of different colors.</p><p>Adam, Design Director at Nothing, has further shared about the product in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/10897-introducing-phone-2a-special-edition">community post</a>, indicating, "We are very happy to unveil Phone (2a) Special Edition. The first product to explore our palette of the primary colors: red, blue and yellow. Its overall aesthetic references some of our design heroes from the past, whilst creating a new expression for a smartphone. Elevating a functional device into a striking piece of art."</p>

<p>Nothing says users can grab one of these starting today (May 29) through the company site or associated e-commerce platforms. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> turned out to be an excellent choice and a super valued phone for the cheaper Android phones segment that it is competing in. </p><p>There is no better time for interested consumers since the phone is now being offered in four colorways, and the latest Special Edition is believed to be available in limited quantities.</p>

<hr>
<p>This year&apos;s Samsung summer comes into focus as the company&apos;s upcoming foldable and smartwatch appear at the FCC.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2024/05/29/samsungs-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-galaxy-flip-6-hit-fcc/">DroidLife</a> spotted the Galaxy Z Flip 6&apos;s FCC listing, confirming some of the extra specifications regarding connectivity.

<p>The hype is building for a "Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra" with the latest batch of leaks showing up recently with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">supposed renderings</a>. The device may sport quite the design shift as Samsung could go for a mix between a squarish chassis and a circular display design. The tipster suggested that the Watch 7 UItra could see a 1.5-inch display in diameter. Its overall dimensions make it appear as though it&apos;ll be slightly larger than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a>.</p><p>The renderings show a new third button joining the typical two on the watch&apos;s right side.

The company had reportedly discussed the idea of "cost control" and "efficiency," which were the driving forces behind the chip decision. So, instead of featuring Qualcomm&apos;s chip in the U.S. and Exynos in other regions, it seems everyone will get the same experience chip-wise.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-fcc-listing-cradle-specs-confirmed">an FCC appearance</a> yesterday (May 28), and with the listing came major spoilers about what it&apos;s offering. The database confirmed the existence of nine ring sizes for the device, alongside a quick look at a charging "cradle." A more concrete look at the cradle wasn&apos;t available, however, it seems Samsung will mark each one with a consumer&apos;s chosen Galaxy Ring size.</p>

<hr>
<p>Microsoft is giving Telegram an AI boost and touting it as your "everyday companion."</p><p>Microsoft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/copilot-for-social?form=MY02F9">announced</a> that its AI chatbot, Copilot, has arrived on Telegram today (May 29). Similar to the AI experience users would get through Windows, Copilot in Telegram is powered by OpenAI&apos;s GPT and Bing Search. The company states that the AI uses "natural language to provide responses on a range of topics."</p><p>Such topics include gaming and sports. For the former, users can ask Copilot in Telegram about the latest game releases and walkthroughs. For sports, the AI can quickly grab scores, schedules, "and more" for those curious about the NFL, NBA, and the NHL, among others.</p><p>Other topics <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-google-assistant-chromeos">Copilot</a> can work with are traveling, fitness, food, music, romance, movies, and brain teasers to pass the time.</p><p>Microsoft states that Copilot&apos;s initial beta period in Telegram limits the AI to text-based prompts.</p><p>Users can get started by hopping into the Telegram app on desktop or mobile. Searching for "CopilotOfficialBot" in the app will produce the AI&apos;s chat thread. Simply pose your question or give the AI some instructions and let it do the rest. Microsoft adds that users can also deliver a follow-up question to the AI after it&apos;s delivered a response to your query.</p><p>Copilot&apos;s arrival on Telegram is free, meaning users on Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS can get started today (May 29). When using Copilot, those concerned about their privacy and security can check out Microsoft&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement">comprehensive</a>" approach.</p>

<p>Microsoft dropped its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-play-store-launch">Copilot app for Android</a> onto the Play Store early in January. Utilizing OpenAI&apos;s GPT-4 model, all users can ask the bot questions or ask it to write content for them. Moreover, the app features DALL-E 3, a model designed to handle a user&apos;s text-to-image generation requests. Microsoft classified this as the "imaginative" side of Copilot.</p><p>There&apos;s also an "Image Creator," which gives users the tools to make social media items, logo designs, illustrations for books, and more. With Copilot starting out as a beta in Telegram, and only accepting text-based prompts, perhaps there&apos;s a future where we see DALL-E 3&apos;s influence in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">popular messaging app</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, an update for Copilot in February enabled the AI to be used as a user&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-default-assistant-beta-rollout">default assistant</a> on Android. Users can swipe diagonally from the corner of their device or long-press their power button to produce it. However, it&apos;s not entirely seamless as instead of experiencing a floating UI, keeping you where you are, users are thrown into the main Copilot app.</p>

<ul><li>Users with ad blockers on YouTube are experiencing problems like videos skipping to the end or muting.</li><li>YouTube denies these issues are related to its anti-ad blocker efforts, attributing them to recent performance improvements.</li><li>The problems mainly affect AdBlock Plus users; uBlock Origin users report no issues.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you&apos;re encountering issues on YouTube, your ad blocker might be the culprit. Some users with ad blockers are noticing their videos unexpectedly skipping to the end.</p><p>On the r/youtube subreddit, ad blocker users have reported odd problems like videos being muted or jumping straight to the end. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1d1pgng/new_youtube_adblock_weird_behaviour_video/" target="_blank">u/SDHD4K</a> shared a clip showing their video ending abruptly with Adblock Plus enabled, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/28/youtube-skipping-to-end-adblockers/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1d1pgng/new_youtube_adblock_weird_behaviour_video">New Youtube adblock weird behaviour - video automatically skips to the end</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube">r/youtube</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The original poster tried replaying the video from different points, but it still ended suddenly. Others mentioned audio problems, like one user who only got sound by constantly adjusting the volume.</p><p>At first, it seemed like these issues were part of YouTube&apos;s increased efforts to fight ad blockers, but the company has denied this. In a statement to 9to5Google, YouTube said the problems stem from recent improvements to the platform&apos;s performance and reliability, not from its anti-ad blocker campaign.</p><p>The glitch mostly affects AdBlock Plus users, but many ad blockers have released updates to fix it. Meanwhile, users reported no problems with uBlock Origin.</p><p>YouTube has been stepping up its fight against ad blockers. Last month, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-blocks-third-party-ad-blockers">tightened restrictions on third-party apps</a>, warning that those blocking ads might lose API access. In November, YouTube confirmed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-loads-slower-on-firefox">slowdowns in major web browsers were linked to its anti-ad-blocker efforts</a>. Back in June 2023, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-three-strikes-policy-for-ad-blockers">began alerting users they&apos;d be cut off after three videos</a> if an ad blocker was detected.</p><p>People use ad blockers to avoid pop-ups and intrusive ads for a better online experience. The recent increase in YouTube ads and the rising cost of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> likely pushed more people to install ad blockers.</p><p>Despite YouTube&apos;s aggressive stance against ad blockers, which apparently caused a spike in uninstalls, ad-block developers quickly released updates to counter the changes.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, people are quick to blame YouTube&apos;s ad-blocker crackdown for any related glitches. Intentional or not, these latest issues make using ad blockers so irritating that you&apos;ll likely turn them off, leaving you to either put up with the ads or spring for Premium.</p>

<hr>
<p>Last week, we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-users-are-getting-hit-with-rcs-spam-texts">saw</a> Google Messages users receive spam messages, including random letters and numbers, along with a Google support page link. This week, we&apos;re back with another blue and green bubble error, as reports suggest that Android users are receiving distorted GIFs sent from iPhones as SMS/MMS.</p><p>Several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> users took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1d1th6c/whats_up_with_this_with_the_screenshot_this_time/?sort=new">Reddit</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/27/google-messages-android-iphone-distorted-gifs/">9to5Google</a>) to share their Google Messages, receiving distorted GIFs from their iPhone friends. Notably, these were received via SMS/MMS by users on Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones. It wouldn&apos;t be the case if iPhones were adapted to RCS instead of relying on older communication protocols for Android handsets. The Apple iPhones are yet to gain RCS support, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone">anticipated</a> to happen later this year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:787px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.71%;"><img id="xcCReMw8yN7gMcCu66WnaZ" name="google-messages-distorted-gif.jpeg" alt="Google Messages distorted GIF" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xcCReMw8yN7gMcCu66WnaZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="787" height="525" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit user u/ForwardMotion6565)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Per the Reddit posts, users saw distortion issues with GIFs and memes. However, other media messages, like photos, appear as usual. Initially, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1d1th6c/comment/l60dtvz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">multiple users</a> attributed this issue to file sizes sent from iPhones to Google Messages—the smaller file sizes of the GIFs rendered well, while the bigger ones struggled to render.</p><p>Meanwhile, another Reddit user noted that Google had recommended factory resetting their Pixel phone when contacted regarding the issue. In the accompanying comments, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1cwcol3/comment/l4yptya/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">another user hinted</a> that turning off “Send Messages Faster” had somehow fixed the distortion. And other users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1cwcol3/comment/l5d9ugg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">who tried</a> the workaround were lucky enough to get the issue fixed as well. It appears to be a temporary solution for users facing the problem.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:462px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:129.87%;"><img id="5kiNbyu3aTbyUinVmPvpQZ" name="google-messages-distorted-gif-2.jpeg" alt="Google Messages distorted GIF" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5kiNbyu3aTbyUinVmPvpQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="462" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit user u/Wooden-Structure158)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It is still unclear when the issue with iMessage and Google Messages started popping up, as many users on Reddit have indicated that it had been happening for more than a couple of weeks. </p><p>As mentioned, Google hasn’t officially acknowledged the issue despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1cwcol3/distorted_gifs_from_imessage/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">suggesting</a> a factory reset for a user. Such issues might still pop up across iMessage and Google Messages unless Apple quickly adopts RCS support as promised.</p>
