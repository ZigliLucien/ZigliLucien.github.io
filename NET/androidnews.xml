<hr>
<p>OnePlus Watch 2 is gaining an update that introduces two new apps for smartwatch users. It further comes with bug fixes and handy new features.</p><p>As spotted by folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-2-update-new-relax-and-barometer-apps-3442315/">Android Authority</a>, the new update bearing  <strong>OPWWE231_11_A.94</strong> version is being rolled out to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> users, bringing new apps dubbed Relax and Barometer and a few other changes. </p><p>The former packs a set of breathing exercises for the smartwatch users, including Mindful Breathing, Bee breathing, and Pre-sleep breathing. Users can set multiple timers to start the exercise and are further guided to perform those exercises. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8XVPwssCJZu8mVVGbKF4BQ" name="oneplus-watch-2-new-apps.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 new apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8XVPwssCJZu8mVVGbKF4BQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Barometer, on the other hand, showcases atmospheric pressure. However, users can only play around with so many settings/ screens. The publication further notes the new inclusion of the “Tap to wake” toggle and a new battery tile on the home screen of the OnePlus Watch 2. </p><p>While the feature is self-explanatory, there is a new setting to turn it off, as it can reduce accidental touches and save battery life. The latest update also brings tons of new watch faces that can be accessed within the OHealth app for the OnePlus Watch 2. </p><p>Here’s the full changelog for the update shared by the publication:</p>
<ul><li>This update introduces several new features and fixes known issues. Update now for a smoother user experience.</li><li>Optimizes data display during workouts.</li><li>Adds support for accessing Music Controller by swiping left during a workout.</li><li>Adds Relax and Barometer apps.</li><li>Adds new features in the Phone app in Power Saver mode, including displaying contacts, favoriting contacts, and displaying call logs.</li><li>Adds support for turning off “Tap to wake.”</li><li>Enhances the experience of removing a watch face.</li><li>Optimizes some workout and health algorithms.</li><li>Fixes other known issues.</li></ul>

<p>Meanwhile, the company has also started rolling out a new <strong>OxygenOS 14.0.0.701</strong> firmware update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus 12R</a> users in North America, which comes in batches. In an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1592896348611411976">accompanying community post</a>, OnePlus shared the full changelog, which includes smoother animations, a touch control experience, and improvements to the system on the latest mid-range handset from the company. </p><p>Across the interface, OnePlus 12R users can experience wallpaper zoom alongside seamless icon transitions during app launch and while exiting apps. There’s a new bounce animation effect while accessing the app drawer, and the Quick Setting icon also gets layer effects. Additionally, animations are optimized on home screen icons, widgets, and even wallpaper zoom, which should look smoother after the new update.</p><p>Here are some more from the changelog that should bring OnePlus 12R users a new touch control experience:</p>
<ul><li>Adds a transition animation when swiping in from one side of the screen to exit an app before it starts up.</li><li>Adds a transition animation when swiping in from one side of the screen to go back to the previous page before a new page is opened.</li><li>Adds a transition animation when swiping inward from a side of the screen or swiping up to exit an app in landscape mode.</li><li>You can now tap the lower right corner of a large folder to view more apps.</li><li>You can now pull down app icons in large folders and then open an app in just one move.</li><li>Improves touch control responsiveness. Tapping and swiping on the Home and Recent tasks screens is now faster and more stable.</li><li>It increases touch responsiveness for app usage scenarios, such as opening and closing apps, entering and exiting recent tasks, or swiping on the gesture guide bar to switch between apps.</li><li>Optimizes animations when using large folders. Dragging apps on the Home screen is now smoother.</li></ul>

<p>On the other hand, system-wide improvements include the ability to adjust volume in Quick Settings. Users can further hide the track pattern when drawing on the lock screen. </p><p>Floating windows can now be resized by dragging them to the bottom. In addition to the system stability improvements, the new firmware also brings the April security patch for the OnePlus 12R.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When phone manufacturers ditched the 3.5mm jack on their devices, the justification was to create room to slot in larger batteries and bigger antennae. That excuse doesn&apos;t hold up in 2024, particularly when you consider that a small phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10</a> somehow has a 3.5mm jack, a 5000mAh battery, and all the extras you need in a modern phone.</p><p>But all other brands already moved away from the analog jack, and are instead pushing their wireless earbuds as a way to listen to music on the go. Outside of a few budget and mid-range devices, you won&apos;t find the 3.5mm jack on most phones these days. This is what Moondrop wants to fix. The audio manufacturer is nothing if not bold in its vision, and its latest product is the MIAD01, an Android phone that has a 3.5mm jack as well as a balanced 4.4mm port — which is unheard of.</p><p>In addition to the ports, the MIAD01 has a decent DAC, and the design is intriguing to say the least. I wasn&apos;t sure about the feasibility of such a device, but I used the MIAD01 for the better part of a week, and it has a few unique advantages. While there&apos;s no shortage of dongle DACs like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka13-review">Fiio KA13</a>, being able to plug in any IEM or headset into a phone is just much more convenient, and the MIAD01 has standout sound quality. It is also able to drive demanding planar headsets without breaking a sweat, and that&apos;s just an added bonus.</p><p>However, the MIAD01 also has to do all the other phone-related features in addition to audio playback, and this is where it doesn&apos;t measure up to regular phones. The software doesn&apos;t have any custom features, the cameras just aren&apos;t worth the hassle, and the hardware isn&apos;t quite the best in this segment. But if you don&apos;t care about all of that and just need a phone for daily use that also doubles as a portable audio player, the MIAD01 has a lot to offer.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-moondrop-miad01-pricing-and-availability"><span>Moondrop MIAD01: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g8Xto2MpkRBnaP96KzGNoG" name="moondrop-miad01-21.jpg" alt="Back of Moondrop MIAD01 next to Venus headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g8Xto2MpkRBnaP96KzGNoG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Moondrop launched the MIAD01 in China in April 2024, and the phone is now on sale globally. It is available in a single variant with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hifigo.com/products/moondrop-miad01">costs $399 at audio retailers like HiFiGo</a>. While the phone is sold with 256GB of internal storage, it has a MicroSD slot that lets you add up to 2TB of additional storage — ideal if you have a lot of offline music.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-moondrop-miad01-design-and-screen"><span>Moondrop MIAD01: Design and screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hMbDWZccLt2C854fCyDuMD" name="moondrop-miad01-12.jpg" alt="Moondrop MIAD01 next to Venus headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hMbDWZccLt2C854fCyDuMD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The MIAD01 has a distinct visual design, and the phone is decked out in a grey color scheme that has the same sci-fi aesthetic as the rest of the brand&apos;s products. The orange accents for the power and volume buttons give the design a little bit of added flair, and I like the fact that the cameras at the back don&apos;t jut out from the design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CH5sgZmNi5BmaC8SUVAMvC" name="moondrop-miad01-9.jpg" alt="Showcasing 3.5mm and 4.4mm ports of Moondrop MIAD01" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CH5sgZmNi5BmaC8SUVAMvC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The defining characteristic of the MIAD01 is the presence of 3.5mm and 4.4mm ports at the top, and to accommodate the analog connectors, Moondrop increased the thickness of the top third portion. This is a good design choice as it ultimately doesn&apos;t affect usability, and because it extends to the entire width of the phone, there is no wobble when using it on a table.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="x85nQwX4RVDW52bXkbfzwF" name="moondrop-miad01-19.jpg" alt="Back view of Moondrop MIAD01 with camera modules" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x85nQwX4RVDW52bXkbfzwF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The back and sides are made out of plastic, but the build quality is decent, and the buttons have good tactility. There isn&apos;t much in the way of branding either; you get the Moondrop logo along with the model name at the back. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9naM5E9vBEuwzm7pPNzbxE" name="moondrop-miad01-16.jpg" alt="Moondrop MIAD01 side view with panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9naM5E9vBEuwzm7pPNzbxE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another interesting design choice is the dual-curved OLED panel; the curvature is just enough that you get the benefits of a curved screen, but not so much that it limits usability. There is enough room on the sides to hold the phone comfortably, and this allows the MIAD01 to differentiate itself a little better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CburXiGFoy8JTtLFBWbPAK" name="moondrop-miad01-24.jpg" alt="Side view of Moondrop MIAD01" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CburXiGFoy8JTtLFBWbPAK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What isn&apos;t great is that the curved design doesn&apos;t extend to the back, so you&apos;re left with an asymmetrical aesthetic that&apos;s just uncomfortable. Sure, the phone looks cool, but the flat back tends to dig into the palm, and it makes holding and using the MIAD01 much more awkward than it needs to be.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XXa47U2phYnY6HPtxTBP4H" name="moondrop-miad01-22.jpg" alt="Bottom view of Moondrop MIAD01 in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XXa47U2phYnY6HPtxTBP4H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a good reason that every other phone that has a curved screen has symmetric curves at the back, but that isn&apos;t the case here, and it ultimately makes using the MIAD01 tedious. On that note, there&apos;s no ingress protection of any kind, but that&apos;s a given considering the phone has analog ports.</p><p>Rounding out the design, the MIAD01 has dual SIM card slots in addition to a dedicated MicroSD slot, giving you the ability to add up to 2TB of storage above and beyond the 256GB of built-in storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3T4wK9sykJ9TvCm6tBcGkD" name="moondrop-miad01-13.jpg" alt="Moondrop MIAD01 with home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3T4wK9sykJ9TvCm6tBcGkD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching over to the screen, the MIAD01 has a 6.7-inch OLED panel with 120Hz refresh. It has good colors and contrast levels, and while the brightness level isn&apos;t the best in its class, I didn&apos;t see any issues in this regard. There&apos;s stereo sound, but as the device is limited to Widevine L3, it doesn&apos;t play streaming content at 1080p — it maxes out at 720p.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7TAZuQrgwJ753dXCJu4NAE" name="moondrop-miad01-14.jpg" alt="Stylized home page icons of Moondrop MIAD01" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7TAZuQrgwJ753dXCJu4NAE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the software itself is barebones, you don&apos;t get many customization options. The phone has an always-on mode, but you just get a digital clock and unread notification icons along with the battery level. The screen refresh is set to Auto out of the box, but you can manually toggle between 60Hz and 120Hz.</p>

<p>On the whole, I like the design of the MIAD01, and the only issue with the phone is the lack of curves at the back.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-moondrop-miad01-sound-quality"><span>Moondrop MIAD01: Sound quality</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cN2J26A8RxEo4WZiU7nAPA" name="moondrop-miad01-6.jpg" alt="Moondrop MIAD01 next to Venus headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cN2J26A8RxEo4WZiU7nAPA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, a key talking point of the MIAD01 is the audio potential. As I mentioned above, the phone has a single-ended 3.5mm jack in addition to the balanced 4.4mm port, and the latter in particular is interesting. The phone has plenty of power to spare, and having used it with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">Fiio FT5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/moondrop-venus-review">Moondrop Venus</a>, and other planar headsets, I didn&apos;t see any issues in this regard.</p><p>The MIAD01 is just as reliable at driving sensitive IEMs, and there&apos;s no background hiss whatsoever. I tested it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fx15-review">Fiio FX15</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/thieaudio-prestige-ltd-review">Thieaudio Prestige LTD</a>, Sennheiser IE200, and a half-dozen other IEMs, and it was terrific throughout. </p><p>You get dual Cirrus Logic DAC hardware, and the MIAD01 is similar to the MoonRiver 2 dongle DAC in this regard. If anything, the sound is almost identical, and you get a neutral sound with a hint of warmth. The DAC has good dynamics and imaging, and the overall sound is refined — it is equivalent to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android">best dongle DACs</a>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PdFfVQXVmR9NAKVaPSDZfC" name="moondrop-miad01-11.jpg" alt="Back of Moondrop MIAD01 next to Venus headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PdFfVQXVmR9NAKVaPSDZfC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you prefer a warm signature, there&apos;s a service dubbed AudioConsole that comes bundled with the phone, and it lets you emulate a tube amp sound. The difference is noticeable, but I prefer the default sound characteristic. The phone doesn&apos;t have AptX codecs, so you&apos;re limited to the usual SBC and AAC in addition to LDAC.</p><p>What I like the best is that the phone has granular volume adjustment, unlike Android&apos;s asinine slider. There&apos;s a nifty toggle that allows you to stream music in the background, and you can use it with any audio and video streaming service.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-moondrop-miad01-hardware-and-battery"><span>Moondrop MIAD01: Hardware and battery</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XkUJTnvFjVNNKZ5rRFmSSJ" name="moondrop-miad01-29.jpg" alt="Moondrop MIAD01 device info" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XkUJTnvFjVNNKZ5rRFmSSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Moondrop says the MIAD01 is powered by MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 7050, but the device info shows it is using the MT6877V (Dimensity 1080) instead. Both platforms use the same set of cores: there are two Arm v8 Cortex A78 cores that go up to 2.6GHz, along with six Cortex A55 cores that hit 2.0GHz. You get a Mali-G68 GPU, and it definitely shows its age when playing demanding titles.</p>
<p>To Moondrop&apos;s credit, the MIAD01 doesn&apos;t have noticeable lag in daily use. It handles mundane tasks like browsing and social media with relative ease, and because the interface doesn&apos;t have any overt customization, it is fluid. However, this is not a gaming phone, and if you play anything but casual titles, you&apos;ll see a lot of jitter and unstable framerates.</p>

<p>The phone is sold in a single variant, and it has 12GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. Again, it isn&apos;t the latest storage or memory standard available today, but there are no issues in usability, and with the MicroSD slot, you can easily boost the addressable storage to up to 2TB.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xFyEh2KscUnRcFk6xk5uhB" name="moondrop-miad01-8.jpg" alt="Moondrop MIAD01 with Venus headset's 4.4mm cable plugged into the device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xFyEh2KscUnRcFk6xk5uhB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the connectivity side of things, the MIAD01 has Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, NFC, and a limited selection of 5G bands: 1/3/5/7/8/20/28/41/77/78. The in-display fingerprint sensor is fast to authenticate and doesn&apos;t have any issues with reliability, but it is located a little lower on the screen.</p><p>Switching over to the battery, the MIAD01 has a 5000mAh battery that lasts a day consistently. There&apos;s no charger in the box, but the phone uses the USB PD 3.0 standard, and goes up to 33W. It&apos;s annoying that Moondrop didn&apos;t bundle a charger in the box, but as you can use any USB PD charger, it isn&apos;t too much of a hassle.</p><p>Most other mid-range phones have better hardware and connectivity, and it&apos;s clear that Moondrop didn&apos;t set out to create a powerful phone; the focus is instead on delivering the best audio performance, and it managed to achieve that.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-moondrop-miad01-cameras"><span>Moondrop MIAD01: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bvXJqiZg2a9SfjiAj7MvXH" name="moondrop-miad01-26.jpg" alt="Moondrop MIAD01 back view with camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bvXJqiZg2a9SfjiAj7MvXH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Tuning the cameras on a phone takes a lot of resources and effort, and it&apos;s not something smaller brands can manage. This is evident when using the MIAD01; the phone has outdated sensors and no camera tuning whatsoever, and the result is that it takes sub-par shots in any given situation.</p><p>What&apos;s particularly telling is that even the brand doesn&apos;t think the cameras are up to scratch, as it notes in its marketing materials: it&apos;s not good, but it works. That sums up the state of the cameras on the MIAD01, and I don&apos;t really have much to add to that.</p><p>The MIAD01 has a 64MP f/1.9 main camera that uses a Sony IMX686 sensor, and it is joined by an 8MP OmniVision OV8856 wide-angle lens, and a 32MP camera at the front that features OmniVision&apos;s OV32B sensor. The interface is similar to what you get on most phones; the shooting modes are arranged in a ribbon at the bottom, and you get toggles throughout the viewfinder.</p>

<p>Daylight shots are passable at best, with the phone able to deliver decent colors in outdoor scenarios with good lighting. There are issues with focusing, foliage rendition isn&apos;t accurate, and the AI mode tends to oversaturate colors. The wide-angle lens isn&apos;t worth the hassle; it is barely usable in daylight situations, and the resultant shots have muted colors and graining.</p><p>When it comes to low-light conditions, the MIAD01 is objectively the worst camera I&apos;ve used in a very long time. There&apos;s so much noise that it reminds me of phones from over a decade ago, and you don&apos;t even get a Night mode.</p><p>I used phones with the IMX686 quite a bit, and the sensor itself isn&apos;t at fault — it has the potential to deliver great photos. This is down to the software, and it is possible to get decent shots by installing a different camera utility. On that note, the MIAD01 has level 3 Camera2 API integration, so you should be able to install an aftermarket utility like GCam and get much better photos. </p>

<p>It&apos;s a monumental undertaking to design a custom Android skin, and most smaller brands choose to use a vanilla interface with limited customizability. That&apos;s the case with the MIAD01 as well; it has a plain UI that doesn&apos;t have any overt styling, and that&apos;s a good move. You get a standard notification pane, large toggles, and Material You accent colors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="St4uNLPJT8u4jZ3SZRGZdK" name="moondrop-miad01-30.jpg" alt="Icons on Moondrop MIAD01" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/St4uNLPJT8u4jZ3SZRGZdK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest annoyance is the stylized icons, and this makes the UI look a bit chintzy; this is similar to what Chinese manufacturers did a half-decade ago. The device runs the November 2023 security update out of the box, but there is an OTA available that installs the May 2024 update. However, you&apos;re still limited to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a>, with no mention of when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> will become available.</p>
<p>There isn&apos;t much else to talk about the software. The overall UI is unfinished, and it reminds me of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Nothing Phone 1</a> back when it launched; you get all the requisite features, but there isn&apos;t any customizability.</p>
<p>Another egregious omission is the Play Store and associated Google services — you&apos;ll need to sideload these onto the device, so if that&apos;s not something you&apos;re willing to do, you should consider another phone. Once you have it installed, it&apos;s easy enough to set up the phone the way you want.</p><p>Updates are also an unknown, and while the brand hasn&apos;t shared how many platform versions the device will receive, it&apos;s a good bet that it won&apos;t go beyond <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> — if that.</p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> is now available, but that device is costlier at $500, and while it has better hardware, the Pixel 7a is a great value — particularly if you can get it at a discount. As with most phones these days, there&apos;s no 3.5mm jack on the device, so you will need to invest in a dongle DAC if you&apos;re interested in pairing the phone with IEMs or a balanced headset.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> is a terrific option to consider, with the phone offering standout hardware and decent cameras at the back.

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a phone with 3.5mm and 4.4mm jacks</li><li>You need great sound quality</li><li>You want a phone that's also a digital audio player</li><li>You need a MicroSD slot</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want polished software</li><li>You use the cameras a lot</li><li>You want the Play Store preinstalled</li><li>You need timely updates</li></ul>
<p>The way I think of the MIAD01 is that it is a sleek digital audio player with a 5G modem. The design is closer to other mid-range phones, and while the in-hand feel isn&apos;t great thanks to the asymmetrical curves, it is light. The biggest selling point of the device is the fact that you get 3.5mm and 4.4mm ports, and the sound quality is on par with most dongle DACs — no small feat. The MIAD01 can easily drive planar headsets, so that isn&apos;t an issue.</p><p>There are other things the device gets right; the 6.7-inch 120Hz OLED panel has good colors and is great in daily use, and the 5000mAh battery lasts a day with ease. I would have liked better hardware, because as it stands, the Dimensity 1080 doesn&apos;t quite measure up to demanding tasks. Similarly, the cameras just aren&apos;t in the same league as other $400 phones.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the software. You get a clean interface without too much bloatware, but it doesn&apos;t have much in the way of features. You&apos;ll need to sideload Google&apos;s services before the phone becomes usable, and it&apos;s still on Android 13. Considering the state of the software, there&apos;s no telling when it will switch to Android 14, much less Android 15.</p><p>That said, the built-in ports and decent DAC make the MIAD01 stand out quite a bit, and if you&apos;re interested in a digital audio player that doubles as a phone, then yes, it is worthy of consideration. It isn&apos;t as good as a standalone player or a regular phone, but as a two-in-one device that lets you listen to high-res music on the go, the MIAD01 is unrivaled.</p>

<p>AI took center stage at this year&apos;s<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog"> Google I/O</a>, so much so that it was used 121 times throughout the presentation. Since AI is now at the core of most Android devices and operating systems, here are some of the new updates that were discussed at this year&apos;s event—specifically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/google-ai-android-update-io-2024/#gemini-nano">catering to Android users</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that caught our eye at this year&apos;s I/O, which is the most useful add-on to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, is phishing scam detection.</p><p>Google is introducing software that enables users to detect unknown phishing/spam calls in real time. They&apos;re currently testing a feature that uses Gemini Nano to provide alerts during calls if it detects that the unidentified caller uses speech patterns associated with scams. </p><p>Imagine a user getting a call from an unknown/private number asking them to transfer funds as their current account could be compromised, requesting personal information like card numbers, pins, or passwords. Gemini will immediately show users a red warning sign on the phone screen that reads "likely spam," asking the user to end the call, along with a short description of why Gemini thinks it could be a threat.  </p><p>Google says the conversation is encrypted and private to the user. They will share more information for users to opt-in "later this year." This feature could come in handy specifically for older users or even children, who might be unaware and get looped into multiple scams that have been doing the rounds. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve all heard about the magic of AI with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to search</a> ever since Samsung&apos;s Unpacked event. Google says it&apos;s now taking this further by getting its Language Learning Model to solve math or physics problems when prompted. This turns the feature into a personalized tutor that shows you how to solve a math problem and gives you examples from your daily life to help you understand tough physics concepts.</p><p>The tech giant says this will give users the answer to those word problems and a step-wise explanation of how to solve them. The company also teases more upgrades later this year that will help students analyze and solve problems involving symbolic formulas, diagrams, and graphs.</p>

<p>Additionally, Google announced a faster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Gemini 1.5</a> model, and with it, Android users will soon be able to bring up Gemini on top of any app. With AI integrated into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, users can get creative by generating fun AI images and dropping them into various apps like Gmail and Google messages or even creating memes to add to their chats.</p><p>With "Ask this video" and "Ask this PDF," users will be able to get more information about a YouTube video they&apos;re watching or get answers about a PDF without the need to scroll through pages of information.</p><p>While Google didn&apos;t give us details about when we can see these tricks on our phones, we can expect them to roll out in the "next few months."</p>

<p>Finally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">Gemini Nano</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-1-5-next-gen-ai-model">Multimodality</a> will give the already existing TalkBack option more "powers." This means that Android phones can process text with a better understanding of sounds, sights, and even spoken language. </p><p>TalkBack is a tool that helps people who experience blindness or low vision by reading out loud accurate descriptions of what’s happening in an image, so an upgrade like this could be very beneficial. For instance, when an image of a dress is shared, the TalkBack option will describe the dress&apos;s exact color, the length of the sleeves, and other accessories that go with it, helping the user visualize the dress effectively without looking at it. </p><p>Google says these descriptions are generated in real-time and don&apos;t need a network connection, as Gemini Nano will work directly on the user&apos;s device. </p>

<p>Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be coming to Pixel phones later this year. However, it remains unclear which models will receive this. We&apos;ll have to watch for those monthly updates to see when new features start rolling out.</p>

There are a lot of reasons to do so; between Google&apos;s camera wizardry with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> and Samsung delivering a stunning overall package with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, there has never been a better time to switch to Android.</p><p>The best part is that Google makes it very straightforward to switch your contacts, messages, emails, photos, documents, and other data over to Android without any hassle. Google&apos;s suite of services cover everything you need, with Google Calendar, Chrome, Drive, Gmail, Messages, and Photos offering a robust set of features with a polished user interface.</p><p>I switch between Android phones on a weekly basis and use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> as my secondary phone, so I know what I&apos;m talking about when it comes to transferring data between platforms. So if you&apos;re mulling a switch or have already bought an Android phone, here&apos;s how to seamlessly migrate your data from your iPhone over to Android.</p>

<p>There are several ways to transfer your contacts, photos, videos, messages, and documents from your iPhone over to Android, and in this post I&apos;m going to highlight the option that has worked best for me. Starting with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a>, Google made it easy to migrate data from iOS when setting up a new Android phone, and that is the method I&apos;ll be using.</p><p>I&apos;m transferring all the content stored on an iPhone 14 Pro to a Google Pixel 7 for this guide, and regardless of what iPhone you&apos;re using, the flow will be identical. To get started, you&apos;ll need to switch on your Android phone and have the iPhone handy as we&apos;ll have to connect both phones via a cable to transfer content. You can do this wirelessly as well, but you won&apos;t be able to transfer messages — including WhatsApp message history — locally-stored music on your device, and apps.</p><p>By using a cable, you&apos;ll be able to automatically install all the apps on your iPhone via the Play Store on your new Android phone, saving you the hassle of doing so manually. This works only for free apps, and you will need to buy paid apps again on the Play Store. As for the cable in question, you will need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Powerline-Lightning-Connector-Certified/dp/B07H256MBK">buy a Lightning to USB-C cable</a> to connect both phones. New iPhones come with USB-C, so you can just use a standard USB-C to USB-C cable, but if you&apos;re using an iPhone 14 or older model, you&apos;ll need the Lightning to USB-C cable. </p><p>Also, while this method is great for migrating data that&apos;s already on your iPhone, it doesn&apos;t take iCloud into account. If you have a lot of photos and videos stored in iCloud, I&apos;ll show you how to transfer that over to Google Photos below.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-migrate-data-from-iphone-to-android"><span>How to migrate data from iPhone to Android</span></h3>
<p>Got the cable and both phones ready? Here&apos;s how to get started with the data transfer on your Android phone:</p>
<p>1. Switch on the Pixel and select <strong>Get started</strong>.</p><p><strong>2. Insert the SIM card</strong> from your iPhone to the Pixel. If you&apos;re using eSIM, select <strong>Download a SIM instead</strong> to migrate the number.</p><p>3. Connect to your <strong>home Wi-Fi network</strong>.</p>

<p>4. You should now get to the <strong>Copy apps & data</strong> section. Hit <strong>Next </strong>to get started.</p><p>5. Select <strong>Next </strong>at the <strong>Use your old device</strong> page.</p><p>6. Hit <strong>Next </strong>the <strong>Find your old device&apos;s cable</strong> page.</p>

<p>7. Now you&apos;ll need to connect both devices via a cable. Unlock your iPhone and plug in the cable. Once you&apos;ve done so, hit <strong>Next </strong>at the <strong>Insert cable into your old device</strong> page.</p><p>8. Connect the <strong>other end of the cable</strong> to your Pixel.</p><p>9. Doing so will surface a <strong>dialog box on the iPhone</strong> asking if you trust the device. Select <strong>Trust </strong>to continue and enter your iPhone passcode. If you don&apos;t get this dialog box, remove the cable and try connecting again.</p>

<p>19. Google has a service similar to iCloud called Google One that backs up photos and videos. If you want to back up photos and videos you take on your Pixel to Google One, select <strong>Turn On</strong>. Every user gets 15GB as standard, and there are 200GB, 2TB, 5TB, and 10TB plans also available.</p><p>20. You&apos;ll be able to <strong>set a PIN</strong> and add biometric authentication at the next page. Press down on the in-screen fingerprint reader to set up fingerprint unlock.</p><p>21.

<p>22. You can continue setting up the Pixel by hitting Continue.</p><p>23. If you want to use <strong>Google Assistant</strong> — it does a better job than Siri — select <strong>I agree</strong>.</p><p>24. You&apos;ll need to <strong>set up Google Assistant</strong>, and give it access to run on the lock screen. Hit <strong>I agree</strong> if you want the feature.</p>

<p>25. Google has a few <strong>extra services</strong> that are unique to the Pixels. You can set these up right now or later in the settings.</p><p>26. If you&apos;re just getting started with Android, you may want to agree to getting guides on how to use your Pixel.</p><p>27. The <strong>data will now transfer over</strong> to your Pixel, and you&apos;ll see a progress bar showing how many minutes it will take.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.00%;"><img id="qWtRzUGRDvLCQVPMS7iQrj" name="switch-iphone-to-android-5.jpeg" alt="How to switch from iPhone to Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qWtRzUGRDvLCQVPMS7iQrj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1450" height="986" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>28. Once that&apos;s finished, you&apos;ll se a message notifying you to <strong>remove the cable</strong> connecting both devices. Hit <strong>Done </strong>to continue.</p><p>29. The next page offers instructions on how to turn off iMessage on your iPhone. I&apos;ll have screenshots of this in the section below, so hit <strong>Done</strong>.</p><p>30. You&apos;re all set! The data has transferred over to your Android device, and you&apos;re ready to get started.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1376px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.51%;"><img id="EUkBmHgeq6cHpshdYoZjUj" name="switch-iphone-to-android-4.jpeg" alt="How to switch from iPhone to Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EUkBmHgeq6cHpshdYoZjUj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1376" height="984" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the easiest way to migrate data from your iPhone to Android, as it ensures all your contacts, messages, calendar entries, documents, photos, and videos are transferred over in one go without any hassle. Otherwise, you would have to manually add everything to Google Drive and then make the switch; thankfully, that&apos;s not the case now. </p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-remember-to-turn-off-imessage"><span>Remember to turn off iMessage</span></h3>
<p>A key point to remember when switching over to Android is to turn off iMessage. If you don&apos;t do this, you will not get messages from other iPhone users. Here&apos;s how to do so on your iPhone:</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Navigate to <strong>Messages</strong>.</p><p><strong>3. Disable the toggle for iMessage</strong> to turn the feature off.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-migrate-icloud-data-to-google-photos"><span>How to migrate iCloud data to Google Photos</span></h3>
<p>Got a lot of photos and videos in iCloud? You can easily transfer the data into Google Photos, and Google allows you to import albums en masse. Note that this method works for albums you&apos;ve created — shared albums you&apos;re a part of won&apos;t count. Smart albums and Photo stream content don&apos;t migrate either.</p><p>There are two ways to transfer photos and videos stored in iCloud to Google Photos. You can import albums from your iPhone directly into Google Photos, or request a transfer of your data. If you&apos;re switching platforms and have a lot of data, the second method is the way to go. This is what you&apos;ll need to do:</p>
<p>1. Go to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://privacy.apple.com/">privacy.apple.com</a> and sign in with your <strong>Apple ID</strong>.</p><p>2. Choose <strong>Transfer a copy of your data</strong>.</p><p>3. You&apos;ll get a page asking where you&apos;d like to transfer the data. Choose <strong>Google Photos</strong>. Select if you want to transfer both photos and videos or just photos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1376px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.88%;"><img id="A7quktMjnVR7tfiqr2ySQj" name="switch-iphone-to-android-2.jpeg" alt="How to switch from iPhone to Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A7quktMjnVR7tfiqr2ySQj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1376" height="934" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>4. <strong>Sign in</strong> with your Google account.</p><p>5. Select <strong>Continue</strong> to initiate the data transfer.</p><p>6. You&apos;ll be able to see the size of photos and videos being transferred over to <strong>Google Photos</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.29%;"><img id="FxwnzTHaiHQYo9CPWRN9Lj" name="switch-iphone-to-android-1.jpeg" alt="How to switch from iPhone to Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FxwnzTHaiHQYo9CPWRN9Lj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1400" height="984" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The migration will take a few days based on the amount of data that&apos;s stored in iCloud, and you will need to make sure you have enough storage in Google Photos. Google provides 15GB of data for free with the account, and if you need more, you&apos;ll need to pick up a Google One plan.</p><p>The transfer migrates albums in their entirety, but note that if you have more than 20,000 photos in an album, the additional images aren&apos;t added to the album — that&apos;s a Google Photos limitation. Videos are also transferred over as well, but they won&apos;t be in their albums. You&apos;ll get an email once the transfer is finished, and you&apos;ll be able to see the status of the request by heading to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://privacy.apple.com/account">privacy.apple.com/account</a>.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-about-music"><span>What about music?</span></h3>
<p>If you use Apple Music on your iPhone, you&apos;ll be able to continue using the same service on Android as well. Apple Music works particularly well on Android, and you&apos;ll be able to continue using the service the same way you did on your iPhone. You can also use AirPods with your Android phone, and if you&apos;re interested in what else is available, you should take a look at our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a> guide.</p>

<p>With a vibrant device ecosystem and extensive customizability, Android brings a lot to the table. There isn&apos;t as much of a learning curve, and you&apos;ll be pleasantly astonished by a few things that Android does better than iOS: notification management, file system access, easy (and secure) sharing of documents and photos, and a whole lot more. </p><p>You may want to browse <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://guidebooks.google.com/android">Google&apos;s Guidebooks</a> that provides a good walkthrough of all the features available. </p>

<p>With Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">I/O 2024</a> behind us, the company is explaining a few new goodies that are on the way for its Workspace apps.</p><p>The company explained in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/google-gemini-workspace-may-2024-updates/">Keyword post</a> that Gemini is preparing to roll out a few extra updates for Gmail users on Android. The idea is to help users remain productive, which is where email summaries come into play. Google states Gemini will analyze an email thread and provide a summary filled with the most important points discussed by you and others.</p><p>This will arrive for Workspace Labs users in May with all Gemini for Workspace customers and Google One AI Premium subscribers in June.</p>

<p>Contextual smart replies, which aren&apos;t new in Gmail, are getting an AI boost courtesy of Gemini. The post highlights the model&apos;s ability to help users with more "detailed and nuanced" suggestions based on a given conversation in an email. Users will have the chance to edit Gemini&apos;s suggested reply if they don&apos;t want to send it as offered.</p><p>Workspace Labs users on mobile and the web will pick this up in July.</p><p>Gmail is also primed to pick up a "Q&A" feature via its sidebar on Android, powered by Gemini. Tapping the Gemini star icon in the app will produce a menu with a few pre-made options. Users can input their questions, such as ones that ask the AI to give a quick overview of important questions involving a user&apos;s book club. Gemini will scour your emails and pick out questions that should have your attention.</p><p>This feature will arrive for Workspace Labs users on mobile and the web in July.</p>

<p>Gemini&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">1.5 Pro model</a> is on its way for several of Google&apos;s Workspace apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Slides, and Sheets today (May 14). The AI&apos;s appearance will bring a longer context window and "more advanced reasoning." In short, Google states Gemini will be able to answer a wider range of user questions for better assistance.</p><p>Regarding the increased context window, the post highlights Gemini&apos;s ability to gather and understand more of a user&apos;s data. Additionally, it can provide helpful insights for users using their emails, content in Drive, and more. Users are also gaining the ability to type "@" in Drive to find a specific document they&apos;re looking for. </p><p>This can turn into a query for Gemini in which you can ask it for specific information found within that document, like contact information.</p><p>Gemini for the Workspace side panel is available now for Workspace Labs users and Gemini for Workspace Alpha users. Next month, Google plans to extend its reach to businesses and consumers on the desktop through Gemini for Workspace add-ons and the Google One AI Premium tier.</p><p>Lastly, Google&apos;s handy "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-generative-ai">help me write</a>" tool in Gmail and Docs is starting to arrive in more languages. The company states that the feature will support Spanish and Portuguese on the desktop. More language support is on the horizon, though when they could arrive is currently unknown.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>At Google I/O 2024, Google announced Project Astra, a multimodal AI assistant.</li><li>In its filmed demo, a Google engineer wears AR glasses that film your surroundings for Gemini to respond to.</li><li>We've heard rumors about Project Iris, Google's AR prototype, but Google hasn't officially announced anything. </li></ul>
<p>The first day of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">Google I/O 2024</a> went all-in on AI, neglecting any mention of hardware we hoped to see like the Pixel 9 or Pixel Fold 2. But one unannounced Google hardware project made a blink-and-you-miss-it appearance: a secret AR glasses prototype that looks surprisingly consumer-ready.</p><p>Demoing several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Gemini AI upgrades</a>, Google revealed Project Astra, a real-time multimodal AI from the Google DeepMind team that looks at your surroundings through a camera and answers your questions based on that visual context. </p><p>You can watch the demo below. And if you jump to 1:25, you can see the moment when the Google engineer puts on a thick-rimmed pair of glasses before the camera view changes to her eyeline. </p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXVvvRhiGjI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Google didn&apos;t call attention to these glasses, and we don&apos;t know what they&apos;re called. But they&apos;re clearly AR glasses, given the holographic dot and text in the visual center that displays Gemini AI answers to her questions. Google claims it was "captured in a single take, in real time," which suggests the footage is real and undoctored. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses</a> also have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-ai-update">AI question function</a>, but with photo snapshots instead of video and Meta AI instead of Gemini. Plus, it has no visual way to show the AI&apos;s answer, relying solely on audio. That&apos;s where Google&apos;s mysterious AR glasses would potentially step things up. </p><p>We&apos;ve waited for a Google Glass successor for years. Behind the scenes, we knew about Google&apos;s "Project Iris," alleged VR/AR glasses with real-time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-smart-glasses-google-io-2022">Google Translate capabilities</a>. Alleged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ar-glasses-problems-behind-scenes">Iris project difficulties</a> had us worried that Iris might never come to fruition. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oYWDsk5xBW4xwuPcfYAHfD" name="Google-IO-2024-AR-glasses.jpeg" alt="A screenshot from the Google I/O presentation showing a Google engineer wearing AR glasses with a camera and Gemini AI capabilities." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oYWDsk5xBW4xwuPcfYAHfD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">You get a brief glimpse of the Google engineer wearing the AR glasses prototype in the Astra demo </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This demo, however, has us wondering whether Google might be able to sell AR glasses powered by Gemini AI sooner than we anticipated. That would certainly be more exciting than many of the straightforward Google I/O 2024 AI demos today, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">AI Overview search summaries</a>.</p><p>Google&apos;s big XR project is developing mixed-reality software (AndroidXR) for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung&apos;s upcoming XR headset</a>, supposedly due out this year. In theory, Google&apos;s Iris AR glasses could follow after Samsung&apos;s headset with its own spin on AndroidXR, designed to be worn out in the world. </p><p>Imagine Google AR glasses that can interpret your surroundings in real time, along with other Google app capabilities like Google Maps directions or real-time Google Translate. If it&apos;s really coming soon, that could spice up a rather dull I/O presentation.</p>

While they were initially a tool those in its Labs experimental realm could test, the company states that AI Overviews will roll out to all users today (May 14) in the U.S. Folks in other countries can expect the useful overview for queries, but it will take place at a later date.</p><p>Additionally, the ability for users to "adjust" their overview. Google states users will find options to simplify the AI&apos;s language or break things down into more understandable pieces. This feature is slated to arrive in Search Labs "soon" for English queries in the U.S.</p>

<p>Search is picking up a couple of extra features, such as planning. Google highlights the engine&apos;s upcoming AI-backed ability to help users plan meals or vacations. The company states that searching for "create a 3-day meal plan for a group that’s easy to prepare" will produce a day-by-day breakdown in Search. Detailed recipes, where to begin, and more will be readily available in easily visible cards.</p><p>Users can then follow up and ask the AI to swap some recipes for ones that would fit a vegetarian or swap ideas for ones that fit dinner plans. An export button will appear so users can toss their plans into Docs or Gmail.</p><p>Meal and trip planning are set to arrive in Search Labs (English) for U.S. users "later this year." The AI ability to help plan for parties, date nights, and workouts is on the docket but there&apos;s no concrete date set yet.</p><p>Lastly, Google is bringing some organization to its AI-powered results. The post states that users looking for ideas on where to eat and more will find a results page that clearly breaks down several possible places of interest. The AI will help by creating headlines to separate different perspectives and content types.</p><p>A more organized AI-powered results page is beginning to arrive for U.S. users for dining and recipes. Later, Google states it has plans to incorporate movies, music, books, hotels, shopping, and more.</p>

<ul><li>During I/O 2024, Google highlighted several new features for the Play Store that developers can begin experimenting with.</li><li>Such features include better app searching, discoverability for specific devices, payment features, and security.</li><li>Google states users and developers can expect more to come in the weeks ahead.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s I/O day and Google is highlighting several new tools arriving for the Play Store that developers can use to better the user experience.</p><p>Google stated in a press release that the Play Store&apos;s app categories are in for a tune-up. To do this, the company states developers can extend their app&apos;s reach to users outside of the store with the new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/preview">Engage SDK</a>." Google adds that this new "surface" should help app developers highlight the "most important" piece of content in a user&apos;s app and launch "immersive, full-screen" experiences.</p><p>Such experiences would be fueled by a user&apos;s recommendations alongside any promotions the developers wish to show.</p><p>Google then reiterated its recent updates to Play Games on PC, Play Points, and more, which it discussed during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/03/key-product-updates-from-2024-google-for-games-developer-summit.html">Developer Summit</a> in March.</p><p>Custom store listings are set to arrive, giving unique details based on the keywords users have searched. Google states the Play Console will give developers tailor-made suggestions that could help their app reach a new target audience. "Cross-device discovery" is also on its way. This will help users interested in using an app on multiple devices.</p><p>The post states that an app&apos;s details will display screenshots, ratings, and reviews for different devices like phones, tablets, etc. Search filters will also benefit from this, as users can discover an app for whichever device they desire. Deep linking is said to help developers improve a user&apos;s app experience by sending them to a "relevant" page within the app for content, bookings, shopping, and more.</p><p>Security is a big part of the Google Play Store, so the company is opening its SDK Console to all SDKs for developers. In short, this gives developers a centralized place to view usage stats and tools to fix issues and information on following the store&apos;s various policies.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mwpx3vHjs2gwrmDtG86kpa" name="Google-IO-2023-logo.jpeg" alt="Google I/O logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mwpx3vHjs2gwrmDtG86kpa.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3200" height="1800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some "enhanced app-release tools" are making their way to developers. These are a set of pre-release checks to ensure that your app meets all the right quality points in terms of UI for a swift, uninhibited launch. There will also be a place to discard unwanted releases. Google states that this feature should help developers avoid "accidental updates."</p><p>A few features are entering the scene to help developers protect their products against "unauthorized" folk. Google states that "App Access Risk" is now in public beta and is designed to let app creators know if another app is capturing a user&apos;s screen or controlling their device. "Play Protect Verdict" acts like a safety net, alerting the app about the status of Play Protect and if there is any malware present on a user&apos;s device.</p><p>Developers also receive "recent device activity," which helps them weed out devices sending automated traffic or signs of an attack.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BZYwNpCHPh7WNyifZd2J4H" name="google-pixel-8a-back-bay-01.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 8a in the Bay blue colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BZYwNpCHPh7WNyifZd2J4H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Optimizations for revenue in the Play Store are arriving via extended payment options. Google highlighted its previous expansion of Pix in Brazil and UPI in India. However, users can now ask another to purchase an app or in-app content for them through a shareable Play Store link. This will begin for users in India and will likely go to more places if all goes well.</p><p>Additionally, Google adds that parents with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7103337?sjid=2881579024856471107-NC">Google Family</a> setup can approve their child&apos;s purchase on any Android OS.</p><p>Developers are picking up more revenue-based options such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10532353">recommended pricing</a> to better fit with any economic changes. The Play Store is said to begin displaying badges such as "best selling," "trending," and "popular" to help consumers make an informed choice.</p><p>Lastly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.play.billingtestcompanion">Play Billing Lab</a> app will help developers playtest new payment features for users <em>before </em>rolling them out. The app is designed to help better the one-time payment experiences and subscription plans.</p><p>With developer previews scheduled, the company states will have more updates in the "weeks to come."</p>

And again, if $80 per month feels too steep, there&apos;s a ton of potential for savings if you&apos;re already a Verizon wireless subscriber. </p><p>Either way, the value of a $200 Home Depot gift card or a Nintendo Switch makes this seem like a pretty good time to try Verizon&apos;s 5G Home Internet. And if you don&apos;t like it, you can always take advantage of the provider&apos;s 30-day money-back guarantee.</p>

<ul><li>Google introduced an advanced AI feature for Google Photos, powered by Gemini AI, to enhance the platform's robust search capabilities.</li><li>This new tool, dubbed "Ask Photos," allows users to find specific images in their gallery by interacting with Gemini through typed queries.</li><li>Although currently limited to text input, the feature is expected to receive updates, including voice input and further enhancements to the search functionality.</li></ul>

<p>At the 2024 I/O conference, Google CEO Sundar Pichai showcased a new AI feature for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> that&apos;s intended to enhance the service&apos;s already strong search features, thanks to Gemini AI.</p><p>The search giant introduced a new feature called "Ask Photos," designed to let you find specific images in your gallery by chatting with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ask Photos, a new feature coming to @GooglePhotos, makes it easier to search across your photos and videos with the help of Gemini models. It goes beyond simple search to understand context and answer more complex questions. #GoogleIO pic.twitter.com/OsYXZLo5S1<a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1790428759700463632">May 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Photos&apos; new feature, rolling out later this summer with more capabilities, will let users search their photo collection using natural language. This relies on AI to understand the content of the photos and other metadata.</p><p>The new feature enhances typical image searches, with Gemini able to recognize specific content in images. Google demonstrated this by using a car license plate as an example. When asked about a specific plate number on a particular car model, Google Photos could identify and display the correct license plate details.</p><p>Right now, if you want to find a specific license plate, you&apos;d have to scroll through loads of car photos. But with the new AI feature, it&apos;s much smarter. It figures out which car you&apos;re looking for based on its location and how often it&apos;s shown up in your photos over the years. Then, it gives you the license plate number in a text response and shows you a photo to confirm it&apos;s right.</p><p>Other details like upload date and location will also help speed up searches when you use a prompt or ask a question. Plus, you&apos;ll be able to use <em>Ask Photos</em> with videos as well.</p>

<p>The feature will appear as a new tab at the bottom of the Photos app. When you tap on that tab, you&apos;ll see the Gemini icon and a welcome message over a bar that invites you to "search or ask about Photos."</p><p>For now, you&apos;ll need to type your queries into <em>Ask Photos</em>—voice input isn&apos;t available yet. But when it rolls out, the regular search bar in your Photos app will get an upgrade to <em>Ask Photos</em> instead.</p>
