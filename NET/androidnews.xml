<h2 id="when-do-the-cyber-monday-sales-start-2">When do the Cyber Monday sales start?</h2>
<p>We&apos;re in that strange transitional period between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Some retailers, like Amazon, are expected to extend their Black Friday deals through the weekend and simply slap a new label on them, while other sites may end their discounts this evening and drop a fresh batch of deals first thing next week. Needless to say, we&apos;ll continue sharing all of the best deals as they go live or expire, so keep checking our site for the latest news.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've been using the Roku Ultra (2024) for over a month now and can confidently call it the best Roku ever made. If you're a Roku fan or are just looking to upgrade your old TV with a fresh suite of new apps, this early Cyber Monday deal makes the Roku Ultra (2024) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Ultra-2024-Streaming-Rechargeable/dp/B0DF44RTTP/"><strong>just $79.99</strong></a> for a limited time.</p><p>I picked up the Roku Ultra (2024) because my 2017 LG OLED was starting to have trouble with streaming apps and was even missing quite a few new services. The Roku Ultra (2024) has every single app and streaming service I could imagine, plus tons of free movies, TV shows, live TV, and more built right in.</p><p>It's also got <em>excellent</em> 4K picture quality with Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision HDR support, which made shows like Rings of Power season 2 look even better than they did when I streamed them from my TV's Prime Video app. I could have picked up an Nvidia Shield but that thing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM">is nearly $200</a>! Forget that nonsense.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You've got an aging TV that's getting slow and laggy, or just need a new streaming box that's capable of the best picture quality imaginable.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need native Google Cast support. Roku has all the apps and services you can imagine but it still doesn't support Google Cast.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/switching-from-chromecast-webos-to-roku">I recently wrote</a>, the Roku Ultra (2024)'s one weakness is a lack of Google Cast support. I've still got my old Chromecast hooked up to the TV for those rare times that I need to cast something obscure from my phone, which is annoying but not the end of the world.</p><p>Most phone apps support Roku casting — and many phones will cast to Roku via Miracast or Apple AirPlay — making this less of an issue than it used to be. Still, if Roku could add Google Cast, this would be the ultimate affordable streaming box.</p><p>But the overall experience has been so good that I've mostly forgotten about this small negative. The remote itself is reason enough to upgrade from an old Roku. It's backlit, charges via USB-C, has hands-free voice control, and there's even a button on the right side of the Roku Ultra (2024) that helps you find a lost remote.</p><p>Plus, with Wi-Fi 6 and Ethernet support, you'll never have issues with buffering or lagging again.</p>

A physical power button on the side makes it possible to use even without Wi-Fi but, of course, these are built with smart homes in mind so it makes the most sense to hook it up to an existing system.</p><p>TP-Link Kasa smart plugs support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a>, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, Apple HomeKit, and just about any other smart home system you can think of. Matter makes these <em>stupid</em> easy to set up — I got a pop-up on my phone automatically the first time I plugged one into the wall — so you can connect them and move on with your day.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want to monitor energy usage of devices throughout your home, or are just looking to be able to add "dumb" devices to your smart home for more automation.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You already have smart devices that allow you to monitor energy usage.</p><p>I primarily use these smart plugs to add remote control functionality and automation of non-smart devices to my smart home. I've got them hooked up to lamps in several rooms, a space heater in my basement office, and occasionally move some around the house to monitor the energy usage of various electronic gadgets.</p><p>Because of it, I've learned that it's cheaper on most winter days to run two larger space heaters in the house than to use my central HVAC unit.</p>

<p>All you need to do is type in what your power company charges per kilowatt-hour (kWh) — you can find this on your power bill — and the Kasa app does the rest. This helped me dwindle my power bill down substantially over the past few months and I now enjoy a little bit of wiggle room I didn't previously have in my budget.</p><p>A 4-pack is plenty if you're just looking to monitor energy usage and identify problem devices — basically anything can be plugged into these smart plugs — but you may want to get a few more if you're planning on leaving them plugged in to provide smart functionality to existing non-smart devices.</p>

<p>I never like to spend my Saturday time trying to sell anything. Saturday has been my day to just write stuff about things I enjoy or things I think need to be said.

But I do know it's a solid phone that will do everything I need it to do without a stupidly large price. And it flips, so it's 600% cooler than my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>.</p>

<p>I've no interest in a phone that's already too big folding out into a phone that's way too damn big, so I'm going to ignore phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> Super Duper or whatever it's called. Work on your phone names, guys. I mean, come on.</p><p>But a phone that folds into a small square is right up my alley. I love the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Flip</a>, but since I got a chance to fondle a Moto Razr, I decided that it's what I want. Motorola's Laissez-faire attitude towards support updates has me a little concerned, but I decided <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-giving-motorola-another-chance">I want to give them a chance</a> and trust they will do what they promised and be better.</p>
<p>And the Razr (Minus) isn't perfect, either. It still has plastic over the screen and there's a ridge running through the middle when it's open and neither of these is ideal. There are concessions one has to make if one wants a phone that folds over on itself, though.</p><p>What I like about it outweighs what I don't. For starters, the price. I think asking close to $1,000 for a phone should be a crime. I can buy an old truck and a full tank of gas for that kind of money and still have enough left to take the misses to Red Robin for a burger. The Razr, even when it's not on sale, is the price a foldable phone should start at. Make a Plus or Pro or whatever version for the people who want to spend more money, and this is where Motorola gets it right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:828px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:30.68%;"><img id="CQ9BxCW7NKjCc8z9ZiN8Le" name="Moto-razr-cart" alt="Motorola Razr 2024 in a shopping cart" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CQ9BxCW7NKjCc8z9ZiN8Le.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="828" height="254" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also like having a screen out front to tell me why my phone is yelling at me so I can decide if I care about it or not. If I see a message, I'll probably answer. If it's just an email or a chat message from Slack, then no way, Jose, you can wait until I feel like looking (sorry, not sorry). You can do that with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-make-lock-screen-notifications-less-obtrusive-in-android-15-qpr2">lock screen notifications</a>, but having it on the little screen on the front is just cooler. At least to me, and this is <em>my</em> money we're talking about here.</p><p>Besides that, it folds into a small package that can fit into any pocket. I like that. I don't know why, but I do. Again, my money. Seriously though, if you're in a wheelchair, keeping your phone in a shirt pocket is a godsend. Flipping it shut means it will slip right in there.</p>
<p>I haven't bought it yet. I stuck it in my cart once I saw the sale price with the idea that I'll check it once all this Black Friday/Cyber Monday mess is done and I know how much money I'm willing to spend. Gotta buy them Christmas presents for the grandbabies, you know?</p><p>I know I'm going to end up doing it, even though I might want to kick myself for it. I don't <em>need</em> a phone; I just <em>want</em> this phone.</p>

<ul><li>A leaker with a reliable track record revealed that Nothing has three phones in active development.</li><li>We already know that Nothing is working on a Phone 3, which is slated for release in 2025.</li><li>The other two rumored devices could be a more premium Nothing Phone 3 Pro or Phone 3a, though that is only speculation at the moment.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing decided not to release a new flagship in 2024, instead <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">choosing to focus on developing AI features</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-os-2-review">Nothing OS</a>, and eventually Phone 3. The move made sense, because the industry leaders — including Apple, Google, and Samsung — have all done the exact same thing. In order to stay competitive, Nothing needs AI, and thus it released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a and Phone 2a Plus</a> this year, saving Phone 3 for next.</p><p>That doesn't mean Nothing hasn't been working hard on new devices behind the scenes; in fact, a new leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1862415464820842533" target="_blank">Yogesh Brar on X (formerly Twitter)</a> suggests the opposite. Brar reports that Nothing has three phones in active development, but does not go into detail as to what those devices might be. Instead, the leaker predicts that these phones will be ready for release sometime in the first half of 2025.</p><p>This lines up with what we already know about Nothing's plans for Phone 3. The company has said that its next flagship smartphone will debut in 2025, so that leaves two devices unknown. Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-database-listing-chip-details-leak">Nothing Phone 3 was spotted in a Geekbench database recently</a>, signaling that the company could be prompting for a launch sometime in the first half of next year.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are 3 new phones from Nothing under active development right now.

These Will likely cover H1 2025<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1862415464820842533">November 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The current Nothing lineup technically includes three phones, for what it's worth. There's the flagship Nothing Phone 2, the midrange Nothing Phone 2a Plus, and the budget Nothing Phone 2a. However, the Phone 2a and Phone 2a Plus are nearly identical, with the latter simply including a faster MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro system-on-a-chip.</p><p>There's reason to believe that Nothing could be favoring the flagship market this year, choosing to release a Phone 3 and a faster Phone 3 Pro. The Nothing Phone 3 Pro may best represent what we're used to from a Nothing flagship, since it is rumored that the standard Phone 3 could include a lowly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> chip. While unconfirmed, a budget Nothing Phone 2a could round out the lineup, accounting for all three devices rumored to be in development.</p><p>It's unclear whether all three rumored devices will launch around the same time, or if these Nothing phones may be staggered throughout 2025. Another thing to watch is the markets the Nothing Phone 3 series will debut in, since prior Nothing phones have had limited or no US availability.</p>

The phone was recently spotted in a leaked video showing off a bit of the device and what looked like One UI 7 running on it. Now, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-exclusive-3503414/">series of images</a> has emerged that reveal more of the device as well as One UI 7.</p><p>As expected, the alleged Galaxy S25 Ultra features a boxier design with more rounded corners and a flat display. We also get a look at the bottom of the phone, which sports the USB-C port, speaker and mic, SIM card slot, and the S Pen tucked into the phone.</p>

This week, both companies presented closing arguments in a final effort to sway the court in their favor.</p><p>“Google is once, twice, three times a monopolist,” Justice Department lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum told the judge (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/technology/google-advertising-monopoly.html">The New York Times</a>). “These are the markets that make the free and open internet possible.”</p><p>The U.S. government is arguing that Google used its acquisition of DoubleClick in 2008 to dominate and push out the competition, as the company now controls 87% of the Ad Tech market. It's said that this has caused websites to potentially lose out on money they could have made selling through rivals, and the result could be that news outlets and websites may be forced to charge consumers to access content.</p><p>Google's lawyer refuted the claims by noting that the company isn't pushing out competition but has reacted in response to competition by innovating its product.</p>

Users can also record and transcribe conversations by just telling their phone to "Pay attention." Finally, users can save screenshots, images, and text in a journal and their phone will "remember" them, using contextual AI to pull details from images and summarize anything that gets saved. This way, you can ask your phone to recall things without having to spend the time to search for them yourself.</p><p>Owners of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>/Razr 50 Ultra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a>/Razr 50, and Edge 50 Ultra can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/us/moto-ai">sign up</a> to test the features now and provide feedback.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The current iteration of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidias-shield-tv-pro-is-still-the-best-streaming-device-in-2024">Shield TV Pro</a> debuted back in 2019, but it is still one of the best streaming devices available today. I bought three of these streaming boxes over the years, and while they still hold up incredibly well, I wanted something that had AV1 codec, and that led me to Mecool's KM2 Plus Deluxe. <br><br>Awkward naming aside, the KM2 Plus Deluxe is the ultimate streaming box. It runs Android TV 11, has 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and is powered by an Amlogic S905X4, one of the fastest platforms in this category. It has full access to the Play Store, and you can set up all the streaming services you use — including Netflix. It has Chromecast built-in, and acts as a Cast target if you need to stream content from your phone or any other device. <br><br>Best of all, it has HDR10+ and Dolby Vision integration, and if you're like me and have an extensive library of HDR content, this is the streaming device for you. It has the AV1 codec as well, and it does a great job with HDR content in YouTube. And with the Cyber Monday deal, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/MECOOL-KM2-Certification-Assistant-Compatible/dp/B0D62YKJ2S">get it for just $119</a>, $30 less than its usual selling price and $80 less than the Shield TV Pro.</p>

<p>✅Recommended if: You need a streaming box that's powerful, and has all the latest codecs. The KM2 Plus Deluxe does a great job with Dolby Vision content, and the interface is among the most fluid I used.</p><p>❌Skip this deal if: You don't like the Android TV interface, and you need AI-assisted image upscaling.</p>
<p>The only problem I had with the KM2 Plus Deluxe when I switched to it earlier in the year was lack of Dolby Vision, but that was addressed by a software update. The streaming box doesn't have any issues with HDR or Dolby Vision content in Netflix or YouTube, and the interface is among the most fluid in this category. <br><br>You get USB ports on the left, allowing you to easily attach an external drive. The biggest feature missing is the ability to upscale SD videos; this is something the Shield TV Pro does incredibly well, and you just don't get that on any other device. Outside of that, the KM2 Plus Deluxe does everything I need in an Android TV streaming box, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/MECOOL-KM2-Certification-Assistant-Compatible/dp/B0D62YKJ2S">$119 pricing</a> makes it a value-focused alternative to the Shield TV Pro.</p>

Sadly, that model isn&apos;t on sale for Cyber Monday, but you can still get the next best thing for nearly half the price! The superb <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-gtr-mini-review">Amazfit GTR Mini</a> rivals the battery life of the newer Amazfit Balance. You can score an excellent 15% discount on the GTR Mini while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWF33MMB"><strong>Cyber Monday deal lasts on Amazon</strong></a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amazfit-gtr-mini-smartwatch-32-5-stainless-steel-black/6579497.p"><strong>Best Buy for $84.99</strong></a>.</p><p>The round-shaped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch">Amazfit smartwatch</a> looks just like a cool wristwatch, but don’t be fooled, there are tons of tracking and premium features inside. Along with more than 120 sports modes, heart rate tracking, GPS, sleep monitoring, and compatibility with an AI fitness app, the GTR Mini can somehow manage to run for up to two weeks per charge.</p><p>Thankfully, Amazfit uses standard quick-release connectors, so compatible bands are super easy and cheap to find. Oh, and did I mention it’s also 5ATM water-resistant so you can swim with it, too?</p>

<p>Not only does this stunning smartwatch run for up to 14 days on a single charge, but it can track all your workouts, deliver notifications, measure your sleep duration and quality, blood oxygen, and stress, and look as great on your wrist whether you’re working out or dining out. At this Cyber Monday price, it’s an absolute no-brainer.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWF33MMB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="84c13607-8bef-4685-80ef-821d18ea959a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazfit GTR Mini: $99.99" data-dimension48="Amazfit GTR Mini: $99.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re a beginner who is just getting into the world of fitness, health, and wellness tracking and who tends to get daunted by complicated menus and apps.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need something more robust with advanced features and third-party app access.</p><p>Along with the “unbelievable battery life,” I absolutely loved the bright AMOLED display, advanced GPS (perfect for runners and cyclists), preset replies for messages, breadth of sports modes, and the ability to summon Alexa from your wrist during my testing for my review.</p><p>Another factor that I admire about the GTR Mini is that it is super thin and lightweight, so you won’t even know you’re wearing it. The Zepp OS 2.0 interface is clean and easy to use, with no learning curve, something someone unfamiliar with using smartwatches will appreciate. It has some limitations though, including no third-party app support nor a speaker or mic (when you summon Alexa, your phone needs to be connected and nearby), but you might not even care. </p><p>Sure, this smartwatch isn’t the newest, most powerful and feature-rich smartwatch you can buy. But for beginners looking to kickstart their fitness or health and wellness journey, it’s a good budget option that doesn’t act like a budget watch. And at <strong>just $84.99 during the ongoing Cyber Monday weekend sales</strong>, it’s worth the investment. When you’re ready to move up to something more premium, hand this one down to a friend or family member and they’ll love using it, too.</p>

I tested a half-dozen in the last 12 months, and the one I ended up using the most is GameSir's G8 Plus. Unlike most mobile gaming controllers, the G8 Plus has full-size buttons and triggers, and that makes all the difference while gaming. <br><br>It also has hall effect thumbsticks, so you'll never see stick drift. The vibration motor has excellent feedback, and it's just enjoyable to use the thumbsticks and triggers. Best of all, the controller pairs over Bluetooth, so it works with just about any device — I used it with my iPhone 16 Pro Max, a dozen or so Android phones, foldables, and several tablets. You can use it with a Switch as well, and the versatility is a key selling point. <br><br>The G8 Plus retails for $99, but for Cyber Monday, it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN">available for $63</a> — that's a standout value when you consider just what you're getting.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a controller that's great to hold and use. The full-size triggers and thumbsticks give the G8 Plus a distinct advantage, and I didn't notice any fatigue even after extended Balatro sessions. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a mobile controller that's portable, or if you have a phone with a massive camera island.</p>
<p>The design of the G8 Plus is a big differentiator; the full-size design with the ergonomic body makes holding and using the controller enjoyable. This was a problem with most other controllers I tested, but thankfully not an issue on the G8 Plus. The thumbsticks are among the best in this category, as are the triggers at the back. You get a decent amount of customizability with both, and there are custom buttons at the back that can be configured to in-game actions with relative ease. <br><br>As it has Bluetooth, it pairs seamlessly with just about any device — I didn't see any issues whatsoever in this area. The left side slides out to accommodate phones and tablets, and the soft rubber bridge ensures the controller doesn't scratch your device. Battery longevity wasn't a problem, and there's a USB-C port that lets you charge the controller while it's in use. <br><br>If you're mulling a controller that lets you play games on your phone and tablet with ease, the G8 Plus is easily one of the best around, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN">coming in at $63</a>, it is one of the best deals this Cyber Monday.</p>

It&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-300W-000mAh-Power-Bank/dp/B0CJY37RT3">now on sale for $118</a>, and I think that&apos;s a terrific price. When I need something smaller, I just use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-25000mah-power-bank-review">Nexode 20,000mAh power bank</a> — it goes up to 130W, has adequate charge, and is easily portable (and it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0CXHNGDC1">$60 now</a>).</p><p>The biggest issue with UGREEN power banks (and most other brands) is that they don&apos;t include custom charging tech. While both models I listed above deliver 100W of power over the USB PD standard, they can&apos;t do the same with OnePlus&apos;s 100W SuperVOOC and Vivo&apos;s 120W FlashCharge tech. This is where Anker comes into the equation; the accessory manufacturer picked up a SuperVOOC license back in 2021, and it&apos;s finally putting that to good use.</p><p>Anker&apos;s 27,650mAh Prime Power Bank goes up to 250W in total, and it does 140W via a single port using the USB PD 3.1 standard. But that&apos;s not the most interesting part; it also has a USB-A port that goes up to 65W, delivering 10V at 6.5A. If those figures look familiar, that&apos;s because it corresponds to SuperVOOC&apos;s charging tech. Basically, you can use this power bank&apos;s USB-A port to charge all OnePlus phones at 65W, and that&apos;s a unique differentiator. </p><p>The power bank usually retails for $179, and it has picked up its first discount now, going <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG">down to $119 on Amazon</a> (with a $10 coupon). That is a terrific value for any power bank in general, but when you consider the addition of SuperVOOC charging, it makes this the best power bank deal around.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want the best power bank money can buy today. Anker&apos;s power bank charges just about any device, and with a 27,650mAh battery, you don&apos;t need to worry about it running out. The obvious highlight is the ability to charge OnePlus devices at 65W, but even if you don&apos;t need it, this is a fantastic power bank.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a smaller power bank.</p>
<p>There&apos;s a lot to like on the Anker Prime 27,650mAh power bank. It has dual USB-C ports, with each able to hit 140W individually over USB PD 3.1. There&apos;s a USB-A port which handles SuperVOOC charging, going up to 65W. With both USB-C ports in use, you get 100W out of one port and 140W out of the other, and it has a total power budget of 250W when all three ports are active.</p><p>It has a vertical design, great build quality, and you get a panel that shows real-time charging details. The power bank recharges the internal battery at 170W, and coming in at 99.5Wh, it is just under the maximum allowed for travel (100Wh). I got started with this power bank three months ago, and honestly, I haven&apos;t felt the need to use anything else.</p><p>I use several OnePlus and OPPO phones, and the ability to charge these devices at 65W via a power bank makes things incredibly convenient. I tested the power bank with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12">OnePlus 12</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Open</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, and didn&apos;t see any issues whatsoever. With any other power bank, these devices charge at 10W, so to be able to go up to 65W is fantastic. </p><p>Even if you don&apos;t have a OnePlus device, this is easily the best power bank you can get today, and the fact that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG">down to just $119</a> makes it an instant buy.</p>
