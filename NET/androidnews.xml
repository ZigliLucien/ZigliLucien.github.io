You can swim in pool or ocean water, and it can withstand rain, sweat, or normal showerhead pressure. But hot or high-pressure water can bypass its protections; don't use it during activities like water skiing or a spa day.</p>
<p>In addition, your Pixel Watch 3 band may not be water-resistant. Specifically, while the default Active band handles water, the official leather and metal bands aren't rated to handle water and should be dried off immediately after a wet or sweaty activity.</p></article></section>

<p>Officially, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> has water protection ratings of 5ATM and IP68, like most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> today. That means it&apos;s tested to last at depths of 50 meters for up to 10 minutes or 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes. </p><p>It&apos;s also dust resistant, meaning salt water or beach sand shouldn&apos;t get inside the case.</p><p>While this 5ATM rating technically means you could wear your Pixel Watch 3 while you go snorkeling or diving, it&apos;s not quite as rugged for water sports as watches rated 10ATM, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>.</p><p>In terms of what you shouldn&apos;t do with the Pixel Watch 3, it "should not be immersed in water for more than 24 hours, used during high-speed or high-impact water sports, or exposed to soapy water or other liquids," according to this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/12652074#water&zippy=%2Cclean-your-bands%2Cwater-and-scratch-resistant-materials%2Cclean-your-watch" target="_blank">Pixel Watch help page</a>.</p><p>Google also recommends that you take the Pixel Watch 3 off after a water activity and dry it off before putting it back on, as a wet watch and band can cause skin irritation and erode the watch&apos;s protective layer in the long term. </p><p>Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, the Pixel Watch 3 doesn&apos;t have a MIL-STD-810H rating for protection against drops or impacts. Google warns that an impact could damage the Pixel Watch 3&apos;s protective layer, eventually letting water in that could damage its inner components. Otherwise, that water-resistant layer could still fade over time, depending on how often you go swimming.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="wwpNckjnXR6Ypxvx97g8Uh" name="google-pixel-watch-3-morning-brief-starting-screen.jpg" alt="Morning Brief on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wwpNckjnXR6Ypxvx97g8Uh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of cleaning your Pixel Watch 3, Google says using warm, fresh water is recommended, but not to use the following in case they damage its protective coating:</p>
<ul><li>Hot water</li><li>Hand soap</li><li>Body soap</li><li>Dish soap</li><li>Hand sanitizers</li><li>Cleaning wipes</li><li>Household cleaners</li><li>Other similar cleaning products</li></ul>
<p>If you have a soft, dry, lint-free cloth, that&apos;s the best option for cleaning and drying your Pixel Watch 3, as it won&apos;t scrape away the protective layer. You should also remove your leather or metal band before using water to clean your Watch 3.</p><p>Even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-waterproof-smartwatches">best water-resistant smartwatches</a> can withstand more punishment than the Pixel Watch 3, it&apos;s still a well-protected watch, and all of these precautions apply to other, more rugged watches, too.</p><p>Otherwise, if you do buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-bands">Pixel Watch 3 bands</a> besides the default Active silicone band, you may want to consider whether or not they&apos;re water-resistant as well. </p>

<p>The market for flip phones is fairly small in North America, but it&apos;s growing with new options in both the high-end and low-end. Samsung and Motorola are at the forefront of this growth, and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Razr 2024 are at both ends of the price spectrum.</p><p>These phones are fairly similar in some ways, but very different in many. This is pretty evident given they&apos;re targeting different price points, with Motorola giving consumers a more "affordable" entry into foldables. Samsung&apos;s Z Flip 6 is one of the most powerful flip phones on the market, but it means you&apos;ll pay a pretty penny for it.</p><p>So, which phone should you consider for your next (or first) flip phone? Lets compare, and hopefully this Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 vs. Motorola Razr 2024 comparison will help you choose.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-motorola-razr-2024-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 vs. Motorola Razr 2024: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cVxGXnbdBy7GESpbkmbnn6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-2024-2.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr 2024 hinge next to the Galaxy Z Flip 6 hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cVxGXnbdBy7GESpbkmbnn6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar to comparing the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Motorola Razr Plus 2024, the design differences between these two phones are just as stark. Samsung takes a more angular approach to its flip phone, with flat glass panels and sharp corners. It&apos;s very much a refinement of previous models of the phone and maybe the best design for the flip series yet.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> borrows its design from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a>. It&apos;s nearly identical to its predecessor, with rear panels that curve into the rounded frame. The phone is also covered in vegan leather on the rear, with a strip on the front above the cover screen.</p><p>The differences in design also mean a difference in comfort. The matte frame and glass on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> feel great, but the sharp corners will dig into your fingers, depending on how you hold the phone. It can be quite uncomfortable the longer you hold it. Meanwhile, the Razr 2024 is much easier to hold for long periods of time, as the soft vegan leather and rounded frame are just easier on the fingers.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-should-you-buy">offers the Galaxy Z Flip 6 in four main colors</a>, with an additional three colors that are exclusive to Samsung.com. The colors are more pastel, which some may not like, depending on your taste, but they are still quite nice. Motorola offers the Razr 2024 in three colors, including a rather striking Sprits Orange, but the Beach Sand and Koala Grey colors are a bit dull in comparison. However, Koala Grey makes up for it with the unique suede feel, which is rather nice, almost like you&apos;re touching an animal&apos;s fur.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that water resistance on both phones means they can be fully submerged, although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-waterproof">IP48 on the Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> beats out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-motorola-razr-2024-waterproof">IPX8 of the Razr 2024</a>, thanks to the added dust resistance.</p>

<p>As for the displays, this is where the phones are a bit more similar, even more so than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> and Z Flip 6. Samsung&apos;s phone has a smaller display at 6.7 inches, but both are OLED, have Full HD+ resolution, and run at a variable 120Hz refresh rate. The Razr 2024 has a bit of an edge with a higher 3000-nit peak brightness, but the difference is fairly minimal, and you should have no trouble viewing both phones outdoors.</p><p>Thanks to improvements to the hinge and display designs, the display crease is also minimal on both phones.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5035px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="X2eLY4uwqHLyRbAncrNp4i" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-hero.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 on a blue table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X2eLY4uwqHLyRbAncrNp4i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5035" height="2158" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These phones are targeted at different price segments, so the hardware and specs will reflect that. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a high-end flip phone featuring the most powerful Qualcomm chip to date, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. As a result, it performs incredibly well, handling apps and games without issue, thanks in part to the 12GB of RAM. This also lets it handle AI features, which we&apos;ll get to in the next section.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2024 features a new mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">MediaTek Dimensity 7300X</a> with 8GB of RAM, but don&apos;t let that fool you. The phone also performs well, although it may not exactly hold a candle to the Z Flip 6. Games like Honkai: Star Rail and Final Fantasy VII Every Crisis are playable at the highest settings, and the phone is also capable of running some AI features, although not as fast or as well as the Flip.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 has the upper hand with storage capacity, since Samsung offers a 512GB variant of the phone, although you&apos;ll pay more for this. Motorola only offers 256GB, and neither model supports expandable storage.</p><p>As far as audio, both phones support Dolby Atmos with dual stereo speakers, but the Razr 2024 sounds a bit unbalanced due to one speaker being noticeably quieter when playing content. Overall, you&apos;ll get a better audio experience with Samsung, but neither are phenomenal.</p>
<p>The battery life situation between the two is pretty comparable. Both phones will last throughout the day, depending on how you use them, although you will likely need to charge up before the end of the night. The Z Flip 6 charges at 25W, and the Razr 2024 at 30W, so speeds are pretty similar, and both have the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-support-wireless-charging">wireless charging speed</a>. The main difference is that the Z Flip 6 supports reverse wireless charging, although its usefulness is still up for debate.</p>

<p>If you read our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-motorola-razr-plus">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 vs. Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a> comparison, then you&apos;ll have a good idea of how the cover screen experience compares between these two phones. Samsung reaffirms its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-initial-impressions">focus on the panel/widget experience</a> as the focus of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen, offering a more curated experience for users. Panels work fine, are presented well, and even have added functionality now that you can add multiple widgets to a panel. However, Motorola continues to excel in the cover screen experience, which extends to the Razr 2024.</p><p>Out of the box, you can set up panels, similar to what you can do on the Galaxy Z Flip 6. In addition, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">set up and use apps on the Razr 2024 cover screen</a>, just as you can on the Razr Plus 2024. The larger 3.6-inch OLED panel gives apps plenty of room, although the UI is still a bit scrunched, and you&apos;ll have to maneuver around the cameras. It&apos;s very easy to use the Razr 2024 without needing to open the phone, even when it comes to other aspects of the cover screen, like responding to notifications, changing wallpapers, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-27.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen widgets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4134" height="2325" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it&apos;s possible to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">use apps on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a>, Samsung makes you go through hoops to make it happen. In addition, the cover screen experience is far from perfect, although apps work well when you get them to work. Still, there are many interactions that will require you to open the phone, which can be a little frustrating.</p><p>Overall, you&apos;ll have a better experience with the Razr 2024, as Motorola has upgraded the cover screen quite a bit, and the external OLED panel also just looks better, thanks to the 90Hz refresh rate and higher resolution. This is a huge win for this mid-range flip phone over Samsung&apos;s flagship.</p>

<p>Both phones run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, but the software experience is very different. Samsung&apos;s One UI continues to grow, and the company focuses on adding more AI experiences with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>. Samsung has seemingly gone all-in and even includes some Google features you won&apos;t find on the Razr, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. This elevates the software experience quite a bit, especially when on-device AI is involved, allowing you to keep your data private.</p><p>Many of Samsung&apos;s features are useful, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-chat-assist-samsung-galaxy-s24">Chat Assist</a>, and some are just fun, like Sketch to Image and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-portrait-studio-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Portrait Studio</a>. Interpreter Mode also received a handy upgrade that takes advantage of the flip phone form factor, presenting translations on the cover screen to help make in-person conversations easier when speaking to someone in another language.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8wP77xhu63ZQZzubTXvQH6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-08.jpg" alt="Generative AI sketch on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8wP77xhu63ZQZzubTXvQH6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, Motorola&apos;s new Hello UX isn&apos;t a huge departure from previous versions of the software, but there are some notable changes to the UI, including the settings menu and the new Control Center with a modern Quick Settings panel. Some AI features let you create new wallpapers, but they don&apos;t work very well.</p><p>The phone shares some AI camera features with its flagship sibling, but others, like Action Shot, are missing. You do have access to some Google features, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a>, which is available on the cover screen, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-compose-google-messages">Magic Compose</a>. Also, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>, the phone also has access to features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> and Photo Unblur. Motorola has also teased some interesting Moto AI features in the works, but those are not yet available. Still, the software is perfectly fine, so long as you can deal with less frequent updates.</p>

<p>The camera comparison between these two phones is pretty cut and try. Both Samsung and Motorola gave their respective phones improved 50MP dual camera systems, but Samsung has the upper hand when it comes to image quality. It could have something to do with the ISP or just the way the algorithms produce images, but photos from the Razr 2024 tend to oversaturate scenes or punch up the brightness a bit too much. By comparison, images from the Galaxy Z Flip 6 appear much more natural, even when taken with the ultrawide cameras.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="470" frameborder="0" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=0fa6598e-59ef-11ef-9396-d93975fe8866"></iframe>

<p>The Razr 2024 also oversharpens images, as if it&apos;s trying too hard to capture and retain detail. By comparison, images from the Z Flip 6 are much softer while still having plenty of detail. You can tell the difference from the images of the building below, which I&apos;ve cropped so you can get an even better idea of what I mean:</p>

<p>Both phones can shoot 4K60 video and Auto Camcorder mode. They also have various shooting modes, although Samsung takes the cake with the addition of Expert RAW, for users that really want to take their photography to the next level.</p><p>Overall, neither camera is perfect, and I would probably prefer the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 over both, but the Galaxy Z Flip 6 easily beats out the Razr 2024.</p>

<p>Between the specs, price, and camera performance, it&apos;s clear that these are two very different phones for very different people. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is for those of you who want the best of the best and are willing to spend a little extra for it. The Razr 2024 is for those of you who are maybe just dipping your toes into the world of foldables, or maybe it&apos;s not your first foldable, but you just don&apos;t want a phone that&apos;ll break the bank and can get by with the basics.</p><p>Despite being more of a mid-range phone, the Razr 2024 still has a lot going for it and performs well above its weight. It also looks and feels great, with one of the best cover screen experiences you&apos;ll find on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a>, second only to the Razr Plus 2024.</p><p>Samsung didn&apos;t change much with the Galaxy Z Flip 6, but it didn&apos;t really need to. It&apos;s a refined phone with the latest chip, a slightly better camera, and better battery life. Unfortunately, the cover screen experience still needs some work.</p><p>If you can manage the splurge, go with the Galaxy Z Flip 6. However, if you want to save, go with the Razr 2024.

While that allowed the Chinese manufacturer to build an initial following, it needed to focus on the mid-range and budget categories to cater to a mainstream audience, and it started doing just that with the introduction of the Nord back in 2020.</p><p>It would be an understatement to say that the debut of the Nord series has catalyzed OnePlus sales globally; the mid-range portfolio now makes up an overwhelming majority of the company&apos;s sales, and allowed it to shoot up the ranks in key markets, particularly North America.</p><p>It&apos;s no wonder, then, that OnePlus launched 18 models in the Nord series until now. Whether it&apos;s the mid-range powerhouse that is the Nord 4 or the entry-level Nord N30, OnePlus has a Nord device to cater to every need — and budget — so let&apos;s take a look at the best Nord phones you can buy now.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-review">Nord 4</a> is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a> I used all year, and a big part of its allure is down to its all-metal chassis. Most manufacturers got comfortable with metal-and-glass designs in recent years, so it was refreshing to see OnePlus go back to a metallic chassis on the Nord 4, and it absolutely makes a difference in daily use.</p><p>The rest of the hardware isn&apos;t all that bad either; the AMOLED panel is vibrant, there&apos;s a huge 5500mAh battery with 100W charging, and it has decent internal hardware — gaming wasn&apos;t an issue on the device. But where it truly excels is the cameras; the Nord 4 is able to deliver striking images, and that gives it a distinct edge in the mid-range segment.</p><p>The Nord 4 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/oneplus-nord-4">available in India for ₹32,999</a> ($393) for the 8GB/256GB variant, and there&apos;s also a 12GB/256GB model that costs ₹35,999 ($429). Over in the U.K., the phone costs £429 ($559) for the 12GB/256GB edition, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/uk/oneplus-nord-4">£479 ($624) for the 16GB/512GB model</a>. OnePlus doesn&apos;t sell the Nord 4 in North America, and customers in the region don&apos;t have an official way to pick up the device.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t need the latest hardware? The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-3-long-term-review">Nord 3</a> still has a lot to offer, and it can be had for a lot less than the Nord 4. It doesn&apos;t have that elegant all-metal chassis, but the glass back combined with pastel hues makes it look good in its own right.</p><p>It has the same 6.74-inch AMOLED panel, but it doesn&apos;t get quite as bright; it is still decent enough, and I didn&apos;t notice any issues in outdoor use. The Dimensity 9000 is great in day-to-day tasks, and it holds up just as well at gaming. The 50MP camera at the back is very good too, and while it is outmatched by the Nord 4, it is among the better sensors in this category.</p><p>The biggest reason for getting the Nord 3 is the value; the 8GB/128GB model is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Misty-Green-128GB-Storage/dp/B0C7V7VH6Q/">down to just ₹20,999 ($250) in India</a>, and that&apos;s a downright bargain for the hardware you&apos;re getting. The phone isn&apos;t as good a deal in the U.K., where the 16GB/256GB <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/uk/oneplus-nord-3-5g">model costs £379 ($494)</a>, and you should consider the Nord 4 instead. But if you&apos;re in India, the Nord 3 is a viable choice. And just like the Nord 4, the Nord 3 isn&apos;t available officially in North America.</p>

<p>OnePlus says the CE in the naming of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-ce4-review">Nord CE 4</a> stands for Core Edition, and that the device is designed to deliver the essentials at an affordable price point. The Nord CE 4 is decent enough, and it has a good design with a big battery, 100W charging, and the 50MP camera takes good photos.</p><p>But the phone will get just two platform updates, and that makes it a poor choice against the likes of the Nothing Phone 2a. If anything, I think the Nord CE 4 Lite is a better choice to consider, and that phone is a better value, particularly in the U.K., where it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/uk/oneplus-nord-ce4-lite-5g">costs just £249 ($324)</a> for the 8GB/256GB model. While the phone is also available in India, you shouldn&apos;t buy it — the Nord 3 costs about the same, and you get better hardware.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">Nord N30</a> is an interesting device; it is the only phone in the Nord portfolio that&apos;s sold in North America, and while it doesn&apos;t have the same great hardware as the rest of the devices on this list, you get a great value. The phone has a 120Hz LCD panel, a 5000mAh battery with 50W charging, and there&apos;s a 108MP camera at the back that takes good photos.</p><p>The design and hardware is rather basic, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Dual-SIM-Charging-Chromatic/dp/B0C22BRGLG">phone costs just $249 on Amazon</a>, and judging by its sales figures, it is one of the best-selling devices in this category. It won&apos;t get software updates and doesn&apos;t have the brightest screen, but if you just need an entry-level phone that nails the essentials, the Nord N30 is a good choice.</p>

<ul><li>A new report claims Samsung is "reviewing" a decision regarding whether it should implement a titanium back panel on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Slim."</li><li>Samsung has also reportedly started mass producing some of the device's necessary materials ahead of its alleged Q4 launch.</li><li>Previous rumors claim the phone will feature a slightly bigger display than the Fold 6, but its price point could be similar.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A fresh report has revealed new details about a potential slimmer version of Samsung&apos;s latest clamshell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable device</a>.</p><p>The latest rumors stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=29678">The Elec</a> which reports that Samsung is "reviewing" whether or not it will place a titanium panel on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-z-fold-6-slim-titanium-3473194/">Android Authority</a>). It was reported that Samsung&apos;s display division "recently completed" a type of titanium plate.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung is reportedly interested in applying a titanium panel due to its lighter weight and tougher exterior.</p><p>"Some parts" of this rumored slim Fold 6 variant have reportedly entered mass production for Samsung. The post claims this is done in preparation for the device&apos;s alleged Q4 2024 release timeframe.</p><p>The report also mentions that Samsung switched from a metal plate to carbon fiber reinforced plastic for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> this year. Apparently, the South Korean tech giant did this because the metal was messing with the S Pen. The shift to a titanium back panel makes sense given that the Slim version might not come with an S Pen.</p>

<p>It&apos;s worth mentioning that, if true, the rumored Fold 6 Slim would be Samsung&apos;s first titanium <em>foldable </em>but not its first titanium phone. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> sports a Grade 2 titanium frame. The decision to move in this direction was similar to what we&apos;ve seen reported for the slim Fold: lightweight, stronger exterior.</p><p>The "slim" Galaxy Z Fold 6 rumors started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-fold-6-slim-expected-to-launch-in-2025">earlier this year</a>, with such tipsters claiming it would drop the S Pen. Additionally, rumors state the device will feature a slightly larger display than the recent Fold 6 and at a (presumed) similar price. Such pricing rumors did arrive a few months after the slim variant was originally thought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-could-make-a-cheaper-galaxy-z-fold-to-bring-foldables-mainstream-finally">to be priced lower</a>, closer to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">the Flip</a>.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is rumored to be released in Q4 2024, but Samsung might wait a month and do it alongside the Galaxy S25 series.</p>

<ul><li>Ring has a new doorbell in store that starts at $100 in the U.S.</li><li>It includes features like Head-To-Toe view in HD, wider field of view, and customizable privacy settings.</li><li>The Battery Doorbell also promises 23% longer battery life than the previous model.</li></ul>
<p>Ring today unveiled a new doorbell that’s a lot like its other models but comes with some cool extras like Head-to-Toe HD video. The company also says it’s super easy to install.</p><p>The new-generation Battery Doorbell offers views similar to those of the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ring-video-doorbell-3-plus-review">Doorbell Plus</a> and Pro models. It features Head-to-Toe HD video, color night vision, and a 150 x 150-degree field of view, so you can see everyone before they even reach your door—a great safety perk. </p><p>Ring mentions that this gives you a 66% taller view compared to the Ring Video Doorbell (2nd gen). It’s also handy for keeping an eye on your packages, especially if you’re subscribed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/how-to-get-package-alerts-from-your-ring-doorbell-or-camera">Package Alerts</a> via Ring Protect subscription.</p>

<p>The new Battery Doorbell also features motion detection, real-time alerts, and a live view. You can chat with visitors using the Two-Way Talk feature, and it works seamlessly with Alexa devices. </p><p>With a Ring Protect subscription, you not only get Package Alerts but also Smart Alerts to notify you if someone’s at the door. Plus, "Rich notifications" provide details on what triggered the alert, complete with a photo preview on your phone. You can store this data in the cloud for up to 180 days.</p><p>Ring says that installing the Battery Doorbell is a breeze thanks to its new push-pin mount design. Just push to attach it securely to the wall, and when it’s time to recharge, you can easily release it using the push-pin tool.</p>

Users who preorder can expect the device to ship by September 4.</p>

This new RingConn Gen 2 has battery life that bests just about any other smart ring on the market and even rivals some fitness smartwatches. Plus, it has a really useful sleep monitoring feature that you won&apos;t find on too many devices, hoping it stands apart from the pack. </p><p>But compared to smart ring giants like Oura and Samsung, can RingConn carve a sizeable piece of the smart ring pie, or will its efforts go unnoticed by consumers? Either way, the company has a compelling device that somehow improves on its already impressive first-gen smart ring, and some other companies in the smart ring race should probably look to this latest RingConn model as something of a standard for their own efforts.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LH9Pcmv5HFaurrMrD9svtk" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-12.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring on a finger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LH9Pcmv5HFaurrMrD9svtk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring is identical to the first model, and that&apos;s definitely not a bad thing. I was really impressed with how RingConn designed its smart ring, which is more of a squircle shape than an actual circle.</p><p>Like other smart ring models, the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring comes in a few different finishes, about the same as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-color-samsung-galaxy-ring-should-you-buy">what Samsung offers</a>, with gold, silver, and black options. I have the silver model with a fairly glossy finish, which I&apos;m normally wary about, given how my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring</a> scratches pretty easily, even when I put a cover on it. But the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring has fared surprisingly well, and I haven&apos;t noticed much in the way of scuffs or scratches in the couple of weeks that I&apos;ve tested the device. As careful as I try to be with my Oura Ring, it&apos;s somehow a magnet for scratches no matter what I do. </p><p>Of course, all the sensors are located on the inside. While this mostly follows the exterior squircle design, the bottom has a flat surface where you&apos;ll find many of the main sensors. This looks like it would make the ring uncomfortable to wear, but surprisingly, it doesn&apos;t. </p><p>RingConn says the Gen 2 Smart Ring is both thinner and lighter than the first generation, which is surprising given the battery life claims of this device. Speaking of, the ring lasts 10 to 12 days on a single charge, which is more than what Samsung or Oura claim for their smart rings. In my use, I would say this is pretty accurate. I&apos;m honestly surprised to see how little battery life is used up at the end of the day, even when tracking workouts. Of course, your battery life will depend on the ways that you use the ring, including how often you track workouts and take advantage of the ring&apos;s newest feature, which I&apos;ll get to in a bit.</p>

<p>And just like the first generation, the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring comes with a charging case, which makes it fairly convenient to carry around as opposed to a charging dock that needs to be plugged in. The case has a 500mAh battery that you can charge separately, and RingConn even has a separate charging dock you can purchase separately, which has cool light indicators to show you the battery level of the ring.</p><p>Another thing you can purchase for the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring is a cover, which is surprisingly uncommon for smart ring manufacturers to offer. Even Samsung doesn&apos;t have one for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a>, which I find odd, so I commend RingConn for thinking of this. There are times when I will take off the ring, but I prefer to keep it on because I have a tendency to lose them easily. Therefore, having a cover makes it easier to handle things without worrying too much about damaging the ring. </p>

<p>Aside from the actual ring, the app experience is also fantastic. While it doesn&apos;t offer everything I&apos;d want in a smart ring app, it has a great layout that makes information very easy to view at a glance. There are only three tabs, so it&apos;s very easy to navigate.</p><p>Nowhere in the app will you find an option for a subscription, unlike some other companies that pretty much require it for their most useful functions/insights, or will hide it and surprise you with a "subscribe to use this" banner when you want to check out a certain future.</p><p>Widgets are also a nice touch and something I&apos;d like to see from more smart ring manufacturers.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wUVmFPyfMTnVZMtxfxez9G" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-03.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 with the companion app open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wUVmFPyfMTnVZMtxfxez9G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to fitness and health tracking, The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring covers the basics that you&apos;d find on just about any other smart ring. The ring tracks your heart rate, sleep, blood, oxygen levels, stress, and even your skin temperature. This is pretty much par for the course on a smart ring, and as far as I can tell, the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring does pretty well that much of it. You can dive into each metric in the app to view detailed data on your sleep, heart rate, etc., and your trends for each metric.</p><p>You can also track several different workouts, such as outdoor running, indoor running, outdoor cycling, and outdoor walking. Smart rings aren&apos;t exactly known to have extensive exercise/sports modes, although RingConn says it&apos;s working on bringing more diverse options to the app.</p><p>You won&apos;t get a readiness score like you&apos;ll find with Samsung and Oura, but you get a more graphical representation of essentially the same thing. The app will show you a graph of your sleep, vital signs, activity, and stress management and how they compare to the previous day. I honestly think I might like this better. It&apos;ll also tell you which areas you can improve on and how you can improve them, and you can dive more deeply into the scores for each individual metric.</p><p>For example, with sleep, you get a sleep score, which factors in all the variables such as your sleep efficiency, your time asleep, and more. I like that it also shows you the optimal intervals for your sleep stages and where you fall short. Unfortunately, there <em>have</em> been a few times when I&apos;ve taken a random nap during the middle of the day, and the app won&apos;t log it, even though there&apos;s a section in the sleep metrics dedicated to naps. I can always add them after the fact, but I rarely remember when I fell asleep or woke up since I&apos;m not scrambling to log my nap immediately after waking up.</p>

<p>Smart rings are getting better at counting your steps, although no device is perfect. The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring is kind of hit or miss in this area. There are times when I found its steps to match closely with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a>, for example, but then there are other times when the Gen 2 Smart Ring is way off. I haven&apos;t noticed much in the way of phantom steps where it&apos;ll somehow calculate that I&apos;ve taken thousands of steps while I&apos;ve been mostly sedentary, but when I am out and about, sometimes it&apos;ll under or over-calculate the steps I&apos;ve taken.</p><p>You can see some of the results in our recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">smart ring step test</a>, in which I wore a few different rings and two smartwatches while walking 5,000 steps. The RingConn performed pretty poorly in these specific tests, but again, I found that there are times when the steps closely match those of my Garmin smartwatch, which does a pretty good job tracking my steps.</p><p>Still, I find you should take smart ring step counts with a grain of salt.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WHdukSAeXnrUsnJwqbJFRB" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-vs-Oura-Ring.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring and the Oura Ring Gen 3 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WHdukSAeXnrUsnJwqbJFRB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring and the Oura Ring. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s the newest feature on the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring: sleep apnea monitoring. For the uninformed, sleep apnea is a disorder that may cause you to stop breathing while you sleep, which is not good for some pretty obvious reasons but can severely disrupt your sleep and ultimately lead to some serious health conditions.</p><p>RingConn claims that the Gen 2 Smart Ring is the first smart ring to detect sleep apnea. It does this by using an AI-advanced OSA detection model to pinpoint moments when there are interruptions in airflow and decreases in blood oxygen levels while you sleep. According to RingConn, its model is 90% accurate, although the company is awaiting FDA approval.</p><p>It&apos;s an interesting feature that you have to manually enable before you go to sleep to ensure that the app remains active. When you wake up, you stop the monitoring, and the app analyzes the information, displaying the results on an AHI index bar. This will show you the number of apneas or hypopneas per hour during sleep, as well as the total number of events during the monitoring duration.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cabCsi8Y5Cvf6VmfGN7a5d" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-05.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring app sleep apnea monitoring feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cabCsi8Y5Cvf6VmfGN7a5d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I didn&apos;t suspect I suffered from sleep apnea, and the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring assures me that I have nothing to worry about. However, while RingConn notes that this feature is not a diagnostic tool and that you should seek medical attention if you feel unwell, I can see how this feature can help people who may suspect they suffer from sleep apnea or are trying to improve what has already been diagnosed.</p><p>Android Central&apos;s senior editor, Andrew Myrick, discovered that he himself might suffer from sleep apnea, which is why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-excited-about-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-health-feature" target="_blank">he was so excited</a> to see this feature arrive on the recently released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch</a> models. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">not everyone enjoys wearing smartwatches to bed</a>, so something like the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring would be ideal in a situation like this.  </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-what-i-don-t-like"><span>RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3777px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8ALVFyLPLf5nqABgDaw295" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-15.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring balanced on its charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ALVFyLPLf5nqABgDaw295.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3777" height="2125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sleep apnea feature is pretty cool, but there are some downsides. Firstly, it won&apos;t start automatically; as I mentioned, you must start and stop the feature manually. I don&apos;t know about you, but when I&apos;m tired, I can barely remember to charge my phone, let alone open an app and tell it to start monitoring for a specific condition. I&apos;m sure if you suspect you suffer from it or you know you do, you might be a little more inclined to remember, but I kind of wish there was an option for this to happen automatically once the ring detects you&apos;re asleep like an automatic option that you can toggle on or off. </p><p>But the second downside, which is why I can see how my suggestion may or may not work, is that sleep apnea monitoring drains the battery by quite a bit. And not just from the ring, but from your phone as well. On a regular night when you&apos;re not monitoring sleep apnea, you lose 2-3% of the Ring&apos;s battery life as it tracks your sleep normally. However, when you turn sleep apnea monitoring on, you&apos;ll lose about 10% or more depending on how long you sleep and how long the app is monitoring. </p><p>The plus side is that the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring has amazing battery life, so it kind of balances out, especially if sleep apnea is not a concern for you.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3624px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="h4Biwhs5D4QKeh9u9hDPgY" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-06.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4Biwhs5D4QKeh9u9hDPgY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3624" height="2038" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I do wish the exercise tracking was a little bit more robust. One of my favorite things about the Oura Ring is that it can automatically track certain exercises and activities, but it&apos;s all manual with the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring. Even after a long walk or run, the app will at least show that you&apos;ve done something to elevate your heart rate, drastically increase your steps during a certain time, and burn a ton of calories. It all points to something happening, but the app won&apos;t actually say what happened unless you manually track the workout.</p><p>And this one&apos;s asinine, but like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-smart-ring-review">first-generation RingConn Smart Ring</a>, I wish the charging case was smaller. With as much battery life as you get from the ring, having such a large charging case just seems like overkill, especially when you look at the case included with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>. Hopefully, RingConn adds this as an additional accessory that you can purchase separately.</p><p>Lastly, I wish the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring synced with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> on Android and not just Google Fit. However, iPhone users will benefit from Apple Health connectivity.</p>

<p>RingConn&apos;s biggest competitors are Oura and Samsung. The Oura Ring pretty much popularized a smart ring category, and the ordering continues to be one of the best smart rings on the market. It has great battery life, a very insightful app, automatic activity tracking, and it syncs with Health Connect. The downside is that it still relies on a monthly subscription when most other smart rings are subscription-free. This drives up the overall cost over the lifetime of the device, while the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring remains a cheaper option, even up front. </p><p>The Galaxy Ring is Samsung&apos;s first smart ring, which means that Samsung has a larger user base to appeal to since it&apos;s part of the Galaxy ecosystem. There&apos;s also no subscription here, and you get access to Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, which powers insights like the new energy score. However, as noted in our Galaxy Ring review, there are some growing pains since this is Samsung&apos;s first smart ring, with mediocre sleep tracking, gimmicky gestures, and various limitations on non-Samsung phones.</p><p>Another favorite is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>, which offers pretty advanced features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-adds-afib-new-app-store-of-powerplugs">AFib detection</a>—the first smart ring to do this. You get a pretty comprehensive set of health tracking features, although the app experience is pretty poor, and you&apos;ll have to pay more upfront for the ring, plus extra if you want the headlining AFib detection feature.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're in the market for a fairly affordable smart ring.</li><li>You don't want to pay a subscription for access to features.</li><li>You think you might suffer from sleep apnea.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want more robust exercise tracking/automatic workout detection.</li><li>You want accurate and reliable step counting.</li><li>You already own the first gen.</li></ul>
<p>Smart rings are becoming a hot new wearable category, especially now that Samsung is in the ring, so to speak. RingConn may not have the same brand power as some of the giants, but the company has a solid offering that does the basics quite well. In fact, with the impressive battery life and sleep apnea feature, the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring manages to achieve some feats that we&apos;ve mostly seen on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">smartwatches from Garmin</a> or Samsung, and it&apos;s more than capable of holding its own against the best smart rings on the market.</p><p>The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring is one smart ring that shouldn&apos;t be overlooked, as it offers great value for those who want to take charge of their health.</p>

Most phones have powerful chipsets that deliver standout performance, but because of overheating issues, these chipsets tend to throttle aggressively. Manufacturers are essentially constrained by the size, so the most they can do is add a vapor chamber to passively cool the chipset on a phone.</p>

<p>ASUS came up with a novel solution called the AeroActive Portal on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-6-pro-review">ROG Phone 6 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-7-ultimate-review">Phone 7 Ultimate</a>; this was basically a small hatch that opened up on the side of the phone, allowing cool air to flow into the heatsink when used in conjunction with the AeroActive cooler. The idea was innovative, but it led to a lot of mechanical complexity, and ASUS doesn&apos;t offer the feature on its latest phones.</p><p>But if the latest solution by xMEMS is any indication, active cooling may just be possible on mobile devices. At a high-level overview, xMEMS&apos;s XMC-2400 is a micro-cooling fan that&apos;s just 1mm thin, and like the brand&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds-with-solid-state-audio-drivers-are-about-to-go-mainstream">solid-state audio drivers</a>, it uses an all-silicon design.</p><p>Basically, xMEMS uses a voltage-controlled transducer to move the fins of the fan fast enough to generate a considerable amount of airflow. The XMC-2400 is able to deliver 39cc/sec airflow and 1,000Pa back pressure, and crucially, it is IP58 dust and water resistant, allowing it to be used on sealed devices like phones. It is available in two variants: top-vented or side-vented configurations.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5p3U-xMlJ58" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The fan measures just 9.26 x 7.6 x 1.08 millimeters, weighs less than 150 milligrams, and consumes roughly 30mW of power. The tech has a lot of similarities to Frore System&apos;s AirJet system, but it is considerably thinner, and xMEMS is positioning it as a viable solution on phones as well as, tablets, VR headsets, notebooks, and gaming handhelds.</p><p>Because it has an all-silicon construction, it doesn&apos;t make any sound, and there&apos;s no vibration as it operates at ultrasonic frequencies. While the tech makes a lot of sense on larger devices like handhelds and notebooks, it remains to be seen how airflow is handled on a phone; most phones have fully sealed designs, and that poses a problem when venting hot air outward.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zNG9UnJwsMf6woioNUYQhh" name="active-cooling.jpg" alt="xMEMS XMC-2400 silicon fan on US dime" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zNG9UnJwsMf6woioNUYQhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: xMEMS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the AirJet system, Zotac added slits to the side of its mini-PC that serves as the exhaust, but it&apos;s unlikely that phone manufacturers will start doing the same on their devices to accommodate active cooling. There&apos;s also the cost to consider; the AirJet system has been around for nearly a year, but it hasn&apos;t secured many design wins.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="reYhX3ssi2EeFipHYTgGYh" name="active-cooling-2.jpg" alt="xMEMS XMC-2400 active cooling silicon fan" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/reYhX3ssi2EeFipHYTgGYh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: xMEMS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s where xMEMS could have an advantage. As its solution is considerably smaller, it can be used in a wider variety of devices. And with xMEMS producing half a million solid-state drivers that go into the likes of the Creative <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/creative-aurvana-ace-2-review">Aurvana Ace 2</a>, it has a proven track record. The brand notes that it will start seeding the XMC-2400 active cooling solution to clients starting 2025, with retail availability a year later.</p><p>While that&apos;s a lengthy wait, if phone brands actually manage to find a way to integrate active cooling into their devices, it has the potential to be a game-changer.</p>

Honor has confirmed that it will launch the device globally at its IFA keynote on September 5, but that&apos;s not all; the Magic V3 will be joined by the MagicPad 2, and the Magicbook Art 14.</p><p>I&apos;m excited to see what Honor has in store with the Magic V3; I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a> quite a bit this year, and it remains one of my favorite foldables. Honor managed to deliver one of the thinnest foldable designs in the Magic V2, and it&apos;s building on that with the V3, which is thinner and lighter than its predecessor.</p><p>There are camera and battery tweaks as well, and with Honor positioning AI as a differentiator on its devices, the brand is likely to announce new features in this area at IFA. The battery uses 10% silicon this time, the back cover of the device uses a custom fiber that&apos;s resilient while being light, and the new hinge is just 2.84mm. </p><p>Honor is also using a new titanium-based vapor chamber that&apos;s lighter and thinner than that of the Magic V2, while offering better heat dissipation. The biggest issue with the Magic V2 was availability; although Honor announced the foldable at last year&apos;s IFA event, it didn&apos;t go on sale globally until well into 2024, and that curbed its momentum. Honor needs to do better in this area with the Magic V3.</p>

<p>While the Magic V3 undoubtedly gets all the attention, I&apos;m intrigued by the MagicPad 2 as well; it has a massive 12.3-inch OLED panel, and goes up against the iPad Pro 13. There are plenty of Android tablets, most still use LCD panels, and you don&apos;t see OLED tablets outside of Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Tab S series, so it&apos;s refreshing to see Honor target the high-end with its tablet.</p><p>Alongside the IFA keynote, Honor is hosting another event at the trade show that focuses on AI. I&apos;ll be on the ground at IFA, and will have more to share soon.</p>

<p>Consumers are still left without proper repair options for Google&apos;s Pixel Watch series — even with the third iteration.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> offers a unique glass-domed design for its watch face that makes it prone to damage. The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-watch-3-cant-be-repaired-3472994/">Android Authority</a> inquired about repair options for Google&apos;s latest smartwatch, but the answer wasn&apos;t favorable.</p><p>A Google representative stated that if your Pixel Watch 3 comes under harm, you can "the Google Pixel Watch Customer Support Team to check your replacement options."</p><p>As the publication notes, this information doesn&apos;t bode well for folks interested in repairing the device instead of grabbing a new one. An option like that would help consumers elongate the life span of their device, especially for an accidental scratch or a funky crown.</p><p>However, Google stated those interested in purchasing a Pixel Watch 3 are encouraged to grab Preferred Care. This device insurance will cover damages received, including "out-of-warranty issues." It&apos;s worth mentioning that if you are chasing a replacement device with the insurance, Google will ask for $49 in service fees.</p>

<p>Not that we were holding our breath, but Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-wont-repair-pixel-watch-displays">hasn&apos;t offered repair options</a> for its smartwatch since the beginning.

Moreover, the idea of Google repairing the watch or doing it at home has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-teardown-video">previously proven difficult</a>.</p><p>Self-repair part provider iFixit conducted a teardown of the Pixel Watch and showcased its sheer lack of repairability.

<ul><li>YouTube details several new features arriving for the NFL Sunday Ticket this year, such as fantasy team stats, scores, and breakdowns.</li><li>Ticket holders will also have access to YouTube's "build a multiview," where they can create custom experiences of two, three, or four games.</li><li>NFL Sunday Ticket holders watching on a TV should find the new TV UI redesign alongside broadcast delay, spoiler mode, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The later we get in August, the closer opening kickoff is, which is why YouTube TV is detailing some new features.</p><p>One of the highlights that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/latest-nfl-sunday-ticket-features/">YouTube TV discussed</a> today (August 20) is the inclusion of even more fantasy football stats for NFL Sunday Ticket holders. The company states that users can link their Yahoo Fantasy accounts alongside those with NFL Fantasy accounts to their Sunday Ticket.</p><p>Users can open the side panel (Scores & Stats) when watching a game to see tabs like Teams, Scores, Stats, Key Plays, and Fantasy. The final tab shows your fantasy team&apos;s current matchup, points tallied, and player performance. In-depth player details are available for each team and tapping on each one displays a full breakdown.</p><p>The post teases additions, such as the future availability for users to view "key plays and multiview combinations" involving their fantasy lineup.</p><p>Those with the NFL Sunday Ticket through YouTube TV can find the new Fantasy tab on their TVs and mobile. Those with access through YouTube will pick this feature up later this season on mobile, tablets, and the web. When the season starts, users can connect their fantasy account under the "Sports" tab <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/9119412">in your account&apos;s settings</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:991px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.44%;"><img id="M6pBpGZGwmjfi2j8zagn9J" name="youtube-tv-nfl-sunday-ticket-fantasy-tab.jpg" alt="The NFL Sunday Ticket prepares to rollout a "Fantasy" team tab for stats and scores." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M6pBpGZGwmjfi2j8zagn9J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="991" height="599" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Multiview shifts ahead this upcoming season as users can now "build" their own custom experience. YouTube states Sunday Ticket holders can create two, three, or four-game combinations on gameday. Additionally, YouTube TV&apos;s base plan members can choose to view "preferred" multiview configurations, which are chosen based on what&apos;s "local."</p><p>The Sunday Ticket through YouTube TV will have this upgraded multiview available on TVs, mobile, and tablets. For YouTube, multiview on mobile, tablets, and TVs will be ready at the start of the season.</p><p>YouTube then teased a few smaller additions that will join the NFL Sunday Ticket for kickoff. Those additions include a spoiler mode to hide scores, more playback controls (broadcast delay), and a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tv-gets-new-last-channel-shortcut">jump to last channel</a>" shortcut.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1113px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.91%;"><img id="ELyBJMnAiBswaptFPxaj6T" name="youtube-tv-nfl-sunday-ticket-custom-multview.jpg" alt="YouTube TV is bringing "build a multiview" to the NFL Sunday Ticket." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ELyBJMnAiBswaptFPxaj6T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1113" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The video streaming service reiterated that football enjoyers (should) have access to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-dual-column-tv-redesign-detailed">new TV UI redesign</a>. The company started rolling out this new dual-column approach earlier this year for YouTube TV subscribers.</p><p>Elsewhere, YouTube&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/custom-multiviews-in-youtube-tv-let-you-pick-four-basketball-games-to-watch-at-once">build a multiview</a>" may sound familiar due to its rollout for the NBA League Pass and NCAA basketball in February. During its debut, YouTube stated users could browse and select from "four pre-selected games." The company explained that its custom multiview will try and have games available for you based on "expected" popularity.</p><p>This customizable multiview experience was said to grab additional live sports and it seems that&apos;s getting underway with the NFL in 2024. Sunday football starts September 8.</p>
