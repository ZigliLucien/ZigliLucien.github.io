                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I was very excited when Google launched the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet last year</a>. I was hoping that the tablet would answer one of Google’s biggest issues: a cohesive and unified smart home strategy. </p><p>Many people had high hopes for the tablet being the device that integrated all of Google’s smart home products into one cohesive and versatile unit. However, the device functions more or less like a regular tablet with a dock and some smart home features tacked on. To top it off, the experience doesn’t lead it to be the Nest Hub replacement many had hoped for. </p><p>So when Google didn’t announce a new tablet iteration <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/made-by-google-event-2024-live-blog-pixel-9-pro-fold-watch-3-gemini-and-everything-else-we-expect-to-see">during its Pixel event</a>, I wondered if it was either because the company was taking its time by trying to combine its smart home strategy with its new Gemini efforts or if the tablet was maybe just a one-off effort.</p>
<h2 id="focusing-on-gemini-and-flagship-phones-xa0-2">Focusing on Gemini and flagship phones </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8bCUGcKHwkrXYYYUozT6G4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-gemini-live-01.jpg" alt="Talking to Gemini Live on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8bCUGcKHwkrXYYYUozT6G4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s evident that Google wanted to focus on its Android software and the integration of Gemini with its latest lineup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on" target="_blank">Pixel 9 devices</a>. Before even announcing its devices, Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of platforms & devices at Google, began his presentation by explaining how the company has integrated Gemini into its operating system. </p><p>Osterloh announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">Gemini Live will let users engage</a> in a “mobile conversational experience” to discuss “whatever’s on your mind.” The company also detailed how users can now overlay Gemini’s UI on top of any app and that this new feature will work for videos on YouTube, which lets users ask questions about what they’re watching. </p><p>It’s obvious that Google cares a lot more about its software than its hardware. In fact, I’d argue that Google’s hardware has been chiefly designed and created as a base point for its hardware and for other Android-based companies to model off of.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="o8Fi9zLSCe2rep8yKdQKuN" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-9-side-by-side-1.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8Fi9zLSCe2rep8yKdQKuN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And here’s why I think the company didn’t launch a Pixel Tablet 2: Right now, it doesn’t really care about a large-screen tablet and wants to focus on perfecting its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> strategy. By solidifying this, it will then be able to reinvent its smart home strategy around the experience, which should be integrated with Gemini, something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-to-become-smarter-with-gemini-help">we’ve already started seeing with Google Home</a>.</p><p>Gerrit Schneemann, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, added that launching Gemini Live and integrating it with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">new Nest Thermostat</a> was key and, in my opinion, likely the first thing the company needed to do to kick off this strategy. However, he adds that instead of a mobile hub, perhaps having a dedicated smart home device to combine all of Google’s smart home devices is necessary; an app could be enough. </p><p>“Especially with Gemini Live, voice becomes an even more prominent part of the user experience. And again, having a duplicate mobile screen in the home along with smartphones, doesn’t seem to add much to the value proposition,” he said. “A tablet that moves around maybe amongst users as well could easily not be where it is needed most (kitchen, side table, etc.) because someone removed it.”</p>
<h2 id="do-we-even-need-a-pixel-tablet-xa0-2">Do we even need a Pixel Tablet? </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bi7MhZGQa4eW7r5ZWBEvcF" name="google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max.jpg" alt="Nest Hub Max next to Pixel Tablet on countertop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bi7MhZGQa4eW7r5ZWBEvcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Schneemann makes a very valid point: Why would someone want to keep moving their main hub around? And the more I think about it, the more I ask myself: Does Google even need a tablet to double as a dedicated point of service for all of your smart home devices?</p><p>At the time of writing this article, all of my smart home devices are on Google. We have a thermostat, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/nest-wifi-pro-review-honestly-its-a-bit-disappointing">Nest Wi-Fi</a> system, doorbell, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-assistant-speakers">speakers</a>. Everyone in my household uses the dedicated Google Home app to control everything. </p><p>For some reason, when I got the Pixel Tablet last year, I pictured myself using it similarly to how I used the Nest Hub Max, but in almost a more futuristic way. At the end of the night, I pictured myself taking the tablet to the bedroom, shutting things down, fixing the temperature of the home, and settling into bed. That was far from the case. </p><p>Instead, the tablet replaced our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-max-review">Nest Hub Max</a> and was barely touched. I used it as a speaker occasionally while I cooked. However, I didn’t think the connection to the tablet was that great, and every time I tried to set a timer, it never worked. It came to a point where I was considering switching back to the Hub Max.</p><p>In his comparison piece, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max-kitchen-test">Tshaka Armstrong also points out</a> similar limitations to the Pixel Tablet’s Hub mode that seemingly fall short of the five-year-old Nest Hub Max. He also notes that his family isn’t big on tablets and that the Pixel Tablet will often be used to watch the occasional show in bed, although even this comes secondary to just using an actual TV. </p><p>However, that’s not to say there aren’t some who find the Pixel Tablet genuinely helpful. As noted by Armstrong, “the [Nest Hub] Max is going to be a stationary device, while you’re going to get so much more flexibility, and ultimately usability, out of the Pixel Tablet,” even if it takes time for Google to improve the experience.</p>
<h2 id="xa0-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-the-new-tablet-xa0-2"> The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the new Tablet </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="nUKPM7ujJtYLrUqaRYPByE" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-gemini-window.jpg" alt="Gemini window prompt on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nUKPM7ujJtYLrUqaRYPByE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I would argue this further by adding that perhaps Google may not even continue launching tablets because it has designed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> device to act more like the tablet you need. </p><p>Schneemann notes that with the larger 8-inch internal display, the company is basically reaching tablet size. </p><p>“Of course, this is a super-premium device with limited global availability. It’s even less likely to be a dedicated [smart home] device. But it shows that Google is thinking about the larger screen form factor — just hasn’t found the right positioning for its tablets after years of underdevelopment in the platform.” </p><p>There&apos;s also another side of that argument: is there even a market for tablets right now? </p><p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC&apos;s Worldwide Device Trackers, says that the current model of the Tablet isn’t a bestseller and “demand for traditional tablets ahs been wanning for some time.”</p><p>“While it would be great to align the launch of a new tablet with their other devices, tablets are often one of the least used compute devices for consumers and their refresh cycle has been growing, making them a lower priority for both consumers and device makers.”</p>
<h2 id="it-x2019-s-time-for-a-nest-revamp-xa0-2">It’s time for a Nest revamp </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fsxSwZiBnHnu9SoXgsVkMb" name="google-nest-learning-thermostat-gen-4-06.jpg" alt="The shiny Google Nest Learning Thermostat (Gen 4)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fsxSwZiBnHnu9SoXgsVkMb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, while a tablet may not be exactly necessary, I still think Google needs to develop a much more unified smart home strategy, and we definitely need new Nest hardware.</p><p>Of course, I asked our senior editor and resident tablet expert—as well as smart home aficionado—Andrew Myrick, his thoughts. He told me that it was odd to see Google announce an unprecedented number of devices within a two-week span and even more confusing that it’s been years since the Nest Hub has been refreshed. </p><p>He thinks this either means that we are in store for an overhauled Nest lineup sometime in the near future and that the company is “likely using the Pixel Tablet and dock design as the centerpiece.”</p><p>“Or Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/you-should-buy-google-pixel-tablet">abandoning the Tablet again</a>, and we’ll only see remedial improvements to its smart home speakers,” he said. However, like my own assumption, Myrick also believes that none of this will happen until Google has further advanced Gemini. </p><p>I love Google’s smart home devices. They’ve never failed me and have brought a lot of seamless integration into my home. However, I would love a better strategy here, one that is a bit more elevated, includes more of Gemini, and maybe has a single point-of-service hardware device akin to the Nest Hub Max, but with the kind of upgrades we’d expect in 2024.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Ring is a great starting point for Samsung, and the smart ring is available in a variety of sizes and colors. It is light and comfortable to use, and you barely even notice it. The battery life is better than the Ring Air, and you don't need a subscription to access all the features. That said, fitness and sleep monitoring are nowhere as good as the most basic smartwatches, the Ring is missing a boatload of features that are standard on its rivals, and the worst part is that gestures and select insights are limited to Galaxy phones.</p></p>

<p>I used the Ring Air throughout 2024, and it has been terrific. The smart ring is so unobtrusive that I don't notice it most of the time, and it has titanium bands. The app has a ton of useful metrics, and it does automatic workout detection and a whole slate of cool extras. That said, fitness monitoring has been inconsistent in my usage, but that has gotten better with subsequent updates. I didn't think I would like the Ring Air as much as I do, and if you're mulling a smart ring, it gets my recommendation.</p></p>

<p>There&apos;s only so much you can do with the design of a smart ring, and as a result both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman&apos;s Ring Air</a> end up looking largely identical. The Galaxy Ring is made out of titanium and is available in a multitude of colors, and it is light enough that you don&apos;t notice it. While Samsung says it uses a scratch-resistant coating, that hasn&apos;t been the case on my colleague Nick Sutrich&apos;s unit, which picked up visible scratches in just a week of use.</p><p>The Ring Air is also made out of titanium, and it has matte and glossy colors that contrast the design well. it is a smidgen lighter than the Galaxy Ring, and it is extremely comfortable in daily use; I barely even notice that I&apos;m wearing a smart ring these days. It has its share of scratches as well, so I&apos;d recommend getting a lighter color.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="s2JMLAg9gfcFFFs72AYoqY" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-held-in-fingertips.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air held in fingertips to show the Ultrahuman logo engraved inside." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s2JMLAg9gfcFFFs72AYoqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both rings have a similar set of sensors, and they&apos;re recommended to be used on your index or middle fingers. Samsung and Ultrahuman send out sizing kits so you can accurately determine your ring size, and as both brands use custom sizing, it&apos;s recommend you try out the designs in the sizing kit to gauge the fit.</p><p>Both smart rings have ridges on the underside where the sensors come into contact with your finger, and while I thought it would be uncomfortable, that hasn&apos;t been the case at all. The only difference to a regular ring is that smart rings are noticeably bigger, but they&apos;re lighter than they look, and at least with the Ring Air, there wasn&apos;t any issue with the design or fit.</p>

<p>Smart rings offer a significantly easier way to monitor fitness and health data, and while they don&apos;t have an extensive feature-set like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a>, they&apos;re great at the basics. Both rings measure 24/7 heart rate, heart rate variability, and skin temperature, and they monitor stress levels throughout the day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="J639EEm5a9rtBGZunsB9uf" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-on-pointing-finger.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air worn on an index finger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J639EEm5a9rtBGZunsB9uf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to activity monitoring, the Ring Air has been inconsistent in my usage, and the data isn&apos;t as reliable as a regular smartwatch. That said, subsequent updates have made a difference, and the key point is that it does a better job than the Galaxy Ring.</p>
<p>The Ring Air didn&apos;t have automatic workout detection, and it was a point of contention when I started using the smart ring earlier in the year. Thankfully, Ultrahuman added the feature via a software update, and while it is buggy at times, it is a great new addition. So even if you don&apos;t manually start an activity before working out, it will start tracking your activity levels and vitals, and give you a notification within the app to log the activity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ibuzM2msdM3tr56zQPNZfj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-find-my-ring-lights.jpg" alt="The gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ibuzM2msdM3tr56zQPNZfj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Ring also has this feature, but it only does so with two activities: running and walking. That limits its ability to measure workouts on its own, and the Ring Air has the edge in this regard. Another area where the smart ring outshines Samsung is sleep monitoring; I got useful metrics out of the Ring Air, but the Galaxy Ring still has a long way to do in this area — it just doesn&apos;t provide reliable details.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3sGWcko3E7aG2PnDTK5TxW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-battery-life-01.jpg" alt="The gold Samsung Galaxy Ring alongside the Samsung Wearables app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3sGWcko3E7aG2PnDTK5TxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both smart rings connect via Bluetooth, and they have decent battery life. I got four days of usage out of the Ring Air between charges, and while that&apos;s good enough in its own right, the Galaxy Ring does better. Samsung&apos;s smart ring manages to last a day longer than the Ring Air, so that should give you at least five days of usage. Samsung&apos;s charging dock looks pretty cool too, and although the Galaxy Ring has a smaller battery, it has better longevity.</p><p>Where the Ring Air has a distinct advantage is connectivity; it doesn&apos;t lock any features to a platform, and you get the same feature-set on all Android phones and iPhones. You don&apos;t need to pay any monthly fees to use all the features, although Ultrahuman is rolling out custom additions that cost extra — they&apos;re not necessary if you just want a smart ring to monitor activity and health data.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="GANrGVbUgtMvUjSiHHfDtk" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-08.jpg" alt="The gold Samsung Galaxy Ring in a puddle of water" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GANrGVbUgtMvUjSiHHfDtk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Annoyingly, Samsung restricts the usability of the Galaxy Ring in several ways; find my device is exclusive to Galaxy phones, so if you use another Android device, you can&apos;t use the feature to locate your Galaxy Ring. There&apos;s no way to use the smart ring with an iPhone — unlike the Ring Air — and the most egregious feature limitation is gestures; the Galaxy Ring has a few gestures to control your phone, but you need a Samsung phone.</p>

<p>If you have a Samsung phone and want a smart ring to go with the device, the Galaxy Ring should be a decent choice. It isn&apos;t available in all regions just yet, and it costs more than its rivals, and it just doesn&apos;t have the same robust feature-set as the Ring Air. That&apos;s obviously going to change over the coming months as Samsung adds features to the smart ring, but if you need something that&apos;s fleshed-out now, the Galaxy Ring isn&apos;t it.</p><p>The Ring Air is a much better alternative. It has better automatic workout detection, has usable metrics that work on all platforms, and does a good job with sleep monitoring. It also costs less, and although the battery doesn&apos;t last as long as the Galaxy Ring, I consistently got four days of use between charges, and that&apos;s decent enough. If I had to recommend a smart ring, it&apos;d have to be the Ring Air.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Microsoft’s new feature for Windows 10 and 11 aims to rival Apple’s AirDrop, making file sharing between PCs and Android devices super easy.</li><li>Integrated into the Phone Link app, it simplifies file transfers if you update both Phone Link and Link to Windows apps.</li><li>Currently, this feature is only available to Windows Insider Program members (Release Preview Channel), but a wider release is expected soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Apple’s AirDrop is hard to beat for file sharing, but Microsoft is closing in with a new feature designed to make transferring files between PCs and Android devices a breeze.</p><p>Microsoft has launched a new feature in Windows 10 and 11 that mimics Apple’s AirDrop for Android, first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/this-new-feature-is-basically-airdrop-but-for-windows-pcs-and-android" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>. It’s built into the Phone Link app, so you can easily share files between your PC and phone. Just update Phone Link and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-your-phone-android-what-it-and-how-does-it-work">Link to Windows</a> app, and you’ll be set to swap files effortlessly.</p><p>The new file-sharing feature boosts the Phone Link and Link to Windows apps, which already handle calls, screen mirroring, and syncing notifications and messages. Microsoft details this new addition in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/seamlessly-transfer-content-between-your-devices-8a0ead3c-2f15-1338-66ca-70cf4ae81fcb" target="_blank">support document</a>.</p><p>Before this update, Phone Link mainly handled notification mirroring, app use, and call management.</p><p>To share files from a Windows PC to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, just pick Phone Link as the destination in File Explorer. For the reverse, use the regular Android sharing menu and select Link to Windows as the sharing method.</p><p>Whatever direction the file is moving, the receiving device will get a heads-up with a notification about the incoming transfer.</p><p>For smooth file sharing between your Windows PC and Android device, make sure your PC has the Phone Link app version 1.24032.156.0 or later and your phone has the Link to Windows app version 1.24032.518.0 or higher.</p><p>To send a file from Windows, open File Explorer, right-click the file, and choose Share from the menu. In the Share window, pick Phone Link as the vehicle.</p><p>On the flip side, to share a file from your Android device, tap on any file and hit the Share icon. Choose Link to Windows from the sharing options, then select your PC’s name.</p><p>While Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-airdrop-rival-nearby-share-finally-starts-rolling-out-today">Nearby Share</a> already lets you transfer files between Windows and Android devices, Microsoft’s new feature promises to make the process even smoother and more efficient.</p><p>As per Windows Central, this AirDrop-like feature is currently only available to those in the Windows Insider Program’s Release Preview Channel, which tests near-final updates. But it&apos;s a safe bet that a wider release for everyone is on the way.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Underwhelming</strong></em></p>
<p>I'll be upfront in my dislike of the Galaxy Z Fold 6; Samsung just didn't enough to differentiate the device against its predecessor, or even the Z Fold 4. It has the same basic design, the battery life hasn't received any meaningful attention, it charges at 25W, and the cameras are the same as last year. There is IP48 ingress protection, a lighter chassis, and the phone will get seven Android OS updates, but given what it costs, I'm not convinced you should actually buy the Z Fold 6 — if you're interested in a foldable and won't consider another brand, you should just get the Z Fold 5 instead.</p></p>

<p>The Open launched nearly a year ago, but unlike Samsung, OnePlus didn't see the need to roll out a new model just for the sake of it. The phone still has a lot to offer; the design is one of the best in this segment, the hinge has a better articulation, and the crease isn't as noticeable as the Z Fold 6. You also get a cover screen that's better to use, bigger battery that lasts longer, better cameras at the back, 67W charging, and a slate of custom software features that make multitasking a breeze. The foldable has its own set of issues; the foldable only has IPX4 water resistance, and it will receive just three Android updates. But as an overall device, the Open has the definite edge over the Z Fold 6.</p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LTzjwGG5PGftdiscbRafVh" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-vs-oneplus-open-4.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. OnePlus Open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LTzjwGG5PGftdiscbRafVh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has proven that it doesn&apos;t like changing the designs of its flagships, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> looks nearly identical to its predecessor. Samsung increased the width of the cover panel to make it less annoying to use, but it still ends up being too narrow.</p><p>Outside of that tweak, the Z Fold 6 doesn&apos;t have any meaningful design changes. Samsung was able to bring down the weight by 14g, and coming in at 239g, the foldable is easier to hold and use. That said, the hinge isn&apos;t as smooth as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables</a>, and the crease is still immediately noticeable. There are areas that Samsung needed to address, but it decided to not bother.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hZwTA5cfMLgqciRjF7wEjR" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-16.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and OnePlus Open crease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hZwTA5cfMLgqciRjF7wEjR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">Open</a>, OnePlus managed to deliver one of the best-looking designs in this segment, and the leather back looks elegant next to the oversized camera housing. The foldable has ideal dimensions, and the cover panel is much better to use — most of the time, I don&apos;t feel the need to unfold the device at all.</p>
<p>While I like the design of the Open a lot better, the foldable misses out on water resistance; with just an IPX4 rating, it can only withstand splashes of water. The Z Fold 6, meanwhile, has IP48 dust and water resistance, and it can be easily submerged in up to a meter of water without any issues.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="KiGYuph4f4JDjUtXAqvJVN" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-17.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and OnePlus Open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KiGYuph4f4JDjUtXAqvJVN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the Open takes the lead is the displays; the 6.31-inch OLED cover screen has exquisite colors and gets bright enough in outdoor use, and the sizing is just right. The 7.82-inch inner AMOLED panel is noticeably larger than what Samsung is offering, and it also has standout colors. Both panels get 120Hz dynamic refresh, and get a smidgen brighter than the Z Fold 6 in HDR content.</p><p>Samsung has a 6.3-inch cover panel and 7.6-inch inner screen, and both have 120Hz dynamic refresh and good visibility outdoors. My main issue is that the cover panel is still too limiting to use, and that inhibits the device&apos;s potential.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-vs-oneplus-open-hardware-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. OnePlus Open: Hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AQxSSYtjCKrE74bFidfA8U" name="oneplus-open-2024-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AQxSSYtjCKrE74bFidfA8U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, while the Open comes with last year&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. Having used dozens of devices powered by both chipsets, the only difference that&apos;s noticeable in daily use is efficiency; the 8 Gen 3 is able to deliver equivalent levels of performance as the 8 Gen 2 while consuming less power.</p><p>That said, that&apos;s nullified in this scenario as the Open has a larger battery. The 4805mAh battery on the foldable easily lasts a day, and even with heavy use, I wasn&apos;t anxious about the battery running out. The Z Fold 6 also manages to last a day consistently, but if you push the device too much, you will need to plug it in before the day&apos;s out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kcpfK8EvvjWbLbwPqfyKgY" name="oneplus-open-2024-19.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kcpfK8EvvjWbLbwPqfyKgY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, Samsung is still sticking to 25W charging tech, and that just isn&apos;t enough in 2024. In a similar vein, you don&apos;t get a charger in the box. The Open doesn&apos;t have these shortcomings; it charges at 67W, and the battery takes 44 minutes to fully charge. And unlike Samsung, OnePlus bundles a 67W charger in the box.</p><p>Just like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 comes with 256GB of storage on the base model, and you&apos;ll need to shell out an additional $120 to get the 512GB model. The Open has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage on the base version, and there&apos;s a new 2024 edition of the device that has 1TB of storage.</p><p>Both phones are fluid in daily use, and they hold up just as well in demanding games. They tend to throttle earlier than regular flagships, but you don&apos;t notice any visible jitter, and there isn&apos;t much in the way of overheating.</p>

<p>Switching over to the cameras, Samsung hasn&apos;t made any changes to the hardware, and as such the Z Fold 6 has the same sensors as last year: a 50MP main camera, 10MP 3x zoom lens, and 12MP wide-angle lens. Samsung is instead turning to tweaks in its camera algorithms to deliver better photos, and the foldable manages to do a marginally better job than its predecessor in this regard.</p>

<p>That said, it still doesn&apos;t measure up to what the Open is offering. The foldable has a 48MP main camera, 64MP 3x zoom lens, and another 48MP wide-angle lens, and outside of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it takes the best photos and videos in this category.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XKDTTyRwiSSteTZzDkjoq6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-6.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 in Flex Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XKDTTyRwiSSteTZzDkjoq6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has a distinct edge on the software, and that&apos;s purely because it offers seven Android OS updates to the Z Fold 6. By contrast, the Open will pick up just three OS updates, and that isn&apos;t anywhere close to being enough. I&apos;d say that OnePlus needs to change its stance, but the Chinese manufacturer made it abundantly clear that long-term updates just isn&apos;t something it is interested in offering.</p><p>And when it comes to the software itself, the Z Fold 6 runs One UI 6.1.1 based on Android 14 out of the box, and just like the Galaxy S24 devices, it comes with Galaxy AI, a suite of utilities that rely on AI to streamline daily tasks. My issue with Galaxy AI is that it is predominantly limited to Samsung&apos;s own apps; I don&apos;t use Samsung Internet or Samsung Keyboard, and outside of the image-editing features, I don&apos;t get much utility out of Galaxy AI.</p><p>The Open also has AI-assisted utilities, but they&apos;re not as extensive as what Samsung is offering — that&apos;s a good thing. The image editing feature is similar to Google&apos;s offering on the Pixels, and audio transcribing gets a decent amount of usage. What I actually like is the multitasking-focused software features; the Open makes it effortlessly easy to pull up windows side-by-side to maximize real estate, and it gets a lot right in this regard.</p>

<p>The biggest thing that changed with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is the price; the foldable costs $100 more than its predecessor, and I&apos;m not really sure why that is the case. Samsung isn&apos;t really offering any meaningful upgrades, and while the Z Fold 6 is lighter and has a marginally wider cover panel, there isn&apos;t a good enough reason to pick it up over last year&apos;s Z Fold 5.</p><p>The Open, on the other hand, is an easier recommendation. It has a better design, two screens that you&apos;ll actually end up using, better software features, and it lasts longer in daily use. You also get one of the best camera packages on a foldable, and there&apos;s 67W charging.</p><p>The best part is that the Open doesn&apos;t cost anywhere as much as the Z Fold 6; the 16GB/512GB edition costs $1,399 in the U.S., and the new 1TB model can be bought for as low as $1,599, and you get the terrific Keyboard 81 Pro bundled with the package. The Z Fold 6, meanwhile, costs an absurd $2,019, and it just isn&apos;t worth it.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>According to a research paper by Google, Imagen 3 is a top performer, creating high-quality images from text and beating other models in tests.</li><li>Imagen 3 has improved understanding of user prompts and includes safeguards against generating offensive or illegal content, unlike xAI’s more controversial Grok-2.</li><li>Feedback suggests Imagen 3 has stricter restrictions compared to previous models, likely as a response to issues with Google's earlier Gemini model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google just rolled out Imagen 3, its updated AI-powered image generator, but instead of its usual big reveal, the tech giant chose to slip the advanced model into everyone&apos;s hands in the U.S. without much fanfare.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07009" target="_blank">research paper</a> from Google, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-quietly-opens-imagen-3-access-to-all-u-s-users/" target="_blank">VentureBeat</a>, describes Imagen 3 as a latent diffusion model that excels at creating high-quality images from text prompts. The paper also claims that Imagen 3 outperformed other models in tests.</p><p>Google first introduced its advanced image generator at its I/O conference in May. But it wasn’t until later this month that the company made it widely available through its Vertex AI platform.</p><p>The tech giant claimed major improvements in how well Imagen 3 understands user prompts. Like other AI image generators, it can create detailed visuals from text descriptions but has limits on generating offensive or illegal content. To prevent misuse, the model won’t produce images of public figures or any weapon-related visuals.</p><p>This is in contrast to xAI’s Grok-2, which has fewer restrictions and has become a hotspot for controversial images on the web.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1eo3ge9/comment/lhgrw57/" target="_blank">User feedback</a> reveals that Imagen 3 comes with tighter restrictions compared to earlier versions, reflecting the larger challenges surrounding AI image generators. These tools have sparked ongoing debates, with new AI-generated content frequently grabbing attention, stirring controversy, or dividing opinions online.</p><p>Google seems to be taking a cautious approach with Imagen 3’s rollout. It’s still unclear if it&apos;ll keep this conservative stance as the model evolves.</p><p>Google’s cautious approach with Imagen 3 might be a reaction to the backlash against its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> model earlier this year. After Gemini produced historically inaccurate images that distorted racial representation, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-ai-image-generation-disabled">paused its image generation to fix the problems</a>.</p><p>The Mountain View-based company also mentioned that Imagen 3 will come in different versions tailored for various uses, like quick sketching or high-resolution image creation.</p><p>Users can also tweak images by choosing specific areas and giving detailed instructions. To check it out, head to Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/image-fx" target="_blank">AI Test Kitchen website</a>, sign in with your Google account, and dive into the platform.</p>

<p>Google pandered to runners like me with the Pixel Watch 3, and barring a couple of mistakes and missing features, it did an excellent job. But my excitement was immediately tempered by the news of another nail in the Fitbit brand&apos;s coffin, one that limits who&apos;ll actually get to take advantage of these new running tools.</p><p>Up until now, running with a Pixel Watch was a bare-bones experience. You turned on the GPS, saw a few stats on your wrist during a run, and received a simple summary afterward. </p><p>The Fitbit OS is slightly better, though I found certain features, like creating intervals, needlessly complicated. Also, its daily recommendations and Premium workouts always felt more geared towards indoor workouts. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> changes things, adding tools like user-made workouts, AI-generated runs based on your Daily Readiness, a cardio load score that takes weeks of workout data and your target load into account, running form insights, and a Morning Brief summarizing everything you need to know before a run. </p><p>Google even says it improved heart rate accuracy when running by reducing "light artifacts" caused by rapid arm pumping. Based on our review testing, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 2</a> was no slouch in this area.</p>

<p>It&apos;s not <em>everything</em> I&apos;d want out of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watch</a>, to be clear. The Pixel Watch 3 won&apos;t let you race past times. You can&apos;t download offline GPX maps, and Google has yet to take full advantage of Google Maps for things like courses or Back to Start. There&apos;s no Garmin Coach equivalent for long-term training plans, either. But this is nitpicking, and Wear OS 5 has things on the right track.</p><p>I&apos;m more disappointed that Google didn&apos;t follow Samsung&apos;s example with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and put dual-band GPS in the Pixel Watch 3. I&apos;ve had bad luck with GPS-only tracking on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a>, though the Watch 3 antenna should be much better. I can&apos;t really criticize it until I test the accuracy for myself, but it does feel like a slightly missed opportunity.</p>

<p>So what&apos;s the <em>real</em> problem? It&apos;s that the future of Fitbit smartwatches apparently rests on the Pixel Watch, and it remains uncertain if Google intends to bring these Fitbit insights to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">Fitbit-branded watches</a> (and I wouldn&apos;t bet on it).</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/waiting-for-a-new-fitbit-smartwatch-google-says-thats-the-pixel-watch-3-202314838.html">Engadget&apos;s Cherlynn Low</a> interviewed Sandeep Waraich, senior director of product management for Pixel Wearables, at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google 2024 event</a> earlier this week when Waraich gave her some unfortunate news.</p><p>Low asked Waraich about other Fitbit-branded smartwatches; he responded that "Pixel Watch is our smartwatch part of the portfolio" and that any Fitbits moving forward would offer a minimalist experience. He says Fitbit users want "a simple experience" and pointed to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-inspire-3-review">Fitbit Inspire 3</a> as an example.</p><p>He clarified that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review" target="_blank">Fitbit Sense 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review" target="_blank">Versa 4</a> will remain available, but we may not see Sense 3 or Versa 5 for a long time, if ever.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Fitbit, asking if these new running features could be added to past Sense and Versa watches and to confirm the news above. A spokesperson responded, saying that Google is "very committed to Fitbit" and to "the customers that use and depend on those products and technology." However, they did not comment on whether we would see these new running features on your Fitbit anytime soon, which doesn&apos;t leave me very hopeful.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve written in the past about Fitbit&apos;s struggles as a brand, so I&apos;ll keep it brief. Fitbit used to be a top-selling wearable brand, but it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-sales-are-going-up-and-the-apple-watch-extends-its-dominance">fell from 7th to 10th in total sales</a> in 2022, as per Counterpoint, and now rarely appears outside of the "Other" category on industry reports.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-confining-fitbit-makes-financial-sense-but-missed-opportunity">cut the territories</a> where it sold Fitbit devices in half in late 2023. A few months later, Fitbit&apos;s executives — including founders James Park and Eric Friedman — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-lays-off-hundreds-in-ar-assistant-while-losing-fitbit-executives">left Google</a> under unclear circumstances. Since then, Fitbit has presumably fallen under the Google wearables umbrella, with no one left to advocate for Fitbit as a separate entity.</p><p>The last Fitbit-branded device — released before the executive exodus — was the respectable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a>. It was essentially a reboxed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-charge-5-review">Charge 5</a> with new Google apps and a Google-made algorithm for better heart rate. We&apos;d hoped new Sense and Versa watches were next; instead, we&apos;ll probably see a petite Fitbit Inspire 4 band next year.</p><p>Here&apos;s the problem: Fitbit&apos;s pivot to focus on cheap fitness bands makes very little economic sense. Look at this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/worldwide-wearable-band-market-q1-2024">2024 Canalys report</a> showing how smartwatches dominate basic bands in total sales. In 2020, trackers and smartwatches made up 46% and 37% of the market, respectively; today, basic bands only account for 17%, versus 37% for smartwatches. By 2028, analysts predict, it&apos;ll be 12% and 48%, respectively.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="dCB7BFwvWviGc9UboSwuvA" name="Canalys-wearables-report-2024.jpeg" alt="A 2024 Canalys chart titled "Wristwatches will continue to steal wristband share."

<p>Abandoning your Fitbit smartwatches for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 3</a> and tiny Fitbit bands feels...short-sighted. It cuts out Fitbit&apos;s many iOS power users, as well as Android-using athletes who want a lightweight fitness watch that lasts a week and not a 24-hour Pixel Watch or a tiny-screened Inspire with no built-in GPS.</p><p>Even though the Fitbit Charge 6 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">best fitness tracker</a> available today, many people skip it because of the relatively high price and subscription. Jitesh Ubrani, IDC&apos;s research manager for wearables, says Fitbit has struggled to compete against "low-cost, value-oriented brands such as Xiaomi, Amazfit, or Huawei." Why spend $160 + $10/month when you can pay $40 for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/xiaomis-next-gen-fitness-tracker-could-hit-stores-worldwide-soon">Xiaomi Smart Band 9</a>?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5111px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7CYB4VkaSFhmKx45pLQhJ3" name="google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-45mm-fitbit-quick-start.jpg" alt="Fitbit Quick Start buttons on Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7CYB4VkaSFhmKx45pLQhJ3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5111" height="2875" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In light of that, I&apos;d always hoped that Fitbit would double down on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a>, optimizing its fitness software and health sensors on the Sense and Versa lineups, then porting those features to the Pixel Watch for Android power users who don&apos;t care as much about battery life.</p><p>Instead, at this rate, Fitbit will become more niche than ever as it pivots to the fitness band form factor that most people are starting to abandon in favor of smartwatches or smart rings.</p><p>Brands like Garmin, Coros, and Polar still cater to runners, but these focus much more on training guidance than health data. The Pixel Watch 3 takes the reverse approach, and I&apos;m genuinely excited to put it through its paces. However, Fitbit&apos;s hardware could have struck a balance between fitness and health, as well as smarts and efficiency. That&apos;s not gonna happen now.</p>

I didn&apos;t expect there to be (tech publications often receive details about products early so they can be prepared for their launch), but I still had a small sliver of hope. I was disappointed like I am every year.</p><p>I&apos;ve finally decided I&apos;m no longer going to have any expectations about seeing a wearable designed for wheelchair users from companies like Google, Samsung, or Apple because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">the wearable market</a> is like the market for every product; it&apos;s based on profits and not some lofty humanitarian effort.</p>

<p>I&apos;ll start by saying there <em>is</em> a wearable designed for people like me so it&apos;s not like we&apos;ve been forgotten. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">Garmin Venu 3</a> does an amazing job keeping track of how often I fail to meet my fitness goals, tracks workout routines specifically designed for folks in wheelchairs, and has been tailored for the physical changes and challenges people in a chair face. And it does an excellent job doing it.</p><p>I&apos;ll also say it&apos;s not the best smartwatch out there because of its software. It runs a proprietary Garmin-built operating system that isn&apos;t as intuitive or feature-packed as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Google&apos;s Wear OS</a> or Apple&apos;s watchOS. Besides, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> looks really good, and I like things that look nice. I just want one.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Google can&apos;t have the same priorities as I do because it wants to sell watches. Google could prioritize a wheelchair mode complete with algorithm changes based on physiology for the next Pixel Watch, but that&apos;s not going to open many wallets.</p><p>Almost every product is like this. In the U.S., <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theregreview.org/2023/03/28/welch-ross-opening-the-skies-to-passengers-who-use-wheelchairs/">8.5% of the population has some sort of mobility issue</a>. Of those people, 15% use a wheelchair. That&apos;s 15% of 8.5%, or about 3.5 million people. That&apos;s a lot of people, but when compared to the 343 million people who <em>aren&apos;t</em> in a wheelchair, it puts the number into perspective. You see this in your daily life — you will find people using a chair, but not very many.</p>
<p>Most companies can not cater to marginalized groups. Yes, I said that and I can, because I&apos;m part of that group. Don&apos;t get mad. Garmin does it because it found a way to do it without compromising the work on features built for everyone else. Other smartwatch companies will let you set your wearable in chair mode without core changes to how fitness tracking works, and that&apos;s enough to include everyone without making things difficult for development.</p><p>This goes for every group of people with any sort of special need. Android Central&apos;s Phones editor, Nick Sutrich, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">can&apos;t use phones that flicker</a> the screen too slowly because he&apos;s sensitive to this.

<p>These companies can&apos;t change their products to better serve the needs of the relatively few people affected. I guess they <em>could</em>, but that would be a silly business decision because it&apos;s spending money in a way that doesn&apos;t make your product better for the vast majority of people. It would only slow the development of features everyone wants.</p><p>I don&apos;t have to like this, but I&apos;ve decided I&apos;m going to stop hating it so much. With every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch</a> launch, I&apos;ve told myself this could be the year they make a watch for me. It&apos;s never that year.</p><p>Meanwhile, Android Central has contacted Google regarding any potential plans to bring wheelchair-focused features to the Pixel Watch but has not received a response in time for publication. I will update this article when I hear back.</p>
<p>Still, you should not let any of this influence your buying decision unless you&apos;re affected. Look at what gives you the best feature-to-value ratio, then buy whatever you like the most. Nobody in a wheelchair <del>is going to</del> should ever try to police your tastes. </p><p>Rock your new Pixel Watch and enjoy it. I&apos;ll wear my Garmin Venu 3 until it dies, but I&apos;ll be a <em>little</em> jealous.</p>

Well, before you do, those of you who want the Pixel 9 Pro Fold are out of luck if you were looking to purchase the device through AT&T. While the carrier has highlighted the impending availability of the Pixel 9 series, the company curiously left out the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>So what gives? We&apos;re not sure, but Android Central did reach out for a comment. Perhaps the original Pixel Fold didn&apos;t sell well enough for AT&T to justify carrying the sequel? After all, these aren&apos;t cheap phones. Still, AT&T does carry the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, so your guess is as good as ours until we receive an official statement from AT&T on the matter.

The company was just dealt a major blow after a judge ruled that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">maintaining an illegal monopoly</a> on search. However, as a result of the ruling, it looks like the U.S. is considering potentially breaking up the company.</p><p>The units up for consideration for Google to divest are Android and Chrome, two major products for Google. According to Statista, Android is used on about 70% of devices worldwide, while Chrome holds over 50% of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545520/market-share-of-internet-browsers-usa/">browser market in the United States</a>.</p><p>However, it may not come to this. The Justice Department is also considering much less drastic moves, such as making Google share its search data with others, which could definitely level the playing field. The government may also ban exclusive contracts like those Google made with companies like Apple to secure itself as a default search engine, which could have interesting consequences for the company.</p><p>These proposals would have to be approved by Judge Amit Mehta, and it seems no decisions have been made, so we&apos;ll keep an eye on the situation as it unfolds.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-app-mirroring-improved"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>One of the cool things about the Link to Windows app is that it allows users to stream their apps or mirror their screens on their PCs. However, one limitation can muddy the experience: You need to give permission to start the streaming process every time you want to open an app.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-devices-confirmed">One UI 6.1.1</a>, that appears to no longer be the case. As pointed out by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-6-1-1-streaming-apps-windows-3469490/">Android Authority</a>, Microsoft made some changes to how the Link to Windows app works and asks for permissions, letting users opt to "Always allow" mirroring. </p><p>The move definitely streamlines the process of streaming apps to your computer. Of course, you can always use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> to achieve more or less the same thing on a desktop-like UI.</p><p>The catch is that One UI 6.1.1 is only available on the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, with no word on when it will arrive on other Samsung devices. Hopefully, it&apos;s soon, as users are hoping to get Android 15 sooner rather than later after it rolls out on Pixel phones.</p>

There have been a few leaks of the Galaxy S24 FE, but the latest suggests that we may be getting the phone fairly soon.</p><p>The phone appears in what looks like press images, revealing the specs and likely colors the phone will launch in. It seems the phone will have a 6.7-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1900 nits of brightness. On the back, we see a triple camera system with a 50MP primary, 12MP ultrawide, and 8MP 3x telephoto. The display will be protected by Gorilla Glass Victus Plus, and the phone will feature an aluminum frame.</p><p>The report from Android Headlines also mentions an Exynos 2400e that will power the phone, likely a slightly downgraded version of the current flagship chipset for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. As for when we&apos;re getting the phone, that&apos;s anyone&apos;s guess. However, it can&apos;t be long now.</p>

<p>Google's second-gen foldable comes with a ton of tweaks; it is significantly lighter and thinner than its predecessor, and both the inner and outer panels are noticeably brighter. There's decent hardware, one of the best camera packages in this category, and a design that's in line with the regular Pixel 9 Pro. Combine all of that with a clean software and plenty of cool AI features, and you get a foldable that excels in key areas.</p></p>

<p>Even though it isn't a new device, the Open continues to be a great choice if you need a new foldable. It is lighter than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, has brighter AMOLED panels, and its cameras hold their own against what Google is offering. You get a smoother hinge articulation, crease that isn't as visible, battery that lasts longer, and 67W charging. Basically, it has a lot of features that you'll actually end up using, but the software is limited; there are useful software features, but the phone will only get three Android updates.</p></p>

<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-oneplus-open-design-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. OnePlus Open: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dS9GZeJta4Bn4kmYb8crCC" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-oneplus-open-face-down.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold and OnePlus Open face-down with screens open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dS9GZeJta4Bn4kmYb8crCC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> was a showcase of Google&apos;s ambitions, but it was too heavy, and wasn&apos;t available widely. Google is rectifying both issues with the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>; the foldable is 26g lighter than its predecessor, and is significantly thinner. While it isn&apos;t the thinnest or lightest foldable — Honor and Vivo claimed those niches — it is thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, and Google is using that to its advantage in North America.</p><p>Coming to the design itself, Google did a good job maintaining the same design aesthetic as the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> series, and the dual-stacked camera housing at the back looks great. That said, the defining design feature is the side profile where the cover screen meets the metal chassis, and this is similar to the Open — but a little more prominent.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xHEmLL3ihZfhAp6ZcUyQjB" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-obsidian-porcelain-side-by-side-angle-closer.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Porcelain and Obsidian face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHEmLL3ihZfhAp6ZcUyQjB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the overall design, but coming in at 257g, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is 18g heavier than the Open while having a smaller battery. Google went with an aluminum frame and upgraded hinge, and while it gets to claim that the foldable is thinner than its rivals, the added weight isn&apos;t ideal. That said, the one area where the foldable has an advantage is water resistance; with an IPX8 rating, it is able to withstand water ingress — the Open only has an IPX4 rating that covers splashes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eGyLKviAK3wq4uCoqV8HdX" name="oneplus-open-2024-18.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eGyLKviAK3wq4uCoqV8HdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the Open isn&apos;t without its wins. The foldable has a faux leather back that&apos;s great to hold, and it has a hinge with one of the best articulations in the segment. The crease is barely noticeable in the middle of the inner panel, and OnePlus nailed the design basics.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-oneplus-open-displays-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. OnePlus Open: Displays</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FGpDTKpipC2U464JTXWyCb" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-split-screen-prompt-alt.jpg" alt="Split-screen prompt on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FGpDTKpipC2U464JTXWyCb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google clearly liked what OnePlus was doing on its foldable, because it went with a similarly-sized outer panel on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The foldable has a 6.3-inch OLED panel with a 20:9 ratio, and the width makes it just as usable as the regular Pixel 9 Pro. In fact, Google went with the same dimensions, and if the foldable looks like it has the panel of the Pixel 9 Pro up front, that&apos;s by design.</p><p>While the Pixel 9 Pro has a QHD panel, the foldable uses an FHD+ resolution (2424 x 1080) on the outside, but it still gets 120Hz dynamic refresh and decent brightness levels. The inner OLED panel is interesting as well, as the 8.0-inch size is one of the biggest on a foldable. Like other devices in this category, the inner panel has a plastic layer protecting the screen, and it also goes up to 120Hz and hits the same brightness levels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dXEAa8WVpZvUdAtztpADwX" name="oneplus-open-2024-20.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dXEAa8WVpZvUdAtztpADwX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Talking about brightness, the device is able to go up to 2,700 nits in HDR content, and that&apos;s double that of its predecessor. I&apos;ll update this post once I start using the foldable to gauge how bright it gets in regular use, but there shouldn&apos;t be any issues in this area.</p><p>The Open is a known quantity, and it has a 6.31-inch cover panel and 7.82-inch inner screen. Both panels get 120Hz refresh with dynamic refresh, have a higher resolution than what Google is offering, and excellent color vibrancy and brightness levels. I used the Open extensively over the course of the last year, and didn&apos;t see any issues with either panel.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-oneplus-open-hardware-and-cameras-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. OnePlus Open: Hardware and cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4aNfnwyja9Ag9HUzaN8KRY" name="oneplus-open-2024-16.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4aNfnwyja9Ag9HUzaN8KRY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has a unique take on the hardware, and while the Tensor G4 platform is technically new, it doesn&apos;t differ too much to the G3. It isn&apos;t as fast as what Qualcomm is offering, but that&apos;s not the point; Google chooses to focus on the AI side of things, as it sees that being a bigger differentiator.</p><p>Although the Open is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, it is still able to deliver outstanding performance in demanding titles. It is optimized to take advantage of the hardware, and doesn&apos;t have any lag in daily use. While both devices come with 16GB of RAM, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold only has 256GB of storage on the base model, and you&apos;ll need to pay an additional $120 to get the 512GB edition. The Open doesn&apos;t have such shortcomings, and the foldable has 512GB of storage as standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5VEqQ3Ah5DyuAJhYnx4yVV" name="oneplus-open-2024-7.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5VEqQ3Ah5DyuAJhYnx4yVV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Open also has a larger battery, but where it has a sizeable advantage is the charging tech; the foldable goes up to 67W, and you can easily charge the battery in under 50 minutes — Google still relies on 21W charging on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The Open comes with a 67W charger as well, and that&apos;s an added bonus.</p><p>I&apos;m not going into much detail on the cameras, as I&apos;ll still need to get the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and see how it measures up. That said, Google knows how to deliver standout cameras on its devices, and while the foldable isn&apos;t using the latest sensors, it should take great photos and videos.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-oneplus-open-software-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. OnePlus Open: Software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HBYM6PMPzpGEUSZaCA2uRT" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-close-up-on-new-apps.jpg" alt="New apps on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HBYM6PMPzpGEUSZaCA2uRT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has a sizeable lead on the software front, with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold slated to receive seven Android updates. The foldable launched with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and it will pick up the Android 21 update whenever that becomes available at the end of the decade. By contrast, the Open will get just three software updates, and as it debuted with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a>, it won&apos;t go beyond Android 16.</p><p>Okay, so the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will technically be usable until the end of the decade, but what about the software itself? Google is the only Android brand that has a clean software without any bloatware, and that makes a difference. The Material You design has a decent amount of customization, and the bright accent colors are great to use. It may not be to everyone&apos;s tastes, but I prefer it to other Android skins.</p>

<p>I&apos;ll admit that OnePlus did a good job on the software side of things. Although OxygenOS has a cluttered interface, you get a lot of unique software features designed to maximize the real estate of the inner panel, and multitasking is a breeze. You get a few AI features as well, and they aren&apos;t gimmicky.</p><p>But when it comes to AI, no manufacturer comes close to Google. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a slate of new features in this regard, with the likes of Pixel Studio allowing you to create stunning imagery in a matter of seconds. There are lots of other Google-focused utilities that rely on AI, and most of it is handled on-device.</p><p>On the whole, if you want a clean UI with AI features you&apos;ll use daily, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the device to get.</p>

<p>This is an easy one to sum up: if you need a new foldable, you should get the OnePlus Open. It may be a year old, but it&apos;s still one of the best foldables around. It has a gorgeous design, the leather back is great in daily use, and you get a smooth hinge with no visible crease. The cameras are terrific, there are no issues with battery longevity, and it charges at 67W.</p><p>The only point of contention with the Open is that it will get just three Android OS updates, and having launched with Android 13, that means it won&apos;t be updated beyond Android 16. That just isn&apos;t enough in this category, and to put things in context, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will get the Android 21 update when that rolls out at the end of the decade. Obviously, you&apos;re not going to use the device that long, but long-term updates absolutely make a difference in the resale market.</p><p>To its credit, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold gets a lot right; I really like the design, the OLED panels are brighter than its predecessor, and it has decent hardware. The biggest selling point is the software and cameras; Google&apos;s clean interface combined with the latest suite of AI features make the Pixel 9 Pro Fold a true powerhouse, and while it may not have the latest sensors, the foldable should take standout photos and videos.</p><p>There&apos;s the cost to consider as well. You can get the 16GB/512GB version of the OnePlus Open for $1,399 in the U.S. and ₹1,39,999 ($1,667) in India, and the same model of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold costs a ridiculous $1,919. Google doesn&apos;t even sell the 512GB model in India; the 256GB version is available for ₹1,72,999 ($2,061), and you can get the 1TB OnePlus Open and have enough left over to buy a swathe of accessories.</p>

<p>Google has a lot to offer with its latest foldable, and if the inflated pricing doesn't daunt you, then you should just pick it up. The outer and inner OLED panels are much better than last year, the software has the best suite of AI-based features available today, and you get versatile cameras at the back.</p></p>

<p>If you don't want to spend too much money but still want a great foldable, the Open is the way to go. I used the foldable a lot over the course of 2024, and it has been outstanding. The software has a ton of cool features, the battery easily lasts all day, and it takes phenomenal photos. The only limitation is the number of software updates, but if you're willing to look past that, it is still an easy recommendation.</p></p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google’s Satellite SOS feature is launching first on the Pixel 9 series and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, but only in the continental U.S. (not Hawaii or Alaska).</li><li>Garmin Response will handle rescue operations, connecting Pixel 9 users with local and international emergency services.</li><li>Skylo’s global satellite network makes it possible for the Pixel 9 to connect in remote areas, with potential for global expansion.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has teamed up with Garmin and Skylo to let you send an SOS message via satellite if you&apos;re stuck somewhere with no cell service.</p><p>During the Made by Google event earlier this week, Brian Rakowski, vice president for product management, announced that the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> series would be the inaugural <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a> to incorporate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-consumer-charge-potential">Satellite SOS</a>. This means users can connect with emergency services and send their location even when there’s no cell signal (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/garmin-skylo-pixel-9-series-satellite-sos/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p><p>Apple was the first to bring satellite connectivity to smartphones with the Emergency SOS feature on the iPhone 14. It gave users in remote spots a crucial way to get help when cell coverage was spotty.</p><p>Much like Apple&apos;s Emergency SOS, Google&apos;s Satellite SOS provides a similar safety net. If you find yourself without cell service, you can use Satellite SOS to reach emergency services. After filling out a quick form about your situation, you&apos;ll be able to text the first responders. Plus, you can let your emergency contacts know what&apos;s happening.</p><p>Just like Apple’s satellite service, Google’s Satellite SOS doesn’t rely on your cellular carrier.</p><p>Google’s Pixel 9’s satellite SOS feature is a joint project with Garmin and Skylo. Garmin Response, known for its global emergency management expertise, will handle rescue operations for Pixel 9 users in the U.S.</p><p>If a Pixel 9 user hits an emergency and is out of cell service, they can use Satellite SOS to reach Garmin Response&apos;s 24/7 emergency crew. Garmin Response will then loop in local authorities like police, fire departments, search and rescue teams, and even international agencies if needed, to get help on the way.</p><p>This partnership could be a real game-changer. Not only does it bring satellite SOS to Pixel users, but it also hints at Garmin’s emergency response services potentially reaching a larger Android crowd, as per Garmin&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/corporate/garmin-announces-support-of-new-satellite-sos-on-google-pixel-smartphones/" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>Skylo’s a big player in this collaboration too. Its global satellite network lets Pixel 9 users get help even in the most remote places. Thanks to this network, there’s potential for satellite SOS to go global, not just stay in the U.S.</p><p>Skylo teamed up with various satellite operators and worked with Google to build a system where phones can connect straight to satellites. This major tech upgrade makes it possible to communicate in emergencies, even in the most isolated spots, according to Skylo&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.skylo.tech/newsroom/skylo-connectivity-enables-new-satellite-sos-feature-on-google-pixel-9-series" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>While Satellite SOS is a groundbreaking feature, it&apos;s still in its early stages. For now, it’s only on the Pixel 9 series and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. Plus, it’s rolling out first in the U.S. but won’t be available in Hawaii and Alaska, according to Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15254448?visit_id=638591764705047306-3664744699&p=satellitesos&rd=1" target="_blank">support page</a>.</p>
