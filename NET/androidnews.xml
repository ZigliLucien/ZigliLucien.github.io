<ul><li>Google Pixel 8a was spotted in an advertisement ahead of its expected launch.</li><li>The device can be seen in two colorways with a matte finish frame.</li><li>The Pixel 8a is expected to launch at Google I/O 2024 on May 14 with a Tensor G3 chipset.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Pixel 8a is Google&apos;s next highly anticipated product launch, and it&apos;s expected to appear at Google I/O in May. However, a recent Google Fi ad appears to give us an official look at the Pixel 8a in two different colorways.</p><p>As seen on YouTube and reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/is_the_google_pixel_8a_hiding_in_plain_sight-news-62309.php">GSMArena</a>, the ad showed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> in what appears to be Porcelain and Bay color variants, similar options to what we&apos;ve seen on the current Pixel 8 devices.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/thpjxUZol1o" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>While the ad doesn&apos;t specifically say that the showcased phones are the Pixel 8a devices, the curved corners, and thinner camera visor seem to match what we&apos;ve seen in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-leaked-renders">previous renders</a> of the device, which are quite different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>. GSMArena also points to the rear mic placement, which seems to differ from other Pixel models and is not visible on the camera visor, as seen in earlier renders.</p><p>While it&apos;s possible the rear phone could be the Pixel 8 Pro, the Pixel 8a renders seems to show a matte frame, whereas the Pixel 8 Pro comes with a glossy finish. The signs seem to point to this being the Pixel 8a, especially since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-pixel-8-should-you-buy">Pixel 8 is not available in blue</a> (it&apos;s exclusive to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>), although for now, you should take this with a grain of salt until the official launch.</p>
<p>Overall, the upcoming Pixel 8a is expected to be pricier than its predecessor. Underneath, the Tensor G3 chip will likely power it, and some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-rumored-to-have-a-bigger-battery">recent certifications</a> have assured that the Pixel 8a would sport a bigger battery as well.</p><p>The Google I/O is slated for May 14, 2024, when we might get our first official look at the Pixel 8a alongside other devices.</p>

It&apos;s a pretty big deal if you&apos;re in North America, and it should be a spectacular show in much of the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>This one won&apos;t be right over my house like the eclipse from 2017 was, but it will be close enough that I want to make sure I&apos;m prepared to get at least one really good photograph of it. In 2017, phone cameras kind of sucked, and most of my pics from back then are pretty trash. In 2024, I can do better. We all can do better!</p>

<p>The hardest part of getting good eclipse photos is making sure you&apos;re in the right place at the right time. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eclipse-explorer.smce.nasa.gov/">NASA has a great interactive map</a> showing where and when, and if you live in or around places like Dallas, Memphis, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Toronto, or Montreal, you&apos;re in for a treat. If you live on the West Coast or southeast U.S., you probably won&apos;t see anything worth taking a photo of.</p><p>You can&apos;t just run outside, point your phone (or your eyes) at the sun, and start taking pictures. that&apos;s a good way to hurt your eyes and maybe even burn your phone camera&apos;s sensor. Fortunately, the gear you need is cheap. More importantly, the way to do it is super simple.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-and-how-to-do-it-2">What you need and how to do it</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YBcqGQdTsZcAdca4xo6edZ" name="eclipse-glasses-blue-background-169.jpg" alt="Eclipse Glasses on blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YBcqGQdTsZcAdca4xo6edZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Medical King)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The internet is full of great advice about taking pictures of the eclipse. <em>Really</em> full. That&apos;s great and highlights what a cool resource the internet can be, but it can be a little overwhelming.</p><p>If you want to know how it works or techniques for professional photographs, Google everything you can. Some of the articles out there are full of awesome stuff, and I&apos;ve enjoyed reading through them. Even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/photograph-solar-eclipse-google-pixel/">Google is talking about</a> ways to get a great image from your Pixel phone.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s get simple though. You need four things before you can take good photos of an eclipse: </p>
<ul><li><strong>Your phone:</strong> You're going to get better results from a phone geared towards photography like a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> or a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, but the phone you have in your hand will work. I'm not saying you should rush out to buy a new phone, just know budget phones aren't going to take photos like the ones you'll find on Instagram the day after.</li><li><strong>A tripod</strong>. If you want to go that route, you can get a good cheap phone tripod on Amazon in time for the eclipse. I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aureday-Wireless-Extendable-Recording-Streaming/dp/B0C1MC68M7">this one</a>, and I like it. You can also fashion a tripod using a phone mount and something sturdy. Find a way to hold your phone steady while it's pointed at the sky.</li><li><strong>A lens filter</strong>. Some say you can't damage a phone camera by pointing it at the sun. Some people say you will. I can tell you that the phone cameras of 2017 can be damaged by taking pictures of the sun because it happened to me using an HTC U11. I suggest you play it safe and buy a specially designed-filter <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smartphone-Solar-Imaging-Enhancing-Photo/dp/B0CFBX3KNN/ref=sr_1_1">like this one</a>. It also makes getting pictures easier because you can see what you're doing through the screen. <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/watch-the-eclipse-through-your-smartphone-with-these-cheap-solar-glasses"><strong>NEVER LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN WITHOUT EYE PROTECTION</strong></a>.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1324px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="Q24NMymgNm8QGfBcmTuLpU" name="perfect-eclipse.png" alt="Don't look at the sun" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q24NMymgNm8QGfBcmTuLpU.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1324" height="744" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Getty)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, you need to know how to use the manual settings on your phone&apos;s camera. Take the time to learn how to do two things: turn off the flash and adjust the brightness. If you can, turn off things like "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ultra-hdr-explained">Ultra HDR</a>" if your phone has them. Phone camera AI can and will ruin your eclipse shots if you let it.</p><p>With this gear at the ready and knowing how to adjust a few camera settings, taking the picture is easy. Find a good spot to keep your tripod or homemade rig steady and get set up. Remember, it will be dark for a few minutes, so be careful not to trip or knock anything over.</p><p>Now, get ready to take some photos of the eclipse:</p>
<ul><li>Get your phone on the tripod and make sure you have a good view of the sky.</li><li>Attach the phone camera filter according to the directions that came with it. Masking tape might be your best friend here.</li><li>Don't use digital camera zoom. If your phone has a zoom or telephoto lens, use it. Pinching all the way in is a good way to get a grainy photo. Remember, it will be mostly dark, and you won't be using the flash.</li><li>Find the sun before the eclipse starts and focus on it. </li><li>Use the manual settings to lower the brightness until you see a crisp outline of the sun on a very dark background.</li><li>When the eclipse starts, try not to move things too much when you tap to take the photo. If you do, take a second or two and set it up again. You can also use a remote shutter for your phone's camera <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Upgraded-Bluetooth-Shutter-Android-Wireless/dp/B084VTFS4X/ref=sr_1_1">like this one</a> instead of touching the screen to take a picture.</li><li>Take <em>a lot</em> of pictures.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Y9GKfDhUB9jZ8YhHiqbHHB" name="Photoshop.jpg" alt="Adobe Photoshop logo on a PC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y9GKfDhUB9jZ8YhHiqbHHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a couple of things you should do after the eclipse. Sort through all of your pictures on the best screen you can find, keeping every one that looks OK. These are the pictures you want to run through editing software. </p><p>You can find plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-photography-apps-android">photo editing software</a> for your phone, and some of the available apps work really well. Alternatively, you can transfer the pictures to another computer and edit them. Just be prepared to adjust the sharpening and exposure to make your good photos great.</p>
<p>You should back them up, too. If you have your own backup solution with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">NAS in your house</a>, use it. Use online backup, too; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> is great (and comes with a pretty good built-in editor), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-photos-best-photo-storage-service-youre-not-using">Amazon Photos</a> is good, too. Make sure to keep them somewhere besides on your phone.</p><p>Finally, remember to share them. You think pictures of the eclipse are cool, which is why you took them. Plenty of folks feel the same (guilty), and we want to see your pictures!</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio started focusing on the high-end segment two years ago, and that led to a deluge of premium products, including DACs, IEMs that used a combination of three different driver units, and network streamers. While these products were aimed at the high-end segment, they still delivered a great feature-set, and undercut their rivals by a considerable margin.</p><p>Nothing illustrates this as much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k9-pro-ess-review">K9 Pro DAC</a>; Fiio did all the right things with the product, and having used it for over a year and a half, I&apos;m convinced that there isn&apos;t anything better at this price point. The only downside is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Amplifier-Headphone-Bluetooth-Resolution/dp/B09PDM588T">K9 Pro still costs $849</a>, making it inaccessible to a mainstream audience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vAPe5yF5vG3j4vi3kkmbo" name="fiio-k9-2.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vAPe5yF5vG3j4vi3kkmbo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s where the K9 comes into the equation. Fiio rolled out the K9 last year, and at the outset, there really isn&apos;t much of a difference between the standard model and the K9 Pro; both use similar ESS DACs, THX amps, Bluetooth connectivity with the same set of codecs, and an identical design. The difference is that the K9 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-K9-Headphone-Amplifier-Bluetooth/dp/B0C13XK1WC">available for $499</a>, just over half the asking price of the K9 Pro.</p>

<p>Obviously, Fiio designed the K9 to slot into the mid-range segment, filling the void between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k7-review">$200 K7</a> and $849 K9 Pro. But by retaining the same design and a lot of the same features as the costlier K9 Pro, Fiio is running the risk of cannibalizing its high-end product, because after using the K9 for six months, I don&apos;t really see the need for buying the K9 Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EwMJP2JMW7ot4ELoM54Qi5" name="fiio-k9-19.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EwMJP2JMW7ot4ELoM54Qi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting with the design, the K9 uses the same chassis as the K9 Pro, and this is something Fiio is prone to doing. It did the same with the K7, which retained the chassis of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k5-pro-review">K5 Pro</a>, and at the time, the brand noted it was to save manufacturing costs and make it easier to get the product out the door.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RdAnzMLWZFZfhwqkDzzaD4" name="fiio-k9-10.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RdAnzMLWZFZfhwqkDzzaD4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Clearly, the brand is using the same strategy here, and the K9 is nearly identical to the K9 Pro. The only difference is the lack of the Pro branding at the front of the unit, and the volume dial that dominates the front fascia doesn&apos;t have gold accents. That said, the labels underneath all the connectors and button are now in white and have better contrast, and they&apos;re significantly easier to read. This continues to be an issue on the K9 Pro, with the grey labels merging with the black chassis, making it hard to make out any of the markings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HmhQqxwRD5wMp6xV9oCPt4" name="fiio-k9-14.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmhQqxwRD5wMp6xV9oCPt4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The K9 has the same connectors up front, so you get a balanced 4.4mm port, 4-pin XLR that has a dust cover, and a single-ended 6.35mm connector. The status LED highlights the mode in use, and you can use USB, optical, coaxial, line in, and Bluetooth. At the bottom, you get the power button, gain toggle — high, medium, and low — along with an input selector, and output toggle that lets you use the K9 as a dedicated DAC, headphone out, or in a configuration that sees it acting as a preamp.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pUm4NyPBEs8oybnCMiDvP4" name="fiio-k9-11.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pUm4NyPBEs8oybnCMiDvP4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given that the K9 uses the same black chassis as the Pro model, it doesn&apos;t really draw much attention to itself. Both sides of the unit have a vented design to deliver passive airflow, and this is needed because there&apos;s no active cooling. You get the same THX branding at the top, but it isn&apos;t embossed, and the new Fiio logo is etched above.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uTfQ6KfUcDufdbiKqkYA54" name="fiio-k9-9.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uTfQ6KfUcDufdbiKqkYA54.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s at the back where things get interesting, with the K9 offering the same set of connectivity options as the K9 Pro. You get an antenna to deliver a stable Bluetooth signal, and there are USB-B, coaxial, and optical inputs along with a 4.4mm balanced and the traditional RCA. You also get RCA and 3-pin XLR out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rTdX67VUnFVRQi7JBBu3h3" name="fiio-k9-7.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rTdX67VUnFVRQi7JBBu3h3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only thing missing on the K9 is USB-C connectivity, and MQA rendering. While I would have liked to see USB-C, it isn&apos;t a big deal, and honestly, you get a ton of other ports on the DAC. MQA is used mostly by Tidal, and as the standard itself is out of favor, its omission doesn&apos;t actually mean anything.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="w5mmjnZRHbEfydaJg626u3" name="fiio-k9-8.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w5mmjnZRHbEfydaJg626u3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like about the K9 retaining the same design is that it can be mounted in a horizontal or vertical orientation, and you get a stand in the package that lets you mount it vertically. Coming in at 5.7lb (2.6kg), it is just as heavy as the K9 Pro, and it isn&apos;t designed with portability. The package contains a USB cable, 3.5mm to 6.35mm connector, and an additional fuse.</p>

<p>The FiiO Control app continues to be great, and it gives you exhaustive control over just about every area of the K9. You can see the active mode, select Bluetooth audio codecs, adjust the lighting around the volume knob, set EQ, and adjust the channel balance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CypFupoPDJPXpfXVXJPNP5" name="fiio-k9-17.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CypFupoPDJPXpfXVXJPNP5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the audio side of things, the K9 uses two 32-bit ESS Sabre ES9068AS DACs. The 2-channel DAC sits one tier below the ES9038 Pro that&apos;s featured in the K9 Pro, but you don&apos;t really notice much in the way of difference between the two in daily use. You once again get two THX AAA 788+ amps, and the K9 utilizes the same Qualcomm QCC5124 Bluetooth modem as its costlier sibling to deliver Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SLLfw35kPvtLKSNmHbwkt5" name="fiio-k9-21.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SLLfw35kPvtLKSNmHbwkt5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Talking about Bluetooth, you get all the audio codecs you&apos;ll ever need: AptX, AptX LL, AptX HD, AptX Adaptive, and LDAC. The LED light on the volume knob changes based on the codec in use, and it is a good visual indicator.</p><p>When used in USB mode, the K9 is able to go up to 768kHz/32-bit over PCM and DSD512. That goes down to 192kHz/24-bit over coaxial, and 96kHz/24-bit via optical. The K9 is an all-in-one device, and it has plenty of power to drive just about any audio device, including the most demanding planar headsets. Conversely, it is able to power sensitive IEMs without any issues whatsoever — all you&apos;ll need to do is set the gain to low.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qAc26umtnc69d3QoSX5LD5" name="fiio-k9-16.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qAc26umtnc69d3QoSX5LD5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The K9 is able to deliver up to 1W of power at 16Ω, 1.5W at 32Ω, and 200mW at 300Ω over the 6.35mm port. Switching to the balanced 4.4mm and XLR ports, you get 1W of power at 16Ω, 2W at 32Ω, and 780mW at 300Ω. I tested the K9 with plenty of headsets, including the outstanding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">Audeze MM-500</a>, Audeze LCD-GX, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft3-review">Fiio&apos;s FT3</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">FT5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fx15-review">FX15</a>, and Dan Clark Audio&apos;s Aeon X. The DAC did an outstanding job with every device, and as I said at the start, I don&apos;t see the need to justify paying a premium for the K9 Pro any longer.</p>
<p>Fiio DACs usually deliver a clean sound without any coloration, and the K9 is no different. Like all great DACs, it just gets out of the way, and allows audio devices to shine; using the MM-500 with the K9 was just as enjoyable as with the K9 Pro. Yes, the K9 Pro delivers a better low-end when testing with the same headsets, and it has cleaner mid-range and elevated highs. That said, the differences are barely noticeable, and in all honesty, the K9 does just as good a job in daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EwMJP2JMW7ot4ELoM54Qi5" name="fiio-k9-19.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EwMJP2JMW7ot4ELoM54Qi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the K9 stands out is by pitting it against the K7; in this situation, the differences are easily noticeable. The K9 delivers a much better soundstage and dynamics, and you can immediately notice the difference in tonality between the two DACs — the K9 is just able to deliver a vibrant sound that you don&apos;t get with the K7.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the K9 offers the best value in Fiio&apos;s extensive DAC catalog. It has most of the features that made the K9 Pro an outstanding choice, and the best part is that it costs just $499. That&apos;s quite the bargain considering just what you&apos;re getting with this DAC.</p>

<p>Sunbird, the messaging app that infamously partnered with Nothing to bring iMessage to Android <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/sunbird-pulls-app-from-playstore">before being swiftly shut down</a>, is now returning. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sunbird-messaging-announces-beta-app-relaunch-enhancing-connectivity-and-security-302109405.html" target="_blank">announced</a> Friday, April 5, that it would relaunch the beta version of its app after making changes to its backend infrastructure. Sunbird says that over 165,000 users have registered for the app&apos;s waitlist and that invitations will become available in small phases.</p><p>The first time around, Sunbird brought iMessage to Android through its own app and the Nothing Chats app. Nothing, the Android phone manufacturer behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a>, wanted to make all of its devices compatible with iMessage through Nothing Chats. However, users quickly discovered that the messages and internal processes were unencrypted, leaving user messages and shared files available for anyone to access. </p><p>Sunbird explained the technical changes to its iMessage architecture, intended to increase security and fix the original app&apos;s privacy woes, on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sunbirdapp.com/update-security-incident-remediation-and-sunbird-re-launch" target="_blank">website</a>. If you&apos;re curious or skeptical, here they are: </p>
<ul><li>Unencrypted messages are never stored anywhere on disk or in a database. When messages are decrypted to be passed to the iMessage and RCS/Google Messages network, they exist in that state only within memory for a limited period of time. In the front-end app, messages are only stored in an encrypted state within the in-app database.</li><li>Static files transmitted through the service are stored in secure cloud storage buckets that are encrypted in transit and at rest. They are protected through permissioned URLs that prevent unauthorized access and are completely expunged from the Sunbird systems no later than 48 hours after sending or receiving them.</li><li>All communication from the Sunbird app to the Sunbird API is protected at the transport layer, either through HTTPS or the MQTTS protocol.</li><li>The MQTTS broker is secured via strict access control lists to ensure that users are only able to access broker topics specifically assigned to them and no others.</li><li>Further, the contents of the message payload itself is encrypted at the application layer using AES encryption with an encryption key controlled completely by the client and only held in memory on the Sunbird side. Messages flow through the Sunbird system in an encrypted state and are only decrypted (in memory) at the moment of transfer of messages to the native messaging platform.</li></ul>
<p>Sunbird also indirectly mentions Beeper in its press release, which discontinued support for its iMessage client — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/beeper-mini-removed-from-the-play-store">called Beeper Mini</a> — after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/beeper-gives-android-imessage-app-one-more-go">repeated moves by Apple</a> to shut it down. The company claims that Sunbird is a solution to the iMessage compatibility problem that doesn&apos;t take steps to provide unauthorized access to Apple&apos;s iMessage servers. Ironically, Sunbird points out the "security and privacy concerns" related to Beeper Mini due to the app&apos;s "unauthorized access to iMessage."</p>

<p>However, it&apos;s up to end users to decide whether Sunbird is actually worth trusting. For what it&apos;s worth, the company has already been caught in the middle of a discrepancy again. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/05/sunbird-imessage-android-return/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>  noticed that Sunbird claimed that it brought on Jared Jordan, a Google engineering director, as a formal advisor. However, Jordan&apos;s LinkedIn page reveals that he left the company months ago. Sunbird quietly updated its website to change the wording around Jordan&apos;s past experience, with no mention or acknowledgment of the change. </p><p>Sunbird says that the reason the company pulled the app for months was due to its "unwavering commitment to the privacy and security of our users." Instead of shipping a quick fix, Sunbird opted to rebuild its internal architecture entirely.</p><p>Still, it remains to be seen whether users trust Sunbird again. The app still has a long way to go, as it is now starting over from scratch in a very limited beta.</p>

<p>The following method will show you the battery activity on your Android phone and let you know which apps are using too much of it. You can get the info by:</p><p>1. Opening <strong>Settings</strong>, followed by the <strong>Battery</strong> option.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Battery usage</strong>, and you&apos;ll see the apps that have been using the most battery power since the last full charge.</p><p>The option doesn&apos;t tell you directly if the battery health is good or not, but it does give you helpful information on how much power your phone has, and you can see if your phone lasts as long as it did before but with data to back it up. </p>

<h2 id="how-to-look-at-the-battery-health-for-samsung-galaxy-phones-2">How to look at the battery health for Samsung Galaxy phones</h2>
<p>All Samsung Galaxy phones come with an app that allows you to check your phone&apos;s battery health. The Members app will enable you to diagnose and optimize your phone. You can also share reviews and tips with other Galaxy users. To open the app, swipe up from the bottom of your display and type "Members" in the search bar. Once the app is open:</p><p>1. Tap the <strong>Diagnostics option</strong>.</p><p>2. Choose the <strong>Phone diagnostics</strong> choice.</p><p>3. Swipe down and tap the <strong>Battery status</strong> option. On the next page, you should see what condition the battery </p>

<p>If your phone&apos;s battery is good, that&apos;s excellent news. You can use other battery-related options, such as battery optimization, but if you would rather keep apps running, you can always <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-battery-optimization-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">turn them off</a>. If the battery health is weak, you can try taking it for service since Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-ubreakifix-expand-repair-options">partnered with repair shops like uBreakiFix</a> for phone repairs and part replacements. You might want to consider getting yourself a new phone, maybe the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. Any excuse is good when it comes to an upgrade.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-check-battery-health-for-using-a-dial-code-2">How to check battery health for using a dial code</h2>
<p>There is a dial code trick you can try, but it doesn&apos;t work on all Android phones.</p><p>1. Open the dial-pad and enter <strong>*#*#4636#*#*</strong></p><p>2. Without having to do anything else, you should see a menu with options such as Phone information, Usage statistics, and Wi-Fi information.</p><p>3. Look for the <strong>Battery information</strong> option, but if you don&apos;t see it, don&apos;t worry. The following section will show you how to get battery health information regardless of your Android phone.</p><p>Some phones don&apos;t have the battery option. But entering the code does nothing on Samsung models, while other models at least show a menu. Some phones support it, and others don&apos;t. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-battery-health-info-with-third-party-apps-2">How to get battery health info with third-party apps</h2>
<p>You can use free third-party apps to get the battery health information you need. One popular app is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digibites.accubattery">AccuBattery</a>. However, you might not like that it won&apos;t give you a health report right away, since it needs time to gather information. </p><p>If you&apos;re like me and you want the information now, you can try apps such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gombosdev.ampere">Ampere</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gombosdev.ampere">DevCheck Device System Info</a>. These apps will tell you how healthy your phone&apos;s battery is within a few seconds of installing them. When I swiped left, I could choose from different information layouts on my phone.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-know-if-your-android-battery-is-damaged-2">How to know if your Android battery is damaged?</h2>
<p>A phone battery that is not in good condition shows it&apos;s struggling. But how do you know <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-tell-when-phones-battery-has-gone-bad">when your phone&apos;s battery has gone bad</a>? One of the various signs is that your phone won&apos;t charge to 100% and drains very quickly when it reaches a full charge. If the battery looks swollen, that is a clear sign that your phone needs a new battery. Does your Android phone take longer than usual to charge?  </p><p>Battery health is not the same as battery life since battery health is how well the battery performs, like holding a charge. Battery life is how much power you have until you need to charge your phone again. But before assuming it&apos;s the battery, you can try using a new charging cable and block to avoid that possibility.</p>
<h2 id="keep-your-android-phone-apos-s-battery-healthy-2">Keep your Android phone&apos;s battery healthy</h2>
<p>Besides knowing how healthy your Android phone&apos;s battery is, it&apos;s also important to understand how to take care of your battery. By knowing what not to do, you can keep your phone in good shape. All Android users should also know various tips for extending the life of their phone&apos;s battery. That way, you don&apos;t have to waste time taking it for service or get a new phone.</p><p>Here are just some tips to keep in mind when it comes to taking care of your phone&apos;s battery:</p>
<ul><li>Charge your phone when it needs a charge and remove it from the charger when it's finished. Don't be afraid to use a wireless charger.</li><li>Use quick charging sparingly if you're concerned about its effect on battery lifespan. There is little immediate damage or danger from using the right charging method for your phone.</li><li>Try to manually shut your phone off if the charge ever drops below 10% and leave it off while charging it for a few minutes.</li><li>Never store a phone with a dead battery and check on a stored phone periodically.</li><li>Don't buy cheap chargers or cables from the gas station or that dude at the flea market. Use the type of charger the people who made your phone recommend.</li></ul>
<p>Whether you have a new Samsung phone or an older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-lg-phones">LG phone</a>, the tips for keeping your phone healthy apply. But now, with the free battery apps on Google Play, you can monitor your battery health.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung's upcoming affordable smartwatch is tentatively named Galaxy Watch FE.</li><li>It is most likely a revamped version of the Galaxy Watch 4, indicates a new leak based on model numbers.</li><li>The Galaxy Watch FE is expected to release alongside the Galaxy Watch 7 later this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It is rumored that Samsung will bring a Fan Edition Galaxy Watch for the first time this year. While there have been minimal details about that till now, new information heavily suggests it is indeed happening.</p><p>We first heard about the Fan Edition Galaxy Watch, tentatively named Galaxy Watch FE, earlier this year, implying that it would come on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/04/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-is-coming.html">Android Headlines</a> corroborates the same with new information. It is seemingly a new version of Galaxy Watch 4, which will be renamed the Galaxy Watch FE.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:841px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:19.62%;"><img id="jDzQNuBXHhsK2jGwBhfqDh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-FE-leak.jpg" alt="Galaxy Watch FE leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jDzQNuBXHhsK2jGwBhfqDh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="841" height="165" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Headlines further notes that the Galaxy Watch FE will be seen in the global, U.S., and Korean markets with corresponding model numbers bearing <strong>SM-R866F</strong>, <strong>SM-R866U</strong>, and <strong>SM-R866N</strong>, respectively. For the unaware, the Galaxy Watch 4 also featured the <strong>SM-R860F</strong> model number — the similarities between these numbers further establish that the Galaxy Watch FE is most likely a revamped version of the Galaxy Watch 4.</p><p>If the previous Fan Edition products from Samsung are any indication, with the upcoming Galaxy Watch FE, we can expect some of the goodies from the then flagship smartwatch model.</p><p>Meanwhile, we have also recently seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-announced">Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024)</a> refresh after two years of launch, dubbed Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2022). While most of the parameters between both tablets remained the same, the 2024 model came with a new chipset underneath.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jpPfxLZvPDpSYEzgFz5bjc" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-hands-on-8.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic Hands On" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jpPfxLZvPDpSYEzgFz5bjc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Likewise, alongside bringing some highlights from the Galaxy Watch 4, the upcoming Galaxy Watch FE is expected to have a new, rumored Exynos chipset for better performance.</p><p>The fact that it&apos;s an FE model also means it will be an affordable offering, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-could-launch-in-2024">previous rumor</a> indicates that the Galaxy Watch FE will cater to the mid-range, competing against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">best affordable smartwatches</a>, something that Wear OS hasn&apos;t really tapped into when it comes to new model releases. As for the Galaxy Watch FE release, it is expected to launch alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> series (which may include Pro and Classic models) later in the year, presumably next to the Galaxy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google Wallet is now rolling out its support for Apple Wallet passes to more users following its limited availability in March.</li><li>Its functionality is not working properly as users face errors when downloading a pass saved in Apple's ".pkpass" format.</li><li>Support for Apple's standard pass format joins Google's work to bring more boarding passes to its Wallet app.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems that Google Wallet is activating support for Apple Wallet passes for more users, but a problem has been spotted early on.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/04/google-wallet-apple-wallet-pass-files-how/">9to5Google</a>, the ability of Google Wallet users to access important ".pkpass" files has become widely available to more users. This file format is Apple&apos;s format used for digital passes.</p><p>Unfortunately, the publication has spotted a frustrating problem with Wallet&apos;s support for Apple&apos;s format: not every <em>app </em>supports it on Android.</p><p>It was discovered that the "Add to Apple Wallet" option consistently failed to appear in a few Android apps. Services weren&apos;t giving users the appropriate Apple file format for them to throw into Google Wallet for safekeeping. Another attempt delivered an error when adding some minor league baseball tickets to Wallet.</p><p>The error prompted users to try opening the link in Safari (the default browser on iOS), but Android users cannot do that.</p><p>The report adds that users can use an iPhone to transfer a pass to their Android device if problems become too troublesome. The publication states users can "share a pass via messaging and other apps" from an iPhone to an Android device, which will deliver the necessary ".pkpass" for them to import into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a>.</p><p>More users should begin noticing support for Apple&apos;s digital pass format available on Android today (Apr. 5) and beyond. More importantly, apps should also start conforming to this newfound support, but it will likely take time to iron out the errors.</p>

<p>Android users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-support-apple-wallet-file-format">started noticing support</a> for Apple&apos;s pass format in March, though it was constricted to a smaller number. Such support has been coming for a long time, as Google stated it was working on implementing functionality back in 2022. However, evidence of the feature in development was only spotted in 2023.</p><p>The latest support for Wallet is one of many, as Google recently brought in additional support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-gains-movie-boarding-pass-support-from-gmail">more boarding passes</a> directly from Gmail. Users receiving confirmation emails for movies and flights can now easily pop those passes into Google Wallet. The update also included archiving older passes, keeping what&apos;s important clean and concise.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing confirms on X that it plans to unveil the "Ear" and "Ear a" buds on April 18.</li><li>The company states that the name change will help it better focus on the "product" and "unique experience" it provides for consumers.</li><li>Little information about the devices has leaked, but the existence of an "a" tag for one suggests it could fall on the budget side like the Phone 2a.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing has been confirmed, but consumers will be treated to two earbud launches from the London-based company later this month.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1776236686340464931?s=20">posted on X</a> today (Apr. 5), stating folks should get ready to see the Nothing "Ear" and "Ear a" on April 18. Essentially, the newly announced "Ear" is the successor to the Ear 2 launched in March 2023. The post adds that the upcoming devices are the "ultimate iteration of Nothing audio" and "reflect the culmination of three years of design and innovation."</p><p>This also (obviously) comes with a curious name change that makes it seem like we&apos;re restarting the series. Nothing states the purpose of its naming strategy reset, which includes removing the series number, is to better focus on "the product and the unique experience."</p><p>The company reiterated that it will continue to create premium devices for consumers that prioritize user preference over price.</p>

<p>Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-3-frog-beetle-teaser">started teasing</a> its new earbud device late in March, and the provided teasers made it seem like we were continuing to the Ear 3. The post featured a little tree frog leaping over a black beetle. The latter was used to promote the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear 2</a> before it launched in 2023.</p><p>The most interesting development is that we&apos;re set to receive an "Ear a" to accompany the, assumedly, "flagship-level" buds. With the "a" moniker, the second pair of buds seems to follow <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a>: a budget phone that came with a premium-level design and some slight software/hardware changes to keep the price down.</p><p>We don&apos;t exactly have much to bite into as Nothing has spilled much information regarding either of the devices. We can refer to Ear 2 as a device that features refined sound and improved ANC capabilities. The device also gained a smaller charging case to make it easier to carry around. Internally, it picked up an 11.6mm custom driver for rich sound.</p><p>It remains to be seen where Nothing will go after its 2023 release. Fortunately, we only have a couple of weeks to wait.</p>

<ul><li>The latest Android 14 beta contains information regarding Google's development of a desktop mode overhaul for Android 15.</li><li>The overhaul would fully revamp its freeform mode, giving users more agency over how to manage multiple windows.</li><li>Other Android 15 news involves additional features for its "Private Spaces" and a potential new status bar later this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>More of what Android 15 could have in store surfaces as a discovery shows Google is preparing some long-awaited improvements to desktop mode.</p><p>As detailed by Mishaal Rahman with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-desktop-mode-demo-3430991/">Android Authority</a>, Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1 shows that Google plans to implement a new multi-window experience. From the demonstration video, apps in full-screen now feature a navigation bar-style tab at the top. Tapping it produces a drop menu featuring the app&apos;s name and a few options: full-screen, split-screen, and freeform mode.</p><p>Split-screen functions like any other Android device. It places the app on half the display, giving users a chance to open another. Freeform mode lets users decide the window&apos;s size by dragging its rounded corners.</p><p>Moreover, testing showed that the apps gain a thick title bar featuring the app&apos;s name, a maximize button, and a close button. Tapping its name will produce the previously mentioned menu full of window options.</p><p>Rahman adds that users can drag a window in freeform mode to either side of the display to "snap it" into split-screen mode.</p><p>This desktop mode revamp is likely for Android 15; however, it&apos;s not clear exactly when it will roll out. The changes seem to make Android&apos;s OS seem a little more refined, but as Rahman noted, it still doesn&apos;t support keyboard shortcuts for window management or offer a polished launcher.</p>

<p>It seems that Google has been mulling over improving its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/with-pixel-8-google-may-finally-have-an-answer-to-samsung-dex">Android desktop mode</a> for a while, even during the early days of the Pixel 8. It was then discovered that the Pixel 8 series launched with full <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-8-series-apparently-supports-display-output">display output support</a>. Despite Google disabling its functionality on the software side, its hardware hid nothing, as users could attach a USB-C to HDMI cable to get things started.</p><p>The discovery was on functionality alone, as the Pixel 8 didn&apos;t showcase a <em>proper </em>desktop mode. The device&apos;s display was mirrored vertically onto a desktop monitor, but it was a positive sign of more to come — even more so now with the latest discovery.</p><p>These discoveries stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-21-out-now">Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1</a>, which started rolling out on Monday (Apr. 1). The beta contains a host of bug fixes for some severe problems, and it features information about Google&apos;s continued development of Android 15&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-spaces-revamp-features-added">Private Spaces</a>." This feature would be a profile where users could download or lock previously installed apps behind.</p><p>Similar to Samsung&apos;s Secure Folder, users could safeguard sensitive data by locking certain apps behind a PIN or other password method.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google is seemingly working on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-major-design-changes-status-bar-icons">status bar revamp</a> for Android 15. Haptic feedback could arrive for Quick Settings alongside a new battery icon.</p>
