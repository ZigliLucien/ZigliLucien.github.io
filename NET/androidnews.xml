<ul><li>Google will open a Google Store location in Austin, Texas.</li><li>The Google Domain Northside retail store will become Google’s seventh U.S. location.</li><li>It’ll be the company’s first retail expansion into Texas, which will mark the fifth U.S. state with a Google Store.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been slowly but steadily increasing its retail footprint across the U.S. since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-nyc-store-first-look">Google Chelsea opened up in 2021</a>. It announced two more Google Store locations in 2024, including Google Santa Monica, which hasn’t opened to the public yet. Now, the company has added a seventh location to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/magazine/locations?hl=en-US&pli=1" target="_blank">its Google Store page</a> — and it’s coming to Austin, Texas.</p><p>Not much information about the Texas retail store is known, as there aren’t even renders available at this point. However, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/24/google-store-austin-texas/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first spotted, it is set to arrive in Domain Northside in Austin, which is a mixed-use development with shops, restaurants, office space, and more. The store’s address will be 11701 Domain Blvd, Austin, and all we know for sure is that it’s “coming soon.”</p><p>We’re still waiting on Google’s Santa Monica location to open, which was announced last year as Google’s second California location and sixth U.S. store. It joins the Mountain View, California store near Google’s own headquarters. Google opened stores in Massachusetts and Illinois in 2024, and looks poised to open at least two retail stores in 2025 as well.</p>

<p>Google Store retail locations are crucial to the company expanding its market share in the U.S., specifically through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel device lineup</a>. Its biggest competitors, Apple and Google, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-expanding-its-brick-and-mortar-repair-network-across-the-us">already have a significant amount of U.S. locations</a> where customers can learn about their products, buy them, and get repair and service help.</p><p>Put simply, Google is behind in this area and its current pace of adding at least two stores per year — especially ones outside of New York and California — is a big step in the right direction. The Austin location, when open, will make Texas the fifth state to have a Google Store.</p>

<ul><li>The Epic Games Store on mobile is inheriting a few fan-favorite features from the desktop version.</li><li>Epic’s free games program is coming to Android and iOS, starting with monthly drops.</li><li>Epic is still unsatisfied with Apple and Google’s sideloading policies, which it claims deters people from downloading the Epic Games Store.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Epic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/epic-games-store-arriving-on-android-later-this-year">brought its popular Epic Games Store to Android</a> and iOS (in the European Union), and now the mobile version is gaining a few fan-favorite features from its desktop counterpart. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-on-mobile-adds-third-party-support">announced</a>the changes in an update today, Jan. 24, which include bringing the free games program to mobile. Initially, Epic Games Store users will get one free game per month, until the store starts offering weekly free games later this year.</p><p>Users can claim the first game, Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee, today through Feb. 20. Another game on the way is Bloons TD 6, according to Epic. These third-party titles join Epic’s own offerings, like Fortnite and Rocket League, which are already available on the mobile Epic Games Store. As Epic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-games-store-telefonica-device-preload-partnered">tries to build up its storefront</a> as a gaming-focused app marketplace competing with Apple and Google, it’s adding 17 third-party titles on Android and 15 on iOS.</p><p>The disparity is due to the restrictions put in place by Apple and Google, namely “scare screens’ and Apple’s core technology fee, Epic claims. That’s also why there are fewer than 20 third-party titles available through the Epic Games Store on mobile thus far.</p><p>“So far none of the 100 highest grossing mobile game developers are willing to distribute their games on the Epic Games Store because of the Core Technology Fee and Apple and Google’s onerous restrictions and scare screens,” the company claims in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/app-store-economy-is-far-from-open-despite-efforts-by-epic-developers-and-regulators-in-the-eu?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BHWcDd4CPeDvT8zXqBVucW" name="Epic-Games-App-Store-Friction" alt="Epic thinks Google and Apple are creating too much friction when downloading the Epic Games Store on mobile." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHWcDd4CPeDvT8zXqBVucW.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Epic thinks Google and Apple are creating too much friction when downloading the Epic Games Store on mobile. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Epic)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Epic also argues that more than half of the time a user tries to install the Epic Games Store on Android or iOS, they are deterred due to system prompts — which Epic describes as “scare screens.” The company says it takes 12 steps for a user to install the Epic Games Store on an Android phone. There have been 29 million installations of the Epic Games Store on mobile, short of Epic’s goal of 100 million by the end of 2024, according to the company. It alleges <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-it-harder-to-sideload-apps-on-android">Apple and Google’s added friction</a> is a key reason why.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google for comment on Epic’s claims about friction and “scare screens” in the installation process for the Epic Games Store. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>The situation isn’t all grim for the Epic Games Store. In addition to new mobile titles, Epic added persistent account login across games and auto-functionality on mobile. You can try out all these new features and games starting today.</p>

<ul><li>The Samsung Galaxy S25 series has the hardware to support satellite connectivity using Snapdragon Satellite.</li><li>However, Samsung didn’t make a deal with a satellite provider directly, so it’s up to your carrier.</li><li>Only Verizon customers can use a Galaxy S25 smartphone to ask for help in an emergency over satellite, at least for now.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">powered by Qualcomm chips everywhere</a>, and that comes with an impressive feature: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-satellite-android-partners">Snapdragon Satellite</a>. Essentially, the Galaxy S25 series can connect to overhead satellites to transmit emergency SOS messages in an emergency — but there’s a big catch. Due to the intricacies of non-terrestrial network (NTN) satellites, only Verizon customers will be able to take advantage of the satellite connectivity feature. That’s why Samsung isn’t even advertising it.</p><p>The satellite connectivity situation of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 lineup</a> was first uncovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/samsungs-failed-direct-to-device-strategy-s25-series-christian-5du8f/" target="_blank"><u>Christian Frhr. von der Ropp</u></a>, who is an independent satellite expert and consultant (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-verizon-satellite-sos-messaging-3519898/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). Samsung chose to leave it up to the cellular carriers to make direct-to-device (D2D) satellite agreements with NTN service providers, rather than make an all-encompassing agreement itself.</p><p>This is a starkly different approach to providing D2D services than Samsung’s competitors, Apple and Google, have taken. Apple made waves when it partnered directly with Globalstar to provide Emergency SOS via Satellite for free to users of newer iPhone models. Google directly reached an agreement with Skylo, a 5G NTN, D2D service provider, for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> — meaning that users can utilize satellite services without involving their mobile network operators (MNOs).</p><p>As Frhr. von der Ropp reports, Samsung took a different strategy by stepping aside and letting MNOs — also known as cellular carriers — handle the agreements with satellite operators. The problem is that, per the report, Skylo is effectively the only 5G NTN, D2D service providers capable of supporting Snapdragon Satellite in the Galaxy S25 series. In other words, Skylo would have a lot of leverage in negotiations with cellular carriers who want to provide services to their customers.</p>

<p>That’s how we got to the point where Verizon is the only carrier to have reached a deal with Skylo for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>. It’s also an explanation for why the Galaxy S25 lineup supports D2D satellite connectivity, a hit feature, and Samsung isn’t touting it.</p><p>It’s possible that more carriers make deals in the future to enable satellite connectivity for their customers on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, or explore other options. T-Mobile, specifically, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-starlink-enable-satellite-texting-early-for-people-impacted-by-los-angeles-fires">partnered with SpaceX’s Starlink to deliver satellite service on Android phones</a>.</p><p>For now, only Verizon users can take advantage of the Samsung Galaxy S25’s satellite connectivity feature.</p>

<ul><li>Google detailed an incoming update for the Pixel Watch Emergency SOS feature that adds a required confirmation by the user.</li><li>Instead of dialing automatically, the new default will require users to press and hold the display to confirm that they need help.</li><li>Google deployed a similar method to Android device's through the Personal Safety app.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an Emergency SOS change to the Pixel Watch that might improve the experience for the user <em>and </em>the authorities.</p><p>The company detailed today (Jan 24) in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/320517148/emergency-sos-with-touch-and-hold-confirmation-on-pixel-watch">community post</a> that it's beginning to roll out an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-emergency-sos-pixel-watch">Emergency SOS</a> confirmation step to the Pixel Watch's safety feature. Google states the patch will make it "less likely to accidentally trigger" a call to emergency services on your wearable. Instead, the update will introduce a method that is still "fast and easy" for users to initiate a call to such personnel.</p><p>It's worth noting that change still requires your device to have location services enabled and a strong 4G LTE connection.</p><p>More importantly, Google says the Emergency SOS confirmation involves pressing the crown "five times" and holding down on the screen for "three seconds to start the call." If a user misses this confirmation chance, the company says your Pixel Watch will close the emergency screen (after 20 seconds) to avoid a mishap.</p><p>While this is set to become the new default SOS method, users still have the choice to allow their Pixel Watch to place an emergency call on its own.</p><p>Once this update arrives "over the next few weeks," users can navigate to their Pixel Watch <strong>Settings > Safety and Emergency > Emergency SOS > Ways to start SOS > Automatically</strong>.</p>

<p>This update to the Pixel Watch's Emergency SOS reminds us <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-accidental-911-calls-fixed">of a similar update</a> Google dropped for Android devices. The Personal Safety app picked up an update that requires a "touch and hold" confirmation step <em>before </em>a user's phone can dial 911 services for assistance. The company reportedly implemented the step due to an influx of accidental calls.</p><p>Of course, the addition was seen as a proper mitigation method for Android but, like those phones, it could make it a little harder to get help when you need it, even on the Pixel Watch.</p><p>Google has been refining the Emergency SOS/safety features of its Pixel Watch, like its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection-explained">new life-saving feature</a> from last summer. The Pixel Watch 3 gained the "Loss of Pulse" detection feature, which leans on its heart rate and AI software to detect if a user's heart has stopped. The watch is said to dial emergency services on its own with an audible message explaining to 911 what's gone wrong.</p>

This Wednesday, while I photographed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> and other show-floor demos in San Jose, my mind was fixated on the 10% — specifically, the easily missed segment where they talked about Samsung Health.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a> sounds powerful but very familiar. I just got a Pixel 9, and since Samsung will rely heavily on Gemini for its new phone, its innovations didn't feel fresh enough. And I know at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-just-not-excited-about-the-galaxy-s25-ultra">one of my colleagues agrees</a> about this!</p><p>More importantly, I'm a smartwatch guy, not a phone guy, and I have to wait another six months for the <em>next</em> Unpacked to see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>. I had futile hopes for a glimpse of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2">Galaxy Ring 2</a> or more info on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>, and Samsung dashed them.</p><p>Thankfully, Dr. Praveen Raja, Samsung's VP Head of Digital Health, sated my wearables hunger when he came on stage to reveal the "new features" coming to Samsung Health in 2025.</p><p>Despite the lack of specifics, these features have me intrigued that the Watch 8 and Ring 2 will launch with much more exciting software than the last generation.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-has-a-unique-spin-on-training-load-2">Samsung has a unique spin on training load</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.97%;"><img id="RRQnekYhcCfDoP7UzSmjtC" name="Galaxy-Unpacked-Vascular-Load-example" alt="The Vascular load (Labs) submenu in Samsung Health that shows your heart's activity level from day to day, as well as a summary of the data: "Steady: Your vascular load is consistent.

<p>The first new Samsung Health feature unveiled on stage was "Vascular Load Indicator," a Labs (aka experimental) tool that monitors how your "daily activities impact your cardiovascular system," to help you "reduce strain on your heart and maintain long-term heart health."</p><p>"Load" is a familiar smartwatch term. Garmin watches and other fitness brands show your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> score after every workout, Google has its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Fitbit Cardio Load</a> to quantify both workouts and non-workouts for their level of exertion, and Apple Watches show a weekly training load graph relative to your past workout efforts.</p><p>I expected Samsung to do its own fitness-focused training load spinoff this year. Instead, vascular load seems to be a health-focused spin on the concept. Even if <em>I'm</em> more interested in fitness, I think that Samsung made a smart move to differentiate itself from its rivals and play to its health-tracking strengths.</p><p>Samsung hasn't yet explained how it'll track vascular health, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> already tracks resting heart rate, sleep quality, abnormally high/low heart rates, irregular heart rhythm, and daily stress.</p><p>If it takes all this data and adds workout data — judging if you're overtaxing your heart or being too sedentary and leaving it too idle — that could make for a useful, holistic heart health metric.</p>
<h2 id="an-unclear-samsung-health-coach-2">An unclear Samsung Health 'coach' </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="eUYfpowhDhkAKQLNxxiXJA" name="samsung-unpacked-samsung-health" alt="Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eUYfpowhDhkAKQLNxxiXJA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I perked up when Raja claimed that "Samsung Health will become your own personal health coach" before I realized that its definition of "coaching" was, again, less about fitness and more about data-driven health guidance.</p><p>Still, I can't help but be intrigued.</p><p>Samsung Health will let you choose a focus — sleep, weight loss, exercise, or overall health — and customize your home screen to match your goals, highlighting wellness tips like how your resting heart rate or activity levels compare to past days or weeks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.97%;"><img id="v4RtBTsvZCMjcASw7BTx9b" name="Samsung-Health-Coach-screen" alt="A Galaxy Unpacked slide showing a phone screen with the words "What do you want to focus on, Sam? Based on what you choose, we'll customize your Samsung Health Home screen to help you reach your goals," with "Overall Health," "Sleep," "Exercise," or "Healthy Weight" as the four options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v4RtBTsvZCMjcASw7BTx9b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1949" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A Samsung Health screenshot from Galaxy Unpacked 2025 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, other fitness apps like Fitbit let you customize your widgets to highlight relevant data, and Samsung first announced wellness tips last year. So, this isn't what I'd call groundbreaking until I see more.</p><p>What's more compelling is Raja's mention of "AI tools" that'll let Samsung Health users "ask questions, get real-time insights, and receive personalized coaching as if you would from your own personal health assistant."</p><p>It sounds like Samsung intends to provide a health-themed LLM backed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> that incorporates your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> data or your doctor's recommendations to make things "personalized."</p><p>We've seen other fitness-themed chatbots like Amazfit's Zepp Coach AI, but they're usually generalized with no way to add context to your smartwatch data. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> does a pretty good job at this.</p><p>If Samsung actually pulls off a Health Coach AI, it <em>could</em> change the game for health apps in general with its specificity. It'll also mean Samsung will have to shoulder the responsibility of guiding people's health decisions, and not letting AI hallucinations or incorrect health sensors lead to poor advice.</p>
<h2 id="all-in-on-ai-health-2">All-in on AI health</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.97%;"><img id="xZAZYrvyGmsKYctbtEQgQR" name="Samsung-Health-antioxidant-index" alt="A photo of a Samsung phone showing the Samsung Health app showing the antioxidant index, next to a plate of healthy-looking food." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xZAZYrvyGmsKYctbtEQgQR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1949" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A screenshot of Galaxy Unpacked 2025 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung also announced that it would use your nutrition log to track your beta-carotene levels and show an "antioxidant index" graph. This data will help Samsung provide "personalized nutrition advice" plus deliver "tailored meal plans and recipes."</p><p>Beyond nutritional health, Samsung Health will "monitor your mood" with a simple mood check-in, guiding you to meditation or breathing exercises if your mood suggests you'll benefit from this.</p><p>In both cases, Samsung is trying to make Health an all-in-one destination and beat out specialized meditation and nutrition apps like Calm or MyFitnessPal. That's much less interesting to me, but if an AI-personalized "tailored meal plan" could account for needing more of a specific vitamin or being allergic to something, that could certainly appeal to a wide range of people.</p><p>Samsung even mentioned during the subsequent smart home section that you could tell the Bixby AI to "Turn off the TV when I fall asleep" and have it do so using your Galaxy Watch biometrics. Of course, you'll probably need a Samsung phone, watch, <em>and</em> TV to pull this feature off, so it's only for superfans.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cuY6haPJuzfi4AAY4D9DGK" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-unpacked-2025" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Ring at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cuY6haPJuzfi4AAY4D9DGK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm not sure whether or not I can truly trust "AI" to guide my health or diet decisions. But if I'm going to trust any company on this front, it's Samsung. Its experience in the health sphere is pretty darn extensive. By the time Wear OS 6 and One UI 7 Watch arrive this summer, we'll all have the chance to test these tools for ourselves.</p><p>I will <em>continue</em> to demand more from Samsung on the fitness front since its vascular load data doesn't seem especially useful for athletes to judge if they're improving. Whether it be daily recommended workouts or a fitness AI coach to go with the health coach, Samsung has room to grow to keep up with fitness brands.</p><p>But despite Samsung only giving us scraps and vague promises, I'm still happy with how Galaxy Unpacked 2025 promised to make AI <em>useful</em> in real-life health scenarios, not merely helping you pretend you're a good photographer or generate silly AI art.</p>

<hr>
<p>Following Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge teaser that left us stunned, a recent discovery might clue us into what it's all about.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/yabhishekhd/status/1882650534630584561">3C Certification database</a> listing was discovered by X tipster Abhishek Yadav, which details some crucial information regarding the phone's (potential) battery life (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-battery-specs-leak/">Android Police</a>). According to the database, the assumed Galaxy S25 Edge features model number SM-9370. Aside from that, the listing clues us into its battery capacity, which is a lackluster 3,900mAh rating.</p><p>The tipster dug further and found that the S25 Edge could feature a measly 25W charging strength, too.</p>

<p>Here's where things get interesting; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-google-pixel-8a">Galaxy S24 FE</a> was a 6.7-inch phone with a 4,700mAh battery <em>and </em>25W charging. This is kind of like a close model to compare as even the newer Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus feature 45W charging. What the database listing paints is a device with a sheer ~800mAh battery capacity drop compared to the latest FE model, which is already a slightly stripped-back variant of the 2024 flagship.</p><p>Recent rumors suggest the device — now believed to be the S25 Edge — could see the following measurements: 159x76x6.4mm.</p><p>Compared to the S24 FE, it's a bit slimmer by roughly 1.6mm. The phone should also be slimmer than the recently revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a> line up, too.</p><p>There was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-geekbench-test">a recent specification leak </a>that told us a little more of what we might see. The S25 Edge could sport the Snapdragon 8 Elite alongside 12GB of RAM. The device could also feature Samsung's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-telephoto-camera-module-alop-detailed">ALoP camera technology</a> to help keep its telephoto sensor thin, which fits with what the company is after.</p><p>So, while the idea of an even thinner phone is cool, we might see some sacrifices — kind of like the lackluster battery size and charging speed.</p><p>Samsung dropped a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">major Galaxy S25 Edge teaser</a> during Unpacked, which could end up being the long-rumored S25 "Slim." Aside from some brief demo models shown off — that show a dual, protruding camera array — we don't have much else to go. The Korean OEM didn't get personal about its specifications, meaning we're still going to have to wait. Originally, the Slim was rumored to debut sometime in Q2 2025 and that could still ring true.</p>

<ul><li>The Oppo Find N5 is confirmed to have impressive water-resistance capabilities, as it is both IPX8 and IPX9 certified.</li><li>It’s possible that the Oppo Find N5 is rebadged as the OnePlus Open 2 in the U.S.</li><li>Unfortunately, there may be no dust-resistance certifications for the Find N5.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The upcoming Oppo Find N5 foldable is already shaping up to be a hit, according to rumors, leaks, and early teasers. We recently learned that the Oppo Find N5, and likely the OnePlus Open 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-open-2-could-be-half-the-thickness-of-an-iphone">could be half the thickness of an iPhone when unfolded</a>. Now, an Oppo product manager has shared similarly-exciting news about the Find N5 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/PapUZDB5O?pagetype=profilefeed" target="_blank">Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-Open-2-Oppo-demonstrates-industry-leading-water-resistance-of-upcoming-foldable-phone.949771.0.html" target="_blank">NotebookCheck</a>).</p><p>The company’s Find-series product manager, Zhou Yibao, shared that the Oppo Find N5 is set to have unprecedented water-resistance capabilities for a foldable.</p><p>“This time, the waterproof performance of OPPO Find N5 has been fully upgraded,” Yibao said in the post, translated to English. ”It should be the only folding flagship on the market that supports IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9 full-level waterproof performance.”</p><p>This would match the capabilities of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Oppo Find X8 series</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, both of which are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP68 and IP69 certified</a>. While the IP68 rating was once the gold standard for water-resistance, the IP69 rating takes that to the extreme. It specifically certifies protection against high-pressure, high-temperature water jets — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-phone-makers-want-your-smartphone-to-survive-a-kitchen-nightmare">like the conditions of a dishwasher</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:690px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:90.58%;"><img id="53mPpydZB9mXnjwHzjdUXb" name="Oppo Find N5" alt="Oppo Find N5 side by side with an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/53mPpydZB9mXnjwHzjdUXb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="690" height="625" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Oppo Find N5’s thinness compared to the iPhone 16 Pro Max. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Zhou Yibao / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a reminder, the first number in an IP rating represents its dust-resistance capabilities. Unlike the OnePlus 13 and Oppo Find X8, the Find N5 and OnePlus Open 2 are only confirmed to have an IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9 rating. That means there could be no official dust-resistance certification for Oppo’s upcoming foldables.</p><p>That could be disappointing to some, as dust can be more dangerous for foldables than liquids. The hinge contains moving parts, and dust or debris getting inside the hinge or under the foldable display can be fatal. For reference, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> has an IP48 rating that gives it some level of protection against dust ingress.</p><p>Still, it’s nice to see Oppo making waves with its next foldable. If the Oppo Find N5 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> are impossibly thin and water-resistant, they could be incredibly successful in their respective markets.</p>

<p>Wear OS 6 should arrive first on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>, though Samsung's watch will use One UI 7 Watch and have unique features. We'll focus first on Google's mainline version of Wear OS 6.</p><p>An APK deep dive found evidence that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-may-soon-get-gemini">Google will replace Assistant with Gemini on Wear OS watches</a> soon. We don't know if Gemini will arrive with Wear OS 6 or with the upcoming March 2025 update to Wear OS 5; Google hasn't updated the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-rollout-resumes-for-all-pixel-watch-models-but-theres-a-caveat">November</a>, so it's possible they're pushing out a major AI update <em>before</em> OS 6.</p><p>Whenever it arrives, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">Gemini on Wear OS 6</a> will be a major shift, delivering a more intelligent assistant and more useful health and fitness insights.</p><p>Unlike Android phones with NPUs for on-device AI, smartwatches don't have the capacity for real AI nor the screen space for drawn-out LLM responses. The Pixel Watch 4 could have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new Snapdragon chip with faster performance</a>, but Google has to make Gemini compatible with the older watch models, too.</p><p>That's why Wear OS Gemini tools will require your phone to pass data back and forth over Bluetooth; still, we could get the equivalent of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a> using your watch's mic and speaker, only with a slightly longer delay than on your phone.</p><p>Otherwise, we assume Gemini on Wear OS will support extensions with other Google apps, so you can ask Gemini to read out a Gmail inbox summary or create a workout playlist in YouTube Music on the fly.</p><p>Beyond Gemini, we don't know what Wear OS 6 will support yet. Google typically reveals future Wear OS features in the spring around Google I/O, so we'll be sure to update this post then.</p>

<p>One UI 7 Watch, Samsung's version of Wear OS 6, already has a few confirmed features thanks to Galaxy Unpacked 2025, where Samsung's head of Digital Health, Dr. Praveen Raja, spent a few minutes on stage talking about Samsung Health features coming this year.</p><p>He described Vascular Load Indicator, a Samsung Health Labs feature that will track how your "daily activities impact your cardiovascular system" so you can "reduce strain on your heart and maintain long-term heart health."</p><p>Samsung Health Labs will also add an antioxidant index graph that will inform the Galaxy AI when making "personalized nutrition advice" and "tailored meal plans and recipes." These will presumably be available on your Galaxy Watch 8.</p>

<p>Most intriguing, Raja promised that Samsung Health will have an AI "Coach" that will let you "ask questions, get real-time insights, and receive personalized coaching as if you would from your own personal health assistant."</p><p>This coach may only be available on your phone, but a wrist-based version would certainly be useful for on-the-go insights!</p><p>Aside from these confirmed tools, we can assume that One UI 7 Watch will have other AI or health-focused features, just as One UI 6 Watch added an Energy Score, AI-based Wellness Tips, new gesture controls, and auto-suggested replies in Messages.</p>

<p>Wear OS 6 should arrive first on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> in late summer or early fall this year. After that, there are a dozen other Android smartwatches eligible to receive Wear OS 6.</p><p>Samsung has promised that all Galaxy Watches will get four years of major updates. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a>, which started with Wear OS 3 and received Wear OS 3.5, 4, and 5 in subsequent years, should end its update cycle with Wear OS 6.</p><p>All other Galaxy Watches with Wear OS software should receive the latest update as well. We technically haven't gotten confirmation whether the budget Galaxy Watch FE will get four years, but Wear OS 6 is a given.</p>
<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 / Watch 4 Classic</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 / Watch 5 Pro</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 / Watch 6 Classic</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Watch FE</li></ul>
<p>Google has promised three years of updates for its Pixel Watches, but wasn't entirely clear on whether that meant version updates or security updates. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">first Pixel Watch</a> launched with Wear OS 3.5, so Wear OS 6 will be its final update if Google does support it.</p>
<ul><li>Google Pixel Watch</li><li>Google Pixel Watch 2</li><li>Google Pixel Watch 3</li></ul>
<p>OnePlus confirmed to us last year that its new Wear OS watches would receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-how-many-updates">two version updates</a> and three years of security patches. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">Watch 2R</a> currently remain on Wear OS 4, we suspect they'll receive Wear OS 5 soon after the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-could-be-readying-a-watch-3-and-watch-3-pro-with-new-health-features">OnePlus Watch 3 and Watch 3 Pro</a> launch.</p>
<ul><li>OnePlus Watch 2</li><li>OnePlus Watch 2R</li></ul>
<p>Mobvoi doesn't guarantee updates, and its most recent models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch 5 Enduro</a> and TicWatch Atlas currently remain on Wear OS 4, with that update arriving in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-4-update-ticwatch-pro-5-series">September 2024</a>. It's <em>possible</em> these watches will receive Wear OS 6 eventually, but Wear OS 5 is the first priority; plus, TicWatches no longer support Google Assistant, so Gemini would be wasted on them.</p><p>The only other Wear OS brand worth mentioning is Xiaomi, which (like Mobvoi) is about a year behind Google and Samsung's updates. It's possible the Xiaomi Watch 2 and Watch 2 Pro will receive Wear OS 6, but not until 2026 at this current pace.</p>

<p>Aside from our predicted features above like on-wrist Gemini Live and Samsung training load, we have several features that we'd like to see on Wear OS 6 and/or One UI 7 Watch.</p><p>As I wrote in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-we-expect-from-android-and-wear-os-smartwatches-in-2025">Wear OS 2025 predictions column</a>, I want to see <strong>further battery life improvements</strong> with Wear OS 6. Google did a great job extending its current watches with XML watch faces and pushing more processes to the co-processor that uses less battery; I'd like to see them focus even more on efficiency and low-power idling with this next software update to make Android watches more long-lived.</p><p>Wear OS 6 should also <strong>make watch faces more exciting</strong> again. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">banned third-party watch faces</a> on Wear OS 5, which helped with battery life but made your visual options much more restricted and harder to find in the Play Store. I'd like to see Wear OS 6 bring back Facer as an official watch face store for XML faces, as well as a way to generate AI watch faces using Gemini.</p><p>Wear OS 5 made some major fitness updates with cardio load, running form analysis, and the ability to follow a target range like pace or heart rate for a workout. Wear OS 6 should continue this fitness focus: It could add <strong>downloadable and shareable courses in Google Maps</strong>, better <strong>syncing with accessories</strong> like HRMs or cycling power meters, and better non-running sports guidance like counting gym reps.</p><p>On the Gemini front, some kind of <strong>Gemini Coach</strong> LLM that gives you personalized health advice based on your nightly stats or judges your training load and walks you through future workouts would be a nice perk.</p><p>Lastly, I'm hoping Wear OS 6 brings us back to a <strong>regular update cadence</strong>. After the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-wear-os-5-problems-force-pause">messy Pixel Watch update rollback</a> and then a months-long wait for new features, it's clear that Google's ambitions for Wear OS sometimes exceed what it can squeeze onto watches at normal intervals. It'd be nice if Wear OS returned to monthly updates to match Pixel drops, and if Google implemented a <strong>Wear OS beta program</strong> to catch issues before stable rollouts.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>During <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-galaxy-s25-live-blog">Samsung Unpacked 2025</a>, we heard that the Galaxy S25 series phones have a "custom" (sort of) Qualcomm Snapdragon chip to power its features. That's pretty cool — we know Snapdragon chips perform well and we've seen what building an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-tensor-g4-is-a-key-piece-of-googles-smartphone-vision">AI-tailored SoC</a> allows in Google's Pixel phones. The 3nm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-8-elite-mobile-platform" target="_blank">Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> paired with a Samsung-spec NPU <em>should</em> work out well if Samsung can tame the heat it will generate.</p><p>But I'm going to guess that it was awfully expensive. Here's the rub — Samsung could have made that chip in its own chip foundry, built to its own specs, and tailored perfectly for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25</a>. Instead, it paid extra on top of Qualcomm's hefty prices.</p>
<p>I'm betting it will within the next five years. It doesn't make sense to continue to do things the way they were done for the S25 when there is a better and more profitable way. Unless Samsung stops making phones, I think the Galaxy S30 will have one hell of an Exynos SoC running the show.</p><p>The only possible hurdle is Qualcomm. Qualcomm will do anything to keep Samsung as a customer. Samsung may put Exynos chips in some of its products, but it ships a lot of phones, tablets, and watches with a Snapdragon something-or-other inside of them. That means a lot of money is moving from Samsung's pockets into Qualcomm's.</p><p>It's a good relationship for both sides, though. It's not like Qualcomm is ripping off Samsung or anything because it gets devices that work better than they would otherwise, especially in North America, which all companies cherish the most for some silly reason. Maybe it's because we're so willing to throw money at anyone or anything.</p><p>Qualcomm wouldn't have to lose Samsung as a customer and actually might make more profit another way — by licensing very specific things under very specific terms.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="uBVTaQHWjrkjwuDtJpjczK" name="samsung-galaxy-25-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-3nm" alt="Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uBVTaQHWjrkjwuDtJpjczK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hypothetically, let's talk Galaxy S30 even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> just came out. The Galaxy S30, Galaxy S30 Plus, and Galaxy S30 Ultra could have a unique Exynos Ultra Elite 9000 chip that will never be in any other phone.</p><p>It would be made by Samsung with wireless connectivity options, core design, and maybe even GPU cores built using Qualcomm's design. Technically, it's possible: Samsung licenses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-arm-new-designs-mean-for-your-next-phone">ARM design</a> from ARM Holdings. It then licenses the changes to those designs that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-buying-nuvia-bigger-deal-than-you-think">Qualcomm has made</a> from Qualcomm. It can add its own suite of co-processors and NPU cores to build a unique, powerful chip.</p><p>Qualcomm doesn't have to worry about fabrication issues, foundry time, quality control, or shipping dates. It sits back and collects something like $0.11 from every single Galaxy S30 series phone sold just because it lets Samsung look at some computer files. Cha-ching.</p><p>On paper, it would look like a loss until you separate profit from income. Qualcomm spends no money letting Samsung do this, so every penny is profit. Qualcomm, like every other mega-corporation, loves the smell of profit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Rdo7X4UBJu6wiCR7t52NRP" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 series in Galaxy S24 series cases" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 series in Galaxy S24 series cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdo7X4UBJu6wiCR7t52NRP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3280" height="1845" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On Samsung's end, things smell just as profity. First, it doesn't have to pay extra for a Snapdragon SoC designed to integrate with any custom fabrications or additions it has. That's enough reason to want this. Samsung can also expand its own chip foundry business to meet demand, eventually becoming able to fab 3nm chips for other companies.</p><p>It wouldn't be able to sell these custom chips to anyone else or use them in products not covered under the hypothetical license. It probably wouldn't be able to because every S30 worldwide could ship with this new chip, and that's likely to be a bazillion phones.</p>
<p>I don't see any downside other than Qualcomm not being able to brag about all the chips it sells to Samsung or saying how it makes "the most advanced chip for the most advanced phone in the universe" or something equally silly. Qualcomm probably loves being able to do that, but I'll bet it loves making money without spending a penny to do it even more.</p><p>Let's do this. It's about time Samsung did something amazing again.</p>

<p>Consumers haven't even gotten their pre-ordered Galaxy S25 devices yet, but one lucky user put the latest Ultra through a battery trial, and let's say it pulled through.</p><p>YouTuber, Benjamin Aboagye (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkzUHycf1Qc&ab_channel=LoverOfTech">Lover of Tech</a>), published a video, which pits the Galaxy S25 Ultra in a major test of battery charging strength. In the initial test, Aboagye placed the latest Ultra on a charger and discovered that the device could go from 0% to 70% charge in 30 minutes. It's worth noting that Samsung upgraded this year's high-tier device with 45W fast charging.</p><p>However, continuing the test showed that the device could reach maximum charge in just under an hour at 57 minutes.</p><p>Elsewhere, the tech enthusiast started a live stream where they placed several Android phones together for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlDv2e2gXSI&t=1s&ab_channel=LoverOfTech">a battery drain test</a>.</p><p>The stream ran for roughly eight hours. In that time, the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which boasts a 5,000mAh battery, lasted seven hours and five minutes from full to empty. The test was riddled with different apps running videos and more to push the involved devices to the limit. Samsung's Ultra model ended the test in second place while the OnePlus 13 lasted the longest at seven hours and thirty-seven minutes.</p><p>Users can check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlDv2e2gXSI&t=1s&ab_channel=LoverOfTech">full battery drain test</a> to see how an old and brand-new Galaxy S24 Ultra fair against two of the latest Android phones today.</p>

<p>Battery and charging are seemingly important this year as Samsung seeks not only to boost its longevity but also how quickly the user can get back to scrolling. During launch, Samsung estimated that its S25 Ultra could reach a 65% charge in roughly thirty minutes, but recent tests show that it's more like 70%. This is in contrast to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">the S24 Ultra</a>, which clocks a 60% charge in thirty minutes — 10% less.</p><p>Moreover, last year's Ultra is much slower in reaching maximum charge as the YouTuber's test highlights the hour and ten minutes needed for the predecessor.</p><p>What's curious though is that Samsung's 2024 model also contains a 5,000mAh battery with 45W charging. So, while Samsung has likely worked some of its magic into the S25 Ultra, its custom <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> is probably helping, too.</p><p>Android Central has published <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on#section-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-performance-and-specs">its hands-on</a> of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The phone is loaded with Samsung's Galaxy AI enhancements, a new lock screen helper, and more of Google's AI model, Gemini. The latest Ultra is likely the most AI-driven device today with the many features that users can open up and experiment with if they desire. Some hardware changes seem to make a world of a difference for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, as well.</p><p>The Ultra model would be nothing without its two other siblings: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 and the Galaxy S25 Plus</a>, which sport similar designs to 2024, but with some next-gen bonuses to take us into the new year.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If there was a theme for smartphones in 2024, it was that flagship phones finally gained feature parity across form factors. Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, as well as Apple's iPhone 16/Pro and iPhone 16 Plus/Pro Max, are a few examples of smartphones that were identical aside from their screen sizes. Whether you wanted a big or small phone, you got the same overall experience.</p><p>Now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> series is here, it would be easy to think the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus would be a similar story. Instead, Samsung's first major launch of 2025 breaks the late 2024 trends.</p><p>Unfortunately, that isn't the case. There are three Galaxy S25 models available this year: the 6.2-inch Galaxy S25, the 6.7-inch Galaxy S25 Plus, and the 6.9-inch Galaxy S25 Ultra. At first glance, you might mistakenly think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus</a> are identical outside of their screen sizes, with the Galaxy S25 Ultra serving as a higher-end option.</p><p>The reality couldn't be more different. In many ways, the $999 Galaxy S25 Plus shares more in common with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">$1,299 Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> than the base $799 Galaxy S25. As such, you should know that you're sacrificing a lot more than screen real estate when you choose the Galaxy S25 over the higher-priced Samsung handsets.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xexavxLoiYvio8hnJzW9jh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-vs-S25-Plus-display-holding-01" alt="Comparing the displays of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xexavxLoiYvio8hnJzW9jh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because the Galaxy S25 <em>does</em> share a lot with the other two Galaxy phones, it's easy to overlook its shortcomings. There's still a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset</a>, 12GB RAM, and the same exact camera system as the bigger Galaxy S25 Plus. But even though the things missing from the Galaxy S25 aren't obvious, they're just as important.</p><p>The differences start with the phones' displays, and it's more than just size separating these two devices. Yes, the Galaxy S25 is smaller than the Galaxy S25 Plus. On top of that, the screens have different resolutions, with the Galaxy S25 supporting Full HD+ and the Galaxy S25 Plus supporting Quad HD+. It's true that this may be less noticeable on the Galaxy S25's smaller display, but the larger phone's Quad HD Plus resolution means the Galaxy S25 Plus has double the pixels of the Galaxy S25.</p><p>All told the Galaxy S25 Plus should look crisper than the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25</a>. Crucially, the bigger phone supports Samsung's "ProScaler for Quad HD+" technology. It's described as "AI image processing" that helps the Galaxy S25 Plus and Ultra "achieve a 40% improvement in image quality." So, it's clear the Galaxy S25 Plus will have a better display than the Galaxy S25 — not just the bigger one.</p><p>The base storage configuration is also lower on the Galaxy S25, as the phone starts with 128GB of storage. For an extra $60, you can upgrade it to 256GB (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">this is cheaper now, thanks to pre-order deals</a>). However, the Galaxy S25 Plus starts at 256GB. It's a nice perk, considering everything else you get when you make the jump to the middle Galaxy S25 phone.</p><p>One of those things is a bigger battery. The Galaxy S25 Plus has a 4,900mAh capacity, whereas the regular Galaxy S25 has a 4,000mAh battery. There are a few things to note here, though. For starters, the bigger Galaxy S25 Plus screen will draw more power, which means the Galaxy S25 Plus may perform similarly to the Galaxy S25 in the real world. But it's just as important to note that the Galaxy S25 Plus is way closer to the Galaxy S25 Ultra's 5,000mAh capacity, meaning it could shape up to be a battery life champion.</p><p>If raw capacity isn't enough to sway you, how about charging speeds? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-fast-samsung-galaxy-s25-charging-speed">The base Galaxy S25 maxes out at 25W speeds over a cable</a>, whereas the Galaxy S25 Plus can charge at up to 45W speeds. For what it's worth, 15W wireless and 4.5W reverse wireless charging speeds are the same across both devices. With that being said, if you're in a pinch, you might wish you had those faster wired charging speeds on the Galaxy S25.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FJfzsJGzpmwkM8bxgNoYzJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-UWB-01" alt="Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) support on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FJfzsJGzpmwkM8bxgNoYzJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The final advantage the Galaxy S25 Plus has over the base Galaxy S25 is the one I think could end up being the most crucial difference in the long run. The former has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-uwb-galaxy-s21-series-and-which-models-support-it">ultra-wideband (UWB) chip</a>, while the latter does not. For the uninitiated, UWB is a nearfield radio communication protocol that is excellent for data transfer and location, helping you find items with pinpoint accuracy. It's the technology that made AirTags so popular.</p><p>Well, the official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-2-announcement" target="_blank">Samsung SmartTag 2</a> also supports UWB for precision finding, as do select Tile trackers. It's possible that as Google's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">Find My Device ecosystem</a> blossoms, more UWB devices will enter the fold. If your new flagship doesn't have UWB, it isn't future-proofed.</p><p>Considering that Samsung is touting the Galaxy S25 as potentially lasting seven years with full OS support, these hardware limitations could become a problem — one that you don't learn about until well after the return window has passed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="A6BmrW892hgLCapb6cudu6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Galaxy-S25-displays-02" alt="Comparing the display size on the Samsung Galaxy S25 with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A6BmrW892hgLCapb6cudu6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To sum up, the Galaxy S25 Plus — despite looking like a bigger Galaxy S25 — has a few key advantages over its smaller counterpart. There's the higher-resolution screen, ProScaler AI enhancement tool, higher-capacity battery, larger base storage, faster charging speeds, and UWB chip. Like I said before, the Galaxy S25 Plus may be better viewed as a smaller Galaxy S25 Ultra than a bigger Galaxy S25.</p><p>I'm not exactly thrilled to tell you this. I don't want to say you <em>need</em> to pay $999 for the Galaxy S25 Plus instead of $799 for the Galaxy S25. In fact, I think it's commendable that Samsung has kept the base Galaxy S25 thin, compact, and light when the rest of the Android phone market keeps getting bigger.</p><p>I wish the Samsung Galaxy S25 had the same internal components and feature set as the larger Galaxy S25 Plus. Then, buyers could choose the one they like most and not feel pressured to size up. Unfortunately, as things currently stand, it feels hard to recommend the base Galaxy S25, considering how much more you get when you pay just $200 more for the Galaxy S25 Plus.</p>

<p>Leading up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-galaxy-s25-live-blog">Galaxy Unpacked</a>, there were a few rumblings that Samsung might consider ditching the S Pen, likely in order to save itself a few bucks. Thankfully, those rumors weren't correct, and the S Pen is still alive and well with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>It's not just that we have a stowable stylus that makes the S25 Ultra intriguing even to those who don't want an almost 7-inch phone. The S Pen provided quite a bit more functionality than just being able to doodle on the screen. However, with the S25 Ultra, Samsung decided to drop Bluetooth Low Energy, opting for more of a "dumb" S Pen.</p><p>Caught in the line of fire with this decision was Air Actions. For the unaware, this would let you perform various tasks when holding down the button on the side of the S Pen itself. You could even customize the gestures and what they did, or just stick to the confines of the Air Action menu that appeared on screen.</p>

<p>For one, I'm still kind of in disbelief that the S Pen is even still around. Companies are always looking for ways to cut costs, and I presume this might be next on Samsung's list. At the same time, the S Pen does help the Galaxy S25 Ultra stand out for more than just its big screen or plethora of cameras.</p><p>Practically every other "big" phone out there forces you to use your digits as a stylus instead, but that doesn't always provide the precision interactions you might be looking for. This is where the S Pen comes in, as it's one of those "nice to have" features, at least whenever you remember that your phone has it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6wXCFouePCD2RdN245yYfL" name="Samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-burgundy-air-commands.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra burgundy colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6wXCFouePCD2RdN245yYfL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When attending a briefing about the S25 series, Samsung was asked why it would remove a feature that had become a staple. In response, company representatives stated it would improve durability, but that's not all.</p><p>As it turns out, the number of people who use Air Actions is shockingly low. Like, less than 1%. Oh, and it gets better. Of that, even fewer people actually use Air Actions, with the "the vast majority" of them only use it and the S Pen as a remote shutter.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Less than 1% of Galaxy S Ultra owners actually use Air Actions, with the majority of those only using it as a remote camera shutter.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In situations where the person with the Ultra also has either a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ring-review">Ring </a>paired, those individuals rely on their wearables to double as a remote camera shutter. But what if the person has neither of those but needs the remote shutter functionality? Samsung explained to us that the "palm gesture" is the most common way that people rely on to take hands-free pictures.</p><p>To try and put the "less than 1%" in perspective, let's look at last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-one-year-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. Earlier this month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1874802229586366801">it was reported</a> that between January and November 2024, Samsung sold 15.8 million Galaxy S24 Ultra units. Based on these numbers, 1% is just 158,000.</p><p>Since Samsung didn't provide the specific percentage, we'll just say that it was at 0.99% to avoid any speculation. So less than 158,000 people even used Air Actions, and an even smaller number only used Air Actions to take a hands-free picture. To Samsung, that's like trying to find a single grain of sand on the beach. So, the company found the grain of sand and got rid of it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rrys54xP3wbYapWD4JQtnP" name="galaxy-s24-ultra-microsd-card-5.jpg" alt="MicroSD card on the back of the Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rrys54xP3wbYapWD4JQtnP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, if you were to look around at the community response, you might think that this is as bad as when Samsung removed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phone-headphone-jack">headphone jack</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-made-a-microsd-card-that-doesnt-suck-but-theres-a-problem">microSD card</a> slot. Even if Samsung's numbers are somehow skewed, and more people used Air Actions than what we were told, it wasn't enough to make any kind of impact.</p><p>So, instead, there's outrage amongst the vocal minority despite Samsung having the data to back it up. Now, you could make the argument about why Samsung removed a feature that the overwhelming majority of people forget even exists. I wish I had an answer, but ultimately, Samsung no longer saw any benefit in keeping BLE in the S Pen, and now it's gone.</p><p>Usually, I'm one of the first people to grab a pitchfork when it comes to unnecessary feature removals or design changes. This time, I'm in the "Who cares?" camp. I couldn't really figure out why I didn't care until it dawned on me — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">S Pen Fold Edition</a> doesn't have Air Actions either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EmSigZ7prjRbed97djK7QZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-22.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Sketch to Image"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EmSigZ7prjRbed97djK7QZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps my opinion about the S25 Ultra's S Pen changes would be different if I had never used a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold</a> before. So, for me, it will just be "more of the same" once the S25 Ultra lands on my doorstep.</p><p>One other thing that I want to point out is that Air Actions and Air Command are not the same. There seems to be a bit of confusion around this, with some thinking that Samsung removed the latter when that's not the case.</p><p>Air Commands is the menu that appears when you remove the S Pen and put a little bubble on your screen. Tapping said bubble opens a list of different actions, such as using Smart/AI Select, Screen Write, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SK2PCADSS5tRefwmc4Wxtj" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-with-s-pen-angled-view" alt="Angled view of all four Galaxy S25 Ultra colors with S Pens unsheathed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SK2PCADSS5tRefwmc4Wxtj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Air Actions are gestures that can be performed when pressing and holding the side button on the S Pen. These include being able to act as a remote camera shutter or even just interacting with your phone with a swish and flick.</p><p>Sure, I understand why someone might be upset if they relied on S Pen Air Actions all of the time. But it's impossible for Samsung to cater to every single person who buys a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>.</p><p>There's <em>always</em> the possibility that something will get changed or removed, and sometimes, it's something that doesn't make any sense. But other times, like now, there's no point in being "outraged" just for the sake of it.</p>

<p>Per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/23430">certification</a>, the charger is manufactured by a company called WITS, which in 2019 acquired Samsung Electro-Mechanics’ wireless charging business. And, the company now has a 3-in-1 charger ready, which is believed to complement the latest Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>According to images from the WPC certification, the 3-in-1 Qi2 charger can wirelessly charge a Qi2-ready phone next to a Galaxy Watch or Galaxy Ring, respectively. Any Galaxy S25 model in the lot can be charged at 15W speeds, which is a significant bump from the 7.5W charging speed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Samsung has also launched Qi2-compatible accessories for the Galaxy S25 models, including a magnetic case for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. While many users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-tipped-to-have-qi2-wireless-charging-case">expected</a> the Galaxy S25 series to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Qi2 compatible by default</a>, the company has made them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2-ready instead</a>.</p><p>This makes the Galaxy S25 series still rely on cases that feature magnets even with the WITS 3-in-1 Qi2 wireless charger or the aforementioned Samsung official case for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Moreover, WITS also has a Qi2 wireless car charger for the Galaxy S25 models, which also offers 15W charging support. Users can also look for third-party <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">Qi2-compatible cases</a> for the latest trio and even for the older flagship Galaxy models or compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> in general.</p>

<p>Samsung just launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> at its annual Galaxy Unpacked event. The phones come with all of the Galaxy AI features, and some phone upgrades. But most notable is that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is now available at the same price as the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Not increasing the price of its latest flagships is a move that I think might be favorable for Samsung.</p><p>The premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> starts at $1,299, the same price that the S24 Ultra launched at. At the time of the S24 Ultra launch, however, the price of the phone was increased by $100 from the Galaxy S23 Ultra.</p><p>During Android Central’s briefing for the S24, a Samsung representative said that the price increase for the S24 Ultra was because of upgrades to the phone itself.</p><p>“Over the last three years, we have added and improved Ultra dramatically and we have prided ourselves in providing an absolute best value that we can to our customers," the representative said.</p><p>"However, at this time with so much of the additions and improvements that were brought from additional improvements from chipsets to cameras, sensors and functions, it was just something that we’re unable to absorb this go around.”</p>

<p>I find it most impressive and interesting that this year Samsung was able to get a brand new, and much more powerful, chipset into the device and still didn’t have to increase the price of the phone. The entire series launched with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> and more importantly is that it’s not just the Ultra that got the new chipset, but the entire lineup of devices, which includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus</a>. These phones also did not get a price increase.</p><p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, said that while it’s common that most manufacturers release new phones with new chips, it’s “quiet notable that Samsung isn’t raising prices.”</p><p>But at the same time he did indicate that in 2025, most manufacturers are likely not going to be raising prices.</p><p>“I don’t [think] we’ll see many price hikes this year from other vendors either because inflation is cooling and prices are quiet high anyway,” he said.</p><p>On the other hand, OnePlus recently launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, which also runs on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset. The company raised the price of the phone to $899, and increase of $100 compared to the previous model, which was priced at $799, already undercutting its closest rivals. That said, it still costs less than the $999 Galaxy S25 Plus.</p>

<p>The past year was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/2025-could-be-very-different-for-google-and-samsung-heres-why">challenging year for Samsung</a>. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> had a successful launch, it didn’t really help improve the downard trajectory of Samsung’s sales. And in April of that year, the company initiated a six-day workweek for executives to create “a sense of crisis” among the company’s leadership team. <br><br>Where Samsung began to really struggle was after launching its Samsung Galaxy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a>, which in many tech circles were more iterative updates to what it launched the previous year. The phones weren’t super exciting and weren’t as innovative as they have been in previous years. It got the point <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">Samsung had to apologize</a> for its lack of innovation last year.</p><p>IDC confirmed Samsung lost smartphone market share as of Q2 2024 compared to the previous year and that the company’s market share dipped to 18.4%, down from 20%.</p><p>And frankly, if Samsung wanted to have a better 2025, raising prices would not be the right move.</p><p>Ubrani agrees, but also adds, it probably won’t be a good look to shareholders either. “After a poor performance in 2024, raising prices would likely hurt them from a share perspective,” he said. “This is even more true in markets like Europe or Asia where there tends to be more brand diversity.”</p><p>IDC, in an email first-look report, indicated that the S24 series took up the increasing share of Samsung’s shipments during its launch quarter, adding that it contributed “to 22% of Samsung shipments in 1Q24.”</p><p>Because of its focus, IDC said that the company’s share in the worldwide premium market ultimately rose to as much as 20% in the past year, up from 15% in 2021.</p><p>Where the company has always shined is through their promotional activity and Ubrani notes that the foldable market will be a bit quiet allowing for the S series to win.</p><p>“Additionally, the market for foldable smartphones is expected to show some softness this year as the growth rate slows. This could potentially lead to increased promotional activity across Samsung’s S lineup particularly in the premium price brands later in the year which could also help the company sell more phones,” he said.</p><p>Ultimately, I'm glad, because Samsung did the right thing here by not raising prices. It’s a better look for the company and it is a better thing for customers. I think if customers are looking for new phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">they should seriously consider the latest phone</a> instead of choosing to buy an older model because of price hikes.</p><p>I look forward to seeing how Samsung improves this year.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-42">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Galaxy S25 series introduces a new battery health feature, showing stats like health percentage, cycle count, and device manufacturing details in the settings.</li><li>The feature might not be available everywhere yet, with some regions still waiting for the update.</li><li>Before, checking battery health on Samsung was a hassle, but now it’s all right there in the settings for easy access.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With Google and Samsung leading the pack with longer software support for their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, providing a clear picture of battery health for anyone hanging onto their phones for the long haul is now a big deal. That's where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/icymi-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-biggest-announcements-and-reveals">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> series steps in with a new battery health feature, and some users are already seeing it in action.</p><p>X user @Razar_the_Raven spotted that all Galaxy S25 models now pack detailed battery stats in the settings (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-tells-you-exactly-how-many-times-youve-charged-it/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). Under "Battery Information" in the Settings > Battery menu, you can check out your battery health percentage, cycle count, and even see when your device was made and first used.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally!You can now see your Battery Health, including the Cycle Count on the Galaxy S25 Series 🔋 pic.twitter.com/xTb5ECkRL4<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1882400017690046860">January 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While Apple has included battery information in iPhones for a while, Samsung is stepping it up with more detailed data and giving users more control over their battery management.</p><p>With more people holding onto their phones longer before upgrading, it’s now up to phone makers to provide useful info about battery life.</p><p>Before, checking your battery health on a Samsung phone was a bit of a hassle—you had to open the Samsung Members app, dig through <em>Support </em>> <em>Diagnostics</em>, and still couldn’t get a clear health percentage. But with the Galaxy S25, all that info is right in the settings, giving you a quick and easy way to check your battery’s condition.</p>

<p>Right now, it looks like full battery health information isn’t available everywhere. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-battery-health-charge-cycle-count/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, this feature might be limited by region.</p><p>It’s not clear why some Galaxy S25s are missing the feature. It might be that those phones need a firmware update to get it working, or maybe it’s meant to be exclusive to certain markets. Plus, it’s still unknown if older Galaxy devices will get the feature down the line.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 series takes a big leap forward compared to its predecessor, thanks to the new Galaxy AI features. At the heart of this upgrade is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> processor, a powerhouse that’s ready to go head-to-head with Apple’s A18 Pro chip.</p>

<hr>
<p>During the Galaxy S25 launch, Samsung announced that the premium Galaxy S25 Ultra sports a stronger Corning Gorilla Armor 2 screen that is said to provide excessive durability to its top-end model.</p><p>According to the company, this is the industry’s first scratch-resistant, anti-reflective glass ceramic cover that is debuting on the S25 Ultra. Corning claims that the glass can survive a 2.2-meter (about 7 feet) drop, even on rough surfaces.</p><p>Considering the hefty price tag this model comes with, users expect the phone to be extremely durable through life's wear and tear. Samsung says that this collaboration with Corning will give customers exactly that.</p><p>“Our partnership with Corning continues to push boundaries in display performance, ensuring that we meet the evolving needs of consumers worldwide,” said Kwangjin Bae, EVP and head of mechanical R&D at Samsung Electronics.</p><p>According to the blog post, devices that come with the Gorilla Armor 2 have better endurance when dropped on rough surfaces as the cover glass is engineered to resist damage and breakage better than the one on the S24 Ultra.</p><p>Lab tests also showed that the Armor 2  showcased four times more scratch resistance than lithium-aluminosilicate cover glasses.</p>

<p>Last year, the Gorilla Armor on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> Corning set new standards of durability and visual clarity by enhancing surface reflections by 75% with the Corning Gorilla Armor in almost any environment. However, consumers have recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultra-needs-to-fix-four-major-s24-ultra-display-problems">complained</a> about how the anti-glare properties of the Corning glass didn't age well.</p><p>As users saw smudges on their screen had to be wiped down from time to time and sometimes it never went away. They complained about having to use an expensive screen guard since the device's anti-reflective coating was ineffective.</p><p>This time around Corning says that it has made "significant progress" and the Armor 2 is the most durable cover material ever used on a Galaxy device yet.  The cover glass claims to reduce surface reflections in both indoor and outdoor settings, without getting into the numbers. Likely, if you're out and about on a sunny day, your phone's screen may still be comfortably visible to you, with minimal glare from the surroundings.</p><p>"With Gorilla Armor 2, we offer consumers an unparalleled user experience with optically advanced and the most durable cover material ever used on a Galaxy device,” Bae added.</p><p>As for it being dirt and smudge-proof, we'll have to wait and see when we get our hands on the device. In the meantime, we already have roundups for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-screen-protectors">Galaxy S25 Ultra screen protectors</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">cases</a> for those that want extra protection for their $1299 smartphones.</p>

<p>With the announcement of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung Project Moohan</a> teasers, there's a spotlight on extended-reality (XR) technology. It's fair to consider Meta a pioneer in this space, with the Meta Quest lineup, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and Meta Orion prototype XR glasses. Where is the company headed? Thanks to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2025-01-21/meta-hardware-plans-oakley-and-ar-like-glasses-apple-watch-and-airpods-rivals" target="_blank">report</a> from Bloomberg insider Mark Gurman, we have an idea.</p><p>Orion, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">the prototype Android Central's own Nicholas Sutrich got to experience</a> last year, will never be mass produced. It's too expensive and has a separate puck that handles the wearable's processing. However, in many ways, it's a glimpse of what Meta hopes to offer to consumers in the future. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">Meta just explained how the sEMG input works</a> — and why it may be the future of hand tracking and device input.</p><p>Gurman now reports that Orion will be offered to software developers next year, in 2026, so they can build and test apps for the platform. Even though Orion won't be sold, the company is working on another project — codenamed Artemis — that will be eventually sold. The Bloomberg report notes that it could become available as early as 2027. By giving Orion to developers early, Meta likely hopes to build up a software ecosystem <em>before </em>selling Artemis, avoiding an Apple Vision Pro-esque debacle.</p>

<p>Artemis is likely still early in development, but Gurman says people with knowledge of the prototypes say it's both lighter and more advanced than Orion.</p><p>Separately, there's new information about Meta's future smart glasses plans. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses are a huge hit, and they're made possible by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-announces-long-term-essilorluxottica-eyewear-deal">a partnership with legacy eyeglass maker EssilorLuxottica</a>. But EssilorLuxottica manages many more brands than just Ray-Ban, and Meta may be about to take advantage of that.</p>

<p>There's reportedly a pair of Meta smart glasses in the works codenamed "Supernova 2," based on Oakley's Sphaera frames. This design would shift the camera to the center of the frames, and would be targeted at athletes, according to the report.</p>

<p>That might not sound great to uses of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">current Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a>, who enjoy the subtle design and everyday wear of the existing pair. There is good news on that front, though: Meta is reportedly working on a premium variant of the Ray-Ban Metas codenamed "Hypernova." This set could cost as much as $1,000, per Gurman, and would be a high-end offering. Crucially, this pair of glasses would include a screen that turns the smart glasses into an AR device.</p><p>The most recent Bloomberg report indicates that Meta is pursuing an XR future on all fronts. It's both working on scaling down its Orion prototype for mass production, and scaling up its Ray-Ban Meta glasses to become a true AR device.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly calling attention to a potentially dangerous situation regarding two of Fitbit's smartwatches.</p><p>Our friends at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/fitbit-issues-battery-overheating-warning-over-two-of-its-most-popular-watches-and-it-might-compensate-you-if-youre-affected">TechRadar</a> hopped on this after receiving word from Google about a battery overheating problem affecting the Fitbit Sense and Versa 3. The company reportedly adds that a "limited" number of those devices and users may be affected.</p><p>In detailing the situation, a Google statement says this issue "poses a potential risk for users and requires an immediate firmware update."</p><p>The publication highlights the details of the update provided by Google. According to the post, the update for the Fitbit Sense and Versa 3 will improve the "stability" of the batteries while also "reducing the risk" of overheating. Unfortunately, tackling this through software seems to adversely affect the longevity of the batteries in both watches.</p><p>Google states that, as a result of the update, "the battery will last for shorter periods between charges."</p><p>The post states that users with these devices who require the update will be notified on two fronts: in the Fitbit app <em>and </em>via email from Google.</p><p>Furthermore, Google has created a form for this harmful battery discovery for affected users. Those with a Fitbit Sense or Versa 3 can fill out the information <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/contact/fitbit_sense_and_versa_3_registration?visit_id=638731352243419808-3939466803&p=sense-versa3-help&rd=1">in this form</a> to "determine eligibility" for "an appeasement of $50 USD." If you require the update, it will be delivered, as well as the compensation money should your eligibility prove true.</p>

<p>Curiously, this isn't the first time Fitbit has had an issue with overheating batteries as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-is-recalling-over-1-million-ionic-smartwatches-heres-why">a similar problem</a> occurred with its old Ionic smartwatches. The company issued a recall of nearly one million of the watches due to the severe risk it posed to consumer safety. The company stated at the time that its batteries could overheat and (potentially) create a burn hazard when worn.</p><p>This led to a lawsuit, which was then shored up by <em>another </em>two months later in May 2022.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-hit-with-another-lawsuit">second lawsuit</a> claimed that Fitbit's trackers and watches were burning users' wrists due to overheating batteries. The devices detailed in this second lawsuit were the Fitbit Sense and the Versa — which is similar to what we're seeing crop up today. Users provided after images of the damage done to their skin because of the hotter-than-expected batteries against their body.</p><p>It seems like Google is trying to get well ahead of this issue, lest both sides suffer a repeat of 2022.</p>

No kidding. The only catch is that you&apos;re limited to trading in devices from Apple, Google, or Samsung (sorry, Motorola users). To sweeten the deal, Verizon will also throw in a free Galaxy Watch 7 or Galaxy Tab S9 FE, which means you could be getting over $1,500 of free stuff when you preorder. </p>

<p>Just like its predecessor, the Galaxy S25 Plus is all about balance.

<ul><li>Google has released Android 16 Beta 1 to developers and early adopters, meaning users can enroll their Pixels in its program.</li><li>The update packs support for a wide range of features like better large display support for apps, "live updates," and video recording updates.</li><li>Google reiterates that it plans to release Android 16 by Q2 2025, but it's also planning a minor SDK update for features and more in Q4.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's here to end your week on a good note as the latest installment of Android 16's beta is coming to developers and early adopters.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/first-beta-android16.html?m=1">announced</a> today (Jan 23) that Android 16 Beta 1 is available for all enrolled users and Pixels <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">in the program</a>. Google teases that this initial build of Android 16 is loaded with support for future features it aims to deliver — and help devs flesh out, too. To start, the post states Android 16 Beta 1 works to improve the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/orientation-and-resizability-changes-in-android-16.html">app adaptability</a>" users experience across devices.</p><p>Google says it has removed the restriction apps have when attempting to resize itself for a new orientation or display size. In short, this change will reportedly allow "large screen devices" to run apps in any size window and aspect ratio. However, Google states that this alleviation of restriction will not apply to games. Most other apps <em>should </em>now fill the screen more comfortably for larger screen devices, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">book-style foldables</a>.</p><p>Developers have been given the tools to rework their apps to fit this new protocol within Android 16 Beta 1. In 2025, Google states devices with a screen of 600dp (width) will see this change applied with apps targeting API at level 36. Next year, these changes will hit apps targeting API at level 37.</p><p>A major introduction in Android 16 Beta 1 is "Live Updates." If you caught Samsung's Galaxy S25 reveal, this might remind you of its lock screen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-lock-screen-keeps-you-in-the-loop-on-sports-and-directions">Now Bar</a>. According to Google, Live Updates will also find a home on your Pixel's lock screen in this test. Users can "monitor" ongoing activities "among other notifications."</p><p>In this initial test, Google states Live Updates are intended for more urgent notification cases. It is encouraging developers to utilize them for ride-sharing info, food orders, and navigational purposes.</p>

<p>Android device cameras are receiving a new update in Beta 1 as Google highlights new support for Advanced Professional Video (APV). The company states this is designed to help users record videos at a higher quality. The post-production side is also reportedly sped up as Android 16 Beta 1 brings a quicker editing workflow, multi-view video, auxiliary video, and more.</p><p>The post highlights some neat things about APV, such as its ability for perceptually lossless video quality, which is stated to be close to "raw video quality." The lightweight entropy coding scheme is said to add support for a high bit-rate range for 2K, 4K, and 8K resolutions.</p><p>Elsewhere, this first beta brings updates to the Accessibility side of Android 16 by way of supplemental descriptions for drop-down menus. Moreover, Android 16 should better identify and navigate between fields that require information when using an accessibility service. The software's test will give developers a better look at its predictive back support for three-button navigation devices and its ART (Android Runtime) internal changes.</p><p>Google highlighted the recent introduction of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-allows-users-to-share-images-files-youtube-videos-to-gemini-live">Samsung-specific Gemini extensions</a> for the Galaxy S25 series. While that included support for Samsung Calendar, Notes, Reminder, and Clock, Google states it will seek to work with other OEMs to do the same for them and their users and devices.</p>

<p>Users need to strap in because Android 16 is gearing up for a Q2 2025 release — which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-gemini-android-studio-sdk-updates">much earlier</a> than we're used to. Of course, Google has been running its Developer Preview since late last year, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-2-released">the second one</a> arriving in December. However, this timeline gives us a clean look at when we should expect Android 16's major release. Q2 gives us a timeframe between April and June.</p><p>More importantly, Google states that while the major release is in Q2, users should also expect minor SDK releases (for features and more) sometime in Q4 2025.</p><p>Also, with Samsung and Google so intertwined following the Galaxy S25 launch on January 22, the Korean OEM teased the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which could drop amid Android 16's launch.</p>

<p>A little over a week later, OnePlus is pushing another update to its latest flagship series to fix several problems.</p><p>Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich spotted a new update on his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> earlier today (Jan 23). The update arrives as version <strong>CPH2655_15.0.0.405 (EX01)</strong> with a download size of 330MB. The patch is small, but its changelog details quite a few fixes for several aspects of the device, beginning with its cameras. OnePlus states it has fixed the colors of photos when users are in Master mode.</p><p>This small patch also aids the stability of the OnePlus 13 cameras while also improving the "tone" of pictures when using the rear set in Photo mode. Additionally, users will find a fix for the phone's zoom.</p><p>When OnePlus revealed its major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-releases-android-15-based-oxygenos-15-heres-when-your-phone-will-get-the-update">OxygenOS 15</a> (Android 15) software in October, AI was a major part of it. The latest update for the OnePlus 13 includes new additions for its on-device AI, such as a "live translation feature that shows the translation of speech in real-time." Users can also listen to AI-based translations when wearing headphones, too.</p><p>Another newly added AI feature is a face-to-face translation feature that shows the translated speech of each speaker in a split view. Joining this is the ability for users to initiate a face-to-face translation session by tapping their headphones. OnePlus warns that this functionality will not work everywhere and is limited to "selected" headphones.</p><p>The Chinese OEM adds, "The translation of one language is played on the speaker on the phone, while the translation of the other language is played on the headphones."</p><p>The full patch notes are as follows:</p>

<p>OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1778649046873800709">also brought attention</a> to this update and stated that users in India, the E.U., and other global regions should see this new update. While we've noticed the update here in the U.S., users should begin checking their devices as the week finishes for it, too.</p><p>The company's latest flagship models — the OnePlus 13 and 13R — debuted on January 7 and we've already picked up <em>two </em>firmware updates. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-13-gets-gemini-nano-and-oneplus-13r-receives-new-updates">first update</a> arrived last week as the Chinese OEM fixed some issues alongside the addition of Gemini Nano. Google's AI model brought its generative AI power to Google Messages on the newest devices. The OnePlus 13 and 13R now benefit from the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-compose-google-messages">Magic Compose</a> button, an experimental feature that provides suggested replies in conversations.</p>

<p>Just before Christmas, we saw the debut of the long-awaited <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/skydance-behemoth-meta-quest-3">Behemoth</a>, a game that combines some of the best elements of the classic PlayStation title Shadow of the Colossus with the visceral combat of a Soulsborne. Just before that, a handful of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/one-year-later-mixed-reality-games-are-booming">amazing mixed reality titles</a> showcased exactly what mixed reality could do for new and existing genres.</p><p>Since then, we've seen dozens of new games debut on the Meta Quest platform. From chill puzzle games to action-heavy Soulsborne titles, there's a good bit of variety here for you to check out.</p>

<h2 id="voxel-violence-2">Voxel violence</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6tUA4zkYSq7GesVZr4viqF" name="clone-drone-in-the-hyperdome-meta-quest-screenshot" alt="A screenshot of fighting robots with a laser sword in Clone Drone in the Hyperdome on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6tUA4zkYSq7GesVZr4viqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Doborog LLC)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Two new titles debuted with incredible physics-driven combat that's sure to wow you with every swing and punch. First up is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/clone-drone-in-the-hyperdome/4523126804481573/">Clone Drone in the Hyperdome</a>, a VR sequel to the popular Steam title Clone Drone in the Danger Zone. Hyperdome uses a similar voxel visual style, but there's much more to this visual style than meets the eye.</p><p>While you might get Minecraft vibes at first, the game is a lot more Teardown than Minecraft because of the ability to slice enemies in the most brutal ways, all using the fun power of voxels to dismantle them. Weapons all have a convincing weight and each type will need to be wielded very differently, otherwise you'll end up as a steaming heap of voxels yourself.</p><p>Clone Drone in the Hyperdome uses a roguelike structure where you'll embark on an infinite death loop, fighting through procedurally-generated levels until you eventually die yourself. As you progress, you'll unlock different powers and weapon types by defeating unique bosses, each with its own skillset that you'll have to choose from before embarking on your adventure.</p>
<h2 id="is-that-the-elden-ring-2">Is that the Elden Ring?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YqCBSDKrXaQsaTZpMJEMqF" name="grimlord-meta-quest-screenshot" alt="A screenshot of fighting knights with a sword in Grimlord on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YqCBSDKrXaQsaTZpMJEMqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Metalcat Studio)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the opposite side of the action spectrum is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/grimlord/6784503354964529/">Grimlord</a>, with its Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals and unforgiving Soulsborne gameplay. This one channels some of the best qualities of Dark Souls and Elden Ring into a stellar VR package, including that dark fantasy setting people love.</p><p>You'll traverse the hand-hewn world, unlocking shortcuts and watching around every corner for the next enemy ready to pummel you to pieces. The swordplay isn't just physics-driven, it's also incredibly accurate feeling and translates beautifully to dozens of other weapons you'll find throughout the game.</p><p>Grimlord was in early access for two years, honing its gameplay via community feedback and eventually switching over to Unreal Engine 5 for the final release. If the visceral combat and brutal, unforgiving nature of a Soulsborne title is your jam, go ahead and try the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/grimlord-free-demo/5015212428599892/">free Grimlord demo</a> a shot first. Based on reviews and my own experience, I'm quite confident you'll end up buying the full version in no time flat.</p>
<h2 id="trapped-in-the-rennaissance-2">Trapped in the Rennaissance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YoJdaTyUENWaXcFy4EHVy8" name="house-of-da-vinci-meta-quest-screenshot" alt="Solving puzzles with the ghost of Leonardo Da Vinci in House of Davinci on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YoJdaTyUENWaXcFy4EHVy8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Blue Brain Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If puzzle games are more your style, the escape room-like vibe of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/the-house-of-da-vinci-vr/6074227932599910/">House of Da Vinci VR</a> is sure to give you a thrill. Cutting-edge graphics and phenomenal artwork really shine on the powerful chipset in the Quest 3 and Quest 3S, but more than that, the puzzles you'll find will make you feel smarter than Tom Hanks in "The Da Vinci Code."</p><p>Leonardo Da Vinci was known for his elaborate inventions and detailed drawings, all of which developer Blue Brain Games took inspiration from. Each machine you come across requires serious brain power and deductive reasoning to solve which, in turn, will give you access to the next area with more puzzles to solve.</p><p>Games like this work particularly well in VR because of the medium's tactile nature, giving you the ability to not only look around at each machine from every angle and inspect it up close but to hold intricate parts in your hand and understand spatial relationships required to solve them. It's a win-win for puzzle and adventure fans alike!</p>
<h2 id="turn-based-strategy-gets-a-mixed-reality-makeover-2">Turn based strategy gets a mixed reality makeover</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h8D7B2Uv9Mbxh5KaCHi2TR" name="augmented-empire-meta-quest-screenshot" alt="A mixed reality screenshot of turn-based strategy game Augmented Empire running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h8D7B2Uv9Mbxh5KaCHi2TR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Coatsink)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/augmented-empire/7618080518206990/">Augmented Empire</a> is the complete rebuild of the classic VR turn-based-strategy title with updated graphics, mechanics, hand tracking, and even mixed reality support on the Quest 3 and Quest 3S. Sporting a neon-drenched cyberpunk theme and superb turn-based mechanics, Augmented Empire is made by the same folks who brought us the excellent Jurassic World Aftermath a few years back.</p><p>The game follows classic turn-based mechanics where each character has a dedicated set of attacks and limited moves they can make each turn. I particularly love it because not only is the gameplay very chill — being turn-based means you can take your sweet time if you want — but the new mixed reality elements make it feel like playing a board game that came to life right on your table or in the middle of your living room.</p><p>You can even choose to have the game board stretch across your entire room, making the small world feel alive and realistic. The story is rather good, and the price is even better at just $12.99. Nothing like a low price and a great game to make an even better weekend!</p>
<h2 id="more-to-come-2">More to come</h2>
<p>This was just a teeny tiny slice of what's available on the Meta Quest now and what has come out in the past two months alone. A ton of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> are on the way including heavy-hitters like Alien Rogue Incursion which we already know is an incredible game from the PC VR and PSVR 2 release in December.</p>

<hr>
<p>Consumers’ audio listening experience has come a long way. Users are seeing a gradual shift from stereo sound experience to spatial audio. To complement the latter, Google and Samsung are creating their own open-source spatial audio format dubbed Eclipsa Audio.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/01/introducing-eclipsa-audio-immersive-audio-for-everyone.html">accompanying blog post</a>, Eclipsa Audio is based on the Immersive Audio model and Formats (IAMF). It is co-developed by Google, Samsung, and others that come under the Alliance of Open Media (AOM). The IAMF, which is already open-source, makes the creation of Eclipsa Audio files easier with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/iamf-tools">notable audio tools</a> and simultaneously supports a wide variety of workflows.</p>

<p>The aim of the new open-source format is to give the best spatial audio experiences for the masses as it can be experienced in your regular day-to-day use. Starting this year, creators can upload videos in the Eclipsa Audio format on YouTube.</p><p>Samsung, on the other hand, will be incorporating this technology in this year’s TV lineup. It includes the company’s Crystal UHD series next to the premium flagship Neo QLED 8K models — giving users a variety of options.</p><p>Google is also believed to be integrating native Eclipsa Audio playback support into the Google Chrome browser and will be working closely with TV and soundbar manufacturers later in the year to bring the new audio format support. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a> will also be getting Eclipsa Audio support through an upcoming Android AOSP release.</p>
<p>“Google and Samsung will be launching a certification and brand licensing program in 2025 to provide quality assurance to manufacturers and consumers for products that support Eclipsa Audio.”</p><p>Going further, later this spring, the companies are going to make a free Eclipsa Audio plugin for Avid Pro Tools Digital Audio Workstation to make the process of creating Eclipsa Audio files easier. After which, more average consumers might be able to experience the spatial audio experience across a wide range of devices and operating systems.</p>

<ul><li>Google to bring some HTC VIVE engineers on board to develop Android XR.</li><li>The search giant has already collaborated with Samsung and Qualcomm to bring reality headsets and glasses.</li><li>The company is now adding HTC’s expertise in the VR space by bringing in a strong technical team.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Last December, Google first introduced Android XR in partnership with Samsung and Qualcomm intending to bring Gemini-powered reality headsets and glasses.</p><p>Today (Jan 23), the search giant has announced (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/22/google-android-xr-htc-vive/">9to5Google</a>) that it is accelerating the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR platform</a> with a new agreement with HTC. It means the popular HTC VIVE engineering team, who are behind the VR space, will be joining hands with Google to create a headsets and glasses ecosystem under its Android XR platform, the company mentions in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/android-xr-htc-agreement/">announcement post</a>.</p>
<p>Google also acknowledges HTC’s “strong technical team with a proven track record in the VR space, ” and their collaboration in building the reality space, which the search giant is currently expediting after investing in XR for over a decade now.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vive.com/us/newsroom/2025-01-23/">HTC’s press release</a>, Google is paying the company a whopping $250 million to acquire certain members of the HTC XR team to join Google. This agreement is believed to “drive the growth” of the XR ecosystem altogether. “As part of the transaction, Google will receive a non-exclusive license for HTC’s XR intellectual property (IP),” the press note states.</p>

<p>Furthermore, HTC’s current commitment to delivering VIVE XR innovative solutions, including the VIVE Focus Vision, will remain unchanged. It means the existing product lines will be supported and developed without any interruption.</p><p>It isn’t the first time Google has acquired HTC employees for its in-house development of products. Back in 2017, Google and HTC announced a definitive agreement under which certain HTC mobile division employees were acquired to develop Pixel smartphones. HTC received $1.1 billion in cash as part of the agreement.</p><p>Regardless, the latest announcement comes after Samsung demonstrated its Android XR-powered mixed reality headset that comes under "Project Moohan” at Wednesday’s (Jan 22) Unpacked event, where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/icymi-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-biggest-announcements-and-reveals">company announced</a> the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a> series. The headset is believed to be available for the masses later this year, per the previous announcement.</p>

Obviously, there's still plenty of time before we can get anything like design renders, but with leaks around camera modules and battery tech surfacing, it's time to see what's in store for 2026. <br><br>Samsung is going to continue its usual release cadence, so the S26 series should make its debut sometime in Q1 2026. The latest information suggests Samsung is set to retain a trio of models — the Galaxy S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra — but with the S25 Edge slated to launch later this year, we'll have to wait and see how that device does and if Samsung decides to launch the model alongside the other phones next year. With that out of the way, here's what we know about the Galaxy S26.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s26-we-may-finally-get-a-new-design"><span>Samsung Galaxy S26: We may finally get a new design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xETzw2tvXYbiYMQtZhF9SV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-backs-all-colors-05" alt="All four colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xETzw2tvXYbiYMQtZhF9SV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung didn't really change the design this year, and the S25 and S25+ are identical to their predecessors. That was always going to be the case considering how little the design changed with the S24 series itself, and we're basically in the third year of the same design. <br><br>If anything, it's the S25 Ultra is the only device that is noticeably different to last year's model. Samsung went with flatter sides and rounded edges this time, and the device is thinner and lighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">S24 Ultra</a>, a big deal in and of itself. What I like is that it is narrower than last year; this was a problem on the S24 Ultra, so I'm glad to see Samsung rectifying that this time. <br><br>With the S26 series, Samsung is said to be overhauling the design. We don't know what the design will look like, and it is unlikely that Samsung will radically alter the overall aesthetic — the minimal design with individual rings around the cameras is distinctive to Galaxy devices, and the brand wouldn't want to make too many alternations to that style. That said, I wouldn't mind seeing better colors and materials, and a little added design flair on the Ultra model.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-is-likely-to-get-a-200mp-telephoto-lens"><span>Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra is likely to get a 200MP telephoto lens</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KqaJdPXEH9GVPTXc8CSRpT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro camera housing highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KqaJdPXEH9GVPTXc8CSRpT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> is the best camera you can buy today, and while it has a standout main camera, it's the 200MP telephoto that gives it a distinct advantage. The high-resolution lens takes outstanding portrait shots at 3x and detailed photos up to 30x, and it is one of my favorite things about the device. <br><br>Honor also used a 200MP telephoto lens in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>, but it isn't the same sensor as the X200 Pro. That said, it also takes terrific photos and portrait shots. It's clear that these massive imaging modules make a difference, and Honor has a nifty AI-assisted mode that cleans up photos, delivering clean shots at up to 100x. <br><br>Ironically, the camera sensors used on both of these phones are made by Samsung, and I don't really know why the brand doesn't use it on its phones instead. That could be changing in 2026, as a new leak suggests Samsung will include a 200MP telephoto lens on the S26 Ultra, giving the phone a considerable upgrade. <br><br>We'll have to wait and see if the phone uses the newer HP9 module (which is in the X200 Pro) or the HP3 that Honor went with, but it's good to see Samsung considering the module on its 2026 flagship.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-could-introduce-silicon-batteries-as-standard"><span>Samsung could introduce silicon batteries as standard</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wTCdYEecrNss5YoMsAnSr6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Galaxy-S25-back-holding-01" alt="Comparing the back of the Samsung Galaxy S25 with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wTCdYEecrNss5YoMsAnSr6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another area where Samsung didn't make any changes this year is battery tech, with the S25 series offering similar-sized batteries as their predecessors. With most Chinese phones now coming with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbide batteries</a> that have better durability and density, Samsung is on the backfoot. <br><br>That may change with the S26 series, as a recent leak out of Korea suggests Samsung is mulling a switch to silicon batteries next year. It could mean bigger batteries within the same chassis — just like the X200 Pro and other 2025 phones — and that's always a good thing. <br><br>I saw a leak that indicated Samsung will switch to 65W charging next year, and if anything, that sounds like a wishlist than credible information. While it would be great to see faster charging on Samsung's phones, the brand has been cautious in this regard, and I don't see that changing in 2026 — I'd love to be proven wrong though.</p>
<hr>
<p>We'll get many more details about the Galaxy S26 series over the coming months, and I'll regularly update this article as and when new leaks surface. With this year's models being iterative, there's increased attention on what Samsung is doing in 2026, and whether it will deliver meaningful upgrades.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-77">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Android 15 QPR2 Beta 3 is here, offering a preview of the significant improvements and new features arriving with the upcoming March Feature Drop.</li><li>A key highlight is the resolution of an issue that caused unexpected device restarts during phone calls.</li><li>As always, the update focuses on improving overall system performance and stability through various bug fixes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> QPR2 Beta 3, marking a big step toward the upcoming Pixel Feature Drop set for March. This update takes on a bunch of nagging issues across Pixel devices.</p><p>The latest release includes the January 2025 security patches and has build number BP11.241210.004, as per a post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1i6t88s/android_15_qpr2_beta_3_now_available/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>. It’s meant to smooth things out with bug fixes and performance boosts.</p><p>Eligible users can now get a sneak peek at the upgrades heading to their devices with this beta.</p><p>The latest beta is ready for a whole bunch of Pixel phones, including the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series and everything back to the Pixel 6. So, if you've got a Pixel 6, 7, 8, or 9, and you're feeling adventurous, you can give this beta a whirl.</p><p>While this update fixes a bunch of bugs, the big news is it stops those annoying random restarts when you're on a call.</p><p>Here's a rundown of some of the major fixes in this update:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed issues that could cause a device to restart when making a phone call. (Issue #379051274, Issue #390594506)</li><li>Fixed an issue where trying to resume an app from the app overview would return to the home screen instead. (Issue #385017194)</li><li>Fixed issues where the language picker menu (accessed by long-pressing the spacebar) changed the window, which caused the IME to hide in apps that had set their softInputMode to STATE_ALWAYS_HIDDEN. (Issue #388201594, Issue #386972825)</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused a clicking sound in the background while recording video. (Issue #385998260)</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused wireless charging to stop functioning in some cases. (Issue #379301921)</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause devices to crash after starting an exercise on a connected Wear OS device.</li><li>Fixed an issue with null pointer exceptions that sometimes caused the system UI to crash.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the Android Beta Feedback app to crash sometimes when submitting a bug report.</li><li>Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability, connectivity, and interactivity.</li></ul>
<p>For those already in the beta program, the update should pop up in your settings. Just head to <em>Settings</em> > <em>System</em> > <em>Software updates</em> > <em>System update</em> to check it out.</p><p>QPRs are like mini-Android updates that happen every few months. Instead of waiting for a huge Android version like 16, Google uses QPRs to sneak in new features, fix bugs, and generally make your phone smoother.</p><p>If you want to leave the Android 15 beta program, you'll have a chance when the March Feature Drop rolls around.</p>

There's agentic AI, a feature akin to Google Now called Now Brief, and better integration with Gemini out of the box among many others Samsung highlighted, but what you don't get this year is much in the way of upgraded hardware.</p>

<p>This isn't new either; last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> wasn't markedly different to its predecessor, and I didn't use the device that much as a result. I was holding out for Samsung to make considerable changes with this generation, but that isn't the case, and the S25 Ultra misses out on innovations that are now standard on its rivals. <br><br>The key omission is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbide battery tech</a>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> all utilize silicon batteries to deliver better density, so you get much bigger batteries without any difference in size; the OnePlus 13 is actually thinner and lighter than the OnePlus 12 while offering a battery that's 500mAh larger than last year. <br><br>Silicon batteries also hold up better in extreme cold weather, and come with better durability. The ability to slot in a bigger battery with increased durability is a game-changer, and most other manufacturers are taking full advantage of the tech — Xiaomi even offers it on the mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-14-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 14 Pro+</a>. But the S25 Ultra misses out on the feature, with the device featuring the same 5000mAh battery as last year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hCjsYM4hmtGBLzAxgkiFEk" name="top-down-view-home-screen-all-four-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2" alt="Top-down view of Home Screen on four Galaxy S25 Ultra colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hCjsYM4hmtGBLzAxgkiFEk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the charging situation. The S25 Ultra still uses the same 45W standard, and we don't get any upgrades this time. I started using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/baseus-nomos-140w-charging-station-review">Qi2 chargers</a> recently, and I figured they might be a good alternative with Samsung's latest phones, but the S25 Ultra is just Qi2 ready, and doesn't have the magnets in the chassis itself — you'll need to buy a case to be able to use the feature. <br><br>Samsung switched out the wide-angle lens on the device, and there's now a 50MP module that should take better photos. But the main and telephoto cameras are unchanged, and I can't help but feel that Samsung will lose even more ground in this area against devices like the X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro. <br><br>Chinese manufacturers are doing incredible things with phone cameras, rolling out massive sensors and delivering generational upgrades on a consistent basis. The X200 Pro gets a 200MP telephoto camera that takes phenomenal portraits at 3x, and Samsung just doesn't have an answer to that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CgrpzhMTVHkxgMn22SckDK" name="samsung-galaxy-25-camera-lenses" alt="The new Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra camera lenses at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CgrpzhMTVHkxgMn22SckDK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even the main camera on most Chinese phones is markedly better than what I used last year, and while the S25 Ultra should take better photos thanks to the changes to the ISP, I'm not sure it will dethrone Vivo, OPPO, and Honor anytime soon — I'll be putting that to the test once I get my hands on the device. <br><br>Similar to last year, most of the new features on the device center around AI. Every other phone manufacturer is getting on the AI bandwagon, and all phones I used in the last 18 months had some version of an AI utility. In each of these cases, I got the sense that the brands are shoehorning dubious AI features onto their devices just because it is the buzzword de jour. Samsung, however, is positioning Galaxy AI as the cornerstone of the S25 Ultra, and I'm not sure that's a winning strategy. <br><br>Don't get me wrong; I like the design changes Samsung introduced this year. The S25 Ultra has flatter sides with rounded edges, and it is thinner and lighter than its predecessor, which is good to see. Samsung also shrunk the bezels, accommodating a bigger 6.9-inch AMOLED panel without increasing the height. As a result, the S25 Ultra is easier to hold and use, and thanks to Gorilla Armor 2 protection at the front and back, it should have much better resistance against tumbles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bxdGWcyWrsjT4Ba4wqoujj" name="top-down-view-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-stacked-colors" alt="Top-down view of four different Galaxy S25 Ultra colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bxdGWcyWrsjT4Ba4wqoujj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the switch to Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite, the phone should be faster as well. Samsung once again worked closely with Qualcomm to customize the platform, and the overclocked chipset has decent gains over last year. But it wasn't like the S24 Ultra was short on power anyway, and whether you get any noticeable difference is something I'll need to wait and see until I get the phone. <br><br>Look, I'm not saying that the S25 Ultra is a bad phone — far from it. It's just disappointing that Samsung played it safe yet again, and the S25 Ultra isn't the best version of the phone it could make if it really wanted to do so. Samsung doesn't have any meaningful rivalry in North America, so it can get away without offering tangible upgrades to the camera or battery life. <br><br>While the OnePlus 13 is a much better showing this year, it doesn't have anywhere close to the same level of carrier backing as the S25 Ultra, making it a nonstarter in the region. Combine that with Samsung's generous trade-in incentives, and the S25 Ultra inevitably ends up being the default option if you want a high-end Android phone.</p>

Aside from these new phones, Samsung announced a host of AI features, a new chipset at the heart of the S25 series, and a surprise fourth variant of the Galaxy S25.</p><p>Here's a quick wrap of all that was 'Unpacked' today.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-s25-plus-and-s25-ultra-2">Samsung Galaxy S25, S25 Plus and S25 Ultra</h2>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch" target="_blank">The Galaxy S25 Series launches today</a> as a trio, with the top-end S25 Ultra, the middle-child S25 Plus, and the standard S25 device. When it comes to the core, all three devices are powered by a custom version of Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, which the chipmaker designed in collaboration with Samsung. The S25 lineup will receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-get">seven generations of OS upgrades</a> and security updates, the company says.</p><p>The devices get the new and upgraded OS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> with Android 15 OS out of the box. With One UI 7, users can expect seamless integration of AI on the phone.</p><p>When it comes to the design of these phones, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> gets a durable titanium build with smooth, rounded edges and thin bezels. It has a 6.9-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED  display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The Ultra also comes with a new 50MP ultrawide camera sensor — upgraded from the previous 12MP, along with a 200MP wide camera, another 50MP telephoto lens with a 5x zoom, and a 10 MP camera with a 3x zoom.</p><p>The phone will be available in four colorways: Titanium Silver Blue, Titanium Whitesilver, Titanium Gray, and Titanium Black, along with three unique colors: Titanium Pinkgold, Titanium Jetblack, and Titanium Jadegreen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9wZp7TveVphVErp7Ro927g" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-exclusive-samsung-colors-03" alt="The three Samsung.com exclusive colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9wZp7TveVphVErp7Ro927g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The three Samsung.com exclusive colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus</a> get a fairly similar design to their predecessors with more rounded edges, sporting a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a familiar 120Hz refresh rate. The S25 Plus has a sleek 6.7-inch QHD screen, while the standard model has a 6.2-inch FHD display. Both siblings get a major upgrade, with a new 50MP wide camera, a 12MP ultrawide camera, and a  10MP telephoto camera  that comes with 3x optical zoom.</p><p>The duo gets four new colorways: Navy, Icyblue, Mint, and Silver Shadow colors, plus exclusive colors like Blueblack, Coralred, and Pinkgold when ordered directly from Samsung's website.</p><p>When it comes to durability, all three phones have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-waterproof">IP68 dust and water resistance</a> certification and are compatible with Qi2 charging, albeit without built-in magnets. The S25 series retains its predecessor's price tags, with the S25 Ultra starting at $1,299, while the S25 and Plus models cost $799 and $999 respectively.</p>

<p>The much-needed collab between Samsung and Qualcomm brings us an 'Elite' chipset that powers the S25 series' AI capabilities. The company aims to bring you an assistant that is not only interactive but also intuitive, knowing what your next move could look like by tracking your daily activities.</p><p>To start, the home screen gets a new interactive bar dubbed the 'Now bar,' which highlights your personalized recommendations and tracks updates. Meanwhile, the 'Now Brief' is another new interactive widget that can provide a snapshot of your day.</p><p>"With a single glance at your phone, you'll know when a match is on and be able to follow live with scores and more," Google said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/google-ai-samsung-galaxy-s25/">in a blog post</a> describing changes coming to Android on Samsung's latest phones. "If you want to dive deeper, simply tap the card to get perspectives, stats, and news on Google Search."</p>

The company states this expansion will apply to "trending images," "unique objects," and more. Once highlighted,  Circle to Search displays quick facts, including links to what the user has searched for. For instance, if you look for a weird-looking dessert, Search will explain what it is and where it comes from.</p><p>Something else that's new with Gemini on the Galaxy S25 is the ability to interact with apps using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">Agentic AI</a>. Summon Gemini by holding the side button; the AI will then interact with the apps on your Samsung phone. You can also ask Gemini Live to review your photos, suggest any edits, and other such interactions.</p><p>The company reiterated that all the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features are available across the entire Galaxy S25 lineup, so even if you get the basic mode, you get it packed with all the AI features.</p>

<p>The next thing Samsung showed off today was more on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> and how it would utilize the Android platform for its upcoming mixed-reality headset. Samsung's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>" Android XR-powered headset is also on the show floor at Unpacked. However, folks attending the event were not allowed to try it on as yet. That said, this was the first time they've publicly shown off the headset like this, giving viewers a good idea of what's in store with this project.</p><p>We expect the headset to have motion controller support like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a>, but for now, we aren't sure when this headset is likely to be released or whether it will come with the controller within the box.</p>

<p>While we thought we'd seen it all, Samsung threw us a curveball, and If you turned off the livestream to the Unpacked event too soon, you'd have missed a good, long look at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge.</p><p>Samsung teased a fourth addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">S25 series</a>— what we thought could be the Galaxy S25 Slim, now has a new name.</p><p>The device looks sleek, possibly with an end-to-end screen (going by its name) and a solid design. The video also showed us the components of the device as a part of the teaser, but not much else.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge appeared quite thin and lightweight. The S25 Edge seems to have two cameras at the back and likely a small selfie camera at the front. In terms of design, the phone, much like the S25 series, has rounded edges and extremely thin bezels.</p><p>We don't have the full specs yet, as Samsung revealed next to nothing about the phone, including how thin it actually is. It could carry the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-galaxy-s25-live-blog">S25 series that launched today</a>, another key fact that has yet to be revealed. We also don't know when Samsung plans to release the phone; however, there has been some chatter that it could come out as soon as April or May of this year.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung and Google mentioned something we haven't heard yet when it comes to smartphones during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-galaxy-s25-live-blog">Galaxy Unpacked 2025</a> presentation: Agentic AI.</p><p>You might have missed it because they didn't say anything more about it except to say the name, but they talked a lot about what it should be able to do inside the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25</a> phones. It plays a big part in all the newer, smarter Galaxy AI stuff.</p>
<p>Agentic AI is a new technology, but it's not brand-new cutting-edge stuff. It's been around for a minute and is currently running inside factories and manufacturing plants that use a lot of automation.</p><p>What it is sounds kind of boring: probabilistic tech that's adaptable to changing environments and events. But it's not boring! This means it's a mix of LLMs, machine learning, and automation (either software or hardware) that can create semi-autonomous AI, which will analyze data, set goals on the fly, and take the appropriate action to meet the goals it set for itself.</p><p>This sounds like a fresh step towards the scary humanization of AI, but we're not quite there. Yet. But it can create an AI agent that seems more like a person when you interact with it and can better serve your needs, within boundaries, of course.</p>

<p>Samsung mentioned that the new AI tools and features are available because of a new specialized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-expands-snapdragon-8-elite-lineup-with-new-7-core-variant">Snapdragon chip</a> with an ultra-powerful NPU (Neural Processing Unit). That's a big part of it all.</p><p>Another thing mentioned was a knowledge graph built on the things you do and where, when, and how you do them. Both are used to bring Agentic AI to life inside a tiny smartphone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="P83orc3XuyZYwGvByiZnAm" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-personal-data-engine-knowledge-graph" alt="Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P83orc3XuyZYwGvByiZnAm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Consider how Agentic AI works in a factory since it's already in place there. Someone lets the software know what they need, say 20,000 widgets ready and boxed for shipping in five days.</p><p>Workers program individual automation lines that perform the various jobs needed to build a widget. This is like the data you add to your own knowledge graph on your phone — you're telling the software the recipe <em>and</em> the ingredients for the end result.</p><p>Agentic AI oversees the whole operation. It knows how many widgets need to be finished and when they are needed, so it adjusts individual parameters to meet the goal in the most efficient way. If one line making a part is down for maintenance, it can ramp up the capability of another line that makes the same part until the maintenance is complete, for example. If the packaging line goes down, it can stop whatever needs to stop so it doesn't overwhelm it while it's being serviced.</p><p>These are all routine tasks, but the software was programmed to watch them, analyze the data it gets, and make informed decisions based on it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oWS5zUYGx3KDY3o38JfemX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-S25-Plus-and-S25-display-01" alt="Comparing the sizes and shapes of the displays on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, and Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oWS5zUYGx3KDY3o38JfemX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On your phone, Agentic AI has all the data from everything you do with your devices in one place. When you ask the AI for something, say a photo of a sunset at Nags Head on July 4, or how much you need to run every day to burn off a few more calories, it rifles through that data and analyzes what it finds.</p><p>It then decides what data is more useful, what data shouldn't be used at all, and which data is the most important to provide you with what you requested. If it sees 100 photos of Nags Head, 1,300 photos taken on July 4, and 71 photos of sunsets it cross-checks the data to see if any of it comes from the same photo. If it does, that's what it shows you. If it doesn't, it returns whatever it was programmed to respond with when there is no answer.</p><p>This works autonomously so you can get a notification telling you to leave for work 20 minutes early because there is an accident on your normal route and you need to go a different way. And bring an umbrella even though it looks sunny right now; it will rain later this afternoon. You can also get your coffee here because the Dunkin you normally stop at isn't on your new route.</p><p>It remains to be seen how well this new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> will work. On the surface, it really doesn't seem so different than the things our phones can already do for us or tell us. But the technology is a big step up, and a lot more will be possible once some bright engineer dreams of doing it.</p>

<p>Screen protectors can be tricky when purchasing. Depending on your phone's in-screen fingerprint reader and the thickness of the screen guard itself, you may or may not have a positive experience. That is why you should only invest in the best Samsung Galaxy S25 screen protectors.</p><p>The LK 2 Pack Samsung Galaxy S25 Screen Protector set proves that you don't need to spend a lot to get good quality protection for your S25's display. Many of the editors at Android Central have used this brand and always found it satisfactory. LK includes everything you could need for an at-home installation, which makes this an even better deal at $15.</p><p>Searching for big-name brands instead? Both Spigen and Dbrand have excellent reputations. While Spigen's GlasTR EZ Fit Screen Protector is quite affordable, the Prism 2.0 Screen Protector from Dbrand is costly. Unless you have an awful time of it putting on the screen protector yourself, the Spigen GlasTR EZ Fit Screen Protector kit should serve you and your Galaxy S25 well.</p><p>After you've picked out a decent screen guard for your phone, be sure to grab one or two of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">best Samsung Galaxy S25 cases</a> to protect its body as well.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra may have just been announced a few hours ago, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">our hands-on review</a> showcases a powerful device with a new look, upgraded hardware, and some of the most advanced AI features found on any smartphone to date. The phone boasts ridiculously-fast performance thanks to the customized Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, plus you get a stunning 6.9-inch AMOLED display, a lighter construction than its predecessor, and a guaranteed seven years of OS/security upgrades, straight out of the box. </p><p>Now, of course, not everything is perfect with the S25 Ultra. There&apos;s been no significant improvement to the Ultra&apos;s charging speeds, the price is still too high, and if you don&apos;t care about AI features, you&apos;d probably be better off going with a more-affordable Android flagship, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. But if you like to be on the cutting edge of smartphone technology and you can get a good deal, the Galaxy S25 Ultra might just be the premium device for you.</p>

<h2 id="it-s-a-tough-call-to-make-but-you-can-only-have-one-shade-of-the-s25-or-s25-plus-2">It's a tough call to make, but you can only have one shade of the S25 or S25 Plus</h2>
<p>There are three main color palettes to consider when choosing which Samsung Galaxy S25 color to buy. Both the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus come in B&W hues, blues and greens, as well as the warmer set of pinks and reds. Start your decision-making process by eliminating the group of colors that you don't like.</p><p>For example, you might find grayscale monochromes like Silver Shadow and Blueblack boring. Or perhaps those are the only colors that appeal to you. Listen to your gut. Once you've settled that, you can zero in on which shade of the S25 or S25 Plus calls to you the most.</p><p>Of course, you could feel completely overwhelmed and not know what to pick at all. If a recommendation is all you want, I highly suggest Coralred or Silver Shadow. These are the two most attractive colorways of the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus in my opinion. If you're worried about dirtying the light silvery option or muddying the brighter red hue, just get a very high-quality clear case with anti-yellowing properties. Any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">best Galaxy S25 cases</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-cases">Galaxy S25 Plus cases</a> will offer this.</p><p>Bear in mind that not all colors are available everywhere. If you opt for the vivacious Coralred for instance, you can only buy it online. Your choice might change depending on the mode of purchase, so be mindful of the online exclusive colors.</p>

<h2 id="let-s-get-down-to-business-and-decide-which-s25-ultra-shade-you-should-buy-2">Let's get down to business and decide which S25 Ultra shade you should buy</h2>
<p>Now that you've seen all the retail and online exclusive colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, you'll have a good idea of what stood out to you and what appalled you. If any single color didn't immediately catch your attention, I'm here to help.</p><p>Black is always the safest shade to buy when getting anything. Whether it's a phone or a car, a laptop or a washing machine, black never disappoints. If you don't like anything Samsung has to offer, just get the Titanium Black option. The great thing about this year's Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra colors is that there are two blacks, so if you don't like the titanium frame, you can always buy the online exclusive Titanium Jetblack.</p><p>Not shy of making a statement? Or perhaps you want to grab attention. If you're one of the brave and the bold, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is a lovely sight in Titanium Silverblue. It's soothing to look at and the silver accents elevate the entire colorway.</p><p>This one's a personal favorite but I adore the Titanium Jadegreen shade as well. Green isn't for everyone, but this light olive tint is marvelous. It's the color I would buy. If you like plants and shrubbery like myself, you'll love it too!</p><p>If all else fails to please you, pick any of the black options, slap on a phone cover and call it a day. There are some really cool <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra cases</a> available that can easily revamp this boring metal-and-glass brick of a device.</p>

<ul><li>Netflix posted its Q4 2024 revenue report, which states the company had a quarter fit for the record books with a 16% YoY growth to $10.2 billion.</li><li>The key point of this report is Netflix's plans to increase prices in the U.S., Canada, and more, bringing a "popular" plan to $17.99 monthly.</li><li>Netflix's Q4 2023 was also a "record-breaking" quarter and the company was prepared to raise prices shortly after that, too.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Netflix is delivering its typical end-of-quarter overview, giving us a look at how 2024 ended and what the future holds.</p><p>Netflix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">recently published</a> its Q4 revenue report and highlights that this past quarter was one for the record books (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2025-01-21/netflix-posts-record-quarter-thanks-to-live-sports-squid-game">Bloomberg</a>). The company states that its revenue had grown by 16% YoY (year over year), assisted by "19M paid net adds." It adds that its operating income rose by 52% YoY and that it finished 2024 with 302M subscribers.</p><p>The Q4 report says its performance in the previous quarter "outperformed" expectations. However, the folks at Bloomberg notes one key statement during the earnings call: prices are set to rise.</p><p>Despite such a record-breaking qurater for Netflix, the company is reportedly preparing to increase the price of its "most popular U.S. plan" by $2.50. The publication states the price of this plan — which could be the Standard Plan — will jump to $17.99 per month.</p><p>This reported price increase is apparently slated for the U.S., Canada, Argentina, and Portugal.</p><p>Reports adds that the company is also looking to increase the price of the "cheaper ad-supported" plan, too.</p><p>In its Q4 file, Netflix states it has factored in this planned pricing increase in the aforementioned countries in its 2025 outlook. The company says it's looking to maintain "healthy growth" in the new year and projects anywhere between $43.5 and 44.5 billion in generated revenue. Netflix estimates that its operating margin will also rise to 29%. It states that these numbers are the result of "improved business fundamentals," its record-breaking Q4 2024 numbers, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.</p><p>Netflix is also interested in developing more live programming and games in 2025. The fight between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, as well as its Christmas Day NFL games were among the highlights. The report states that the football games streamed on Christmas were two of the "most streamed" games in NFL history.</p>

<p>Netflix has had a long history of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-raises-prices-basic-premium-plans">price hikes</a> for several of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-reportedly-prepares-another-price-increase">its subscriber plans</a> — and for a few different countries. So, it feels like we're just living in a time loop, by this point. Regardless, following Netflix's other "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-teases-price-hike-2024-plan">record quarter</a>" (Q4 2023), the company announced a price increase was inevitable for its users. The company increased the price of its Standard plan before, which brought it to $15.50, but that was because it phased out the old "Basic" plan.</p><p>Netflix also has the cheaper, ad-supported plan, which is seemingly where the company was to push people. At the time, Netflix said, "Scaling our ads business represents an opportunity to tap into significant new revenue and profit pools over the medium to longer term."</p><p>That report shed light on how much Netflix spent for its WWE Raw streaming program: $5 billion over a 10-year period, beginning in 2025. Even then, it felt like that money had to come from somewhere.</p><p>Since it looks like we're set for another definite price increase, all we're left with is the waiting room until it happens.</p>

<hr>
<p>Like many of you, I was watching along as Samsung introduced the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25</a> series. As if I weren't excited enough about all of the upcoming Galaxy AI and Gemini features on the way, Samsung showed off an outlined render of a tri-fold foldable phone.</p><p>The graphic that was shown, was essentially a timeline of various devices, with the Android XR headset found right in the middle. However, to the left of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a> outline, was both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ill-admit-it-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-better-than-i-imagined">Galaxy Z Fold</a> as we know it today and an outline of the tri-fold folding phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA" name="samsung-unpacked-android-xr-triple-fold" alt="Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has been rumored to be working on a tri-fold for some time now. Prototypes of such devices have been shown off at various trade shows, including CES 2025, where the Samsung Display booth actually had two concept devices on display. One of which can be folded in upon itself, and unfolds as if you were opening a book.</p><p>The other was a tri-fold folding phone that works similarly to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-reaction-is-a-tri-fold-phone-necessary">Huawei Mate XT</a> that was released in 2024. The different screens are layered on top of one another, offering the ability to use just two of the three panels at once, if you wanted to.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Hf5aoDyaQK5sonvTkf2Wib" name="huawei-mate-xt-tri-fold-screen-unfolded.jpeg" alt="The Huawei Mate XT tri-fold offers a 10-2.inch display experience." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hf5aoDyaQK5sonvTkf2Wib.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1406" height="791" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just earlier this week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-flagship-foldable-production-rumors">a rumor surfaced</a> suggesting that Samsung's tri-fold will "feature a 9.9 to 10-inch screen when unfolded." Unfortunately, that same report claims that "roughly 200,000 units" will be produced for consumers. It sure sounds like we're in store for another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">Galaxy Z Fold SE</a> situation, but hopefully, that won't be the case.</p><p>As for when the tri-fold could make its debut, expectations are that production will begin in Q2 2025, putting it sometime between April and June. What will be interesting to see is whether this tri-fold phone will at least be shown off alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Flip 7</a>. Those devices are expected to arrive sometime this summer, potentially as early as July.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1131px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hXWgyEfPvQgs4vgXNzLxwM" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-promo-render.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hXWgyEfPvQgs4vgXNzLxwM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1131" height="636" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While slipping the tri-fold in there came as a surprise, Samsung just completely ignored it. At the time when the graphic was shown, the presentation was focused on Android XR, Project Moohan, and how AI will be integrated into the platform.</p><p>After feeling as though the Galaxy Z Fold series has become a bit stale, this could be the spark that Samsung needs to reinvigorate itself and the foldable form factor. Now it's just a matter of playing the "wait and see" game until some type of formal announcement is made.</p>

<ul><li>Meta detailed a new cross-posting feature arriving for WhatsApp via its addition to the Account Center.</li><li>Users can decide to post their WhatsApp Status to Instagram or Facebook Stories (or both) when linked to the Account Center.</li><li>Meta adds that users will retain their privacy and security through E2EE for messages and calls when linked.</li><li>Late last year, WhatsApp picked up better cross-platform support and a username option for new contacts.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta is detailing a new feature for its messaging service, WhatsApp, that better connects it with the rest of its ecosystem.</p><p>As highlighted in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/whatsapp-joins-accounts-center/">blog post</a>, Meta states it has started rolling out an Account Center option for WhatsApp accounts. Your WhatsApp profile is "off by default," meaning users will have the choice of adding it if they'd like. The major point of this addition is that users — once added to Account Center — can "reshare" updates from WhatsApp Status to their Instagram and Facebook Stories.</p><p>Meta states its delivering this cross-posting option in the menu when creating a WhatsApp Status. Users don't have to cross-post to <em>both </em>platforms if they don't want to. The sub-menu will feature small toggleable options for Instagram and Facebook for quick decisions when updating your Status.</p><p>To help alleviate our privacy concerns, Meta states that your calls and messages will remain end-to-end encrypted if added to the Account Center.</p><p>Additionally, WhatsApp's availability in Meta's Account Center is beginning to hit users globally. It will take some time to appear for everywhere, but once it does, users will find the option in the app's settings.</p>

<p>As the feature rolls out, Meta teased additional features that users can expect down the road, like AI Stickers and a centralized hub for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-imagine-me-selfie-all-platforms">Imagine Me</a> products. Ther are also plans to manage all of your avatars without having to bounce between places in the app.</p><p>Meta's Imagine Me launched in mid-July last year, leveraging the company's generative AI software to turn you into something entirely different. Users can kickstart the AI by saying "Imagine me..." followed by whatever you'd like. You can turn yourself into a tennis player, an astronaut, or maybe a DJ. When messaging Meta AI, the announcement stated that users can type "change" to make any alterations they see fit.</p><p>In other news, WhatsApp picked up a huge update late last year, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-likely-to-have-userames-soon">brought in usernames</a>. The idea of a username is meant to replace phone numbers when saving new contacts. More importantly, the update also let users add and manage contacts through WhatsApp on the Web and the Windows platform in cojunction with their Android phone/tablet.</p>

<hr>
<p>While we were hoping to see the new Samsung XR Glasses or another ring-sized surprise, Samsung did us one better! If you turned off the livestream to the Unpacked event too soon, you'd likely have missed what Samsung had in store for us at the very end.</p><p>At the tail end of its Unpacked event, Samsung teased a fourth addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">S25 series</a>—the Galaxy S25 Edge. What we thought could be the Galaxy S25 Slim, now has a new name.</p><p>We got a good, long, look at the device that looks sleek, possibly with an end-to-end screen (going by its name) and a solid processing system. The video also showed us the components of the device as a part of the teaser.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9fo8EsBntiCcnYkLJPARyh" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-parts-teaser" alt="Components for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge on stage at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9fo8EsBntiCcnYkLJPARyh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Central's Michael Hicks ,who is on the ground at the event, got a good look at the phone. The Galaxy S25 Edge, which is showcased in a silver/grey colorway, seems to be hung by a thin metal stand of sorts connected by a clip, possibly hinting at how light weight this phone could be. The S25 Edge seems to have two cameras at the back and likely a small selfie camera at the front. In terms of design, the phone, much like the S25 series has rounded edges and extremely thin bezels.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a premium Android device, you may think that brands like Samsung and Google are the only options in town. But they aren’t. When you compare the Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13R, you might actually be surprised at how close they are to one another. There’s a compelling reason to look beyond what’s most familiar to you. Here, I’ll compare these two phones so you can make an informed decision versus just going with what you already know.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rMMGxv3UpVvjtTL2TcQNvf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-display-morning-brief-holding-01" alt="Morning Brief on the Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rMMGxv3UpVvjtTL2TcQNvf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 is the latest entry-level phone in the brand’s line. Available in Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow. It has a 6.2-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate.</p><p>With a screen made of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, the frame is constructed or Armor Aluminum, so the phone is durable. It’s also IP68 rated to protect it against dust and water.</p><p>Equipped with a 4,000mAh battery, it supports Super Fast Charging, Fast Wireless Charging 2.0, and Wireless PowerShare.</p><p>The phone comes with either 128GB or 256GB storage. Since this is not expandable, you’ll want to choose the larger option, which costs a bit more. And if you tend to download a lot of apps and games and shoot lots of photo and video, you’ll probably have to factor cloud storage into the cost, or offload content to a separate drive when it gets full.</p><p>Out of the box with Android 15 and Samsung One UI 7, the phone is supported for seven OS upgrades and seven years of security updates. You get an ultrasonic fingerprint reader and face recognition for security.</p>

<p>One of two new phones OnePlus just launched, the OnePlus 13R is the more affordable, scaled down variant, similarly to how the Samsung Galaxy S25 is the entry option in its new line. The phone, which Harish Jonnalagadda calls “the definitive value flagship of 2025” in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">his review</a>, comes in Nebula Noir or Astral Trail with a large 6.78-inch Aqua Touch 2.0 display. This refers to the ability to comfortably use the screen even if your hands are wet from things like drops of rain or snowflakes. This phone also has a feature called Glove Mode that allows you to manipulate the screen while wearing thin gloves.</p><p>The screen supports a 1-120Hz dynamic refresh and offers 2,780 x 1,264 pixels with 1,600 nits brightness and 4,500 nits peak brightness. Jonnalagadda isn’t a fan of the boxier design, finding that the sides dig into his palm. But he likes the clean, camera housing and the sturdier feel when compared to last year’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>.</p><p>Speaking of which, the phone only has an IP65 rating, which isn’t quite as high as the Samsung Galaxy S25, but still protects it against some dust and water exposure. The screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass GG7i.</p><p>OnePlus phones are known to have incredible battery life and the OnePlus 13R is no exception. It has a massive 6,000mAh battery that supports 55W SUPERVOOC charging, up to 80W with a OnePlus SUPERVOOC dual-port GaN power adapter or up to 100W with a OnePlus dual-port power adapter. Bottom line: not only does this phone last for days, you can plug it in and recharge it to full in the same time it takes you to grab a Starbucks coffee. Jonnalagadda says he got about two days per charge, a day and-a-half with heavy use, but he found that it took longer to charge than the OnePlus 13.</p><p>You’ll only get 256GB storage, a bummer given how much this phone can do so. So, consider a cloud storage platform or a means to offload images and other content. Otherwise, you may have to keep your downloads tight to just the most important apps, games, and other content you need.</p><p>The phone comes loaded with Android 15 alongside OnePlus’ own OxygenOS 15 OS for a smart, intuitive, snappy experience. You’ll get an optical fingerprint sensor, though Jonnalagadda isn’t a fan of its positioning low on the screen, along with face unlock NFC, and Bluetooth 5.4.</p><p>OnePlus supports the phone for four years of Android updates and six years of security updates, through 2031. This isn’t quite as long as with the Samsung Galaxy S25. But considering the much lower starting price, you might be OK with that.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-oneplus-13r-features-and-functions-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13R: Features and functions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PqTEpFWqVMxFeKFNJjbfvF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-back-mint-holding-01" alt="The back of the Mint Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PqTEpFWqVMxFeKFNJjbfvF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 comes loaded with the new Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor, impressive as this is the same you’ll find in the top-line <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> model as well as the larger Galaxy S25+ variant. This processor is smoother, faster, and better able to accommodate all the new AI features of the phone, including on-device processing so you don’t have to rely on cloud connectivity.</p><p>With 12GB RAM, stand out features include not only Android 15 but also Samsung’s One UI 7. This affords lots of Galaxy AI features, like cross-app action with AI Agent: long-press the power button and Gemini instantly opens app with native app integration, regardless of what you’re doing at the moment and what app you’re in. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">his hands-on</a>, Nicholas Sutrich loved trying out this feature and found that it worked well: he was even able to search for specific recipes he wanted in an hour-long YouTube video.</p><p>There are also features like the Now Brief that shows you sleep, weather, and schedule data thanks to AI-powered insights. Multimodal Search can be used to search in various ways, including even humming a song to get help identifying it by name and artist.</p><p>Circle to Search has been enhanced, now able to recognize phone numbers and e-mail addresses to automatically call someone or open a messaging window, as well as URLs to open a web page. The phone also boasts better natural language understanding and can better understand context of requests.</p><p>This phone has an improved cooling system, something multitaskers, content creators, and especially gamers will appreciate. Overall, Sutrich says you’ll notice huge speed boosts with this phone, especially when compared to older models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Samsung Galaxy S23</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GPTJNJJdmJjbQrreigg8Yo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GPTJNJJdmJjbQrreigg8Yo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R has its share of AI features as well, thanks to Android 15, Google and Gemini integration, and its own OxygenOS 15 AI functions. These include features like intelligent search for blazing through files, notes, and photos quickly and efficiently, AI Notes, and more. “The interface is fast and doesn’t have any slowdowns or bugs,” says Jonnalagadda, who calls it “refreshing to be able to say that about a new version of the OxygenOS.” He loves the customizability options as well, and the various lock screen styling options.</p><p>Running on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, the OnePlus 13R might not be as snappy as the Samsung Galaxy S25 based on specs alone, but the phone will more than suffice for most users. Jonnalagadda did not encounter any gaming challenges at all while playing various titles. Combined with the 12GB RAM, you get an impressive user experience for everything from content creation to multitasking, video watching, and gaming.</p><p>Gamers will love the PUBG Mobile gaming experience that leverages the 120 frames-per-second gameplay capabilities. The phone also has plenty of AI features like Circle to Search, just as the Samsung Galaxy S25 does.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-oneplus-13r-the-camera-experience-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13R: The camera experience</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="42zoFP7EDYb3bxqECmZK7U" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-camera-viewfinder-01" alt="The camera viewfinder on a Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/42zoFP7EDYb3bxqECmZK7U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What about the cameras? The Samsung Galaxy S25 has a 50MP wide AF OIS main camera along with a 12MP ultra-wide camera, 10MP 3x tele AI OIS camera, 30x Space Zoom, and 12MP wide AF front camera.</p><p>You can enjoy features like the ProVisual Engine, HDR Portraits, Selfie AI ISP, Nightography, and more. There’s also the typical photo editing features you were able to enjoy with the Samsung Galaxy S24 along with new ones like improved Audio Eraser for removing background noises and isolating sounds in videos. This feature, Sutrich notes, works on-device, and is super-fast and effective. Auto Trim even lets you remove certain words (think “ums” and “ahs”) or use AI to intelligently remove sound bites that aren’t necessary.</p><p>We’ll need more time to play around with the cameras in the Samsung Galaxy S25 to provide more feedback on their pluses and minuses.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qEK3Wim66oAJaiGzVToLXo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qEK3Wim66oAJaiGzVToLXo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the OnePlus 13R, it has a similar 50MP wide main camera, 8MP ultra-wide, 50MP telephoto with 2x optical zoom, and 16MP front camera. Most notably, it uses a Sony LYT-700 imaging sensor for the main camera, and the results show. You get stunning images of all kinds, including great motion, detail when zooming, and more.</p><p>There are unique photo editing features, too, that let you do things like remove distracting options (something you can do in the Samsung Galaxy S25 as well), unblur photos (also in the Galaxy S25), and even remove or reduce reflections in images.</p><p>Jonnalagadda found that images he took with the OnePlus 13R were just as good as ones with the OnePlus 13 suggesting that you aren’t downgrading any camera-related functions if you opt for this more affordable option versus its more premium sister device. He did admit, however, that you don’t get the same level of vibrancy and details with photos when using the wide-angle lens. He also noticed some visible noise when snapping photos in low-light scenarios.</p>

<p>It’s decision time! Years ago, we might have had a tough time recommending anything as one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> beyond Samsung Galaxy devices, along with a few other notable brands. But the Android space has been heating up of late, and some of those brands you might not be as familiar with are delivering incredible devices. That’s precisely why we’re making the comparison between the Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13R.</p><p>And we can confidently say that you might actually be better off with the OnePlus 13R. Not only is it significantly cheaper, it’s also a premium phone with cameras that match or even exceed the Galaxy S25. It has incredible battery life, a bright and bold screen, and a fast processor that can keep up with most anything you throw at it.</p><p>If you wanted to step up, even going with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> could be a better option since it sells for about the same price. What’s odd is that as you move up the line to the Samsung Galaxy S25+ and even Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, there’s still no truly compelling reason to get one of those phones instead of OnePlus’ latest entry. Considering the OnePlus 13 is bafflingly durable with both an IP68 and IP69 rating, it’s worth it for that price alone. But it’s also a darned good phone.</p><p>Back to the core two devices at hand: if you’re looking for affordable premium and deciding between the Samsung Galaxy S25 and OnePlus 13R, I’d actually suggest forking out a bit more and going with the OnePlus 13. You’ll still be paying the same you would for the Samsung Galaxy S25 and getting a more durable phone with a much bigger battery, Sony cameras, and a similar set of AI features, including some amazing photo editing ones.</p>

Sure, these phones are materially better than last year's and offer more features and better hardware, but are they $800 or more better? For some people, that answer is definitively a <strong>no</strong>.</p><p>If you're coming from an older Samsung Galaxy device — that largely means a Galaxy S22 or older — upgrading to a Galaxy S25 makes a lot of sense. It's a huge upgrade from previous generations and adds a ton of new features older hardware simply cannot support. Upgrading to a Galaxy S25 from a Galaxy S24 doesn't make as much sense, though.</p>

<p>If you're using a Samsung Galaxy S24 right now, there are almost no reasons to upgrade to the Galaxy S25. Let's break it down by model.</p><p>Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24 owners considering upgrading to a Galaxy S25 of the same model will see a bump in performance for everything they do. The Galaxy S24 isn't exactly a slow phone and won't feel "old" any time soon, but the new processor in the Galaxy S25 is 30-40% faster depending on what you do.</p><p>Other than that, don't expect to see much that's different. Most Galaxy S24 models already have 12GB of RAM — only a few smaller Galaxy S24 models shipped with 8GB of RAM — and while the Galaxy S25 has a bunch of nifty new AI features, they'll almost certainly make their way to the Galaxy S24 series when the One UI 7 update is released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">in a few weeks</a>.</p><p>Samsung didn't change the battery size, make the charging faster, or swap out the cameras for something new or different, so most of your daily experience won't be different between these two generations of Galaxy phones.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra sees the biggest year-over-year changes, but they might not appeal to everyone.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Galaxy S24 Ultra owners will see a few more changes when moving to a Galaxy S25 Ultra, but you might not like most of them. Samsung has ditched the curved sides in favor of completely flat side rails, while it chose round corners instead of square ones. That gives the Galaxy S25 Ultra a completely different look and feel compared to the Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>In addition to that, the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen no longer supports Air Commands or Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity. That means the Galaxy S25 Ultra doesn't allow you to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-first-things-to-do#section-taking-photos-with-your-s-pen-s24-ultra">S Pen as a remote camera shutter</a>, among other things.</p><p>You will get a boost in performance thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor inside the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Additionally, rumor has it that Samsung may have fixed some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultra-needs-to-fix-four-major-s24-ultra-display-problems">Galaxy S24 Ultra display complaints</a>. We haven't confirmed this yet but will do so as soon as we have review units.</p><p>Samsung also upgraded the ultrawide angle camera on the back of the Galaxy S25 Ultra to a 50MP sensor from a 12MP sensor on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. That will result in better quality ultrawide photos as well as much higher quality macro shots since the same camera captures both types of photos.</p><p>Samsung also added several new camera features like Galaxy LOG and Nightography Video which probably won't come to the Galaxy S24 Ultra. We'll have to wait and see what's in the final One UI 7 update but Samsung hasn't confirmed these features yet.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 series sports a 30-40% performance boost over the Galaxy S24, making the Galaxy S25 series the fastest mobile phones on the market. Last year's Galaxy S24 delivered a roughly 30% performance improvement over the Galaxy S23, while the Galaxy S23 was about a 40% performance boost over the Galaxy S22.</p><p>All that to say, if you're coming from a Galaxy S22 or older, a Galaxy S25 of any size is going to feel like a near-revolutionary improvement in speed and overall performance.</p><p>In addition, most Galaxy S21, S22, and S23 phones offered 8GB of RAM while the Galaxy S25 family packs 50% more. Anyone who multitasks regularly will see a huge difference in performance, and this additional RAM enables a host of cutting-edge new AI features that you're sure to love.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Brighter, bolder displays and stronger construction mean these will last a long time.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The displays have all seen big upticks in brightness, clarity, and several other features that can also be seen as improvements. Samsung doubled the PWM rate of its phones last year, making these phones more eye-friendly than your older Galaxy phone in some ways. They're still not as good as most other Android brands these days, so if you're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">sensitive to PWM dimming</a> you'll want to look elsewhere like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>Samsung's build quality has improved even more since the Galaxy S23 and older, with phones sporting more robust metal frames and glass that's stronger and more scratch-resistant than ever. The Galaxy S25 Ultra packs a titanium frame, which is both more scratch-resistant and stronger, all while reducing the weight over aluminum.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 family features completely flat front and back glass which makes finding a screen protector easier in some cases, although you'll want to follow our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-screen-protectors">best Galaxy S25 screen protector</a> guide to ensure you find one that works with the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor under the glass.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy S25's One UI 7 isn't just packed with features, it also comes with a seven-year software update promise.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 family launches with Android 15 and One UI 7 which sports a different look and feel compared to previous versions of Samsung's operating system. New features like a vertical app drawer and expanded quick toggles UI make One UI better than ever. Even that terrible old multitasking UI design has been given a fresh coat of paint, so it's easier and faster than ever to switch between running apps.</p><p>The Galaxy S25's new processor and expanded RAM enable great new AI features like AI Select, Now Brief, and AI Agents. Unlike some of the niche Galaxy AI features from last year, many of these new features are ones you'll actually find yourself using from day to day.</p><p>Now Brief will give you a Morning Brief and an Evening Brief, which includes daily information summaries and hidden features that you might not have known about. It's easily accessible via the Now Bar, which appears on the bottom of your home screen and in the status bar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="TnSftznBShisVRkjYUY3S5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-display-lock-screen-01" alt="Customizing the lock screen in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnSftznBShisVRkjYUY3S5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AI Select gives the old Smart Select tool a significant upgrade by giving you smart, context-sensitive actions when you circle something on your screen. That includes easy text extraction from images, generative edit suggestions, creating GIFs from videos, and lots more.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>New AI features take the frustration out of common tasks by giving you smart, context-sensitive actions by just circling things on the screen.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>AI Agents can be found by pressing and holding the power button which will now display a new Gemini UI in addition to context-sensitive buttons. When you're watching a YouTube video, for instance, a button will appear to summarize the video for quick reference. That can be nice when you <em>just want the dang recipe</em> and don't feel like sitting through all the "like and subcribe" fluff that some videos have.</p><p>Camera and battery life improvements over the years have added up to a really big deal. While the physical battery size may not be much different from your old phone, newer, more efficient processors and better software mean battery life should be better on the Galaxy S25 than your old Galaxy phone.</p><p>And the cameras are also guaranteed to be better than whatever older Galaxy phone you're coming from thanks to notable improvements in sensors, lens quality, and new processors with AI power that understand what's being captured and can enhance it in new and important ways.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung guarantees seven years of software updates with every Galaxy S25. That means you won't have to consider upgrading again for a very long time, all while getting great new features and important security updates round the clock. All in all, the Galaxy S25 is a huge upgrade for owners of older Galaxy phones and one we can heartily recommend.</p>

<h2 id="what-os-will-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-come-with-2">What OS will the Samsung Galaxy S25 come with?</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, along with its sister phones the Galaxy S25+ and Galaxy S25 Ultra, will all come loaded with the latest version of Android, which is Android 15. They will also include Samsung One UI 7, the latest version of Samsung’s UI overlay, which adds tons of features, mainly relating to AI.</p><p>The phone can understand context and personal preferences to deliver customized AI experiences. Through a shared vision with Google, there are features like multimodal capabilities for interpreting text, speech, images, and videos. You can engage in more natural interactions using natural language to call up things on the phone.</p><p>You’ll get features like Google’s Circle to Search that can now also recognize phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and web URLs for one click access to what you want. There are also actionable searches with context-aware suggestions provided for the next steps.</p><p>Easily switch among apps, interact more naturally with the device, and press and hold the side button at any time to call up the Gemini AI assistant. It works with Samsung and Google apps along with a selection of third-party ones, too, like Spotify.</p><p>All these AI features, along with ones like Call Transcript, Writing Assist, Drawing Assist, and more, are thanks to the Android OS, Google integration, and Samsung One UI 7.</p><p>As Google releases new versions of Android, you will be able to download the latest ones for the next seven, up to Android 22 or whatever name is given to the next batches of updates should Android release a new OS annually. Most importantly, you will be able to enjoy a secure experience with the phone for the next seven years, all the way through to 2032. That’s almost unheard of when considering the phones of yesteryear, but it’s a commitment Samsung has made for its latest devices.</p><p>While chances are you’ll want to upgrade your phone much sooner than seven years from now, the extended support means you can confidently hand the phone to a friend or family member when you do, and they can be reassured that it will not only work but be current for many more years to come. Think of giving the phone to a child or teen as their first device, or a parent or grandparent.</p><p>This also means the phone, poised to take the place of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> on the list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a>, will hold its resale value. If you decide to sell it second-hand, you will get a good dollar amount for it with still many years of software upgrades and security support left.</p>

<h2 id="everything-you-should-know-about-samsung-galaxy-s25-battery-life-and-charging-2">Everything you should know about Samsung Galaxy S25 battery life and charging</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> includes three different models: the base Galaxy S25, the bigger Galaxy S25 Plus, and the premium Galaxy S25 Ultra. While the latter two models are rated for the same charging speeds, the regular Galaxy S25 charges slower, and this may be attributed to its smaller 4,000mAh battery.</p><p>The base Samsung Galaxy S25 is rated for "Super Fast Charging," "Fast Wireless Charging 2.0," and "Wireless PowerShare." Marketing terms aside, this simply means the Galaxy S25 can charge at up to 25W wired or 15W wirelessly. The phone also supports 4.5W reverse wireless charging for powering up other devices, like wireless earbuds.</p>

<p>By comparison, the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra support "Super Fast Charging 2.0," "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-fast-wireless-charging-20">Fast Wireless Charging 2.0</a>," and "Wireless PowerShare." This simply means that these Galaxy S25 models can charge at up to 45W wired or 15W wirelessly. Additionally, it can reverse wireless charge other devices at up to 4.5W. In other words, the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra charge 20W faster than the base Galaxy S25 when using a cable.</p><p>As previously mentioned, the higher battery capacities of the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra could be a reason they can charge faster. The former has a 4,900mAh battery, while the latter has a 5,000mAh battery.</p><p>All three Samsung Galaxy S25 models can charge wirelessly with Qi or Qi2 chargers, but the Galaxy S25 series does not have official Qi2 support. It won't work with magnetic chargers and accessories as a result. Unfortunately, that limitation is still common among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones in 2025</a>.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins">Qi2</a>, which includes magnets for chargers and accessories, is based on MagSafe and is becoming a popular request for Android phones.

As such, Qi2 chargers will work with the Galaxy S25 series, even if the phones aren't officially certified and magnetic connection won't be possible.

<p>Aside from 15W wireless charging support, the Galaxy S25 series supports up to 45W wired charging speeds and 4.5W reverse wireless charging.

<p>Samsung just unveiled its new S25 series at Galaxy Unpacked today, and we got a full look at the lineup in all its glory. To start, the series comes as a trio once again, with the top-end S25 Ultra, the middle child S25 Plus, and the standard S25 device.</p><p>When it comes to the core, all three devices are powered by a custom version of Qualcomm's customized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, giving these devices a performance boost (40% in NPU, 37% in CPU, and 30% in GPU) said to fuel the latest AI features within these phones.</p><p>“Galaxy S25 series opens the door to an AI-integrated OS that fundamentally shifts how we use technology and how we live our lives,” said TM Roh, president and head of mobile experience business at Samsung.</p><p>Additionally, the trio will run One UI 7 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review" target="_blank">Android 15</a>,  which the company says makes the Galaxy S25 "a true AI companion" that will interpret multimodal information in a seamless, interactive manner. Out of the box, Samsung promises seven generations of OS upgrades and seven years of security updates.</p>

<p>AI is really what's driving the new S25 series, with features including the Now Bar on the home screen, which highlights the user's personalized recommendations for entertainment, directions to their next meeting, or even help with communicating in different languages. And Now Brief can provide users with a snapshot of their day.</p><p>Next, Samsung will get upgrades to Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href=" https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">Circle to Search</a> that will not only interpret images and videos but will also recognize phone numbers, email, and URLs on your screen, letting you call, email, or visit a website with a single tap.</p><p>Images will also get a face life with ProScaler, an AI image processing on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and S25 Plus to achieve better image quality to match the QHD+ display resolutions.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> is focusing on bringing more intuitive interactions with the user, and Samsung says it will make tasks seamless.

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> gets a durable titanium build with smooth, rounded edges, unlike its predecessors' squarish ones. It has a 6.9-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED  display with a 120 Hz refresh rate protected by the new Corning Gorilla Armor 2, which helps with the phone's drop protection and anti-glare issues.</p><p>The device comes with a 5,000 mAh battery, like its predecessor, and is said to reach 65% charge within 30 minutes of charging with a 45W Adapter. The phone is compatible with wireless Qi2 chargers, but Samsung tells us it isn't optimized for Qi2. This means you can charge the S25 Ultra on another Qi2 device.</p>

<p>Getting into the camera array, the Ultra showcases wider black camera rims and comes with a new 50MP ultrawide camera sensor— upgraded from the previous 12MP, along with a 200 MP wide camera, another 50 MP Telephoto lens with a 5x zoom, and a 10 MP camera with a 3x zoom. On the front, the device comes with the same 12MP Front Camera .</p><p>The Ultra sticks to its IP68 dust and water resistance, making the phone water-resistant to a maximum depth of 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes.</p><p>The phone will be available in four colorways: Titanium silver blue, Titanium Whitesilver, Titanium Gray, and Titanium Black. However, people who order via Samsung.com get access to three unique colors, including Titanium Pinkgold, Titanium Jetblack, and Titanium Jadegreen. Samsung is retaining the price of its new phones this year with the Galaxy S25 Ultra starting at at $1,299.99, the same as the S24 Ultra and comes with three storage options 1TB  , 512GB and 256GB respectively.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus</a> get a fairly similar design to their predecessors with more rounded edges, sporting a  Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a 120Hz refresh rate similar to their predecessors. The S25 Plus has a sleek 6.7-inch QHD screen, while the standard model has a 6.2-inch FHD display.</p><p>The batteries remain unchanged, as the Plus model gets a 4,900mAh battery while the standard phone gets a 4,000mAh battery. Like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, they are both compatible with Qi2 charging but don't have built-in MagSafe charging, nor are they optimized for Qi2. For wired charging, they can reach up to 50% charge in around 30 mins with a 25W Adapter.</p><p>Samsung says that the external components of Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus have at least one recycled material and its metal frame incorporates recycled armor aluminum as well.</p>

<p>Both devices get a major upgrade with a new 50MP wide camera, a 12MP ultra-wide camera, and a  10MP Telephoto Camera  that comes with 3x optical zoom.  Samsung retains the selfie camera at 12MP for both devices.</p><p>The Samsung S25 and S25 Plus will also come with the same durability as the Ultra, sporting IP68 dust and water resistance, skipping out on the more robust <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a> we've seen on other flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus starts at $999.99 with 256GB and 512GB storage options, while the Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 with 128GB and 256GB options. Both get four new colorways: Navy, Icyblue, Mint, and Silver Shadow colors, plus exclusive colors like Blueblack, Coralred, and Pinkgold when ordered directly from Samsung.com</p>

<h2 id="the-galaxy-s25-plus-may-have-a-logn-face-but-you-won-t-after-you-get-a-stellar-case-2">The Galaxy S25 Plus may have a logn face, but you won't after you get a stellar case</h2>
<p>The best Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus cases take assorted forms and are available at all kinds of price points. Such a thin and tall device might slip out from your hand easily, so watch out for ones that offer additional grip.</p><p>Dbrand is the king of cool skins and cases. Skins aren't very protective, though, which is why I recommend grabbing the Dbrand Grip Case (MagSafe) for the Galaxy S25 Plus instead. This case looks as cutting edge as the skins from Dbrand but adds more than just scratch-proofing. You also get textured sides for enhanced grip, military-grade drop protection, tactile buttons with great tactile feedback, and MagSafe support. It might be a pricey option, but Dbrand always delivers.</p><p>Now, if you're on a budget but refuse to compromise quality, there are tons of name brands that have performed consistently well over the years. For the Galaxy S25 Plus, both Poetic and Spigen's cases are budget-friendly but you still get added functionality and robust drop protection.</p><p>The Poetic Guardian MagPro case costs almost exactly the same as the Spigen Ultra Hybrid S MagFit case, with the latter saving you a dollar to your name. Of the two, Poetic's bumper cover offers better impact absorption and you also get frontal protection, something Spigen's case lacks. However, the Spigen Ultra Hybrid S MagFit is much slimmer. At the end of the day, it boils down to your preferences and style when choosing between the two. Rest assured that both are excellent choices, regardless of what you pick.</p>

<p>Samsung didn't alter the dimensions and shaping of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-hands-on-galaxy-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a> lineup dramatically. Even the camera lenses and flashlights of all three models align with the Galaxy S24 series, leading one to assume that all S24 cases fit the S25 lineup. However, this isn't universally applicable across the board.</p><p>Let's take a look at the dimensions of each model in the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Samsung Galaxy S24 series and compare the size differences first.</p>

<p>As you can see, the smallest Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S25 are nearly identical in size. Both phones boast 6.2-inch displays too. These minimal changes mean that you can easily reuse most of the Galaxy S24's phone cases on your latest Samsung device.</p><p>Next, we have the mid-sized Plus models to compare and contrast. Once again, the measurements mirror each other. I put both phones as well as cases from CASETiFY and Wave Case for both devices next to each other and they seemed identical in bulk and stature.</p><p>Noticeably, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra has the most changed proportions. The numbers might seem like a lot on paper, but I've held both the S24 Ultra and the S25 Ultra in hand. Let me tell you right now, the newer model is slightly thinner and taller than its predecessor. However, it's still possible to use most of the more flexible S24 Ultra cases with the latest S Pen-bearing Ultra model from Samsung.</p><p>Be warned, however. More solid S24 phone cases with hardshell exteriors and more rugged builds might not fit the S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra as well as they would fit the S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra. On the other hand, soft cases like the ones that I tested have more bend to them and are more pliable, so they can accommodate minor changes in dimensions.</p><p>A poor fit reduces the drop protection a case offers, so keep that in mind when going <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">case shopping for your S25</a>, S25 Plus, or S25 Ultra.</p>

<p>Despite the slight size differences, the Galaxy S25 Ultra can actually wear select <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-ultra-cases">S24 Ultra cases</a>. However, I don't recommend this because the fit won't be perfect, which will affect factors such as impact absorption and drop-proofing. So, choose one of the best Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra cases that were meant to be used with the device.</p><p>Which phone cover is perfect for your S25 Ultra? That's a very tough question, mainly because the answer is subjective. However, a few simple factors appeal to every kind of user. Drop-proofing, thinness, MagSafe support, and a few colorways are the main factors anyone buying a case prioritizes. Based on this, Mous has the best overall case for your Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. The British brand's Clarity 3.0 MagSafe Case for Galaxy S25 Ultra has scored sides for additional grip, adds impact absorption to your device, and comes with a magnetic ring for Qi2/MagSafe support.</p><p>The Mous Clarity 3.0 MagSafe Case might be too expensive for some users, which is why I love the i-Blason Cosmo case. It costs less than $30, comes with military-grade drop-proofing as well, and includes a screen protector so you don't have to spend money on one separately. There's a MagSafe ring embedded in the back and the S25 Ultra case comes in both clear, semi-transparent, and opaque designs. How versatile is that?</p>

<ul><li>Samsung confirms the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra shipping with Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chips worldwide.</li><li>Samsung and Qualcomm collaborate to make a customized Snapdragon 8 Elite chip that can handle Galaxy AI and Gemini assistant features better on Galaxy S25 phones.</li><li>It brings in the latest connectivity features alongside improvements to display and energy efficiency.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s new year has just begun as it launches the Galaxy S25 series today globally. They bring some exclusive features that set them apart from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there, and the most notable one happens to be the SoC — the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy.</p><p>Samsung confirms all Galaxy S25 models across all regions come with the “Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy” SoC. The approach is similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, which came with "Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy" across all regions. While the other two siblings came with an Exynos processor in some regions. It doesn’t appear to be the case this time as all models across all regions equip the already proven powerful processor — in fact, a tad bit advanced version of it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gTpPF9D6RCHJrW8Zwegqc3" name="snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy" alt="Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTpPF9D6RCHJrW8Zwegqc3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung notes that the new Snapdragon 8 Elite happens to be the fastest mobile SoC, which is based on Geekbench 6.2 MT, Geekbench 6.2 ST, Speedometer, and Antutu CPU.</p><p>Qualcomm and Samsung seem to have worked together for the SoC to “deliver premium image quality and power consumption on a Galaxy smartphone display.” With the new chip, the Galaxy S25 users can also expect better low-light video capture capabilities even in 8K, next to making the devices power-efficient as well.</p><p>The companies’ collaboration also means the chipset is utilized for all the latest Gemini experiences alongside managing tasks between apps, live-streaming from the Gemini app, and utilizing Gemini as a writing assistant — all these experiences are promised to run seamlessly on the Galaxy S25 series. Samsung also notes that the SoC is customized to deliver better Galaxy AI, mobile gaming, and connectivity as well.</p>

<p>It supports 5G by utilizing the Snapdragon X80 5G Modem-RF System next to Qualcomm’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity system for faster cellular and Wi-Fi 7 speeds. The Galaxy S25 series also marks the first commercial phone to incorporate Snapdragon Satellite, which allows users to send and receive messages via satellite (narrowband NTN).</p><p>"The collaboration between Qualcomm Technologies and Samsung has always been about pushing the boundaries of what's possible. With the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, we are not just enhancing performance; we are redefining the user experience by integrating cutting-edge on-device AI and connectivity features that will shape the future of mobile technology,” said O.H. Kwon, senior vice president and president, Qualcomm APAC.</p><p>All in all, the new chipset on paper showcases some notable benefits over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> that powered notable premium handsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. The exclusivity for Samsung should likely make the Galaxy S25 series already ahead of the competition.</p>

<p>Samsung has just wrapped up its Galaxy Unpacked event and announced its new Galaxy S25 series. Google, on the other hand, took the stage to introduce some cool new enhancements coming to Gemini to make it more helpful, personalized, and accessible on the Galaxy S25 series and other Android devices.</p><p>Gemini Live AI Assistant already helps users brainstorm new ideas, organize their thoughts, and also simplify complex topics in a conversational manner. And, the search giant now wants to make it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/new-gemini-app-updates-android">more versatile</a> and is adding the ability to add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="edAYDXFpZwVyp4WjubT32S" name="Gemini-Live-images-files-feature" alt="Gemini Live images and files sharing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edAYDXFpZwVyp4WjubT32S.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, a dog photo captured on a phone is shared on Gemini Live and asked about the shot composition, to which the assistant addresses that the focal point of the particular photo appears clear.</p><p>The latest support for adding images, files, and YouTube videos to Gemini Live will be rolling out to the latest Galaxy S25 series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series, starting today (Jan 22).</p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are also promised to be getting in the coming weeks. Additionally, Google notes that its Project Astra capabilities like screen sharing and video streaming Gemini on Android devices, including the latest Galaxy S25 models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="yjxunucs2eR426n9R8EmvR" name="Gemini-extensions-2025" alt="New Gemini Extensions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yjxunucs2eR426n9R8EmvR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Further, extensions are a great way to get your tasks done with the help of Gemini — on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">favorite Android apps</a> like Gmail, Google Maps, Spotify, and several others. As part of the collaboration, some Samsung apps on the Galaxy S25 series, including Samsung Calendar, Notes, Reminder, and Clock, now work with Gemini in getting things done.</p><p>Similarly, Gemini can use multiple extensions in a single prompt. With the new inclusion, Gemini responses can now be saved to Samsung Notes or Google Keep. These multi-extension prompts are available to all Gemini users on the web, Android, and iOS devices.</p><p>Lastly, accessing Gemini is pretty familiar on the Galaxy S25 series too, which means long-pressing the side button will trigger the AI assistant.</p>
