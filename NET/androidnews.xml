<ul><li>TECNO shows off a new tri-folding phone concept that measures 11mm when folded.</li><li>The phone has a 6.48-inch display when folded and opens up to a 10-inch 3K OLED panel and can by arranged in a number of ways.</li><li>TECNO is also preparing to launch two new foldable phones soon, the Phantom V Fold 2 and V Flip 2.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TECNO is no stranger to interesting concept devices, several of which it showed off earlier this year at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/coolest-things-mwc-2024">MWC 2024</a>. Now, after showing off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-is-the-latest-brand-to-unfurl-a-rollable-phone-concept">Phantom Ultimate</a> rollable phone concept, the company is switching things up with the Phantom Ultimate 2, a new tri-fold phone with an impressive and versatile design.</p><p>While we&apos;ve seen tri-fold concepts before, TECNO has implemented some rather impressive engineering to design one that measures just 11mm thick when folded. For reference, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is 12.1mm when its two halves are folded. The thickest part is the section that houses the triple camera system, which also holds the charging port and what looks like a speaker opening.</p><p>To achieve such thinness, TECNO is using a new hinge design that is capable of achieving a thickness of less than 9mm on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. The company also utilizes "the smartphone industry’s thinnest battery cover," measuring just 0.25mm and made of "super-compressed Titan Advanced Fiber material."</p>

<p>When closed, the primary display measures 6.48 inches. The phone then opens to feature a slim frame and a 10-inch 3K OLED panel with a 4:3 aspect ratio. Unfolded, the TECNO Phantom Ultimate 2 looks a lot like an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> but with significantly smaller bezels. However, instead of just being able to fold it completely open, TECNO has implemented various folding angles to bring more versatility to the device.</p><p>In one example, the Ultimate 2 is shown standing up with 1/3 of the phone folded flat on a table and the user typing on it like a regular laptop keyboard. It&apos;s a form aimed at productivity and sort of reminds me of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-yoga-book-9i-gen-9-review" target="_blank">Lenovo Yoga Book 9i</a> with a keyboard at the bottom. Another shows the bottom section folded back in a form that&apos;s seemingly meant for viewing media. A third form shows the phone folded in a tent-like mode, which TECNO says is ideal for scenarios like live dual-screen translation, a feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-october-2023">we see more foldable phones take advantage of</a>.</p><p>TECNO has also optimized the software to take advantage of the form factor, meaning wallpapers will adjust according to how you fold or unfold the phone, and users can take advantage of multi-panel multitasking.</p>

<p>To support all these various folding scenarios, TECNO says both hinges have been tested to support up to 300,000 folds and are enhanced with 2100MPa strength.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is a concept device, so TECNO has not revealed any additional specs in its press release, such as chipset, battery capacity, camera resolutions, and more. It&apos;s also unclear if and when TECNO plans to actually launch the product or one like it. Clearly, something like this wouldn&apos;t be cheap to produce, and TECNO prides itself on developing impressive devices at more affordable prices.</p><p>Speaking of, the company is also gearing up to launch its foldable devices, the Phantom V Fold 2 and Phantom V Flip 2. TECNO did not specify a launch date but says they are "scheduled for release soon." If they&apos;re anything like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-flip-review">previous models</a>, we expect to see great designs and prices that will undercut much of the competition, especially Samsung.</p>

<ul><li>Google and the state of California announced last week that 1.5 million state residents can now add their mobile driver's license to the Google Wallet.</li><li>The company previously said that it was working on bringing more states onboard its digital ID program. </li><li>Google Wallet has been upgraded in a few key ways this year; it can now create a digital pass out of basically anything, from tickets to store loyalty and insurance cards.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google spent much of this year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">talking up its digital ID program</a>, describing plans to add more states and make the entire experience more ubiquitous. Well, it added a pretty big state last week: California, which is home to nearly 40 million people. Google and the state of California jointly announced a pilot program that would initially allow 1.5 million people to add their mobile ID to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet#section-google-wallet-summarized">Google Wallet</a>.</p><p>Part of the reason it&apos;s so difficult to grow Android or iOS mobile ID adoption is that many U.S. states are trying to create their own offerings from scratch rather than work with Apple or Google. Recently, New York launched its Mobile ID (MiD New York) program independently, requiring a standalone app. In fact, California had its own app — the California DMV Wallet app — before opening up the Google Wallet pilot program. The California DMV Wallet app will still be used as another option. </p><p>"It&apos;s never been easier to keep a digital driver&apos;s license and identification card in California," said Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/08/23/californians-can-now-add-their-mobile-drivers-license-to-google-wallet/" target="_blank">statement</a>. "The state continues to work to offer convenience for those opting into the mobile driver’s license program, now with the option of using Google Wallet."</p><p>To be clear, mobile IDs still have a long way to go before they are truly useful. Even now, Californians who store their driver&apos;s license in the Google Wallet are required by law to keep their physical card with them. The mobile version of their ID will only come in handy when passing through TSA checkpoints at select airports and at some restaurants. </p><p>However, adding California is still big for Google Wallet, and it&apos;ll become even more important if the pilot program is opened to more state residents. For starters, Google now supports the same number of state IDs as Apple. Google Wallet has Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, and Maryland, while Apple Wallet has Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, and Ohio. Getting a state the size of California and securing a state that already has its own mobile wallet app are both huge victories for Google. </p><p>While Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/08/drivers-licenses-and-state-ids-in-apple-wallet-are-coming-soon-to-california/" target="_blank">announced</a> that it would be participating in a similar pilot program with California, the mobile IDs launched in Google Wallet first, and the timetable for Apple Wallet support is unclear.</p><p>Previously, a key drawback to using Google Wallet over Apple Wallet was that fewer IDs, cards, passes, and tickets supported it. Additionally, there weren&apos;t as many places that accepted Google Pay. While I still have some reliability and user-experience concerns about Google Wallet, many of these supposed "cons" to using Google Wallet are simply outdated. Google has come a long way just this year alone, and the addition of mobile California IDs — as big as it is — isn&apos;t even the best thing to come to Google Wallet of late. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="iSNZtYCjj8zGf6UCJZgbrC" name="Google-Wallet-Add-Card-to-Wallet.jpeg" alt="Menu to add a payment card, transit pass, loyalty card, or gift card to Google Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iSNZtYCjj8zGf6UCJZgbrC.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Recently, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-everything-else-spotted">added a feature</a> to the Wallet app that lets you create a pass from basically <em>anything</em>. You can scan a card in your real wallet — think an insurance card or a store loyalty card — and Google will use its text recognition and AI smarts to turn it into a Google Wallet pass. If the whole thing works as expected, the pass will be created and organized without any manual user action. If there are passes that need to be kept secure, Google Wallet can automatically create a Private Pass for those cards.</p><p>This feature alone makes the Google Wallet more versatile than the Apple Wallet. I&apos;ve been a frequent user of both digital wallet apps for years, and I loved how almost all passes that supported mobile versions worked with Apple Wallet. Some supported Apple Wallet <em>and</em> Google Wallet, but few supported Google Wallet <em>exclusively</em>.  </p><p>Now, with this feature, you don&apos;t even need a card, ticket, or pass to support a digital variant for it to work with Google Wallet. Anything you can find in your wallet should work in a digital form, and this is incredibly convenient and useful. Throw in the fact that Google Wallet has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-wallet-push-continues-as-30-new-banks-are-added-in-the-us">added support for hundreds of banks in 2024</a>, and it&apos;s clear progress is being made. Though I&apos;m still skeptical of the utility of mobile IDs, California is a big get for Google Wallet. </p><p>Looking at these improvements holistically, Google Wallet is now ready to give Apple Wallet a challenge. I doubt that many people are switching between iOS and Android based on wallet apps, but that doesn&apos;t really matter. iOS clearly had a check in the win column for many years thanks to the Apple Wallet, but that isn&apos;t as clear anymore. If Google builds on 2024&apos;s momentum, Google Wallet should be a force moving forward. </p>

<ul><li>Another set of OnePlus 13 rumors double down on the potential for a 6,000mAh battery to challenge the 12 model's battery life.</li><li>However, the device may feature 50W wireless charging, which goes against what was previously rumored this year.</li><li>Aside from the suspected LYT-808 primary sensor, speculation states the OnePlus 13 will launch late in 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As consumers eagerly await the next OnePlus phone, a new rumor claims it will boast quite a battery upgrade.</p><p>The latest rumors arise from known Chinese Weibo leaker Digital Chat Station (DCS), which states the OnePlus 13 will have a 6,000mAh battery (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/08/27/oneplus-13-main-camera-battery-size-wired-wireless-charging-details-leaked/">Gizmochina</a>). The leak adds that the device could sport 100W wired fast charging <em>and </em>50W wireless charging capabilities.</p><p>DCS claims that the OnePlus 13&apos;s rear primary camera could be more of the same. Their post states that the company may implement the Lytia LYT-808 sensor with an f/1.6 aperture. While this seems disappointing, it&apos;s not all bad, considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 12</a> features the same 1/1.4-inch sensor at 50MP and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-vs-oneplus-12-camera-review">takes rather impressive photos</a>.</p><p>That said, Digital Chat Station&apos;s rumor seemingly goes against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-charging-display-upgrade-leak">what we heard in June</a>. It was previously rumored that the OnePlus 13 would miss out on a key charging feature that its predecessor offers: wireless charging. OnePlus has gone back and forth on this as the 11 series didn&apos;t offer wireless charging while the succeeding 12 did.</p><p>What has remained consistent is the apparent upgrade from a 5,400mAh battery to 6,000mAh. The OnePlus 12 could last for up to two days (without heavy use), but it seems the 13 model could challenge that. Moreover, speculation behind OnePlus&apos; continued use of 100W wired charging hones in on what it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-charging-survey">wanted to capitalize</a> for consumers.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-triple-camera-array-sensor-upgrade-leak">Rumors continue</a>, claiming that OnePlus will still feature a triple camera array; however, its ultrawide and periscope lenses might receive a buff. It was purported that both sensors might fall into Sony and its IMX882 for 50MP camera strength.</p><p>Other speculation states the OnePlus 13 may feature a 6.8-inch 2K 8T LTPO "customized" display. It might not be completely flat as older leaks suggest OnePlus could layer some "micro-curved" glass on top.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 is rumored to launch late in 2024.</p>

The list is pretty long, so if you don&apos;t feel like scrolling through all of the promos on display, I&apos;ve done the work of sharing five of my favorite Android offers below so you can save yourself some time (and some cash). </p><p>First and foremost, it&apos;s worth mentioning that Samsung deals are rarely simple. Usually they involve some kind of action on your part — such as a trade-in or a carrier activation — and it&apos;s unusual for an offer to appear as a straight, no-strings discount. Still, if you play your cards right, you could find yourself earning some serious savings AND an awesome Samsung device at the same time (not to mention the exclusive color options). </p><p>For example, you could get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uakaxaa/"><strong>up to $1,200 off</strong></a> the Galaxy Z Fold 6 when you trade in an old or broken phone today, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24/buy/galaxy-s24-plus-256gb-unlocked-sm-s926ulgaxaa/"><strong>$200 off</strong></a> when you buy an unlocked Galaxy S24 Plus. Keep reading to see more of my favorite offers, and don&apos;t forget that most of these promos are set to expire in early September — so act fast. </p>

<hr>
<p>Google is making replying to emails snappy with an all-new experience rolling out on mobile devices.</p><p>The company detailed the update rolling out on Android devices in a Workspace <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/08/reply-to-emails-in-gmail-faster-on-android.html">blog post</a>. Google is chucking the old reply, reply all, and forward options in a conversation for a new Message-like textbox. Starting soon, this new pill-shaped area will be housed at the bottom of an email for quick replying.</p><p>Google sees this as the best way for users to send "quick, lightweight" responses as you won&apos;t need to open a separate window.</p><p>Tapping on the box will show "compose email" with a drop-down menu at the top left, which says "Reply" by default. Interacting with that will show additional options like forward and "change recipient." Users can also quickly submit an attachment with the paperclip icon on the left.</p><p>Moreover, Google states it has included an option for long-form replies via the expansion icon. Expanding the box will shift the app to the screen users are used to when replying to emails on mobile. This full-length response display offers extra formatting options that the quicker, texting-like variant forgoes.</p><p>The good news here is that Google states all personal Google accounts and Workspace individual subscribers now have this feature.</p>

The company warns that anyone testing new generative AI experiences through Workspace Labs will not see this new reply experience. Meanwhile, those on iOS will pick this up "later this year."</p><p>Aside from a better emailing experience, Google detailed a new feature for Gmail, powered by Gemini, that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmails-new-gemini-feature-turns-messy-notes-into-polished-emails-in-a-snap">polishes your drafts</a> with a tap.

The company states that you can paste or write your rough ideas, and Gemini will sort them into a comprehensive email before sending them.</p><p>The only downside is that Workspace and Google One AI customers can utilize this useful feature.</p><p>Additional Gemini features in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-is-now-in-gmail-to-write-summaries-and-craft-replies-on-the-fly">Gmail include summaries</a>, reply suggestions, and shortcuts for the "Refine my draft" selection of AI options.</p>

<ul><li>A new Nothing product was spotted going through Singapore's IMDA certification database called the "Ear Open."</li><li>The listing states it is a "low-energy device" and fits within the TWS (true wireless earbud) genre.</li><li>Speculation states Nothing could begin teasing the device "soon," though there's nothing concrete.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing&apos;s next pair of earbuds has received overseas certification and the details might surprise you.</p><p>Nothing&apos;s next set of wireless buds, the "Ear Open," was spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nothing-ear-open-launch-imda-certification/">91Mobiles</a> passing through Singapore&apos;s IMDA certification database. It&apos;s suggested that the product&apos;s listing will bring the company&apos;s product to global markets. The database holds very little information aside from highlighting that the "Ear Open" is a "low-power device."</p><p>Another detail states that users can expect it to be a set of "true wireless earphones." With model number B182, consumers might be in for a premium audio experience, considering it&apos;s listed under the Nothing brand and not CMF.</p><p>Unfortunately, Singapore&apos;s listing doesn&apos;t expand on much else surrounding the new buds. However, there&apos;s speculation that Nothing could start its teaser engine for the supposed Ear Open "soon," per the publication.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZQ7NN4Y2pt8LADtpKM3z2g" name="nothing-ear-2024-microphones.jpg" alt="Nothing Ear (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZQ7NN4Y2pt8LADtpKM3z2g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Tacking on "open" to the end of the device name could signal a slight shift in form factor for Nothing. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">Open-ear earbuds</a> are a thing, which can offer enjoyable sound quality while letting in the world around you. These devices are often geared toward people going for a run, outdoors, or working in a warehouse. They don&apos;t generally go in-ear with a silicon tip, which helps to block out some surrounding noise.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Bose Ultra Open</a> is a good example of how Nothing could go about designing the device for the ear — or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-review">Shokz OpenFit</a>.</p><p>There&apos;s no telling when Nothing could debut or tease the "Ear Open." Although, it&apos;s worth mentioning that the brand dropped the updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review">Nothing Ear 2024</a> earlier this year. The company boosted the Ear with LHDC 5.0 support, 11mm ceramic drivers, and ANC. Nothing&apos;s choice of ceramic drivers brought about brighter vocals and a more refined audio experience.</p><p>Open-ear earbuds typically suffer from "auditory masking," which makes them great in quieter settings rather than walking around traffic. It&apos;s all speculation by this point while we await Nothing&apos;s official word.</p>

The Tensor G4 processor inside isn&apos;t any faster than previous Tensor processors in daily performance — especially when playing games on the Pixel 9 — the display still uses an abysmally low PWM rate, some of Google&apos;s AI features have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-not-the-only-way-to-create-unhinged-ai-photos">called ethically questionable</a>, Google once again raised the price of its latest phones by $100, and the amount of storage space is pitiful for the price.</p><p>All of that left some of us feeling disappointed. So maybe you <em>should</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-rumors">wait to buy a Pixel 10</a>, instead. We&apos;re taking a look at what we already know about the Pixel 10, including the new Tensor G5 processor, and putting everything together so you can make the best-informed decision with your hard-earned dollars this year.</p><p>The oft-leaked Google Pixel 9 was one of the industry&apos;s worst-kept secrets. That&apos;s not particularly surprising given Google&apos;s loose track record with leaks, and this year we saw prototypes and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/thinborne-pixel-9-cases-early">cases in the wild</a> much earlier than usual. The number of Pixel 10 leaks is still fairly low but, given that the release isn&apos;t likely until Summer 2025, we have plenty of time to speculate based on several known factors.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6AcWY7myxfTHBsUvqiE7qL" name="google-pixel-9-pro-with-case-and-buds-pro-2-hazel-01.jpg" alt="The Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro with an official Google case next to the Hazel Google Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6AcWY7myxfTHBsUvqiE7qL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s current Pixel lineup <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/there-are-too-many-pixel-phones">is a bit convoluted</a>. The Pixel 9 series debuted in four different sizes for the first time ever, and we&apos;re still expecting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> to make a debut at a reduced price sometime in Spring 2025. That leaves a big question mark on what Google will do for the Pixel 10.</p><p>Our thoughts are that Google needs to drop the "Pro" moniker and just stick with one main line of phones with a secondary line of more affordable Pixel A-series phones. For the Pixel 10 series, that would mean something like this:</p>
<ul><li>Pixel 10a</li><li>Pixel 10</li><li>Pixel 10 XL</li><li>Pixel 10 Fold</li></ul>
<p>The Pixel 9 introduced the first smaller Pro-level model, so we don&apos;t expect Google to go back on that idea. The smaller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 is confusingly missing features</a> that the "Pro" models have, and we think it would make more sense for an A-series model to be the one missing features, if Google is going to continue doing that.</p><p>As for the Pixel 10 release date, we expect that Google will likely launch the Pixel 10 near the end of Summer 2025. Google released the Pixel 9 just 10 months after it debuted the Pixel 8, making it the shortest time between releases we&apos;ve seen yet. There&apos;s no reason to expect Google to do this again, but that might depend on sales of its latest flagships.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iL4FzPaugER79TtCMjWnS7" name="google-pixel-9-pro-obsidian-and-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-back-02.jpg" alt="Comparing the backs and sizes of the Obsidian Google Pixel 9 Pro with the Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iL4FzPaugER79TtCMjWnS7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 introduced the most radical change to Pixel phone design since the Pixel 6, but that doesn&apos;t mean Google will stick to this radical new design language with the Pixel 10. One Pixel 9a leak suggests that the company is already considering a different direction for the future, and the company&apos;s head designer even said the Pixel 9&apos;s specific camera bar design <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">might not stick around forever</a>.</p><p>The Pixel 9&apos;s flatter design has received mixed reviews, something the Pixel 6-8 didn&apos;t really see. While Google ramped up build quality with this release, the shiny, flat side rails not only make it look an <em>awful</em> lot like an iPhone, but they also make the phone harder and less comfortable to hold than more ergonomic designs like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>.</p><p>Google has changed up the design language on Pixels a lot over the years. Pixels one through six all look completely different, and it wasn&apos;t until the Pixel 6 that the company seems to have decided on the camera visor as the thing that makes a Pixel primarily look like a Pixel. There&apos;s no guarantee of a radical change again next year but there&apos;s a lot of history behind the company doing that, so it wouldn&apos;t be a surprise.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Not everyone likes the new design, but Google has been known for radically altering the Pixel design language over the years.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 debuted a brighter AMOLED display than ever, topping out at 3,000 nits. The company also upgraded the display with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-pixel-9s-new-display-feature-makes-using-it-with-wet-hands-a-lot-easier">new wet touch feature</a> that makes it possible to use the screen even with wet hands, similar to how the OnePlus 12 works.</p><p>But while Google might have one of the brightest phone displays on the planet, the company has completely ignored industry trends to make displays more eye-friendly.</p><p>Namely, the company still uses the lowest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> frequency in the industry. At 240Hz, Google&apos;s displays flicker at half the rate of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> series and the latest iPhones. Furthermore, phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> only switch to PWM dimming at low brightness and, even when they do, use a substantially higher 2160Hz rate.</p><p>We know Google can push this rate much higher <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-display-upgrade">based on our own testing</a> and the fact that most other smartphone manufacturers already do it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10-cameras"><span>Google Pixel 10: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AmYusEJKqzkxPdvKfgmPk5" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-camera-viewfinder-01.jpg" alt="Taking a photo of a gate with the Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AmYusEJKqzkxPdvKfgmPk5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s little chance we&apos;ll see anything radical change with the cameras in the Pixel 10 series especially given that Google continues to push the envelope for AI-centric features. The company&apos;s own head of design said that the current camera bar design is mainly used to house larger camera sensors but that the company wants to shrink that going forward as AI replaces the need for more advanced physical hardware.</p><p>With tricks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/lesson-learned-with-google-zoom-enhance-feature">Zoom Enhance</a>, Google can continue to shrink the number and size of camera sensors on the back with little to no difference in the end. It&apos;s not likely we&apos;ll see this sort of change happen with the Pro series of phones — which we expect to continue to use a triple camera system on the back — but the more budget-minded Pixel phones could see a change in the camera bump size and shape to further differentiate Pro models.</p><p>We&apos;ve also seen an uptick in the number of AI-powered software features directly related to the camera. The Pixel 9 introduced improved Night Sight Video, Night Sight Panoramas, enhanced Video Boost for better video quality, and new AI tricks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a>, Reimagine, and others. No doubt, Google is cooking up plenty of new ways to incorporate AI into its cameras to deliver the wow factor we expect from the company.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 series surprisingly launched with Android 14, the same version of Android the Pixel 8 debuted with. This is mostly because Google released the Pixel 9 just 10 months after the Pixel 9, giving the Android team less than a full year to churn out a new version of Android.</p><p>A delayed Android version <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-it-mean-if-both-google-and-samsungs-android-15-updates-are-delayed">complicates Google&apos;s software promise</a>, which is supposed to deliver seven years of Android and security updates for Pixel phones. Because of the release window, the Pixel 9 will see support end with the same Android version as the Pixel 8 — that&apos;s Android 21 — but will see ten additional security updates over that older phone.</p><p>The Pixel 10 will launch with at least Android 15 and could even see a launch alongside Android 16 depending on when Google wants to debut its next generation of phones.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s where we expect the Pixel 10 to deliver the biggest improvement yet. Google has long focused on the AI processing capabilities of its Tensor processors. The Tensor G4 in the Pixel 9 can process AI 2.25x faster than the leading competitor, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. But daily performance is a totally different story.</p><p>In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro review</a>, I noted that the gaming performance for the Pixel 9 Pro series was worse than the Pixel 8 Pro. The silver lining is that the Pixel 9 doesn&apos;t get as hot as the Pixel 8 does. Google prioritized efficiency with the Pixel 9 but the Tensor G4 is still based on the extremely inefficient Exynos line, which has trouble competing with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 in many situations, a 2021 chipset.</p><p>Thankfully, everything we know about the Tensor G5 so far tells us that it should be a monumentally better chipset in every way. Google has allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">finished its design</a> and sent it along for manufacturing at TSMC, ending the era of Samsung-produced designs.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Tensor G5 is said to be Google's first fully in-house developed chip, manufactured by TSMC instead of Samsung.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>TSMC tends to manufacture better chipsets than Samsung. For reference, Qualcomm used Samsung to produce the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, a processor that was infamous for overheating and heavy throttling. They then switched to TSMC halfway through the year for the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, a processor that&apos;s largely the same design but, because of TSMC&apos;s superior tech, was able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">significantly outpace</a> the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 in every benchmark. It also stays far cooler and is better on battery life.</p><p>That&apos;s all to say that we expect a similar thing to happen with the Tensor G5 compared to the Tensor G4. Not only should it be a far more efficient and cooler chipset because of TSMC&apos;s manufacturing process, but a brand-new chipset designed fully in-house by Google. It would mark the first time Google doesn&apos;t use a reference design from Samsung&apos;s Exynos line for the new chip, as well.</p><p>It could finally flip the narrative that Tensor is a slow, inefficient processor, helping Google further pitch the Pixel as a super premium device.</p>

<p>While we&apos;ve already covered a number of different changes we expect — and hope — to see, but it&apos;s sometimes easier to see them all in one list.</p>
<h2 id="better-processor-2">Better processor</h2>
<p>We&apos;re already very sure that the Tensor G5 in the Pixel 10 is going to be <em>a lot</em> better than previous Tensor processors, but there&apos;s no guarantee until we have one in our hands. Tensor is already the king of AI processing among smartphone processors, but we want to see it thrive elsewhere, too.</p><p>Google seems to have put a band-aid on the heat problem with Tensor G4 by throttling the processor quickly when it&apos;s doing a lot, but we&apos;d like to see the Tensor G5 push heavy workloads without getting steamy in the first place. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is also susceptible to heavy throttling when running heavy workloads but because it&apos;s <strong>so</strong> much faster than the Tensor G4 in normal tasks, that throttling isn&apos;t felt like it is on Tensor.</p><p>Since the Tensor G5 is both in-house Google developed <em>and</em> manufactured by TSMC, there&apos;s hope that these issues will be solved in the Pixel 10.</p>
<h2 id="more-eye-friendly-display-2">More eye-friendly display</h2>
<p>Google has stressed that the Pixel&apos;s displays have industry-leading brightness and color accuracy, but the company is achieving these metrics at the expense of your eye health. Meanwhile, companies like OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">are also using ultra-bright displays</a> but managing brightness in a way that&apos;s far more friendly to human eyeballs.</p><p>As brightness continues to increase, it&apos;s of paramount importance that Google also starts increasing its PWM rate. All Pixels have used 240Hz PWM dimming to date — the lone exception is 360Hz on the Pixel 7a — while other companies are pushing up to 4320Hz on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-200-pro-review">Honor 200</a>.</p><p>There&apos;s no reason Google can&apos;t offer a bright, color-accurate display <strong>and</strong> a high PWM rate. At the very least, Google needs to consider the fact that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">some folks <em>need</em> a higher PWM rate</a> in order to use its phones, again, especially as brightness continues to ramp up at exponential levels.</p>
<h2 id="fingerprint-sensor-changes-2">Fingerprint sensor changes</h2>
<p>Google shifted to using in-display fingerprint sensors with the Pixel 6, and the company had problems with reliability on both that generation and the Pixel 7 after it. But last year, the Pixel 8 series optical fingerprint sensor worked incredibly well. Despite that, Google swapped out the optical sensor and replaced it with an ultrasonic sensor on the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>While ultrasonic fingerprint scanners work very well for some people, they&apos;re problematic for others. I happen to be one of those people who find ultrasonic sensors to be unreliable and commented on it in my Pixel 9 Pro review. Ultrasonic sensors are also <em>very</em> picky about which screen protectors you can use, meaning you might accidentally waste your money if you don&apos;t get the right one.</p><p>Instead of all this in-display nonsense, Google should switch to a fingerprint sensor in the power button. They already do it on the Pixel Fold line and it works perfectly. The power button — or "side key" as some companies call it now — is the ideal place for a fingerprint sensor as it&apos;s easy to reach and use no matter how you&apos;re holding the phone. It&apos;s also more accurate than any in-display option.</p>
<h2 id="design-changes-2">Design changes</h2>
<p>The Pixel 9&apos;s design has caused a fair bit of controversy with its iPhone-like side rails, buttons, and other similar design cues. It also does away with the "friendly" curves Pixel phones had been moving toward for a far more sterile, industrial design. While some enjoy this new look — as Android Central&apos;s Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, noted in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9 review</a> — I&apos;m not a fan.</p><p>At least on the Pro models, I find the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL to be more difficult to hold without a case. Google previously said its designs are now focused toward folks who use cases, so this isn&apos;t a section that everyone will agree with or even care about, but I&apos;d like to see Google go back to using more rounded side rails again. More specifically, I&apos;d love to see matte rails like we had on the Pixel 6, which remains one of the most comfortable phones Google has ever made.</p>

You can perform the same beat-em-up combos and hunt foes in Predator mode like you do in Arkham Asylum, but you&apos;re liable to make mistakes from a first-person perspective. It almost makes this Batman: VR LARP feel more authentic, that you&apos;re not the same confident, unwavering hero.</p><p>Before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-gameplay-trailer-gamescom">Arkham Shadow Gamescom reveal</a>, I was lucky enough to attend a private Batman: Arkham Shadow hands-on with developer Camouflaj&apos;s Game Director Ryan Payton and Design Director Ryan Darcey, where I played the first hour+ of the game. </p><p>Arkham Shadow may not be the first "AAA" Quest 3 game — that might apply to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-vr-hands-on">Assassin&apos;s Creed Nexus</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/asgards-wrath-2-review">Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2</a> — but it was immediately clear how Camouflaj took the time to translate the series&apos; flatscreen roots into VR and made it feel like a natural progression of the series. This is no throwaway VR spinoff.</p><p>In other words, true Arkham fans are going to have to decide whether it&apos;s worth spending $500 on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> to avoid some painful FOMO, because I can tell from the first hour that Arkham Shadow nailed the series formula and ambiance. I&apos;ll be shocked if it doesn&apos;t end up being the best Quest game of 2024 for a lot of people.</p>

<p>My Batman: Arkham Shadow demo skipped the opening cinematics and placed me in the sewers, hunting down rumors of the mysterious Rat King. I went through several rounds of combat against foes, one Predator session, and a lot of in-game tutorials showing how to traverse the world.</p><p>Actions that only require a thoughtless button press in Asylum are more deliberate in VR, like holding the controllers up and out to glide off ledges or grabbing your Batarang off your chest before aiming and throwing. It slows the gameplay down, and no doubt I look very un-Batmanlike in real life, but it <em>feels</em> very immersive.</p><p>Long-time Arkham fans will appreciate the combat: You sneak or charge into a group of foes and then build up your XP multiplier by successfully timing hits and using a variety of gadgets without getting struck. When you reach a foe, fist or arrow icons will indicate where or in which direction you must hit, or else the attack fails. And instead of button combos for finishers, you grab foes with both hands and slam them down.</p><p>XP unlocks new gadgets and types of attacks. I got a brief glimpse of a disorganized ability web once I leveled up, and the Camouflaj team suggested they&apos;re working on making it a bit easier to use in the final version. In theory, though, there are dozens of unlockable abilities you&apos;ll attain across dozens of campaign hours.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Combat in Arkham Shadow feels more real and rhythm-focused than past games, as you must strike with precision, power, and timing to beat foes.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Payton told us in a previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-gameplay-story-interview">Arkham Shadow interview</a> that VR rhythm games like Beat Saber and Superhot inspired their combat, and that came across in the demo. At first, I failed several attacks because I punched with the Touch controllers too quickly or inaccurately. If you strike strongly, Camouflaj rewards you with more points and a colorful flash.</p><p>You must watch out for warning indicators when a blind-spot attack is coming and dodge or strike to the side since you no longer have a bird&apos;s-eye view of the arena.</p><p>By the end of the demo, I was successfully finishing battles with no damage and decent combos by prioritizing staying mobile. I asked the Camouflaj team how they would keep the combat fresh, and they hinted that we&apos;d see a similar enemy progression as in the other Arkham games. Most likely, we&apos;ll see armed or larger foes that you can&apos;t punch out so easily.</p><p>I will say that a couple of movement and combat tutorials confused me, and the Camouflaj team had to explain to me what I was doing wrong because the game didn&apos;t make it clear. They said they&apos;re hoping to make the in-game tutorials a bit more obvious by the final launch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7ySga7hLvHmQ4RqoeFL7wa" name="Batman-Arkham-Shadow-predator-still.jpeg" alt="A still from Batman: Arkham Shadow showing Batman holding a foe in Predator mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ySga7hLvHmQ4RqoeFL7wa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, of course, you have the Predator sections, where foes have machine guns, and you must stealthily take them out one by one to win. The demo taught me how to dip off of gargoyles, slide down to grab foes, choke them out, and hang them in the air. You can also glide down to strike foes directly, but this usually tips off nearby enemies and gets you shot.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit tricky hunting foes in first-person mode and open space, with only a 100º stretch of the world visible at any point; it leaves you feeling more vulnerable. Out of an abundance of caution, I didn&apos;t try hiding under grates for a takedown, and I didn&apos;t have access yet to certain gadgets like explosive gel that would add more variety. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4sS8CjdHGo6tjRbJujxcWa" name="Batman-Arkham-Shadow-detective-mode-still.jpeg" alt="A still from Batman: Arkham Shadow showing Batman overlooking the environment in Detective Mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4sS8CjdHGo6tjRbJujxcWa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Batman&apos;s stealth sections felt somewhat plain compared to other first-person stealth games like Dishonored or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vampire-the-masquerade-justice-vr-hands-on-preview">Vampire: The Masquerade – Justice</a>, where you have magical abilities and camouflage to spice things up. That&apos;s why I&apos;m hoping Camouflaj will add Predator challenge maps to the game for post-campaign replayability, as Rocksteady did for Asylum — to add a real challenge factor for long-time fans.</p><p>When I asked, the team said they&apos;ve seriously considered the idea but are focusing on finishing the campaign first. My sense is that the decision will depend on how successful the game is with Quest users.</p>
<h2 id="a-closed-world-gotham-2">A closed-world Gotham</h2>
<p>From what I&apos;ve seen, Batman: Arkham Shadow has plenty of traversal through the world, but not in the same open-world, free-roaming vein as Arkham City or Knight; you&apos;ll only be able to grapple to specific rooftops. It&apos;s very much on-rails and curated, which matches the more Asylum-like vibe and (probably) is more feasible for the Quest 3&apos;s mobile hardware.</p><p>That focus allowed Camouflaj to pay close attention to art direction and level design. Just in that hour, I remember seeing little glimpses of worldbuilding like the sleeping bags of Rat King followers embedded into the sewer walls or interactable items you/ Batman can pick up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YHkuBC9Z2qzF3dgQFRJn4P" name="Batman-arkham-shadow-investigation-still.jpeg" alt="Screenshot from Batman: Arkham Shadow showing Jim Gordon and another man investigating the Rat King." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YHkuBC9Z2qzF3dgQFRJn4P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, you&apos;ll also find hundreds of collectibles in Arkham Shadow, a more tangible reward for being attentive to every nook and cranny. I found a few Rat King broadcast radios and yanked them out, which felt like a more realistic thing for Batman to care about than Riddler trophies.</p><p>I asked the team whether players would have the chance to replay sections to find missed collectibles and got an immediate "No comment." Either they didn&apos;t want to say "No," or that&apos;s something they&apos;re still deciding.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Batman: Arkham Shadow gameplay focuses less on exploration and more on combat, investigation, and interactive cinematics.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Another aspect of the more on-rails Arkham Shadow experience is a slight difference in gameplay from past titles. Camouflaj says that the Arkham series is traditionally half exploration, with the other half split into cinematics, combat, Predator encounters, and boss fights. With Shadow, there&apos;s less exploration and more time spent in interactive cinematic cutscenes, as well as a greater emphasis on puzzles and investigations.</p><p>I didn&apos;t see much puzzling in the early gameplay, but it makes me optimistic, simply because the Arkham games never really had Batman live up to his "World&apos;s greatest detective" title. You turned on Detective Vision and followed a glowy line to a destination. Arkham Shadow brings back Detective Vision, but I&apos;m hoping Batman&apos;s Rat King investigation involves more thinking on the player&apos;s part.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="z9dvVxNDx8rDtDQ7LF7YiP" name="Batman-arkham-shadow-ratcatcher-still.jpeg" alt="Screenshot from Batman: Arkham Shadow showing the Ratcatcher in his cell in Arkham." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z9dvVxNDx8rDtDQ7LF7YiP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The game brings back Roger Craig Smith (Arkham Origins) as a younger Bruce Wayne and Tara Strong as Harleen Quinzel (not Harley Quinn, yet). Mark Rolston (Deathstroke) now voices Jim Gordon, Troy Baker (Joker) is a new character that I&apos;m guessing is Harvey Dent and Khary Payton (Killer Croc) now stars as Ratcatcher. Not to be confused with the brand-new Rat King, Ratcatcher is a 1988 DC villain who promises to help Batman in the game trailer.</p><p>The voice-actor continuity really hammers home the Arkham series connection; it&apos;s not going to feel like some random spinoff like a lot of VR franchise tie-ins. It&apos;ll be much longer than the PSVR Batman game (which only took a couple of hours to beat) and have proper combat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G7dMDa2H58q7EdAXKMwwQP" name="Batman-arkham-shadow-group-therapy-still.jpeg" alt="Screenshot from Batman: Arkham Shadow showing Harleen Quinzel and a group therapy session at Arkham." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G7dMDa2H58q7EdAXKMwwQP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I loved the Batman Arkham games when I was younger, I never finished Arkham Knight because the open world and side quests overwhelmed me. That holds true for a lot of games these days, where developers stretch things out to 100+ hours of the game with only a bit of core story sprinkled in with the fetch quests. And Rocksteady&apos;s live-service sequel to Arkham Knight, Kill the Justice League, didn&apos;t appeal either.</p><p>That&apos;s why Arkham Shadow has me so intrigued and ready to dive in once it launches in October. It&apos;s a story-driven experience of you (as Batman) growing into a proper superhero without a ton of fluff and padding. It&apos;s not another rehashing of the Batman/ Joker battle or other popular comic storylines. And again, the combat and predator modes were, at first glance, a blast to play.</p><p>Not every Batman fan will agree with me. Maybe you loved the old Batman games for their massive size and the chance to fight dozens of rogue&apos;s gallery boss battles. Maybe you&apos;d rather have Mark Hamill rambling and cackling instead of a brand-new baddie. And many of you would rather be pressing buttons on a controller than actually punching foes yourself.</p><p>In my case, Batman: Arkham Shadow is the kind of focused, active experience I&apos;ve been waiting for as a Batman fan.</p>

<ul><li>The Garmin fenix 8, previously MIP only, now has AMOLED models as well, making the short-lived Garmin Epix lineup defunct.</li><li>It comes with a 40-meter dive rating, built-in mic and speaker with new voice commands, new strength training plans, and a revamped map interface with "dynamic round-trip routing."</li><li>The Garmin Enduro 3 now hits 90 days or 320 GPS hours with solar charging, about double what the Enduro 2 offered thanks to a new solar panel.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Garmin has announced its new flagship fenix 8 and Enduro 3 watches with a host of hardware upgrades and exciting new software tricks. While both watches still come with battery-saving MIP displays, Garmin continued its AMOLED transition by offering the popular fenix in three AMOLED sizes, as well.</p><p>Garmin previously sold the "Epix" line as an AMOLED alternative to fenix, so I asked my Garmin rep if this news means Epix is dead. She responded, "That&apos;s correct, we&apos;re combining both Solar/MIP and AMOLED under the fenix family — which has established itself as a very reputable brand over the past decade."</p><p>The Garmin fenix 8 AMOLED arrives today in 43mm, 47mm, or 51mm sizes, while the fenix 8 Solar has 47mm and 51mm models. You&apos;ll need the 51mm AMOLED to match the 47mm Solar with a 29-day battery life; the 51mm fenix 8 Solar hits a whopping 48 days per charge.</p><p>At the same time, the MIP-only, 51mm Garmin Enduro 3 has arrived with a 90-day battery life and up to 320 GPS hours or 120 multi-band GPS hours. Garmin attributes its "larger, more efficient solar lens" that "provides more than double the solar panel of the previous Enduro model."</p><p>As always, the Garmin fenix 8 and Enduro 3 will cost you a pretty penny. The Enduro 3 is cheapest at $899, while the fenix 8 ranges from $999 to $1,199, based on size and optional titanium bezel or Sapphire lens upgrades. </p><p>We&apos;ll break down the new hardware and software tricks for both the Garmin fenix 8 and Enduro 3 below. Otherwise, Garmin is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.creacast.com/channel/garmin/">livestreaming </a>its fenix and Enduro launch at Charmonix starting at 7a ET today, if you want to get a closer hands-on look.</p>

<p>Aside from replacing the Epix series, the Garmin fenix 8 will also encroach on Descent territory: It&apos;ll have "leakproof metal buttons" and a "40-meter dive rating" with scuba and apnea dive activities added. That&apos;s in addition to the same MIL-STD-810H rating for thermal, shock, and water resistance as the fenix 7.</p><p>Like before, it&apos;ll have a built-in mic and speaker for phone calls and passthrough commands for Google Assistant, Siri, or Bixby. For the first time, Garmin is adding <em>on-watch commands</em> like "set a timer for 5 minutes," "save waypoint," or "start a strength training activity." This feature is long overdue, as much cheaper fitness brands have such commands, and I hope Garmin will bring this feature to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> and last-gen models.</p><p>What I&apos;m most excited about, however, is the new "Advanced Strength Training" update. Garmin promises that athletes will receive "targeted 4–6-week strength training plans to help meet personal goals, plus sport-specific workouts for athletes of all types, including trail runners, surfers, skiers, and more."</p><p>Many Garmin watches have thousands of animated workouts with muscle maps, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">Garmin&apos;s indoor workouts are too limited</a>: creating your own workouts is slow and you won&apos;t find a wide-enough range of premade workouts. Garmin&apos;s new advanced strength training sounds like the solution, the equivalent of a Garmin Coach cross-training calendar that adjusts based on your ability level, equipment, and favorite sports. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5373px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="LZH984yfMA3tsK5y4epCtf" name="garmin-fenix-8-product-photo-2.jpeg" alt="Photo of the Garmin Fenix 8 main watch face on an athlete's wrist." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LZH984yfMA3tsK5y4epCtf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5373" height="3022" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While only the fenix 7X and Pro had LED flashlights, it appears all fenix 8 sizes will have an LED flashlight for your nighttime workouts. And you&apos;ll now have access to the Garmin Messenger app on the watch itself, in case of an emergency.</p><p>Garmin also promises a "new map interface" for its TopoActive maps that lets you "customize map layers," but the press release doesn&apos;t elaborate how it&apos;ll work.</p><p>What&apos;s more exciting (in my mind) is the new "dynamic round-trip routing." Basically, it appears you&apos;ll be able to choose a hiking destination and intended distance, and have Garmin show you possible routes back and how long each would take. This will help keep your local park trails fresh, save you time finding new trails on Alltrails, and ensure you return to your car before it gets dark.</p><p>Those are all of the new Garmin fenix 8 features the company has revealed thus far. Otherwise, you&apos;ll find plenty of familiar training tools: Training readiness, endurance score, hill score, VO2 Max, PacePro, ClimbPro, and Garmin Coach. You also get ECG readings, HRV Status, Pulse Ox, and sleep coaching with nap detection.</p><p>Compared to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>, you&apos;ll get more advanced sports modes, TopoActive Maps, multi-band GPS, longer battery life, and a more durable design with the fenix 8 series. It&apos;s available now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1228493/pn/010-02903-00"><strong>Garmin&apos;s site for $999 and up</strong></a>; you can check the full feature and specs list at that link.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-enduro-3"><span>Garmin Enduro 3</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6884px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xPq99BprvdSR28EXvbK3GA" name="garmin-enduro-3-dynamic-routing.jpeg" alt="Photo of dynamic round-trip routing on the Garmin Enduro 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xPq99BprvdSR28EXvbK3GA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6884" height="3872" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned above, the Garmin Enduro 3 beats the Enduro 2 for solar-backed smartwatch days (90 vs. 46 days), GPS hours (320 vs. 150 hours), and multi-band GPS hours (120 vs. 81 hours), thanks to a new solar panel. </p><p>I assume it&apos;s the same revamped solar panel added to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a> in 2023, since the Enduro 2 launched in 2022. For context, that watch lasts 145 GPS hours or 36 multi-band GPS hours. The Enduro 3 costs twice as much and lasts twice as long, so you can decide if you need that extra capacity or not.</p><p>Of course, the Enduro 3 has other perks besides battery life: A titanium bezel, sapphire lens, built-in LED flashlight, and a proper 1.4-inch MIP display that can display more text than an Instinct&apos;s low-res, two-window display. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jVFERauWteBMd9toakort7" name="garmin-enduro-3-photo-led-flashlight.jpeg" alt="Photo taken at night of the Garmin Enduro 3 with the LED flashlight on." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jVFERauWteBMd9toakort7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8256" height="4644" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like the fenix 8, it has preloaded topographic, golf, and ski maps, plus the new dynamic round-trip routing and advanced strength training plan features. Also, you get ECG readings for AFib detection and a built-in LED flashlight for the first time.</p><p>Garmin says the Enduro 3 weighs 63g (I assume without the band) and ships with an UltraFit nylon band. The band-less Enduro 2 weighs 64g, so I assume the experience will feel comparable. It&apos;s also important to note that the Enduro 3&apos;s boosted battery comes from getting a few hours of sunlight per day. Depending on the conditions where you live or hike, your Enduro 3 might not last as long as what Garmin promises on paper.</p><p>Like the fenix 8, it&apos;s available now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/851039"><strong>Garmin&apos;s website for $899</strong></a>; you can also see the full list of features and specs there.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL might sound like a new addition to the family, since we&apos;ve never had a &apos;Pro XL&apos; Pixel before this, but it&apos;s actually the Pixel 9 Pro that&apos;s the new addition with its smaller screen size. The 9 Pro XL is the direct successor to the 8 Pro, but with a higher price tag and a few improvements.</p><p>Starting at $1,099, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> goes up against a formidable rival — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>. Both phones come with the same level of software update commitment, very useful AI features, premium designs, and great cameras. Picking just one is a tough call, but that&apos;s where we come in. Let&apos;s compare both to see which one would be the most practical choice.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-design-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2XTFe28XWSvVLQ4gKWJ4dm" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-display-fingerprint-sensor-01.jpg" alt="An up-close look at the new in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2XTFe28XWSvVLQ4gKWJ4dm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Design is usually a subjective matter, but I think most will agree that the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL has a more head-turning look. It&apos;s something brand new and we don&apos;t have this aesthetic anywhere outside the Pixel 9 series. We&apos;ve seen the look of the Galaxy S24 Plus on previous models and Samsung&apos;s cheaper series too. It&apos;s clean and simple, which some might actually prefer. Regardless of which design catches your fancy, you can expect excellent build quality on both with premium materials like glass and aluminum.</p><p>In terms of ease of use though, the Galaxy has the upper hand here as it&apos;s way lighter and slimmer than the Pixel. We&apos;re talking 7.7mm versus 8.5mm in thickness, and 197g versus 221g in weight. The S24 Plus does have sharper corners which we found to be a little painful when holding it. The Pixel 9 Pro XL feels better in the hand, in our experience. Both get the IP68 rating for proper dust and water-proofing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jpswqvttvAMawKsfyNmr48" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-review-7.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S24 Plus in hand with a light behind it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jpswqvttvAMawKsfyNmr48.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S24 Plus and Pixel 9 Pro XL have nearly the same screen sizes. The Pixel has a 6.8-inch Super Actua OLED display with a crisp 2,992x1,344 resolution. It gets a variable refresh rate of 1-120Hz, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for scratch protection, and a peak brightness of up to 3,000 nits. The display looks great in general and gets plenty bright too. However, Google is stuck on the 240Hz PWM dimming rate which can result in severe headaches for those sensitive to this, as our resident Pixel reviewer quickly found out.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Plus doesn&apos;t have this problem, and it matches the 9 Pro XL in terms of specs. It uses a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a sharp 3,220x1,440 resolution. There&apos;s a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz, Victus 2 scratch protection, and a peak brightness of up to 2,600 nits.</p><p>Another thing worth noting is that the 9 Pro XL&apos;s display curves a lot more along the edges than the Galaxy, which can cut off some UI elements like when gaming for instance. Both phones also use ultrasonic fingerprint sensors, but we found the Pixel to be problematic when using some screen protectors.</p>

<p>While both phones come with 2024 hardware, the Galaxy S24 Plus easily beats the Pixel 9 Pro XL when it comes to raw performance and gaming. This is largely thanks to the more potent Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, which is a lot more powerful than the Tensor G4 in the Pixel. The S24 Plus has 12GB of RAM and comes with 256GB of base storage, along with a 512GB option. Prices start at $999.99 and go up to $1,199.99 from Samsung&apos;s official site. Given that it has now been on sale for nearly half a year, you can easily find a deal on Amazon for the top variant, for well under $1,000.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL has only just launched, and unless you snagged a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-deals-pixel-9-pro-discounts">pre-order deal</a>, you&apos;ll most likely be paying full price for a while. The pricing is not great, to be brutally honest. You&apos;ll have to settle for a measly 128GB of storage for $1,099, as going to 256GB to match the Galaxy&apos;s base model would be $1,199. There&apos;s a 512GB option too for $1,319, which I don&apos;t see many opting for.</p>

<p>Battery capacities and charging speeds are also different on both phones. The Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 5,060mAh battery which can be charged at up to 37W using Google&apos;s 45W wall charger. It can also do fast wireless charging up to 23W using the Pixel Stand (2nd Gen) charger. So far in our initial review of the phone, battery life has been pretty stellar in real-world usage, similar to the Pixel 8 Pro.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Plus has a slightly smaller 4,900mAh battery, but charges at 45W wired. Wireless charging is still limited to 15W. This small dip in capacity shouldn&apos;t phase you though, as we regularly got a full day&apos;s worth of use and then some when we reviewed it.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S24 Plus packs a very similar camera setup as its predecessor, which is to say, you can expect quality shots whether day or night. It still struggles to take sharp photos of moving subjects, but this has improved compared to before. Only the main camera gets a high 50MP resolution, while the ultrawide and telephoto have a paltry 12MP and 10MP resolutions, respectively. The same goes for the selfie camera, which is just 12MP.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL is the opposite. It has either 50MP or 48MP resolutions for the rear cameras, and all three popular focal lengths are covered. Even the selfie camera is 48MP. While a direct camera comparison should prove which one is the sharper shooter, my money is on the Pixel.</p>

<p>In the update commitment department, the Galaxy and Pixel are tied. Both offer seven years of support, including OS upgrades and security patches, meaning you&apos;re good till 2031 with either phone. Depending on your flavor of Android, you could go either way here. The 9 Pro XL offers a leaner Android experience with little to no fluff and bloatware. Plus, you have access to Pixel-exclusive features like the new Add Me camera trick. Owning a Pixel means you&apos;ll be the first for updates, as well as new features that Google might add in the future.</p><p>Similarly, the S24 Plus also gets useful AI features and works best with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung&apos;s best smartwatches</a>, which are easily among the best. Even though Galaxy AI features are no longer exclusive to the S24 series, there are some very handy ones like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-chat-assist-samsung-galaxy-s24">Chat Assist</a>. The software interface is One UI, which has gotten way leaner over the years, but it&apos;s still no substitute for a true clean Android experience.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus is, by a good margin, the more sensible and practical phone. It&apos;s cheaper, has a more powerful processor that&apos;ll be relevant for longer, packs enough AI smarts to keep most happy, and Samsung has been pretty on-point with updates off late. Its design lacks the &apos;wow&apos; factor of the Pixel 9 Pro XL for sure, and its cameras are probably a notch behind what the Pixel has, but it still makes a very compelling case for itself, especially when you can have the top 512GB model for less than the starting price of the 9 Pro XL.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL is a special phone, no doubt. It offers that unique Android experience that only a Pixel can, and certain software features will probably stay exclusive to Google&apos;s own hardware. If there&apos;s a specific feature you&apos;re after that the 9 Pro XL has and you have the budget, you should be very happy with it. You could consider the standard Pixel 9 Pro too if size isn&apos;t a deterrent. But keep in mind that the new Tensor G4 is not much powerful than the G3, which wasn&apos;t a game changer to begin with. It&apos;s also thicker and heavier, the display flickering is still an issue if you have sensitive vision, and it&apos;s more expensive.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL is a fantastic follow-up to the Pixel 8 Pro, but it still falls short in key areas like gaming performance and affordability. Get it only if you absolutely must have a large-sized Pixel.</p></p>
