<ul><li>Verizon gets new AI tools to transform customer experience.</li><li>They are dubbed "Personal Research Assistant," "Fast Pass" resolution, "Segment of Me," "Problem Solver" and more.</li><li>These won't replace human jobs but rather assist them to save time and achieve complex tasks.</li></ul>
<p>Verizon announced today (May 14) that it will introduce nifty GenAI tools to transform the customer experience. The company promises that these tools won&apos;t replace human jobs but rather assist them in saving time and achieving complex tasks.</p><p>"These new tools make it simple to do business with Verizon and help reduce the cognitive load on our store and customer service partners," the company mentioned in its shared press release. First up in the lot is Personal Research Assistant, Verizon&apos;s personal assistant technology that promises to help frontline teams serve customers with accurate information by researching thousands of company&apos;s resources. These tools are believed to help its employees answer almost all queries that customers raise during support calls effectively and accurately.</p><p>Next comes the "Fast Pass" resolution, which claims to save customers precious time. It primarily uses AI to cleverly pair the customer to the relevant department or person quite easily, rather than getting assigned to a general customer representative. Additionally, Personal Shopper/Problem Solver is yet another time-saving tool for customers. It uses AI to instantly analyze a customer&apos;s profile and why they are calling. It will work alongside employees and give them a head start.</p>
<p>"Segment of Me" is another AI tool that helps customers get Verizon&apos;s personalized, unique offers and products. These can include new plans, product offers, and service upgrades, amongst others. Here, AI is promised to act accurately and proactively for customers regarding what they are looking for. Verizon notes that this increases engagement with customers, "lowered churn," and increases "overall revenue."</p><p>Brian Higgins, Chief Customer Experience Officer, Verizon Consumer, also notes, "AI is helping us not just meet expectations, but exceed them by showing our customers we&apos;ve got their back at every turn."</p>

<hr>
<p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-restarts-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-s22-rollout">resuming its One UI 6.1 update for older flagships last week</a>, Samsung is now rolling out the same treatment for the Galaxy A54 and A34.</p><p>According to X user and well-known leaker Tarun Vats, Samsung has finally rolled out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6.1</a> update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a54-5g-review">Samsung Galaxy A54</a> in South Korea. The update comes with build numbers A546SKSU4CXDC, A546SSKC4CXDC, or A546SKSU4CXD1.</p>

We expect One UI 6.1 to roll out to the Galaxy A54 and A34 in other regions in the coming days.</p><p>The latest One UI version stands out because it has provided the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>, S23, and S22 with Galaxy AI. This AI helps with things like translating languages on the fly (Live Translate), searching the web with a tap (Circle to Search), and getting help with chats (Chat Assist), among others.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ai-more-past-gen-confirmed">Galaxy S21 also received Samsung&apos;s new AI</a> but only got a stripped-down version with Circle to Search.</p><p>Even though the update doesn&apos;t have all the fancy AI features from the pricey Galaxy S models, it shows Samsung is still giving love to its mid-range users with this software upgrade.</p><p>If you have a Galaxy A54 or A34 and live in the mentioned territories, you can download and install the new update by going to the Settings app, heading to <em>Software update</em>, and tapping <em>Download and install</em>.</p>

<hr>
<p>This is a big week for artificial intelligence, as OpenAI held an event on Monday, May 13, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">Google I/O 2024</a> is taking place on May 14 and 15 as well. Although reports that OpenAI might be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-reportedly-planning-to-announce-google-search-rival-monday">prepping a search competitor</a> didn&apos;t pan out, OpenAI did launch GPT-4o on Monday. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/openai-announces-gpt-4o-promising-gpt-level-intelligence-to-everyone-including-free-users">latest AI model from OpenAI</a> is multimodal and can process combinations of vision, text, and voice input. Though it&apos;s still early, quick tests and demos of the GPT-4o model have left both users and AI researchers impressed.</p><p>Certain characteristics of GPT-4o make it more likely to displace existing products and services than any other form of AI we&apos;ve seen to date. The support for combinations of vision, text, and voice input takes the novelty factor away from hardware devices like the Humane AI Pin and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a>. Response times that are claimed to be as quick as a human when using voice have the potential to make Google Assistant look outdated. Finally, rich translation and learning features could make apps like Duolingo redundant. </p><p>We fully expect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-voice-assistant-demo-teaser-io-2024">Google to counter OpenAI&apos;s GPT-4o</a> at I/O 2024, and who knows, Google might debut an offering that&apos;s as good or better than GPT-4o. Regardless, it&apos;s time for the rest of the tech industry to start worrying about OpenAI. Up until now, there were a handful of glaring flaws with ChatGPT and GPT-4 that made it fairly easy to dismiss. Some of these still exist, but OpenAI is crossing many off the list. </p><p>Mobile AI is coming fast, and soon, features that were once exclusive to specialized hardware and software will be available right on your smartphone. That has massive implications for the tech industry, and it could displace more than just the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1219px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="ADfnbAWLWjdhaCNncfLvwB" name="Google Assistant lifestyle-2.jpg" alt="Google Assistant pop-up message" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ADfnbAWLWjdhaCNncfLvwB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1219" height="686" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has been slowly trying to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gains-more-google-assistant-features">move away from the Google Assistant</a> on its own, preferring instead to use an AI-based voice assistant like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. However, with GPT-4o, Google might not have that luxury. By all accounts, GPT-4o is the most powerful AI interface we&apos;ve seen at the consumer level to date. It can answer questions about your surroundings with vision, talk to you with audio, and respond to text. </p><p>The slow response times of AI-based voice assistants appear to be a thing of the past with the release of GPT-4o. OpenAI says that the model can deliver responses to questions asked with voice in as few as 232 milliseconds. The average response time is 320 milliseconds, according to OpenAI. The kicker? That&apos;s about the same amount of time it would take a human to come up with a response in a real-world conversation. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Say hello to GPT-4o, our new flagship model which can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time: https://t.co/MYHZB79UqNText and image input rolling out today in API and ChatGPT with voice and video in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/uuthKZyzYx<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1790072174117613963">May 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>To be fair, we won&apos;t get to see GPT-4o using voice and video in ChatGPT for real-world tests for a few weeks. However, OpenAI&apos;s demos for the feature were impressive. If real-world performance is even close to what OpenAI has demonstrated, it could be far better than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> today. </p><p>At the time of writing, Google showed off a similar multimodal AI tool in a teaser for I/O 2024, but that was pre-recorded. We won&apos;t know for sure what Google might have up its sleeve until the keynote happens. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One more day until #GoogleIO! We’re feeling 🤩.

<p>Still, it feels like OpenAI and ChatGPT are once again a few steps ahead of Google. The company scheduled its event for GPT-4o one day before Google I/O 2024, and that wasn&apos;t by accident. Now, the pressure is on Google to give us a reason why we shouldn&apos;t use ChatGPT instead of Gemini and Google Assistant.</p>
<h2 id="openai-exposes-dedicated-ai-hardware-yet-again-2">OpenAI exposes dedicated AI hardware yet again</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LDBWp434mSBxy9WEvhDzqd" name="rabbit-r1-settings.jpg" alt="Settings menu on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LDBWp434mSBxy9WEvhDzqd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, GPT-4o is also bad news for the creators of dedicated AI hardware devices. All the features that were deemed exclusive to new hardware, like the Rabbit R1 and the Humane AI Pin, will eventually be available straight on your phone through ChatGPT. The exception to this is Rabbit&apos;s Large Action Model (LAM), but until the Rabbit R1 can reliably and quickly perform actions using the LAM, it&apos;s hardly relevant. Instead of paying $200 for the Rabbit R1 or $700 for the Humane AI Pin (plus $24/month), you can get the same functionality for free on your phone. </p>

<p>A product design lead for Humane said on Monday that all internal AI pins were already running GPT-4o. However, that brings a whole new suite of issues. If the entire AI Pin software framework could be shifted to a new AI model in just a few hours, that would suggest it is heavily reliant on OpenAI software. In other words, today&apos;s developments give serious weight to the claims that the Humane AI Pin is essentially using a "wrapper" for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-now-use-chatgpt-without-an-account">ChatGPT</a>. </p><p>So, if you can get the functionality of a new AI hardware product on your phone, why wouldn&apos;t you? And if these companies are just retooling OpenAI&apos;s models, why not go straight to the source? The release of GPT-4o puts AI hardware companies — that were already in danger — in more peril. </p>

<p>Really, no one is safe from being displaced by OpenAI&apos;s dominance. The perfect example of this is Duolingo, which saw its stock drop by over seven percent almost immediately following OpenAI&apos;s event Monday. GPT-4o has impressive translation and learning capabilities, which appear to have spooked investors. When you think of OpenAI&apos;s competitors, Duolingo probably isn&apos;t the first to come to mind, and yet it was seriously affected by the GPT-4o announcement. </p><p>It goes to show that OpenAI can displace anyone, and no hardware or software product is safe. Who knows, the Google Assistant could be next. It&apos;s now up to Google to show us why it&apos;s still a force to be reckoned with in AI at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024">I/O 2024</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Lenovo and Motorola are facing a sales ban in Germany for devices with WWAN modules due to patent infringement.</li><li>The ban came after a Munich court ruled in favor of InterDigital, which claims Lenovo infringed on its WWAN patents.</li><li>The ban affects Motorola phones, including the Edge 50 series, and some Lenovo laptops, but not earbuds and chargers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Lenovo and its subsidiary Motorola are in hot water in Germany after a court banned sales of their devices with modules that are key for mobile internet.</p><p>The sales ban in Germany comes after Lenovo was found guilty of infringing on InterDigital&apos;s patents for Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) modules. In early May, InterDigital won an injunction against Lenovo, and on May 8, a Munich court enforced the sales ban after InterDigital posted a four million euro security deposit, as per a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wiwo.de/technologie/digitale-welt/neuer-streit-um-patente-vertriebsverbot-fuer-motorola-handys-und-lenovo-computer-mit-funkmodul-in-deutschland/29783960.html" target="_blank">WirtschaftsWoche</a> report (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/lenovo_and_motorola_get_a_sales_ban_in_germany-news-62825.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>Consequently, Motorola pulled all its smartphones from its German website after the court ruling. Apparently, the ban hits any Motorola phone, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-ultra-launch">the new Motorola Edge 50 series</a>, along with some Lenovo laptops that use WWAN. The company&apos;s earbuds and chargers are still good to go, though.</p><p>Speaking of Lenovo laptops, the company&apos;s website says some models with internet connectivity won&apos;t be restocked once they sell out.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Lenovo for a statement and will update the article soon. Meanwhile, Lenovo told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t3.com/news/motorola-european-ban" target="_blank">T3</a> that it disagrees with the ruling and plans to appeal.</p><p>The patent dispute is over a special kind of technology that&apos;s supposed to be available to everyone for a fair price. Basically, the company that owns it (InterDigital) can&apos;t charge an arm and a leg for it. However, Lenovo might not be happy with the price InterDigital is asking.</p><p>On the other hand, the court thinks Lenovo isn&apos;t being fair with InterDigital about the licensing terms. Lenovo argues that InterDigital is asking for way too much money, but the court disagrees.</p><p>For now, third-party retailers can still sell Motorola phones and Lenovo laptops until their current stock runs out. After that, they&apos;ll have to wait for the patent dispute to be settled before they can restock and continue sales.</p><p>This isn&apos;t the first time phone companies have gotten into trouble over patents in Europe. A couple of years ago, OPPO and OnePlus phones were pulled from several EU countries after a legal battle with Nokia. They <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-is-returning-to-europe-after-resolving-patent-disputes">eventually worked things out</a>, so hopefully that&apos;s what happens here too.</p>

<p>In the words of our very own Andrew Myrick, Chromebooks are simple, versatile laptops that can be excellent tools for students and professionals alike. These handy laptop/tablet 2-in-1s are designed to meet most of your needs on the go, like a lite portable workstation. But they&apos;re not ideal for everyone, something that I&apos;ve been coming to terms with over my time with one.</p><p>Since I travel a lot, it only made sense to get one of these sleek things myself. My everyday machine is an HP Victus 16, which is a chunky gal. It is an absolute nightmare to have to take it out of my hand carry every time I&apos;m crossing airport security, which sometimes happens multiple times on a single journey if I have connecting flights.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t expecting smooth sailing because we&apos;ve all heard that ChromeOS has its quirks. However, some people swear by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> and how capable these budget devices really are. After using a Chromebook on and off for more than a year now, I am forced to admit that it&apos;s not all rainbows and sunshine. It fails to meet my needs, and I&apos;ve come to the point where I&apos;m just going to get a Microsoft Surface instead.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="siWWHRY5jqv5zJcQSWFjpC" name="acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-review-5.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 714" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/siWWHRY5jqv5zJcQSWFjpC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ChromeOS has so much potential. It could morph into the perfect love child of Android and Windows someday. But for now, I personally feel like that day is very far off. Students might make do with a Chromebook, but working professionals are going to struggle immensely when working off of one for more than a day or two.</p><p>To be honest, my work as a writer and editor doesn&apos;t require much. But I was amazed at how annoying it was to do the simplest tasks that take me a few seconds on my Windows laptop. The ordinary task of resizing an image to a specific size or sharing files to and from a ChromeOS tablet is unnecessarily frustrating. Who would have thought that I would struggle with something as simple as editing or using the find function on slides?</p><p>Sure, there are a lot of workarounds that gap the bridge between what can and cannot be done on ChromeOS, but honestly, who&apos;s got the time for that when you&apos;re working away from home and simply don&apos;t have the time or resources at hand to put up with fixes?</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I'd rather put up with annoying security checks than feel handicapped while working abroad.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Another problem with Chromebooks is that not all accessories play nice with them. Keyboards and mice need to be prepped to work with ChromeOS. So despite having an amazing Logitech mouse, universal Android styli, and a bunch of cool mechanical Bluetooth keyboards, I was forced to purchase new companion accessories for my Chromebook. This irked me even more.</p><p>Yes, traveling with something as lightweight as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-duet-5-chromebook-review">Lenovo Chromebook Duet 5</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-review">Acer Chromebook Spin 714</a> has its conveniences. But needing to rely on a bunch of add-ons, which also need to be packed and taken along, cancels out the perks of portability. I&apos;d rather put up with annoying security checks than feel handicapped while working abroad.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1771px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tH3gggRbXvsboFE2WU3ere" name="microsoft-surface-go-3-lifestyle-1.jpg" alt="Microsoft Surface Go 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tH3gggRbXvsboFE2WU3ere.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1771" height="996" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m old-school, lazy, stupid, or a creature of habit because I&apos;d just rather buy a Windows 2-in-1 for my on-the-go work needs. This ties into why I have my eyes set on a Surface laptop — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-go-3">Microsoft Surface Go 3</a>, to be exact.</p><p>You might ask, why the Surface Go 3 specifically? See, it&apos;s the perfect substitute for a Chromebook (or maybe it&apos;s the other way around). All I need is a powerful enough tablet PC with all the apps I need for work, an ecosystem of decent companion accessories that I don&apos;t need to hunt down myself, and an easy-to-use OS that I&apos;m familiar with.</p><p>The Go 3 checks all the boxes for me, and it&apos;s pretty cost-effective, too, even if I compare it with ChromeOS machines. You can buy a keyboard, stylus, and mouse for the device if you want to use it as a laptop. The 2-in-1 can be used as a tablet, too, and because it runs Windows 11, you can use it like any other computer. On top of that, it supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">memory cards for expandable storage</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s a battle of convenience, and Microsoft has won in my eyes. A Surface simply feels more complete than a Chromebook. Of course, when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/best-windows-tablets">Windows tablet PCs</a>, there are a ton of other excellent competitors available that deliver value for money and all of the above.</p><p>Just because Windows 2-in-1s work for me and Chromebooks don&apos;t, it doesn&apos;t mean that they won&apos;t be good enough for you, though. I urge you to try using a Chromebook for a couple of months to find out whether this breed of computer is compatible with your lifestyle and needs.</p>

<ul><li>Apple and Google have partnered to create a new industry spec, called Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers, which will deliver unknown tracking notifications to both iOS and Android users.</li><li>The move comes as the Find My Device continues to roll out for Android users and more Bluetooth item trackers come into the fold. </li><li>Previously, Android users could download an app to scan for unknown Apple AirTags that may be tracking them. Now, there's true cross-platform support. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The prevalence and accuracy of cheap Bluetooth item trackers were intended to make them an easy way to keep track of your belongings. However, they&apos;ve been used for countless nefarious purposes, and personal safety is now a major concern. That&apos;s why Apple and Google have partnered to deliver an industry-wide specification for detecting unwanted item trackers, and it&apos;s called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers/01/" target="_blank">Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers</a>." Now, iOS and Android users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-and-google-deliver-support-for-unwanted-tracking-alerts-in-ios-and-android/">will all receive unknown tracker alerts</a> when conditions are met, regardless of which Bluetooth tracker or platform is used. </p><p>Google and Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-apple-partner-tackle-unwanted-location-tracking">first started work on this project</a> more than a year ago, when the companies announced in May 2024 plans to build an industry standard for unwanted item tracking. </p><p>If either iOS or Android detects that a Bluetooth tracker is moving with a user, they will provide an "[Item] Found Moving With You" notification. The alerts will work with AirTags, Find My-compatible devices, and some Bluetooth trackers compatible with Google&apos;s Find My Device network. Specifically, the brands Chipolo, Eufy, Jio, Motorola, and Pebblebee have all committed to supporting the Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers standard for future products.</p><p>When the notification appears, there will be a few steps that users can take. First, users can ignore the notification if they know about the tracker — like if they&apos;re traveling with a friend and iOS or Android detects their keys. Or, they can see the device&apos;s identifier, play a sound to help find it and take steps to disable it with instructions. </p><p>These steps will vary based on the type of tracker. For example, AirTags can be disabled in seconds by sliding the back cover off and letting the coin-cell battery pop out. </p>

<p>This is an open standard managed by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/" target="_blank">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> , and specifically the Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers working group. That means while Apple and Google are participants, the group works with widespread community and industry insight. Additionally, since it&apos;s cross-platform, more brands and OEMs can support this standard in the future. </p><p>Apple added support for the standard on Monday with the iOS 17.5 update, and Google made the tools automatically available on devices running Android 6.0 or higher. The rollout comes as users outside the U.S. and Canada have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">started to see Find My Device appear on their Android devices</a>, signifying the global deployment of this crowdsourcing network is underway. </p>

<ul><li>OpenAI today launched GPT-4o, which is a new AI model that can interact with users through audio, vision, and text. </li><li>Google appears to have a counter for GPT-4o ready to go for Google I/O 2024, which begins tomorrow. </li><li>In a teaser, Google previewed an unreleased multimodal AI interface, and said to expect announcements related to AI, Google Search, and more. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OpenAI beat Google to the punch today, hosting an event where the company released a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/openai-announces-gpt-4o-promising-gpt-level-intelligence-to-everyone-including-free-users">new AI model called GPT-4o</a>. The timing of OpenAI&apos;s event was not by accident — it came about a day before Google was set to announce artificial intelligence plans and features at the Google I/O 2024 developer conference. However, it looks like OpenAI might spend only a day as the leader in multimodal AI. In a teaser <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1790055114272612771" target="_blank">posted to X</a> (formerly Twitter), we got a look at an unreleased artificial intelligence interface running on an Android phone. </p><p>The main part of the teaser is a video that shows some sort of multimodal AI interface running on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. Visually, it looks kind of like the Pixel Camera app, and the demo shows someone asking it questions about their surroundings. In this case, it&apos;s the Google I/O stage. After correctly identifying that setup was happening for an event, this AI tool also recognized the Google I/O wordmark and explained the details of the developer conference. However, since it&apos;s a pre-recorded video, results have to be taken with a grain of salt. </p><p>Alongside the video, Google says to expect "the latest news about AI, Search, and more" at Google I/O 2024. The main keynote is set for 10 a.m. PT, and we&apos;ll be tracking all the developments in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">live blog</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One more day until #GoogleIO! We’re feeling 🤩. See you tomorrow for the latest news about AI, Search and more. pic.twitter.com/QiS1G8GBf9<a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1790055114272612771">May 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Gemini has already appeared as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">voice assistant</a>, and as a chatbot that can consume images, screenshots, and more. However, the new part of Google&apos;s teaser is that the interface now supports vision as an alternative to voice and text input. By looking through your device&apos;s camera, this AI interface can answer questions and details about your surroundings. It&apos;s similar to what the Humane AI Pin and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> tried to do with standalone devices. </p><p>However, there&apos;s still a lot we don&apos;t know, like whether this functionality would be built into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> or some other app. The demo seems impressive enough that a supercharged version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gains-more-google-assistant-features">Gemini might be ready to replace Google Assistant</a>, but that&apos;s only speculation for now. </p><p>We&apos;ll gain more clarity on what Google has been working on during Tuesday&apos;s keynote, but for now, this teaser seems to confirm a GPT-4o competitor is coming. </p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re a runner or cyclist looking for personalized guidance and comprehensive data from your smartwatch; you don&apos;t mind buying last year&apos;s fitness watch. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you can afford the Garmin Forerunner 965; you want a watch with an AMOLED display. </p><p>As we noted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-955-review">our glowing Forerunner 955 review</a> over a year ago, the Garmin watch impresses by providing an incredible amount of fitness data for runners in particular, with loads of personalized reports and Training Readiness calculations, super-accurate GNSS tracking with full-color mapping, and days upon days of battery life. </p><p>Sure, the newer Forerunner 965 is arguably a better watch than its predecessor (if you can afford it), but if you want deeply comprehensive running data for less than $500, this is the deal for you.</p>

<hr>
<p>With Google I/O hours away, a few images supposedly depicting the upcoming Pixel 9 series have leaked.</p><p>The set of images was posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rozetked.me/news/33304-eksklyuziv-fotografii-vseh-modeley-google-pixel-9-ot-rozetked">Rozetked</a> (Russian), supposedly depicting an array of live photos for the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 XL (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/mmassive-live-photo-leak-pixel-9-series/">Android Police</a>). Specifications about the devices suggest the base model will sport a 6.2-inch display, the Pro may have a 6.3-inch display, and the 9 XL could see a 6.7-inch screen.</p><p>The publication, which cites an anonymous source, says the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro are the "same size." However, the devices differ in their bezels, as the base model supposedly sports thicker ones compared to the Pro edition.</p><p>The leak continues to say that the displays for the entire 9 series can reach a 120Hz refresh rate.</p>

<p>The alleged live photos give us a much cleaner look at the Pixel 9 series&apos; back panel. The series has been rumored to boast a design change where the camera visor no longer stretches the span of the panel horizontally. These speculated live photos double down on those past rumors, which makes the phones feel more like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>.</p><p>The base model&apos;s camera specs are light, as the publication states it will offer 0.5x and 1x zoom. The Pro and XL models are said to deliver three 50MP cameras with 0.5x, 1x, and 5x zoom capabilities. Additionally, both the higher-end models could debut with UWB support.</p><p>Internally, the Pixel 9 could arrive with a RAM/storage configuration of 12/128GB. The Pro and XL could both feature 16/128GB setups. The entire series is expected to rock the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-samsung-upgraded-tensor-g4-process">Tensor G4</a>, as well. The leak adds that the base Pixel 9 could feature a glossy back panel with "matte frames." This is reportedly different than the Pixel 9 Pro, which will offer a matte back with "glossy frames."</p>

<p>The latest wave of live photos joins <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/alleged-pixel-9-pro-live-photos-surface">an earlier look from April</a> at the Pixel 9 Pro. It was previously rumored that the device would sport a 6.1-inch display, though that&apos;s seemingly not the case now as speculation floats a 6.3-inch display onto the table.</p><p>More importantly, after some rendering confusion, the idea of a potential <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">Pixel 9 XL</a> was theorized in March. The device will reportedly take the cake as the largest in the upcoming series with a 6.7-inch display instead of the previously rumored 6.5-inch screen.</p><p>Google is preparing to host its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024">I/O 2024</a> event tomorrow, May 14, at 10 am PT. The event should hold a few surprises for us and maybe even a proper look at the Pixel 9 series that&apos;s on its way for a fall debut.</p>
