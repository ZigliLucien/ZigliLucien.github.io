<ul><li>Google has started rolling out a change to its visual search history UI for Lens on the "My Activity" page.</li><li>While the list of past visual searches remains, a dedicated "Lens history" page displays all searches in a grid, with the option to "reanalyze" the photo.</li><li>Google rolled out its visual search history feature for Lens back in March and the opt-in feature let users backtrack on their searches and download the photo.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has pushed a UI redesign for its visual history page regarding a user&apos;s searches through Lens.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/23/google-lens-history-ui/">9to5Google</a>, the latest UI changes apply to Google Lens&apos; visual search history in the user&apos;s My Activity account page. The feature has gained a dedicated "Lens history" UI page, which displays all your previously camera-searched images in an image grid. Users can find this grid by tapping the clock-like icon at the top right of the Lens camera UI.</p><p>Google groups your Lens searches by month, with a similar UI to how your photo history appears in Photos. Underneath each Lens thumbnail, you can see details on the date and time the photo search was conducted.</p><p>9to5Google also discovered that if you tap an old Lens photo search, Google will "reanalyze" the data and display its results once again.</p><p>The download button for photos taken through Lens remains, though you will have to tap on the three-dot button beneath the photo.</p>

<p>The update to the visual history UI for Google Lens has started rolling on both Android and iOS.</p><p>The original version of Google Lens&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-visual-search-history-rollout">visual search history</a> arrived for accounts back in March; prior to that, Lens searches weren&apos;t saved on your device. Visual search history on Lens is an opt-in feature, found by heading into your Google account and navigating to <strong>Data & Privacy > Web & App activity > Include Visual Search History. </strong></p><p>Google Lens will only save visual searches conducted through the main Google app. Anything captured and searched through Google Photos and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> will not be displayed in its history. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold will allegedly drop its old stout shape for a taller, more square form factor.</li><li>These changes could see the cover display increase to 6.2 inches with a slightly higher resolution, much like the supposed 8-inch internal display.</li><li>Google's tease of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold confirmed both its existence and a radical change to its rear camera array.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The rumor mill won&apos;t keep quiet as another report suggests form-factor changes inbound for the next Pixel Fold.</p><p>The rumors stem from information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-pixel-9-pro-fold-display-3464091/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, which states the next Pixel Fold will move away from its stout shape. Rumors state the cover display will measure 6.2 inches, an increase over the 5.8-inch screen offered on the O.G. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>.</p><p>That change will result in a slight resolution increase, jumping from 1,080 x 2,092 to 1,080 x 2,424. The brightness could boost to 1,800 nits from 1,200, as well.</p><p>This same report suggests the internal display will take on a more square-ish shape with an 8-inch display. Its resolution would hit 2,152 x 2,076 with 1,600 nits of peak brightness, compared to the original&apos;s 2,208 x 1,840 and 1,450 nits.</p><p>Performance-wise, it doesn&apos;t seem like Google will stray from the last-generation&apos;s 120Hz refresh rate. Otherwise, it appears Google has its sights set on beating Samsung and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, since this rumored internal display would win the resolution battle.</p><p>With that said, a larger or more square display wasn&apos;t something we felt the Pixel Fold needed; our review was titled "Wider is better" for a reason! The Pixel Fold could handle apps side by side quite well, without needing any extra vertical space. Instead, we had other issues with the Fold like its shorter battery life, overheating Tensor, and typical array of Pixel bugs, which we hope the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will solve.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve heard similar reports in the past about "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-multitasking-resolution-changes-spotted">portrait foldables</a>." Allegedly, Google wants to develop a left-right app split function for users looking to multitask on a foldable phone. At the time, analyst Mishaal Rahman found a matching resolution spec of 2,076 x 2,152 for the "pixel_fold2."</p><p>Google started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-confirms-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-real-in-official-tease">teasing its next foldable</a> last week, in preparation for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">Made by Google event</a> on August 13. Along with a quick glimpse of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-official-teaser-gemini">9 Pro model</a>, Google showed an official Pixel 9 Pro Fold image that confirmed a change to its rear camera array. Where the Pixel Fold had a centered camera visor look, the 9 Pro Fold will feature a rounded-corner square array at the top left side.</p><p>Its assortment of cameras is still unknown; however, the original device features a 48MP wide-angled primary lens, a 10.8MP ultrawide lens, and a 10.8MP telephoto camera. Thankfully, we won&apos;t have too much longer to wait for the official spec list.</p>

<ul><li>Fitbit detailed several updates rolling out for its line of wearables this week, such as improved heart rate accuracy thanks to Google's machine learning.</li><li>The update brings 20 new exercise modes to the Inspire 3 while also adding automatic exercise recognition to several devices.</li><li>Fitbit is on the cusp of shutting down its Pay services on July 29 and users are advised to make the switch to Google Wallet.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Fitbit has started rolling out a host of updates for several of its wearables, which bring notable improvements and new modes.</p><p>The fitness-focused company detailed several updates in a press release shared with Android Central, starting with your health and fitness. Fitbit credits Google&apos;s "machine learning" for an update across the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">best Fitbit trackers</a> that helps them "track heart rate with improved accuracy," which provides more health insights and more accurate data like calories burned or Active Zone Minutes. </p><p>Fitbit&apos;s late July update adds 20 new exercise modes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-inspire-3-review">Inspire 3</a>, which previously could only support a few on-device exercises at a time. Additionally, owners of this device can now check the time much easier when in exercise mode. </p><p>Elsewhere, the post states most Fitbit devices can now "automatically detect" the following exercises: Rowing, elliptical, and spinning. In addition, the Inspire 3 is picking up automatic recognition for running, walking, and biking, alongside the previously stated exercises, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236725?sjid=7711890358107339149-NC#zippy=%2Ccharge%2Cace%2Cinspire">Fitbit&apos;s patch notes</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Sense 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Versa 4</a> are finally grabbing the YouTube Music app, which was added to the Charge 6 last year. This means users can scroll through their songs, play, and control them without reaching for their phones. However, users must have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music Premium</a> subscription to control their content.</p><p>A quality-of-life update for both devices sees them picking up a zoom modifier to alter the text size on the display. Plus, Fitbit claims that GPS accuracy has improved across "certain Fitbit devices," though they don&apos;t say how or which.</p>

<p>The company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236725?sjid=7711890358107339149-NC#zippy=%2Ccharge%2Cace%2Cinspire">update changelog</a> notes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Charge 6&apos;s</a> newfound recognition of exercises similar to the Inspire 3. The Charge 5 is picking up extra language support for notifications (calendar events, texts, etc.) for Hindi, Arabi, Vietnamese, and more. Additionally, users can now view their Daily Readiness Score from the small tracker after swiping up from the clock face.</p><p>These updates have already started rolling out, so users should begin receiving them on their wearables as we close the week.</p><p>It&apos;s worth reiterating that we&apos;re approaching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-pay-shut-down-later-2024-detailed">the cutoff date</a> for Fitbit Pay services. The company started emailing users earlier this year, stating its Pay services will shut down on July 29. Instead, users will have to utilize Google Wallet, to which Fitbit says this move should "benefit" them; Fitbit will also allow you to transfer your Fitbit Pay cards to Google Wallet</p><p>Amidst all of this, Google Wallet recently picked up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-american-express-fitbit-support">American Express card support</a> as Fitbit Pay&apos;s conclusion looms.</p>

We tune in every two years — no matter if it&apos;s Summer or Winter — and binge as much content as possible in the short two weeks it&apos;s available. While streaming the Olympics has been notoriously difficult in the past, NBC seems to have finally gotten its act together and is providing significantly better coverage this time around.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">AC thVRsday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC" name="ac-thvrsday-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="AC thVRsday logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">weekly column</a>, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more.</p></div></div>
<p>One of those new ways to watch is by using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5821833171264888/">Peacock app for Quest</a> which works marvelously on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> with its high-quality mixed reality cameras. Just like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/netflix-meta-quest-app-is-dead-what-next">Netflix on Quest</a>, the Peacock app lets you watch videos in several ways, from a resizable window you can bring with you like a tablet, to a giant movie theater screen for full immersion.</p><p>For me, watching the Olympics this way can make the most sense for two reasons: you want to watch something the rest of your house doesn&apos;t — there are over 32 different sports in the Summer 2024 Olympics — or when you&apos;re walking around the house, doing chores, or are otherwise occupied and need to take the video with you.</p><p>The Summer 2024 Olympics runs from July 26 to August 11 and I was able to see a handful of preliminary events through the Peacock app on my Quest before the opening ceremonies aired.</p>
<h2 id="a-more-personal-olympics-2">A more personal Olympics</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DxLaV79DatLhCzosrSZuDg" name="olympics-2024-schedule.jpg" alt="NBC's official Olympics schedule promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DxLaV79DatLhCzosrSZuDg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NBC)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To watch the Olympics in VR, you&apos;ll need the Peacock app as well as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/peacock-streaming-service-everything-you-need-to-know-about-it">Peacock Premium or Premium Plus plan</a>. A Premium plan is $7.99 per month and includes ads on some content, while Premium Plus is $13.99 and removes most ads. You can pay per year if you really enjoy the service, which will bring the cost down to as low as $6.67 "per month," if you budget it out that way.</p><p>There&apos;s no trial plan for Peacock but TomsGuide <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/entertainment/peacock/how-to-get-peacock-for-free">has some ways</a> you can get Peacock for free with other paid services. Once you&apos;ve got your subscription set, just download the Peacock app on the Meta Horizon Store and sign in.</p><p>The UI looks and works identically to how it is on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best tablets</a>, smartphones, or probably even your smart TV. That means scrolling through rows of thumbnail icons, swapping categories via tabs at the top, etc. I found using hand tracking on Quest was the perfect way to chill and watch what I wanted as it felt just like using a giant, floating tablet.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>This "grab and go" style of watching is personally the most useful for me, as it lets me move around the house without missing a moment.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>By default, the Peacock app opens up alongside any other windows you have open on Quest. Thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-july-v67-update-new-ui">new Meta Quest UI</a>, you can resize this window to your liking, snap it alongside up to two other apps or other windows, or even grab it and move it anywhere you want to float in 3D space.</p><p>Floating windows will stay in place as if you&apos;ve suspended gravity in real life, so getting up and walking around won&apos;t affect the placement. If you want to take it with you, just grab the little white bar at the bottom of the window and bring it with you just as you might grab and hold a tablet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6N38ttETrJuoTySSfu4w8c" name="olympics-peacock-quest-1.gif" alt="Watching the Olympics on the Peacock app on a Meta Quest 3 while taking the footage with me" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6N38ttETrJuoTySSfu4w8c.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This "grab and go" style of watching is personally the most useful for me, as it lets me move around the house without missing a moment. I found that if I start the same event from my phone and cast it to the TV, I can catch what&apos;s happening at the same as the rest of my family without needing to stop what I&apos;m doing.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen people do this with phones or other devices but those are awkward because you always have to find a place to prop the phone up or place it somewhere that it can be seen. Plus, since those screens are far smaller than anything you&apos;d have in mixed reality on a Quest 3, it&apos;s just less convenient than watching on a Quest.</p><p>Then there&apos;s also the neck pain factor that comes into play when craning your neck down at a smartphone or tablet screen for a long time. Since I can move the window anywhere I want in mixed reality — that means floating it just outside my normal field of view — glancing over at the screen doesn&apos;t end with me needing to go to the chiropractor later.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Wf9dgPiDEpR5shrjzgHAP" name="peacock-olympics-quest-2.gif" alt="Watching the Olympics on the Peacock app on a Meta Quest 3 in a virtual home theater" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Wf9dgPiDEpR5shrjzgHAP.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The theater mode isn&apos;t something I imagine I&apos;ll find myself using very often but I can see the appeal for some folks. Tapping that four arrows icon on the top of the Peacock app will launch theater mode with controls that are identical to watching Netflix or YouTube via a browser.</p><p>By default, the screen expands to be several hundred inches large and sits back from your face by several feet. This makes it feel like you have a wall-sized TV a few feet away from you, which is mind blowing to watch. It&apos;s also crystal clear and looks as good as any TV, in my estimation.</p><p>You can "dim the lights" in your room via the control panel that sits at the bottom of the virtual display, too making it easy to shut out most of the real world and just enjoy your favorite sport. There&apos;s also a setting for making the display curved or flat, as I know everyone seems to have a different opinion on which type of display is best.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Watching something as grand as the Olympics in a giant virtual home theater is incredible, but immersive 180-degree or 360-degree video would have made this even better.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But the experience isn&apos;t perfect and it doesn&apos;t completely live up to some of my expectations. Being able to take the coverage with me around the house is brilliant, and watching that same coverage in a personal movie theater is unforgettable, but if I&apos;m doing this in VR I want to feel like I&apos;m <em>really</em> there.</p><p>Having some sort of immersive coverage would have been amazing. Even if it&apos;s not 360-degree video, some kind of 180-degree footage would have been a brilliant way to get people to give Peacock in VR a try and experience something entirely <strong>new</strong> rather than a more convenient or personal version of an existing experience.</p><p>This, of course, highlights the difficulty of the "chicken & egg" scenario where the cost of producing 180 or 360-degree videos like this might not be financially worth it now but the existence of these experiences would likely pay off in the future as new buyers are spurred on by unique new content.</p><p>Until then, though, I&apos;ll just enjoy my favorite Olympic sports while working or doing chores over the next two weeks from the comfort of my headset. There&apos;s nothing like having that TV you can take anywhere with you!</p>

<ul><li>Zach Nelson of JerryRigEverything put the Galaxy Z Flip 6 through rigorous durability tests.</li><li>Like the Galaxy Z Flip 5 last year, the Z Flip 6 managed to withstand several tests to its glass and improved hinge.</li><li>The teardown also showcased the Z Flip 6's other components and waterproofing protections.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s latest Galaxy Z Flip 6 has passed Zack Nelson&apos;s durability test on YouTube, and the fifth iteration of the clamshell phone also turned out to be promising in terms of build quality.</p><p>Zach Nelson published the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/d1f8i-Y3zdU">durability test</a> on his popular YouTube channel JerryRigEverything. Nelson started the test with the foldable screen, which showcases similar internal screen warnings to the predecessor Galaxy Z Flip 5: you should not press the screen too hard, remove the protective film, or let dust into the screen before you fold it closed.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d1f8i-Y3zdU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Nelson uses a scratch test system that puts increasing pressure on glass to see what it can withstand. Like last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, the Z Flip 6&apos;s inner screen can only withstand a "level 2" scratch before seeing permanent damage, while the cover screen only shows damage with his hardest "level 6" scratches, thanks to the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection.</p><p>The all-around armored aluminum frame, however, appears to be scratchable throughout, an argument for adding a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cases">Galaxy Z Flip 6 case</a>.</p><p>Thankfully, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 survived Nelson&apos;s sand test, during which he poured sand all over the main display, cover screen, and hinge. While the debris added a "groaning sound" to the hinge, it otherwise remained unimpeded, suggesting it&apos;ll survive a trip to the beach.</p><p>It even managed to survive his "reverse bend" test, where he tries to unflip the phone the incorrect way to see if it breaks. He praised Samsung&apos;s "wizardry" for keeping the display and hinge intact, where other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> might have snapped in two.</p><p>Nelson praised how the Z Flip 6&apos;s crease is significantly less visible than it was on the Z Flip 5. Our managing editor, Derrek Lee, also observed this in his initial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6 review</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4206px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LJz33H2ujQaKK5kQ3vJgQX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-26.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 display folded at an angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LJz33H2ujQaKK5kQ3vJgQX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4206" height="2366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nelson then starts peeling the plastic layers one by one, which showcases Samsung&apos;s incorporation of layers under the foldable screen, ultimately revealing the Ultra-Thin Glass (UTG). Interestingly, the new, improved hinge design is also seen after the last layer of the foldable screen is removed. </p><p>After his durability test, Nelson removed Z Flip 6 parts like the front display to show the components underneath. According to him, you can easily replace the dual lithium batteries in both parts of the foldable phone, a good sign for repairability. He also found a large vapor chamber under the cover screen and battery; it&apos;s the first time that Samsung has incorporated a vapor chamber for a Flip phone.</p><p>The other components of the device include the speakers, wireless charging coil, charging port, vibrator, and waterproofing screen to keep the water out, which are also showcased in the video.</p><p>It&apos;s encouraging to see that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 managed to survive this teardown, though you&apos;ll need to be careful with the internal display. Samsung made a point of adding dust resistance up to 1mm particles to this phone for the first time, proving that foldables can become more durable than they&apos;ve historically been.</p>

<hr>
<p>With July winding down, Google is highlighting an update to Gemini that quickens its response time and extends it to more places.</p><p>As noted in a press release, Gemini&apos;s latest updates kick off with the debut of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">1.5 Flash model</a>. Google states this version of Gemini has been "optimized for speed and efficiency" as the AI can respond to your queries faster. The model has also been granted a 4x large context window, which helps Gemini understand, process, and answer your complex questions more easily.</p><p>The 1.5 Flash model is picking up a Gemini Advanced feature, which lets users upload files to the AI via their Drive or from their devices.</p><p>Gemini&apos;s fastest model is rolling out on the web and Android today (July 25). Users can find the AI available in 40 languages across 230 places.</p>

<p>Google also announced that Gemini is on the way to more places and people following today&apos;s updates. To start, the AI model is making its debut in Messages in the European Economic Area (EEA), the U.K., and Switzerland. New languages are also receiving support, with Google stating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-you-to-text-gemini-in-google-messages">Gemini in Messages</a> now supports French, Polish, and Spanish.</p><p>The main Gemini Android app is also rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/14579026?visit_id=638574456988887950-2640642685&p=gemini_app_location&rd=1">in more countries</a>. The other side of this is Google&apos;s expansion of its model to teen users. Those who meet the minimum age requirement (13) can begin accessing Gemini for help regarding homework, paper writing, and more.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-for-students-educator-features-detailed">recently previewed this expansion</a>, stating Gemini would also enter the school system to aid teachers and students alike. Google stated that it had implored guardrails to ensure that young users aren&apos;t exposed to inappropriate content when asking questions. Gemini for teens is set to arrive "in the coming week" in August.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1074px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.87%;"><img id="zCfU6z3gEVjNaTxkv3TKE6" name="google-gemini-fact-checking-example.jpg" alt="Google's Gemini picks up a fact checking chip for users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zCfU6z3gEVjNaTxkv3TKE6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1074" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, Google is bolstering the ability for users to fact-check Gemini. Arriving for English prompts first, Gemini chats will now display an arrow icon beside certain responses. The post adds that clicking or tapping on this chip will expand the response, showcasing where Gemini got its (hyperlinked) information from.</p><p>These links will display the website&apos;s icon (if available), the title of the article, and the website&apos;s URL. Moreover, if Gemini pulls any information from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini#:~:text=how%20to%20control-,Gemini%20Extensions,-to%20other%20Google">your connected extensions</a>, you&apos;ll see those listed alongside any relevant links.</p><p>Users will be familiar with this style of fact-checking as Google Search&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overviews-test-expansion">AI Overviews</a> feature them. During a response, Search will display its collected assortment of information relevant to your question. However, expanding the box will showcase any relevant links to the source material.</p><p>This final update is rolling out today on Gemini.</p>

<ul><li>Amazon detailed several changes on the way for Prime Video viewers in "the coming weeks."</li><li>Prime Video is set to pick up a navigation bar with pre-made options, a new "Prime" choice, and add-on subscriptions from other services for easier access.</li><li>Amazon is also revamping how recommended content is understood and displayed for users browsing different categories and topics.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amazon has prepared a host of updates for its Prime Video service, one of which is a UI upgrade that users will immediately notice.</p><p>The company detailed what&apos;s next for Prime Video in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-updated-steaming-experience">a blog post</a>, starting with a "content-forward" navigation bar. The bar is placed at the top of your display and features the following pre-made options: Home, Movies, TV Shows, Sports, and Live TV. Amazon states users will notice a "Prime" option, which is packed with content available to you "at no extra cost."</p><p>Active add-on subscriptions to other services like Crunchyroll or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/paramount-plus">Paramount Plus</a> will appear beside the Prime option for easier access. As such, what you were previously watching or what&apos;s recommended will appear as the hero image below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:711px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.84%;"><img id="8THgpxDoYH4pMZ5WuQfe9j" name="amazon-prime-video-new-ui-add-on-content.jpg" alt="Amazon's Prime Video UI updates displays add-on subscriptions in the top nav bar." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8THgpxDoYH4pMZ5WuQfe9j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="711" height="397" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The recommendations viewers will see have been given a heavier personal touch based on your interests and history. Amazon states that it now takes advantage of Generative AI to help users find "content that&apos;s relevant." Users browsing the "Made for You" section for movies and shows will notice simplification as Prime Video categorizes content based on your interests.</p><p>Additionally, users can find new content with the "Top 10 in the U.S." and "Trending Shows" categories in Prime Video. Movie and show descriptions have also become more concise due to Amazon leveraging LLMs (large language models).</p><p>Some smaller refinements to Prime Video enter by way of smoother animations. TVs are preparing to receive an auto-playing hero rotator. Amazon states this is designed to give users an "immersive experience" when trying to pick a show or movie to watch. Hopping into Live TV will play recommended 24/7 stations until users pick a station or leave the tab.</p><p>Amazon adds that these updates have considered its older streaming devices alongside the latest models to ensure a seamless experience. The post informs users that the updated UI will begin appearing "in the coming weeks."</p><p>The updates to Amazon Prime Video come a couple of months after the brand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-prime-video-interactive-ads">introduced interactive ads</a>. The goal is to aid users in shopping while watching shows as the ads will appear as 15 to 30-second breaks. Moreover, these interact ads will appear whenever a viewer pauses their content with details about the brand to help shoppers make an informed decision.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is said to be ramping up Galaxy Ring production due to high demand, increasing its initial plan by 600,000 units.</li><li>Suppliers were reportedly instructed to boost production by 150%, potentially shipping over a million units by year-end.</li><li>The smart ring is now available in the U.S., but with low stock and delivery dates stretching into late August.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is reportedly ramping up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> production as early market signals show the smart ring is surpassing expectations.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4920" target="_blank">The Elec</a>, Samsung originally planned to produce 400,000 Galaxy Rings. However, due to unexpected demand, it has increased that number by 600,000 units.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s July Unpacked event was a big deal, packed with game-changing innovations. Among other devices launched during the show, the Galaxy Ring stole the limelight, catching everyone&apos;s eye since its debut. Even though it was teased earlier this year, Samsung kept the specs and launch date a secret until the much-awaited July reveal.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring blew past all expectations, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-cant-ship-the-galaxy-ring-fast-enough-shows-how-theyre-an-in-thing">selling out in the preorder phase</a>. It&apos;s clear that demand for Samsung&apos;s new wearable technology is way higher than initially thought.</p><p>Now, industry insiders say Samsung has told suppliers to boost Galaxy Ring production by 150% due to huge consumer interest. If true, the South Korean tech giant could ship over a million units by year-end, as per The Elec.</p><p>Meanwhile, Finnish wearable company Oura <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220405006108/en/On-the-Heels-of-1-Million-Rings-Sold-Oura-Now-Valued-at-2.55-Billion" target="_blank">surpassed 2.5 million units for its smart ring in 2022</a>. While impressive, it took the company seven years to reach its first million.</p><p>Oura pioneered the smart ring category nearly a decade ago, keeping it a niche market. But with Samsung now entering the scene, this technology could go mainstream.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring stands out from other smart rings by offering no subscription fees, a battery life of up to a week, and personalized recommendations and insights powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>.</p><p>Priced at $399, the smart ring is now available in the U.S. But with stock running low and delivery dates pushing into late August, buyers should act fast to secure their size.</p><p>Despite Samsung&apos;s push to speed up production and meet the high demand for the Galaxy Ring, consumers might still face stock shortages in the short term as the company tries to restock.</p>
