While phone designs and hardware haven&apos;t changed too much, the one area that is seeing continual improvement is mobile imaging, with Chinese brands in particular pushing the boundaries of camera tech.</p>

<p>Devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">OPPO Find X7 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro</a> all have outstanding cameras, and while there are differences between each device, you&apos;re guaranteed to get great shots regardless of whichever phone you choose. And while Chinese brands are doing a decent job with software, there&apos;s still some way to go in this area.</p><p>I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-review">Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR</a> extensively in recent weeks, and the device has a lot to offer; it combines distinctive styling with terrific cameras, but Honor&apos;s MagicOS is irksome to use at times, and it misses out on a few basics. That&apos;s why I decided to switch back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> once I was done with the current review cycle.</p><p>I&apos;ve always gravitated to Pixels; in previous years, Pixel devices got the most amount of usage out of all other phones. The reasoning is simple: I like Google&apos;s vision of Android, and the Pixel&apos;s clean interface coupled with unique software extras makes it the ideal choice for my own use case.</p><p>I&apos;ll freely admit that the Pixel 8 Pro doesn&apos;t have the best feature-set: the OLED panel doesn&apos;t get as bright as 2024 phones, the hardware is hilariously unsuited for gaming, the battery doesn&apos;t last as long, and 30W charging is pitifully slow. From just a hardware point of view, it is objectively worse.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TmopkaobwSLhDg7jgXCAAc" name="google-pixel-8-pro-phone-pile-6.jpg" alt="Pixel 8 Pro next to 2024 phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TmopkaobwSLhDg7jgXCAAc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google doesn&apos;t even have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best cameras</a> in the industry. Chinese brands have made greater strides in this regard over the last 15 months, and the switch to massive 1-inch sensors combined with overhauled camera tuning means the likes of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, Find X7 Ultra, and Magic 6 Pro take much better photos than the Pixel 8 Pro in any given scenario.</p><p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra in particular is terrific, and the Magic 6 Pro somehow manages to take outstanding photos of fast-moving objects. Out of all the phones I used this year, I liked the cameras on the Find X7 Ultra the best — I prefer its color vibrancy to that of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, and the phone does a better job with portrait shots in challenging scenarios.</p><p>But I don&apos;t care about any of that. What the Pixel 8 Pro lacks in hardware prowess it more than makes up for in the software, and that ultimately is the differentiator. The Find X7 Ultra&apos;s interface is fluid like no other phone around, but trying to wrestle the Chinese ColorOS build to do what I wanted became a constant source of frustration. Same with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra — Xiaomi&apos;s long-awaited software overhaul isn&apos;t meaningfully different, and if anything, it is more annoying to use.</p>

<p>The Pixel 8 Pro, meanwhile, manages to deliver an overall experience that&apos;s just better than other devices. The software doesn&apos;t have as many features as its rivals, but the ones Google included inevitably get a lot of use; I like At A Glance and Now Playing and constantly utilize both features, Recorder is my go-to choice to record and transcribe interviews, and all the AI-infused camera features that debuted in the Pixel 8 Pro are fantastic to use.</p><p>While a lot of brands are bundling AI into just about every product they can imagine, I like what Google did in this area. Best Shot, Audio Magic Eraser, and Magic Editor are all useful features that make a difference in how I take and edit photos and videos, and I even get a lot of utility out of Video Boost.</p><p>There&apos;s also the fact that I like the Material You interface; it is quirky and playful, and it does a great job with the basics: notification management, UI navigation, and security. </p><p>I know it isn&apos;t for everyone, but for what I need from a phone, the Pixel 8 Pro continues to be the perfect choice.</p>

Specifically, he explained how the higher-end SXR2350 will support 16GB of RAM, UFS 4.0 storage, and 4K screens. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">'Project Matrix' https://t.co/wO4jAXnyZ0<a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1791626922645954608">May 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>More recently, VR analyst Brad Lynch shared a leaked cargo manifest showing that Qualcomm is shipping out the SXR2350 chip — likely called the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 3 — for "testing and integration in future HMDs."</p><p>Lynch speculates that it&apos;ll be "nearly identical" to the XR2+ Gen 2 in features and bandwidth, but use the Oryon CPU found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite</a> instead of Arm Cortex cores, plus a more energy-efficient GPU. </p><p>Qualcomm is "shipping these much faster than the gap between Gen 1 and Gen 2," Lynch points out in the same thread, arguing that "there must be (a) huge demand for something better" than the XR2+ Gen 2. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My personal speculation* on what changes we will see in this chip (probably next year):- Orion CPU cores (the biggest change)- More power efficient GPU at similar graphic performance as XR2 Gen 2- nearly identical XR features/bandwidths as XR2 Gen 2<a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1792814078089691289">May 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Meta Quest Pro</a> used the XR2+ Gen 1, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> uses the XR2 Gen 2, which gives it strong gaming performance. The XR2 Gen 3 (no "+") would theoretically target the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Quest 4</a>, but that&apos;s not expected to arrive for years.</p><p>Qualcomm only announced the upgraded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2</a> in January 2024, with Samsung, Sony, and HTC Vive committing to use this chip in future productivity headsets that require more power. As of yet, none of them have shipped. </p><p>Qualcomm says the XR2+ Gen 2 can support 4.3K per eye resolution, 12 concurrent cameras, and 15% & 20% boosts to GPU and CPU frequency, respectively, over the XR2 Gen 2. It&apos;s certainly an upgrade, but not a drastic shift in power. The leaked XR2+ Gen <strong>3</strong> could change that. </p>
<h2 id="early-testing-or-a-rapid-fire-shift-2">Early testing or a rapid-fire shift?</h2>
<p>Multiple leakers agree that the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 3 is coming. The question is, why so soon after the XR2+ Gen 2 announcement?</p><p>This new chip&apos;s power makes it well-suited for productivity headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2">Meta Quest Pro 2</a>, with its rumored 3,840 x 3,840 resolution — but LG has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2-new-display-delay">delayed it until 2027, reportedly</a>. Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">Meta Horizon OS</a> headsets could use it, like Lenovo&apos;s XR productivity headset. But that might not arrive for some time, either. </p><p>At present, devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung&apos;s 2024 XR headset</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-announces-high-end-xr-headset-to-compete-with-apple-vision-pro">Sony&apos;s spatial XR headset</a> are slated to use the XR2+ Gen 2. So why send the XR2+ Gen 3 out to HMDs if they&apos;re still finalizing their Gen 2 headsets? </p>

<p>I can only think of two possibilities: (A) Samsung and Co. asked for a chip with more power and will skip the Gen 2 after all, or (B) Qualcomm itself wants to persuade these brands to try its newer, better tech, now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 will use Oryon</a> later this year.</p><p>The Apple Vision Pro used an M2 chip found in MacBooks, making it difficult for other productivity headsets to compete. Charging a laptop-level price for productivity headsets with Snapdragon XR2 chips — essentially redesigned versions of mobile chips found in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> — is a tall ask for consumers.</p><p>If the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 3 has Snapdragon X Elite-quality performance with better RAM, then maybe Samsung would delay its headset into 2025 to see a greater chance of success. We&apos;ll have to wait and see whether the XR2+ Gen 2 actually sees the light of day or not, if the Gen 3 has supplanted it. </p>

<p>Google is preparing to create more "opportunities" for consumers seeking information through Search with ads.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/ai-creativity-google-marketing-live/">Keyword</a> blog post, Google advised users that it will soon begin testing "Search and Shopping" ads in its AI Overviews. The company explained that ads will surface in these overviews via their own sub-section labeled "Sponsored." Ads will only appear if they are relevant to what the user is looking for and the information that artificial intelligence managed to gather.</p><p>For example, Google searched for ways to get wrinkles out of clothes. While the AI-backed overview delivered a few quick solutions and websites to help, the ads were listed at the very bottom. The section was described as "products to unwrinkle your clothes," followed by a horizontally scrolling carousel of "relevant" products.</p><p>Google states that advertisers don&apos;t need to do anything to get these ads to function properly.</p><p>Moreover, the company cites prior testing and feedback from SGE users as part of its decision to implement ads. Google said, "we’ve heard that people find the ads appearing above and below the AI-generated overview helpful."</p><p>Ads in AI Overviews are slated to begin with U.S. users before arriving elsewhere. However, the company did not state when this is set to begin.</p>

<ul><li>The LG-made Meta Quest Pro 2 has been delayed until sometime in 2027.</li><li>LG said it's "controlling the pace" of its releases, suggesting that Meta and LG are working to keep from releasing too many Horizon OS-powered headsets at once.</li><li>A new 4K LG Micro OLED display was also recently announced, suggesting that this headset might be using that technology.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta&apos;s first enterprise-level headset, the Meta Quest Pro, may not have sold as well as the company originally hoped, but that&apos;s not stopping it from forging ahead with a second-generation model. The only downside is that would-be customers are going to have to wait until 2027 to find out if it&apos;s really better than the original 2022 release.</p><p>The report of the delay comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sedaily.com/NewsView/2D990BASDR">Seoul Economic Daily</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/lg-meta-quest-pro-2-delayed-to-2027/">UploadVR</a>) and notes that LG has delayed the headset for roughly two years, as it was originally set for a 2025 release date. That would have made it a nice follow-up to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung XR headset</a>, which is said to be released later this year and is built on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-meta">Google&apos;s new Android XR platform</a>.</p><p>LG&apos;s headset, by comparison, will be using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">Meta&apos;s Horizon OS</a>, the same software that runs today&apos;s Meta Quest headsets, albeit likely customized a bit to make it look and feel more like a business-class headset. LG told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-05-20/business/tech/LG-pumps-brakes-on-Meta-partnership-as-headsets-struggle-to-sell/2050663">Korea JoongAng Daily</a> that it&apos;s delaying the release to "control its pace," referring to slow ultra-premium headset sales and likely the fact that several Horizon OS headsets are set to debut over the next year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="oHVzCuKbUU29siZu8hgbMj" name="Meta-Quest-Pro-hands-on-partial-light-blocker-02.jpg" alt="Partial light blockers on the Meta Quest Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oHVzCuKbUU29siZu8hgbMj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regardless of the release date, though, the upcoming LG-built Meta Quest Pro 2 could feature LG&apos;s latest display technology. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/lg-next-generation-micro-oled-display-vr/">UploadVR</a> describes it as a proper 4K micro OLED display featuring a resolution of 3840×3840 per eye. By comparison, the Apple Vision Pro&apos;s micro OLED display is 3660×3200 per eye, while the Meta Quest 3 is 2064x2208 per eye.</p><p>The new LG display features 10,000 nits of brightness, which sounds incredibly excessive at first but makes sense when you consider other factors. Pancake lenses like the ones used on Apple Vision Pro or the Meta Quest 3  essentially "eat" light as it&apos;s passed through, meaning the amount of light that eventually reaches your eye is reduced by as much as 90%.</p><p>In addition, VR headsets use a technology called "low persistence" that&apos;s somewhat similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM flickering</a>, meaning the pixels turn off several times per second before illuminating again. Low persistence differs from PWM on phone displays because the tech is used to reduce motion blur rather than control brightness.</p><p>Although the technique is similar to PWM, it further reduces the perceived brightness. On Apple Vision Pro, this means the headset&apos;s 5,000 nit display is taken down to a whopping 100 perceived nits once the light reaches your eyes. In other words, you need an "absurdly" bright display behind those lenses to make a display bright enough.</p><p>This, combined with the resolution mean the LG-made Meta Quest Pro 2 could have the best looking VR headset display if nothing better launches between now and then.</p>

<ul><li>The latest version for the Google app's beta contains signs of several new features on tap for Circle to Search.</li><li>A "listen" button was discovered, which could let Google read what they've highlighted aloud, alongside a "select all" option for text.</li><li>The app also showed signs of a "save" button, which would let users take snapshots of whatever they've highlighted and save it in the Google app for later.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s beta app displays signs of new features when tapping for its Circle to Search feature on Android.</p><p>Discovered by AssembleDebug in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-three-new-features-teardown-3445102/">Android Authority</a>, Circle to Search is preparing to receive "listen" and "select all" buttons. With these found within the app&apos;s v15.20.36.29 beta code, there wasn&apos;t a way to produce them in real-time. However, there&apos;s speculation that Google could take a page from its Lens feature to make them work.</p><p>The "listen" button could refer to users&apos; soon gaining the ability to let Google read aloud a selection of highlighted text, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-google-lens-search-images-text-simultaneously">like Lens</a>.</p><p>The other function, "select all," is rumored to highlight all relevant text visible through your phone&apos;s camera or a taken image.</p><p>Google&apos;s app beta also points toward a "save" button after circling a section of an image to search. The tipster was able to get this to work, and its demo showed that the save option will appear alongside pre-existing functions like select text, copy, and share.</p><p>These small screenshots are then saved into the "saved" tab of the main Google app, instead of taking up space on your device in Photos or elsewhere. The tipster states screenshots through Circle to Search will be placed in a new "uploaded images" album.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WMab7m8CVng8rUHffk5bgR" name="Google-Pixel-6a-google-search-bar-home-screen.jpg" alt="Google Search bar on the home screen of the Google Pixel 6a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WMab7m8CVng8rUHffk5bgR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;ll likely take a while longer until these features arrive, considering the "listen" and "select all" functions are still deep in development.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google rolled out Circle to Search <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-users-can-finally-use-circle-to-search-on-android-14">on the Pixel Tablet</a>. Users with Android 14 on the device circle or highlight anything on their device to quickly run a query through Search. While the company has remained somewhat consistent in bringing the feature to other Pixels, the feature doesn&apos;t work for the tablet&apos;s split-screen mode.</p><p>Google stated it is looking into implementing support for split-screen mode "in a future update." Such support is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-phones-may-soon-let-you-use-circle-to-search-in-split-screen-mode">already being tested</a> for Pixel phones as of the Android 15 Beta 1.2 update.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus found testing a new repair mode on its latest flagship.</li><li>The recent Android 15 beta has introduced the feature on the OnePlus 12.</li><li>The official rollout of the feature is expected with OxygenOS 15 later this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Repair mode is an essential feature for phones that will help users hide their data whenever they send their devices to service centers for repair. The latest Android 15 beta has enabled the feature for the flagship OnePlus 12.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-12-repair-mode-android-15-beta-3444848/">Android Authority</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, which received the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-brings-android-15-beta-1-to-oneplus-12-and-oneplus-open-users">first Android 15 beta</a> alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, has now gained a new Repair mode feature on the flagship phone. It is similar to the Repair mode on Pixel devices, next to Maintenance Mode on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a>.</p><p>The first Android 15 beta users on the OnePlus 12 can head over to the device’s <strong>Settings> System & updates> Repair mode</strong>, which can be seen right under the Developer Options.</p>

<p>According to the publication&apos;s screenshots, the Repair mode can be enabled before users take their flagship for repair, and they can hide their personal information, including photos, videos, contacts, SMS messages, and chats.</p><p>However, repair personnel can use essential functions required for troubleshooting, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, mobile data, and phone calls. OnePlus 12 users are still advised to back up their phones before entering repair mode. </p><p>Strong Lock screen password is another parameter that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phone</a> owners should be aware of before submitting their device to the personnel via repair mode. Overall, the functionality certainly adds privacy when submitting devices to repair personnel.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the instructions are similar to those on Pixel and Galaxy phones. While the former opts for Dynamic System Updates, the latter allows users to create a new profile. Samsung was one of the first OEM makers to introduce a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-one-ui-5-maintenance-mode">Maintenance mode</a> in OneUI 5.0 (Android 13-based). Google picked up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/repair-mode-for-google-pixel-phones">Repair mode</a> in Android 14 back in December 2023.</p><p>While it is encouraging to see OnePlus opting for Repair mode in the latest Android 15 beta, Android Authority notes that there’s a catch with the approach on the OnePlus 12. In Galaxy and Pixel phones, the respective repair mode takes the device to the home screen.</p>
<p>In the OnePlus 12’s case, the repair mode brings the device to a phone setup stage wherein users have to follow a process similar to setting up a new device. While users can still skip these steps, it still takes some time compared to the aforementioned process.</p><p>Since it is the first time that OnePlus is bringing a Repair mode in the first Android 15 beta, it is still likely in the testing phase, and it presumably would be hassle-free when the rollout happens officially with the OxygenOS 15 later this year.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google unveiled its plan to inject artificial intelligence into Search, the company&apos;s main business, at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O 2024</a>. AI overviews are rolling out at the very top of search results pages for all users in the U.S. as of last week. These overviews first appeared as tests for a limited number of users, and is also known as the Search Generative Experience. Now that Google is going all-in on generative AI in Google Search, it is under immense pressure to get it right. </p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">putting AI overviews at the top of all search results</a> pages brings up a few key questions, like whether these summaries are outright plagiarism, how publishers will be compensated, and why users would even click webpages anymore. The stakes are high because, as Google&apos;s own AI overview explains, Google is the biggest referrer of web traffic on the internet — and it really isn&apos;t close.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5443px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Junb4VSDL3zmmUMuxggTjX" name="Google-Web-Traffic-AI-Overview.jpg" alt="An AI overview explaining web traffic data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Junb4VSDL3zmmUMuxggTjX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5443" height="3061" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s easy to see why people in the online media and publishing industry are worried. If Google is summarizing content and giving people the answers they need right in an AI overview, there&apos;s little reason for users to click through to the original source. </p><p>To the company, this is by design. Google wants to be the only site you need, explaining that soon, "Google will do the searching, simplifying, researching, planning, brainstorming and so much more."</p><p>The problem is that if Google completely cuts out publishers and disincentivizes people from creating original content, it will end up cannibalizing its own business model. There won&apos;t be new content to train AI models, which will make the overall quality and effectiveness of features like Search Generative Experience worse. </p><p>Digital ad revenue will drop alongside the cratering web traffic caused by reliance on AI overviews in Search and fewer webpage clicks. Both of these things could be disastrous for Google, yet it&apos;s the company that might be causing them to happen. </p>
<h2 id="google-makes-money-off-ads-so-how-does-it-earn-from-ai-overviews-2">Google makes money off ads, so how does it earn from AI overviews?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="z6tvCEtF9C5BiHta3vMEoh" name="google-io-google-logo.jpeg" alt="Google's "G" logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z6tvCEtF9C5BiHta3vMEoh.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3200" height="1801" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has dipped its toe in just about every part of the tech industry, from hardware, to software, to services. But none of its businesses are more lucrative than Search, and by extension, advertising. Last year alone, Google earned $237.86 billion from digital advertising, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/" target="_blank">Statista</a>. Many online publishers use Google Ads, so the ads you see on the sites you visit may be supplied by Google. </p><p>The conundrum here is obvious. If the primary way Google earns revenue is through advertisements on websites, how will the company continue to make money if people stop clicking on webpages? </p><p>AI overviews aim to give users the answer to their query straight from Google using generative AI. There are surely benefits to this for Google, such as cutting out the person in the middle. Any revenue Google might earn from AI in Search would go directly to the company instead of being split with publishers. </p><p>The question of how Google makes money from AI overviews is still unanswered. I&apos;m inclined to think that Google cares about collecting user data more than anything else. While it won&apos;t directly earn ad revenue from AI overviews in Google Search, it will still collect data. The tricky part is that the main purpose of Google&apos;s data collection is to serve personalized ads to users. If people aren&apos;t clicking on actual websites and seeing personalized ads, it doesn&apos;t matter how much data Google collects — there won&apos;t be any advertisements to serve.</p><p>There are other ways Google could increase revenue from SGE, and e-commerce looks to be a big one. </p><p>At I/O 2024, the company announced that Google Shopping is getting AI-based features, and that could be a growth opportunity. There were also rumors that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-reportedly-weighing-making-search-generative-experience-a-paid-feature">Google could charge for SGE</a>, though it denied that possibility, at least for now. </p><p>Regardless, there are a lot of unknowns about what might happen to the internet if AI summaries take over. Google, with a rich advertising business clearing over $200 billion annually, seems to have more to lose than it does to gain if things are disrupted. </p>
<h2 id="ai-models-constantly-need-to-source-new-information-2">AI models constantly need to source new information</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb" name="Google-Gemini-app-home-page.JPG" alt="The Google Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1910" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the large language models (LLMs) that power AI chatbots and features may have large context windows, they are outdated as soon as they are released. For example, the knowledge cutoff date for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> is early 2023. By comparison, OpenAI&apos;s knowledge cutoff date for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">GPT-4</a> is April 2023. If you ask any AI model what happened last week, last month, or even this time last year — it&apos;ll be clueless. </p><p>The knowledge and effectiveness of AI depends on the new information that it is trained on and that it can tap into. For example, some AI chatbots are able to answer questions about recent events using web results on the internet. Someday, GPT-5 or a future Gemini model will be trained on a newer data set, extending its knowledge cutoff date. It&apos;ll know more about recent events, because human authors, researchers, and publishers have given it data to learn from. </p><p>There&apos;s one key component to the success of AI, and that&apos;s new content. Without new content being created, artificial intelligence models will completely stagnate and won&apos;t be able to answer questions regarding new information. The end goal for AI development is what is known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. When or if AGI is reached, AI models will function more like human intelligence. Until then, AI is just an incredibly good pattern-matcher that is only as knowledgable as the information it is trained with. </p><p>Again, the problem here is quite obvious. If Google&apos;s plan for Search involves AI overviews that eliminate the need for users to visit websites, there will be little financial incentive for new content to be created. Without new content, AI models will become less and less informed, and they will fail. That&apos;s why Google&apos;s strategy of effectively replacing online publishers is a shortsighted one. Unless companies find a way to compensate publishers for the content that is being used to train AI models, they&apos;ll just stop making that content. </p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, Google would reject the idea that SGE is out to replace online publishing, as CEO Sundar Pichai explained to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/24158374/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-ai-search-gemini-future-of-the-internet-web-openai-decoder-interview" target="_blank">The Verge</a>. "People are responding very positively to AI Overviews. It’s one of the most positive changes I’ve seen in Search based on metrics," Pichai explained. "But people do jump off on it. And when you give context around it, they actually jump off it." </p><p>"It actually helps them understand, and so they engage with content underneath, too," he added. "In fact, if you put content and links within AI Overviews, they get higher clickthrough rates than if you put it outside of AI Overviews."</p><p>We&apos;ll have to wait and see whether Pichai&apos;s opinion of AI overviews turns out to be correct. For now, we can only look at the unexpected drops of organic traffic from Google Search that have hit publishers hard in recent months. Many sites, especially independent ones, have downsized or shuttered altogether due to changes in Google Search rankings. If web traffic continues to drop thanks to AI overviews, it could doom more sites. </p>
<h2 id="cutting-out-publishers-hurts-google-and-ai-xa0-development-in-the-long-run-2">Cutting out publishers hurts Google and AI  development in the long run</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qnqkKh8GSNWaffJHXJDSr7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S9-Ultra-display-01.jpg" alt="Reading Android Central on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qnqkKh8GSNWaffJHXJDSr7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At one point, it seemed like Google and online website hosts wanted the same thing and had the same goals. When website owners saw traffic, both Google and the sites earned money from advertisements. Somewhere along the way, the goals of Google and publishers drifted apart from each other. Now, the rollout of AI overviews is the latest example of Google focusing on its own strategies with little regard for the websites it depends on. </p><p>Generative AI might make it seem like Google is less reliant on publishers and creatives than ever, but the opposite is true. If the company goes all-in on AI overviews and SGE, it&apos;ll need publishers to keep churning out content to advance AI models and provide new information to summarize. Without incentivizing people to keep creating on the web, Google could be left without ad revenue <em>and</em> knowledgable AI models. </p>

<hr>
<p>Rumors are surfacing about Honor&apos;s upcoming clamshell foldable, and there are a lot of eyes on its cover display.</p><p>Chinese Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Ofha70XWL">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) posted the rumors, stating the Magic V Flip&apos;s cover display will span the entire outer panel (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetechoutlook.com/new-release/gadgets-release/mobile/honor-magic-v-flips-case-image-hints-a-massive-cover-display/">TheTechOutlook</a>). The screen is touted as a "super-large" display that could rival others in the clamshell foldable industry, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus 2023</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>.</p><p>Additionally, DCS posted an alleged early render of the case for the Magic V Flip. With it, the tipster states the "outer screen&apos;s shell only borders" the device, pointing toward its all-encompassing design.</p>

DCS led those rumors, with the proposed battery setup purported as 2,420mAh and 1,980mAh.</p><p>Moreover, there&apos;s speculation that Honor could power the V Flip with a Qualcomm Snapdragon SoC, but we&apos;ll have to wait and see. Rumors added that the device could be the "thinnest and lightest" among its industry competitors.</p><p>We&apos;re still left theorizing about when Honor could debut the device. The publication notes that the company is preparing to debut its 200 phone series on May 27 in China. It could follow this with a "Magic V Flip" launch in June.</p><p>For context, Motorola&apos;s 2023 clamshell offers a 3.6-inch cover display, while Samsung&apos;s features a 3.4-inch screen. Rumors haven&apos;t gotten specific regarding Honor&apos;s version, though they&apos;re pointing us in the direction of "super-large." However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-motorola-razr-plus-2024-specs-leak">recent leaks</a> for Moto&apos;s upcoming Razr Plus 2024 suggest its display could reach 3.9 inches.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/honor-developing-a-smart-ring">during MWC 2024</a>, Honor appeared and teased that it was getting into the Flip foldable game. The company&apos;s CEO George Zhao stated, "this year we are preparing for the flip phone launch—now that we are internally in the final stage."</p>

<ul><li>After users spotted issues with the new Private Space feature, Google rolled out the new Android 15 Beta 2.1 update.</li><li>The update is only rolling out to Pixel devices 6 and over, with a file size of 12 MB.</li><li>Android Beta 2.1 will be automatically available OTA for eligible devices enrolled in the Beta program on the System Updates tab.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After showing off the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-2-just-landed-for-google-pixels-and-non-pixel-devices-too">Android 15 Beta 2 </a>at I/O last week, Google had to follow it up with another update as those who downloaded the Beta were experiencing major issues with the Private Space feature. </p><p>The feature allows you to lock sensitive apps in a separate section that is password protected. Once locked, these apps don&apos;t appear in the app drawer or the overview menu; they&apos;re hidden inside a new user profile.</p><p>However, when some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1cwm0ra/android_15_beta_21_patch_now_available/">users tried</a> this for the first time, they saw it deleted app icons from the Home screen.<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/340868295"> Google&apos;s Issue Tracker</a> website also details that this has been brought to their attention and that Beta 2.1, a "minor update," began rolling out to all eligible Pixels on Monday (May 20).</p><p>The build number for this update is <strong>AP31.240426.023</strong>, and it comes with Play Services version 24.15.18</p>
<p>According to Android Police,  the new version initially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-15-beta-21-b/">came out </a>with a 2.57GB file size on one of their devices before downloading. However, users who installed this update stated in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1cwm0ra/android_15_beta_21_patch_now_available/">Reddit thread</a> that the file size was anywhere between<br>
11.30 MB to 12.12 MB when they restarted their device. </p><p>Google says that only Pixel devices that are enrolled in the beta program will automatically get offered an over-the-air (OTA) update, i.e., <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a"> Pixel 8a</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8</a>, Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel 7a, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a>, Pixel 7, Pixel 6a, Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 6, Pixel Fold, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-eyntk">Pixel Tablet</a>. </p><p>However, any<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15"> other new devices</a> set to receive the expanded Android 15 Beta might get their own updates based on the device. These include Honor, Nothing, OnePlus, Vivo, and more phones. </p><p>Per the update notes, the OTA update may take up to 24 hours to arrive on your device. You can check for updates by visiting <strong>Settings > System > System updates.</strong></p><p>However, one user took to Reddit to share that the new Beta 2.1 update was throwing an error on the Android Beta Feedback App, while most users saw that it fixed the Private space issue for them.</p>

<p>While new Beta updates bring several exciting features to your phones, users should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dont-install-android-15-dev-preview">be wary of downloading</a> as they may come with a new set of issues. </p>
