<p>For whatever reason, people are still upset about Samsung removing the BLE functionality from the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen. Perhaps it's just a "vocal minority" kind of thing, but the discourse left us wondering what Samsung should do for the Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p><p>There are really four different paths that Samsung could take; keep things as they are now, bring back BLE, ditch the S Pen while retaining compatibility, or just get rid of the S Pen entirely. Each of these comes with its own sets of pros and cons, so let's take a deeper look.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-change-anything-2">Don't Change Anything</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2t5Wknyoth2Aw2meBRbwnj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-s-pen-01" alt="Comparing the size and shape of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra versus the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the S Pen slightly unsheathed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2t5Wknyoth2Aw2meBRbwnj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For me, the most obvious course of action is for Samsung to just keep things the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. The community has voiced its opinion, but Samsung has the numbers to back up its decision.</p><p>In doing so, this would probably mean that we would have another year without built-in Qi2 charging or support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-favorite-magsafe-phone-grips-ranked">magnetic accessories</a>. To some, like myself, it's definitely going to be annoying, but as I've already found with the S25 Ultra, accessory makers offer a workaround.</p>
<h2 id="bring-back-ble-2">Bring Back BLE</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DXU9DYy5fNHBQz2jWJ42QQ" name="Samsung Galaxy S Pen" alt="Samsung Galaxy S Pen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DXU9DYy5fNHBQz2jWJ42QQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/penny-pinching-over-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-just-looks-bad">iFixit revealed</a> that the new S Pen features <em>almost</em> the same internals as the previous version, I couldn't help but laugh. Not because it was surprising but because all Samsung did was use a blank circuit board.</p><p>My first thought was that Samsung probably just slapped the circuit boards in there as part of the structural integrity or something. However, the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra S Pens aren't exactly identical, leading me to believe that there's a chance Samsung initially planned on including BLE before scrapping it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A2zghntLi3KtPpemArgKtE" name="Ultra25_49-2048x1152" alt="Comparison of the S Pen with and without Bluetooth." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A2zghntLi3KtPpemArgKtE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/108201/galaxy-s25-ultra-teardown-quick-battery-fix-slow-progress-on-repairability" target="_blank">IFIXIT</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given that these phones are likely designed at least a year or two in advance, the circuit boards were already developed and printed but weren't assembled. So when Samsung ran the numbers and found that <em>practically</em> nobody uses Air Actions, it decided against having the capacitors and other bits and bobs added to the board.</p><p>That being said, I think this is the second least likely decision Samsung would make with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a>. I just can't see a company backtracking just to appease less than 1% of its customer base.</p>
<h2 id="take-the-galaxy-z-fold-approach-2">Take the Galaxy Z Fold Approach</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="MSKXLU7Ks6pvjLMPTeRcPL" name="samsung-s-pen-pro-galaxy-s25-ultra-z-fold-6" alt="S Pen Pro on Galaxy Z Fold 6 next to Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MSKXLU7Ks6pvjLMPTeRcPL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It wouldn't be an editorial from me without mentioning foldables at least once, so here we are. Samsung first brought along S Pen support with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a>, and every model since has retained that support. However, Samsung foldable phones are compatible with a different type of S Pen, named the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-s-pen-pro-vs-s-pen-fold-edition">S Pen Fold Edition</a>.</p><p>For one, it's not built-in, nor will you find one in the box. Instead, it's a separate purchase, either on its own or included with Samsung's S Pen Case. In terms of functionality, the S Pen Fold Edition and the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen are pretty much the same.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dKHPqMa5bRH6ddv2P5Z9NP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-s-pen-slim-comparison-03.jpg" alt="The new slimmer S Pen for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dKHPqMa5bRH6ddv2P5Z9NP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung doesn't offer a S Pen Fold Edition with Bluetooth built-in, meaning that Z Fold users are already used to not having Air Actions. However, the Z Fold technically does support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">Air Actions</a>, provided that you have the now-discontinued S Pen Pro. Unfortunately, the Galaxy S25 Ultra doesn't offer any kind of support for Bluetooth-enabled S Pens, so you're out of luck on that front.</p><p>If the Galaxy S26 Ultra were to take this route, it could open the door for more improvements. By ditching the built-in S Pen, that should mean Samsung can fill that space with a bigger battery, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">maybe even a microSD card slot</a>. It also likely would mean proper built-in Qi2 wireless charging, hopefully, complete with support for MagSafe accessories without needing a case.</p>
<h2 id="saying-goodbye-2">Saying goodbye?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="YgYtmJzoqYFEaiLhCxaqdj" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-close-up-corners-edges-2" alt="Close-up on Galaxy S25 Ultra corners and edges" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYtmJzoqYFEaiLhCxaqdj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Surely Samsung wouldn't take away one of the defining reasons to pick an Ultra over any other flagship phone? Right? Well, that's the only other potential option that I could think of. But it's also more unlikely that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> will get the same camera hardware as the S25 Ultra.</p><p>There are still plenty of people who use an S Pen, so I just can't see a scenario where Samsung just drops it altogether. I'm also aware that companies have a knack for just getting rid of things for the sake of it, but this wouldn't make much sense. Well, that's unless Samsung was actively trying to push people into the arms of Apple, Google, and OnePlus.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-s-the-move-2">So what's the move?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="sjadVmhSFTZWyniwhrgiCD" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-back-02" alt="A close look at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge's protruding camera module at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sjadVmhSFTZWyniwhrgiCD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If I were a betting man (and I am), I think the Galaxy S26 Ultra will look and function almost identically to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Complete with the included S Pen. I think Samsung is proud of the design changes that it made with its latest flagship, and seeing how much pushback there was with the removal of BLE on the S Pen, I shudder to think about what would happen if the S Pen was no longer included.</p><p>For the sake of brevity, here's where I rank the laid-out scenarios:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Don't Change Anything</li><li>Take the Galaxy Z Fold Approach</li><li>Saying Goodbye?</li><li>Bring Back BLE</li></ol>
<p>If you think I'm crazy, don't forget about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-reveal-feels-desperate">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> that's slated to be released at some point this year. That gives Samsung an option for those who want a big-screen phone but without the bulk of needing to have a place for the S Pen. This means that the Edge can live alongside the Ultra while giving Samsung the flexibility to offer a variety of phones based on what <em>you</em> want.</p>

<ul><li>Google is done selling the Chromecast with Google TV on the Google Store.</li><li>The Chromecast with Google TV HD and Chromecast with Google TV 4K are both listed as "no longer available."</li><li>Google planned to let stock of Chromecasts run out for good after announcing the Google TV Streamer last year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast">Chromecast with Google TV</a>, it's time to hunt one down: both the Chromecast with Google TV HD and its 4K counterpart are no longer available for purchase on the Google Store. The $50 and $30 Chromecast with Google TV streaming dongles are being discontinued in favor of the new Google TV Streamer, as the company announced last year. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/20/google-store-chromecast-with-google-tv/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_google_tv" target="_blank">Chromecast with Google TV product page</a> on the Google Store says both models are "no longer available" as of Thursday, Feb. 20.</p><p>Google announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/why-the-google-tv-streamer-is-more-important-than-you-think">Google TV Streamer</a> back in August 2024, and it's a $100 set-top box with Google TV and more features — effectively replacing the Chromecast. At the time, Google said it would still provide support and updates to the Chromecast with Google TV. However, it would only continue to sell the streaming dongle until current stock was exhausted.</p><p>It seems as if Google is officially done selling the Chromecast with Google TV, at least through direct channels. It looks like you can still find Chromecast with Google TV HD and Chromecast with Google TV 4K at some third-party retailers, like Walmart, but who knows for how long. Soon, Google will have finished selling Chromecasts for good.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2110px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.53%;"><img id="mUhME8bq8gpPWsbi3GgfQ3" name="Chromecast-With-Google-TV-Google-Store" alt="A screenshot of the Chromecast with Google TV product page." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mUhME8bq8gpPWsbi3GgfQ3.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2110" height="1446" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The device replacing the Chromecast with Google TV, the Google TV Streamer, is a bit controversial. At $100, it's significantly more expensive than the Chromecast with Google TV — priced at $30 (HD) or $50 (4K) — which was appealing to budget buyers.</p><p>That's because most smart TVs nowadays match the functionality of a budget streaming stick, per the company. However, the Google TV Streamer also isn't quite as powerful as other set-top boxes, like the old Nvidia Shield. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">We reviewed the device</a> positively overall, but noted it still fell short in a few key areas.</p><p>The Google TV Streamer runs Android 14 for TV, an update that existing Chromecast with Google TV devices haven't received yet. While your Chromecast with Google TV will still get future updates, there won't be any new ones to buy now that Google has officially shuttered the brand.</p>

I use it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/how-to-securely-access-your-synology-nas-from-anywhere">connect to my NAS remotely</a>, and it just makes it so much more convenient. Basically, Tailscale is a tunneling service that creates a secure connection to your devices, making remote access a breeze.</p>

<p>Another big use case is ad blocking. I have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-block-all-ads-pi-hole-raspberry-pi">Pi-hole set up</a> on a Pi 4 that's connected to my home network, and it does a great job blocking ads on all devices — including phones and tablets — while I'm in the house. As a high-level overview, Pi-hole is an incredible utility that blocks ads on the entire home network; you set it up on a device like the Pi 4 or Pi 5 and connect it to your router, and have it running as the DNS server. It has built-in ad lists and does a great job filtering ads on all devices that connect to your router (including IoT gear), and it's an invaluable tool. <br><br>But that's just in the confines of my home; it's not like I can configure a Pi-hole on the go. The solution is to use Tailscale to connect to my home network, allowing me to essentially use Pi-hole as the DNS while traveling. The best part about this is how easy it was to set up; why I like Tailscale so much is the seamlessness with which it works — there's no need to manually configure settings in any way; just have the service installed on any device you want to connect to, and you're good to go. Oh, and did I mention that it doesn't cost anything to use? <br><br>Tailscale is a zero trust networking service, which means it doesn't store any user data. In fact, it doesn't even handle authentication; you'll need to use your Google account or any other SSO while setting up and logging into the utility.</p>

<p>I've had a busy week with launch events in Malaysia and Singapore, and I did most of my work on a Windows machine and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>. Both devices connected to my Tailnet — my home Tailscale network — and as the DNS was being filtered by Pi-hole, I didn't see any ads. I was initially worried that it would lead to increased latency as all data was being routed to my home network 2,000 miles away, but it wasn't a problem at all — there was no noticeable difference while browsing, and it felt like I was back home. <br><br>This usability is what makes Tailscale so good. I also like that it doubles as a tunnel to all my other devices; I needed to download images of the Find N5 saved in my home NAS, and I did so while I was at the product launch event. I just connected to my NAS via Tailscale, browsed to the folder, and downloaded the images onto my Find N5. I use a decent number of networking tools, but Tailscale continues to be the best around, and its robust feature-set combined with effortless ease of use (and the fact that it's free) makes it an easy recommendation.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>After a 4.5-month beta, Strava's Athlete Intelligence is launching as a stable version with increased accuracy and new insights.</li><li>Strava is also improving its algorithm to prevent cheating or miscategorized activities on its segment leaderboards.</li><li>Other Strava updates include a new progress summary chart and a way to share your post-activity Flyover views to Instagram stories.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Strava's Athlete Intelligence, which launched in beta last October, has achieved its first stable build this week. And it's just one of several key changes coming to the Strava app.</p><p>Strava's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-enhances-subscriber-experience-with-updates-to-key-features">press release</a> explains how Athlete Intelligence delivers "even more insights for a more tailored analysis of each upload" with the latest version. For instance, it can interpret "non-GPS activities" like treadmill runs or cycling power meter data for the first time.</p><p>More generally, if you frequently run the same route, Athlete Intelligence will "note how your pace or speed compared to other times on that route," as well as call out any record distances or gold segments. And Strava is promising "more accurate insights with fewer mistakes" than Athlete Intelligence showed during beta.</p><p>In our testing, we initially noticed obvious mistakes, like Athlete Intelligence claiming that a 150bpm-average run was an anaerobic activity, but the insights have gotten more useful (and accurate) in recent weeks. Strava claims that 80+% of polled Strava subscribers "say that Athlete Intelligence is very helpful," which is why they decided to take it out of beta.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A3RqLHv9Ssu2dU4mCznxLY" name="strava-live-segments.jpeg" alt="Strava app showing Live Segment records" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A3RqLHv9Ssu2dU4mCznxLY.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3200" height="1800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Strava also intends to improve its leaderboard algorithm to improve overall integrity. For instance, they're analyzing results to "prevent bike rides on run leaderboards and ebikes on ride leaderboards." Both accidental miscategorizations and intentional cheating are targeted.</p><p>"Every activity uploaded to Strava is now automatically analyzed by our machine learning model, which looks at 57 different factors, like speed and acceleration, to determine if any portion of an activity was recorded in a vehicle," Strava explains.</p><p>On the lighter side of things, Strava will now let you share your post-run GPS Flyover summaries to Instagram Stories (or other platforms) for the first time. You can impress your friends with an eagle-eyed view of your epic rides, runs, and hikes, simply by clicking the Share button on the Activity Details Page; Instagram Stories will be a default option, but you can copy the Flyover link for other apps.</p><p>Finally, this February Strava update has revamped the Progress Summary Chart. In the You tab and Progress section, you can select a specific sport and time frame: one week, one month, three months, six months, year-to-date, or one year.</p><p>You'll then see your cumulative distance, time, elevation, or activity count in that frame, and you can tap "Compare Date Range" to see how, for example, your 2024 stats compare to your 2023 stats.</p><p>Strava has made significant updates to its app in recent months, from Apple Fitness+ integration to Night Heatmaps to help you decide where it's safe to run in the evening. But this new version of Athlete Intelligence, combined with Strava's compatibility with all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness smartwatches</a>, should only make Strava's subscription even more popular with athletes.</p>

<p>In typical Gemini fashion, Google is bringing a feature once exclusive to paid Gemini Advanced subscribers to all free users, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1892678157406281931" target="_blank">announced</a> today, Feb. 20 in a post on X (formerly Twitter). Free users can now upload documents for analysis on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> app on iOS and Android, plus the Gemini web client.</p><p>"Document upload is now available to all Gemini users," the company wrote. "Upload multiple Google Docs, PDFs, and Word documents from Google Drive or your device. Get quick summaries, personalized feedback, and actionable insights — streamlining your workflows and saving you time."</p><p>To use the feature in the Gemini app, write a prompt in the text field and tap the "plus" icon to add a file using the <strong>Files</strong> or <strong>Drive</strong> buttons. As the company explains above, Gemini can intake files stored physically on your device or in the cloud via Google Drive. It can also handle multiple files within its context window. Then, it'll be able to analyze the files provided and use it to respond to your query in the proper context.</p>

<p>As always, Google reminds users that you'll need to check Gemini responses for accuracy. Additionally, keep in mind that you shouldn't share any private information with Gemini.</p><p>There are still reasons to use Gemini Advanced for file analysis. Certain file types are still unsupported in the free version of Gemini, such as code documents or spreadsheets. It's also unclear how much information the free version of Gemini can intake before limits are reached. By comparison, Gemini can handle up to one million tokens for users with a paid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google AI Premium subscription</a> — which costs $20 per month and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-ai-premium-plan-just-got-more-appealing-with-new-perks">unlocks Gemini Advanced</a>.</p><p>Still, this continues Google's trend of slowly making paid features available to free users after a waiting period. It's one of the perks of using Gemini compared to other chatbots.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing is trickling information out about the upcoming Nothing Phone 3a series before its release, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-to-offer-50mp-periscope-lens-with-3x-optical-zoom">shared the official camera specs for the devices</a> earlier this week. Alongside the specifications, Nothing released a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D_btmdrP9M" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> comparing the Phone 3a's camera performance to the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max. In the video, the company compared a video clip from the iPhone's lower-quality ultrawide camera to video from the Nothing Phone 3a's main rear camera.</p><p>YouTube commenters pointed out that the clip comparison was misleading, as the iPhone 16 Pro Max's ultrawide camera is significantly worse than its main sensor for video. In response, Nothing said this comparison was made as a result of an editing mistake and wasn't intentional. It shared the following statement in a pinned YouTube comment and on the Nothing community Discord:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Hey everyone, we shot across all lenses throughout the day (sometimes cycling one-handed on a bumpy road), and in editing, a clip shot using the iPhone 16 Pro Max’s ultrawide lens was mistakenly used in the video stabilisation comparison instead of one shot using its standard lens. There was no intent to mislead, and we’ll be more careful to ensure even greater scrutiny in future comparisons. Appreciate you all keeping us accountable!</p><figcaption><cite>Nothing</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>It appears the original, unedited YouTube video with the potentially-misleading clip is still live at the time of publishing. While the pinned comment is there, the video includes little sign that there is a mistake if viewers don't manually navigate to the comments. The video's description doesn't include any mention of the error, either.</p><p>You can watch the original video below, and Nothing shared the full-resolution images and videos via Google Drive in the video's description. That's how savvy viewers were able to originally spot that the iPhone 16 Pro Max video sample was using an unequal camera sensor (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/20/nothing-phone-3a-iphone-camera-comparison-trick/#more-662130" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p>

<p>It's likely that, as Nothing claims, the comparison between the iPhone's secondary camera and the Phone 3a's main camera was a mistake. After all, the Nothing Phone 3a is predicted to cost a fraction of the price of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, so there would be no reason for Nothing to mislead about its capabilities.</p><p>With that being said, this mistake adds a permanent asterisk to what would've been a favorable performance from the Nothing Phone 3a.</p><p>Nothing will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">officially reveal the Phone 3a on March 4</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is allegedly planning to bring back its Premium Lite subscription after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-axing-premium-lite-service">axing it in 2023</a>. You'll no longer have to pay full price for both YouTube Premium and YouTube Music to avoid ads while binging YouTube playlists and podcasts.</p><p>According to a source "familiar with the plans" at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-20/youtube-plans-lower-priced-ad-free-version-of-paid-video-tier">Bloomberg</a>, the YouTube Premium Lite package "will be announced soon in the U.S., Australia, Germany, and Thailand."</p><p>"As part of our commitment to provide our users with more choice and flexibility, we've been testing a new YouTube Premium offering with most videos ad-free in several of our markets," a YouTube spokesperson told the site. "We're hoping to expand this offering to even more users in the future."</p><p>Google began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-new-youtube-premium-lite-subscription">testing Premium Lite late last year</a> in Australia, Germany, and Thailand, though not the United States.

And the dip in cost <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@funkenstille.dev/post/DBMivGMsmEl?xmt=AQGztzAV1AWt4_dxXlUTDexOFadmjikNE2iOrhXIG4G6DXI" target="_blank">from €12.99 to €5.99</a> — or from A$23 to A$12 — made these trade-offs very tempting for users who already pay for another expensive music service, such as Spotify or Apple Music, or who don't watch many music videos.</p>

<p>Now, based on this breaking report, it appears that U.S.-based YouTube power users will have the choice to spend about half as much as before for ad-free content. Bloomberg's source didn't share a price, but the $6–8 range seems likely given its test price in other countries last year.</p><p>"This new tier, if widely adopted, could make subscription revenue a larger and more significant part" of YouTube content creators' revenue than ads, Bloomberg suggests.</p>
<h2 id="google-has-pleasantly-surprised-me-with-this-move-2">Google has pleasantly surprised me with this move</h2>
<p>Last year, I wrote a <em>controversial</em> post claiming that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-made-a-mistake-with-youtube-premium">Google made a mistake with YouTube Premium</a> by coupling it with YouTube Music with no alternative, noting that paying to remove ads is, by itself, not something that should cost $14/month and that bringing back a Premium Lite plan would solve this problem.</p><p>The comment section was less than kind to my argument, calling it ridiculous, half-baked, and so on. It didn't matter that most other streaming services only charged about $6 to remove ads because they weren't free like YouTube. YouTube Premium was worth the value to them, content needs to cost money, and I was cheap and whiny for arguing otherwise.</p><p>A less hostile response came from a YouTube rep at the time, who contacted me to clarify that Google wasn't done with Premium Lite, even though they'd shut down this price tier almost a year prior and had no public plans about it. That sounded promising.</p><p>Now, almost a year later, it appears that I'm getting exactly what I wanted: ad-free YouTube for about half the price it costs now, even if it means missing out on offline downloads and other experimental, Premium-only features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-new-experimental-features-4x-speeds-and-jump-ahead">4X-speed videos and higher-quality audio</a>.</p><p>Assuming Bloomberg's report is accurate, and YouTube Premium Lite really does launch soon in the U.S. for about half the price of YouTube Premium, I'll be a day-one subscriber. It'll no longer feel like an irresponsible subscription, given that I already pay for a family music bundle on another platform.</p><p>More generally, by making this choice, Google will increase its total number of subscribers, even if its YouTube Music subscriber count decreases. It'll be interesting to see whether YouTube Premium Lite expands to more countries or remains limited to the current four. And hopefully, unlike the last time, Premium Lite will stick around for a while.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a simple smartwatch with great battery life and built-in sports modes; you like minimalist design and AMOLED displays.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want to experience the latest in wearable technology; you want to use third-party apps or an onboard keyboard. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazfit-gtr-3-pro-review">Amazfit GTR 3 Pro</a> may not win any awards for innovation nowadays, but it&apos;s an affordable smartwatch with up to 14 days of battery life, 5ATM water resistance, and a vibrant AMOLED display. It also comes with over 150 sports modes and a ton of health and fitness tracking features straight out of the box.</p><p>So what&apos;s the catch? Well, you&apos;re not going to get any of the fancy AI features found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches of 2025</a>, there&apos;s no way to integrate third-party apps, and some of the UI features already felt kind of dated way back in 2021.</p><p>Buying the GTR 3 Pro today means settling for a no-frills, fitness-focused wearable with a nice display and great battery life that belies some relatively simple hardware. If that sounds alright and you have 100 bucks to spend, then this is the smartwatch deal for you.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung listed three unreleased A-series Galaxy phones on its Chilean service website.</li><li>The phones are the Samsung Galaxy A26 5G (SM-A266), Samsung Galaxy A36 5G (SM-A366), and Samsung Galaxy A56 5G (SM-A566).</li><li>This listing suggests a release is imminent and the phones should debut next month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has a few new Galaxy A-series budget smartphones in the pipeline, and that's not just a rumor anymore. The company updated the service list on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/cl/support/outofwarrantyservice/" target="_blank">Chilean website</a> to include the unreleased Galaxy A56, Galaxy A36, and Galaxy A26, which are expected to release next month. The listings include the official retail names and model numbers for the devices, as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-lists-galaxy-a56-galaxy-a36-galaxy-a26-its-website/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the listing confirms that the Galaxy A56, Galaxy A36, and Galaxy A26 will be sold in Chile. The website includes the price list for out-of-warranty repairs for Galaxy phones, including now the unreleased A-series devices. Since they aren't out yet, the repair prices are simply listed as "not available," which is unsurprising. However, it does share the official names and model numbers for the devices, which are the following:</p>
<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy A26 5G (SM-A266)</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A36 5G (SM-A366)</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A56 5G (SM-A566)</li></ul>
<p>The inclusion of upcoming A-series Galaxy phones on the service list suggests that a release is imminent. The phones are expected to launch in the first week or two in March, just like their predecessors.</p>

<p>According to prior leaks, the Samsung Galaxy A56 5G may be powered by a Samsung Exynos 1580 chipset and could support 45W wired charging for the first time. However, that's unclear at the moment. While leaks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-galaxy-a56-and-galaxy-a36-renders-surface">revealed the design of the Galaxy A56</a>, the exact specifications are shrouded in a bit more secrecy.</p><p>The refreshed design likely includes a unibody rear camera housing with three cameras, covered by a black shell — mimicking the DSLR-style covers that already appeared on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. The Galaxy A56 could come in pink, gray, and green, with the cheaper Galaxy A36 being available in green, gray, and purple, per leaks.</p><p>We'll learn more about all three models — the Samsung Galaxy A56 5G, Galaxy A36 5G, and Galaxy A26 5G — as this official confirmation is a sign release is nearing.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is highlighting the various uses of Pixel Call Assist on its smartphones, while also drawing attention to new updates.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-call-assist-call-notes-tips/">blog post</a>, the company detailed a couple of ways users can lean on the Phone app to handle "too many spam calls." While Pixels can conduct a reverse number search for unknown calls, Google is preparing to roll out a new set of filters. The post states the Phone app will soon roll out five filters: All, Missed, Contacts, Non-Spam, and Spam.</p><p>These filters will be available in the "Recent" tab of the Phone app once it hits devices. The post did not state when this update will begin rolling out on Android.</p><p>Google also detailed an upcoming update for the Pixel phone call interface (UI). The company states the update is aimed at making the Pixel Call Assist feature quicker to access. Additionally, the update will make tools like Call Notes, Direct My Call, and Audio Emoji much easier to find and utilize.</p><p>Regarding that note, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/20/pixel-phone-call-redesign-filters/">9to5Google</a> post shed some light on this, stating the UI update has supposedly arrived on the Pixel 9 series. The publication highlights Google's slight UI rework, which displays a row above your standard phone call tools (numpad, mute, etc.).</p><p>There, users will find a Call Assist button that opens to offer its features, as well as a way to expand the Audio Emoji function.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="eAhRyzrK4dG3rebFRV2dvA" name="google-phone-app-filters-recent-view-addition" alt="The Phone app on Android will receive five filters to help users organize their recent calls." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eAhRyzrK4dG3rebFRV2dvA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="450" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The post draws attention to a couple of other useful Phone call features like Live Caption and Call Screen. The former is a useful accessibility tool that lets users who are deaf or hard of hearing to read what's being said on the other end. Additionally, those users will be given a keyboard to type their response and the app will read what you've said to them.</p><p>Call Screen lets users allow the AI to answer a phone call or "Ask if urgent." What's said on the other end will be relayed to you via text on your display. More importantly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro</a> deliver "AI-powered suggested replies" if toggled on.</p><p>Google started rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-audio-emoji-update-spotted">Audio Emoji update</a> last spring, which made calls much more expressive. These quirky emojis play a unique sound (depending on the emoji) alongside a fun animation on their display. Six emojis were present during the feature's arrival like the laughing emoji, party favors, and drum.</p><p>The Phone app received a beta late last year for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/real-time-scam-detection-is-rolling-out-now-in-google-phone-app-beta">real-time scam detection</a>. The feature is AI-based and is a tool that automatically runs in the background. Google states that the detector will scan incoming calls and, if they are (potentially) a scam, it will deliver a bright red pop-up to users about it. The pop-up will let you quickly end the call to avoid accidentally giving personal information.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amazon is discontinuing its app store on Android devices starting Aug. 20 this year. In an update to App developers, the company stated that they will no longer be accepting new apps for the store moving forward(via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/amazon-is-shutting-down-its-app-store-on-android/?guccounter=1">TechCrunch</a>). Developers can continue to update existing apps on the Appstore until the above deadline.</p><p>The Amazon Appstore is currently available in 200 countries and allows users to download games and mobile apps on supported devices.  It is a third-party app store that comes pre-installed on all Amazon devices.</p><p>However, it has always been an alternative Appstore for Android users that offers free apps and content that isn't found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play">Google Play Store.</a></p><p>On its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/appstore/android/faq" target="_blank">FAQ page</a>, Amazon stated that "any apps downloaded from the Amazon Appstore will not be guaranteed to operate on Android devices," after Aug.20.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh wait what, Amazon App Store discontinued on Android Devices. pic.twitter.com/CQvxcXe4LP<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1892543928638861606">February 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson told Android Central in an email that it has decided to take this step with Android devices as the company is looking inward and wants to focus its efforts "on the Appstore experience on our own devices, as that’s where the overwhelming majority of our customers currently engage with it.”</p><p>According to the company, only a small number of customers use the app store outside Amazon devices, which pushed them to take this step.</p><p>Amazon added that its virtual currency aka Amazon Coins, which users use to purchase eligible apps and in-app items from the Appstore will also be discontinued. The company will refund unused coins to users after Aug.20. That said, the Appstore will remain untouched on Amazon's devices like the Fire TV and Fire Tablet.</p><p>It looks like Amazon is following suit after what went down with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/windows-11-ending-android-app-support-announcement" target="_blank">Microsoft devices last year</a>. Windows 11 users at least got a year's headstart on this shift. As of  March 5, even Microsoft devices will no longer support several apps available on the Amazon Appstore once this date arrives.</p>

The fund aims to reward creators with cash prizes and a way to earn an income through Meta's Roblox-like game, including a new expansion to mobile that launched last Fall in the Meta Horizon app on iOS and Android.</p>

<p>Meta says the new fund is designed to appeal to a growing audience of players <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">who prefer free-to-play content</a>, similar to audiences on other mobile platforms. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/empowering-horizon-creators-with-a-new-50m-fund-and-advanced-tools-for-mobile-and-mr-worlds">Meta's blog post</a> on the announcement says the new move is aimed to grow these mobile, non-VR audiences by reaching "a lot of new people who don’t yet own a Quest headset and ultimately grow the pie for everyone."</p><p>The logic, Meta dictates, is that people who enjoy Horizon Worlds will be more inclined to purchase a Meta Quest headset to try the experiences in VR. But Meta couldn't be more wrong here, and while I ultimately think hybrid experiences like this — that means VR and non-VR players can game with each other — are the future of gaming as a whole, Meta's focus on Horizon Worlds is simply unhealthy for everyone.</p><p>Meta's CTO recently said that 2025 would be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">make-or-break year</a> for Horizon Worlds, so while it's not surprising to see the company make a last-ditch effort to catalyze better development for Horizon Worlds, it's beyond frustrating to see the company continue to push the Roblox-like platform over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> at the expense of existing VR developers.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I fully believed that Meta Horizon Worlds could co-exist with more premium experiences like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>. Other platforms seem to have no problem juggling the balance between offering free-to-play and premium experiences to users who prefer one over the other, but Meta has shown that it's not very good at multitasking.</p><p>Instead, a quick visit to the Meta Horizon app on your phone always shows a ton of Horizon Worlds content that you may or may not want. The premium app store can be found by clicking a tiny icon on the top left of the app, and promotional content for these kinds of experiences has substantially waned over the past six months.</p><p>This huge shift in focus for Meta has had a profound impact on the VR industry, as a whole. Instead of developers seeing record game sales after the launch of a new headset, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a> launch was decidedly different. Many VR developers saw flat or even lower sales throughout the Holiday 2024 period when compared to 2023, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/from-quest-to-horizon-how-metas-shifting-priorities-are-affecting-developers/">the results haven't been pretty</a>.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Meta's choice to promote Horizon Worlds content over paid apps from developers is causing unnecessary and irreparable harm to the VR market as a whole.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Lots of video game developers have closed their doors or made substantial layoffs this year. While this unfortunate reality isn't relegated just to the VR market, it hurts more in VR because there aren't as many bigger developers as on traditional consoles or PC. Just in the last month alone, we've seen major layoffs at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/toast-interactive-closes-office-as-majority-of-staff-are-made-redundant-2/">Toast Interactive</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/crytek-laying-off-15-percent-of-staff/">Crytek</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/fast-travel-games-layoffs-january-2025/">Fast Travel Games</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/soul-assembly-layoffs-january-2025/">Soul Assembly</a>, and even the app market <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/sidequest-holds-layoffs-amid-changing-market/">SideQuest</a>.</p><p>Wider industry trends are somewhat to blame for these problems, but Meta's choice to promote Horizon Worlds content over paid apps from developers is causing unnecessary and irreparable harm to the VR market as a whole.</p><p>I had already planned to write this post before I found out about Meta's new creator program, and its existence only further solidifies my opinion here. The first thing you see when opening the <em>required </em>Meta Quest companion app isn't the best games on the platform. It's janky free-to-play garbage that's an instant turn-off to anyone who isn't 8 years old, and that's a <strong>huge</strong> problem.</p>

<p>Meta, it's time to give up the ghost. Horizon Worlds isn't going to be The Oasis from Ready Player One. It's not even going to be Rec Room or VR Chat, two <em>very</em> successful VR "metaverse-style" experiences that existed far before Horizon Worlds was ever a twinkle in Mark Zuckerberg's eye.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, if you're reading this, it's OK to accept Horizon Worlds as a "failure" to capitalize early enough on a growing trend. So instead of tanking the successful Quest ecosystem and its development community, focus on the best experiences available on the platform and start promoting those, instead.</p><p>With the VP of VR on the way out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/mark-rabkin-leaving-meta-quest">at the end of the month</a>, this is the perfect time for his replacement to focus on the <em>real</em> metaverse of apps and games that Quest players know and love. Get back to that early 2024 time frame when developers were seeing huge growth and success in their titles with the swath of new players. The Quest 3S just broke sales records, and that should translate into game sales. This fixation on Horizon Worlds could kill off the VR ecosystem you've spent years building up and no one wants that.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/among-us-vr-review">Among Us VR</a> launched as one of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games/2#section-best-quest-3-2-multiplayer-games">favorite multiplayer Quest games</a>, but despite several major updates since 2022, it can be hard to keep a steady user base with so many Quest gamers spending their time in Horizon Worlds or new Gorilla Tag clones. So Schell Games is turning to non-VR Steam gamers with "Among Us 3D," and it's a sign that crossplay might be the best future for VR games.</p><p>Announced on Thursday, Among Us 3D is a new Steam PC port of the original Among Us VR game. Starting as a demo during Steam Next Fest from February 24–March 3, Among Us 3D will eventually let Steam gamers play as crewmates and imposters with VR gamers on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S</a>, PSVR 2, and Steam VR.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UYMaaMTgxa4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>"With Among Us 3D, we're excited to bring the first-person perspective to an even wider audience," said Ryan Hall, project director at Schell Games. "By uniting VR and PC players, we're opening up even more ways to brutally betray your friends — your whole crew can get in on the fun!"</p><p>Among Us 3D is available to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">wishlist on Steam</a> today, though there's currently no release date. Among Us VR on Quest will be "rebranded to Among Us 3D" in the coming months, adding a new in-game currency called Stardust to "expand customization options" and "support the expansion of the game." It's possible that Schell Games wants the original Quest game ready before launching the non-VR port.</p><p>After the full launch, Schell and Innersloth are promsing new modes and tasks, as well as "collabs" with the original Among Us. Despite the image below, don't expect actual crossplay between the 2D and 3D Among Us versions: It simply refers to original, fan-favorite cosmetics coming to the 3D version.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7EwN4GfmubZgvojWuvhP78" name="among-us-3d-roadmap" alt="Among Us 3D roadmap: Engineer role out now, Stardust and Among Us 3D launch/ Among Us VR rebrand "coming soon," and future plans (in no particular order): "New modes, new tasks, more limited time events, collabs, wardrobe expansion, and MORE!!!"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7EwN4GfmubZgvojWuvhP78.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Innersloth / Schell Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite having fewer maps than the main version, Among Us VR impressed us with its loving recreation of Skeld and seamless VR motion controls for beloved tasks, as well as proximity chat to make you truly feel like a crewmate in danger or an imposter listening for witnesses. And we appreciated post-launch updates like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/among-us-polus-hands-on">Polus Point map</a>.</p><p>With Among Us 3D, Schell Games is committing to continuing to support the VR version, but using an influx of Steam gamers to keep funding their work and add fresh bodies to their murderous little world. The main question will be how the VR-centric controls have been ported to keyboard-and-mouse controls.</p>

<p>Meta Quest games are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">going through a free-to-play crisis</a>. The Quest Store overall is making more money than ever, but most often via in-app purchases in free-to-play titles. Meta's metaverse is a jumble of Gorilla Tag clones attracting younger gamers, while the more polished VR titles struggle to get proper storefront space or make back their development costs.</p><p>We've seen how many of the best VR multiplayer games have struggled with user retention, or else didn't make enough money to keep up with updates; Echo: VR is the most notorious example, shutting down despite its critical acclaim and avid fanbase.</p><p>Now, with Among Us VR turning into Among Us 3D, we're seeing a potential new pathway that more VR studios could take: Convert their VR-only game into a non-VR, first-person experience that adds an influx of gamers but still supports their original fanbase.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PXCJwimXKZUhbBDwRhmD4a" name="Breachers-screenshot-official-Factory-gun-upgrade.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of Breachers on Meta Quest" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXCJwimXKZUhbBDwRhmD4a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Breachers VR on Quest </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Triangle Factory)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many original Steam games have Steam VR ports, but these are secondary add-ons, and we've seen for years how PC VR is a niche platform for a few die-hard enthusiasts — not an especially profitable or popular one. Ideally, we'd see more Quest games that jump to Steam, with the largest VR and PC communities joining together.</p><p>Even if they're <em>better</em> in VR, multiplayer shooters like Contractors, Breachers, and Ghosts of Tabor would work on flat screens, too, and they'd launch with a dedicated user base so new Steam gamers would know they'd immediately have people to play with. Plus, VR gamers feeling too lazy to put on their headsets — or who notice their Quest 3 battery is dying — can keep the fun going on their gaming rigs.</p><p>Perhaps this kind of VR-to-traditional gaming transition is more difficult than we're making it sound; or perhaps these games' fanbases would balk at resources going to a new version they won't care about. But we still think this kind of strategy will give VR devs the resources they need to keep making great games despite a challenging sales climate, and that's a great thing in our books!</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is continuing to alter the Assistant within its ever-changing ecosystem, and this latest move impacts audio devices.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/326148532/google-assistant-spoken-notifications-change-on-headphones?hl=en&sjid=7078688767109123196-NA">community post</a>, the company drew attention to an upcoming change that will affect how users interact with the Google Assistant on headphones (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-assistant-earbuds-losing-tap-and-hold-notifications/">Android Police</a>). Google states the Assistant will soon lose the ability to read your notifications aloud when "pressed to activate."</p><p>In addition to this, the post states users will no longer be able to leverage the Assistant to reply to notifications, either.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7515695?hl=en">follow-up support</a> document expands on this, stating users will now have to manage the Assistant vocally. Instead of pressing a button, the Assistant will only respond to "Hey Google, read my notifications" moving forward.</p><p>Curiously, Google states it "will be" making this change to all headphones with Assistant as its virtual helper. However, the post fails to explicitly state when users can see this change go into effect. It'll be worth keeping an eye on things as we enter the final week of February.</p><p>It seems like we should brace for a future where we lose this ability on two of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-headphones-support-google-assistant#section-best-over-ear">headphones with the Assistant</a>: the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and Sony's WH-1000XM5. We <em>could </em>say we're surprised by this development, but we saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-assistant-notifications-gone">the same thing happen</a> to earbuds with Google Assistant support in September. Things happened in reverse order as users took to Reddit to report the sudden jarring change to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a>.</p><p>Users were hit with a message stating, "touch and hold won't read notifications anymore." Similarly, they were told to say "Hey Google" aloud for those functions. It didn't sit well with users as they stated the touch-and-hold method was more private and convenient — but most of all <em>silent</em>.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google at the time and the company stated it made the change "based on user feedback." It also confirmed that the change would stick, forcing users to have to speak aloud to the AI. The company reiterated a similar tune with its headphone announcement, meaning those users will lose out on the private touch-and-hold method.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> debuted in August with deep integration with Gemini, instead of the Assistant.</p>

<hr>
<p>Fitbit has been spotted pushing a light update to a few of its most recent smartwatches and trackers.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236725#zippy=%2Ccharge">support page</a>, the wearable company is rolling out version 214.22 to the following devices: Charge 6, Sense 2, Versa 4, and the Inspire 3 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/20/fitbit-charge-6-sense-2-update/">9to5Google</a>). The latest patch brings enhanced "Bluetooth security" features to the Charge 6 and Inspire 3. Google states, after updating, users will be asked to "reconnect your device when prompted in the Fitbit app."</p><p>The other significant portion of this update concerns new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14225687#Charge6_status_indicators&zippy=%2Ccharge">status indicators</a>."</p><p>All four wearables are receiving this small update today (Feb 20). The support document states these new status indicators will appear when users first wake up their watch's or tracker's clock face. Fitbit's update brings four icons, such as a DND sign and a crescent moon. The former indicates your wearable's Do Not Disturb mode is on while the latter regards "sleep mode."</p><p>Fitbit also added a red battery symbol, signaling your watch's power is severely low. The final symbol is a crossed-out phone, so users know their device has lost its Bluetooth connection with their handheld.</p><p>The company states the status indicators are optional. Users can head into their device's <strong>Settings app > Display > Status Indicators </strong>to toggle them on/off. Moreover, these indicators are not permanently on your display. They will display after a few seconds; however, you can "swipe right to check the icons at the top of quick settings."</p>

<p>Fitbit's devices have been left stagnant for a while as its most recent (major) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-update-features-modes-app-rollout">update came last July</a>. The update was spearheaded by Google as it inherited Fitbit's line of watches and trackers. The company plugged its machine learning into Fitbit's devices to improve its heart rate accuracy. The Inspire 3 received 20 new exercise modes last summer and other QoL (quality of life) enhancements.</p><p>The Sense 2 and Versa 2 finally gained a dedicated YouTube Music app a year after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Charge 6</a> got it. Speaking of the latest tracker, the Charge 6 gained additional exercise modes similar to the Inspire 3.</p><p>Fitbit's latest update sings a better tune, especially after Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-versa-3-battery-overheating-warning-reported">massive warning call</a> to Sense and Versa 3 owners about a dangerous battery issue. The devices were prone to extreme overheating issues, which could cause severe burns to the user's wrist if inflicted. Google started rolling out a software patch to correct the issue; however, owners of a device prone to overheating could've submitted a form for compensation.</p>

<hr>
<p>Android Auto users have been having bumpy starts to their car drives, thanks to a new update that may have messed up the connectivity between the two.</p><p>Many took to Google forums in the past few days stating that their Android Auto suddenly stopped working ( via<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/19/android-auto-wireless-broken-reports-13-5/#more-662203" target="_blank"> 9to5 Google)</a>. According to them, this issue could be due to the latest software update patch that came in at the end of January or early February that is causing the wireless connectivity to break.</p><p>Some users<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/thread/323764003/wireless-android-auto-stopped-working-after-january-2025-update?hl=en&sjid=6661046456060814083-NA"> reported</a> the wireless connection failing once they updated to the latest version of the firmware, and Android Auto not being able to detect their device. But when the device is connected via USB, it seems to function as usual.</p><p>The patches in question are Android Auto v13.4 and v13.5, but we can't say for sure if this is what's causing the widespread issue. It could also be how some devices are interacting with the latest update. For now people with the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier"> Pixel 8</a>, Samsung Galaxy S23 Plus, Galaxy S22 Ultra, Galaxy S20, with different car models seem to be facing this issue.</p><p>"After a year and a half, my 2023 Honda Civic no longer shows "Android Auto" for wireless. And when searching for my phone, the car screen says the car cannot find the Galaxy S20 phone.  It's been working mostly fine. And my phone's AA is recently updated," a user stated on the forum.</p><p>The people facing issues have tried all sorts of troubleshooting methods, but nothing seems to be fixing this issue. One user however noted that unless they restarted their phone each time, Android Auto didn't seem to connect.</p><p>We don't have any official guidelines from Google on how they plan to fix this issue. However, this isn't the first time an update has caused havoc for users, in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/thread/279134372/android-auto-not-connecting-after-may-24th-update?hl=en" target="_blank">May last year users faced </a>a somewhat similar issue trying to connect their devices via USB and the app wouldn't recognize their devices. Users either had to reboot their phones or buy a different USB cable that sorted the issue out for them.</p><p>Google's spokesperson told Android Central in an email that they're aware of this issue and are currently investigating a fix for the same.</p><p>Despite said connectivity issues, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-rolls-into-the-polestar-2-to-cover-some-gaps-in-android-automotive" target="_blank">Android Auto expanded its latest software </a>update for Polestar 2, P3.3.16, which came with HD radio and smoother low-speed driving, with wired Android Auto. This update is rolling out to Polestar 2 models from 2021 onward, via OTA and is also available through service appointments.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025 is just a few short weeks from now, and companies have already begun to tease what's in store for the big annual show. Honor just launched a pair of new phones so it looks like the company will be focusing on the software front for MWC this year, pushing forward with a new AI-focused concept it calls the Honor Alpha Plan.</p><p>Last year's launch of the Honor Magic 6 Pro came with a full commitment to leading with AI-forward features, particularly where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-camera-review">the phone's camera</a> was concerned. At the time, the concept was still fairly new among phones, as Samsung had just announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and most other AI-powered features baked into Android used AI before the term was in vogue.</p><p>The biggest issue with Honor's AI launch last year was compatibility with non-Honor devices and services. The rollout of Magic OS 9 alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> helped push that forward, with features like Magic Portal receiving support for hundreds of apps and a cool knuckle gesture that works a lot like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to search</a>. This builds on Google's function by making it easy to share things you circle, not just search for them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="Xo3LehSv4dS9bfnN2u7baZ" name="honor-magic-portal-2025-demo" alt="Circling a paragraph with a finger knuckle and then immediately sharing it to X using Honor Magic Portal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xo3LehSv4dS9bfnN2u7baZ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At MWC, we expect big things from the brand-new CEO of Honor, Jian Li, who just replaced previous CEO George Zhao in mid-January. No doubt, Li is looking to make his mark on the company as he sets the tone for the rest of the year, and the Honor Alpha Plan sounds exactly like what we might expect.</p><p>As you might imagine from the name, the word "Alpha" is the beginning of the Greek alphabet and likely a new path forward for the company's AI pursuits. Companies are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-plans-to-spend-billions-on-ai-2025">spending more on AI in 2025 than ever</a>, and the crown for the best AI in the land seems to change every week. It's not likely that Honor is going to jump into the fray with the likes of Open AI, Grok, Gemini, and Deepseek, but it certainly would make sense for the company to start launching more AI-forward devices in the future.</p><p>The question is whether that means adding more AI-enhanced features to its phones — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-camera-review">brand-new AI telephoto feature</a> on the Magic 7 Pro — or if it means dedicated AI devices. One pioneer in this sector, the Humane AI Pin, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/humane-announces-its-departure-from-the-ai-scene-hp-acquires-it-for-usd116-million">just called it quits</a>. While the concept of a screenless device powered by an AI assistant is extremely futuristic, Humane's implementation of the concept left a lot to be desired.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wsNJPxcuJkAvo9xQFReWXZ" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-7-rsr-provence-04" alt="The back of the Provence PORSCHE DESIGN Honor Magic 7 RSR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wsNJPxcuJkAvo9xQFReWXZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But I could easily see a company like Honor moving in to take advantage of the interest in this market by using its expertise on AI and device ecosystems. Honor already produces laptops, smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and more that all link together in impressively cohesive ways.</p><p>I use an Honor MagicBook Art 14 Snapdragon Edition as my main laptop, and it pairs perfectly (and seamlessly) with the Honor Magic 7 RSR and two Honor tablets that I have. Using a tablet as a second laptop screen is as easy as hitting the "connect" button that pops up when the tablet is unlocked, and the same goes for bigger screen foldable phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>.</p><p>Most of the company's improvement happened throughout 2024, and 2025 looks to be the best year yet. Android Central Phones editor Harish Jonnalagadda wrote about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-is-innovating-its-way-to-the-top">Honor's impressive upward trajectory</a>, and I have no doubt the new CEO is aiming even higher with the Honor Alpha Plan when it's unveiled at MWC.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Da3vGi4zgjPAJKtajAPUHJ" name="honor-magic-v3-review-30.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 in semi-folded mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Da3vGi4zgjPAJKtajAPUHJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Jian Li comes from a Huawei background, at a time when the company led smartphone camera innovation before U.S. trade sanctions stymied the business for a few years. Now, Li has moved on to the helm of Honor and is clearly ready to take the company to the next level internationally.</p><p>While I could hope for a proper U.S. release of the company's products, I dare not hold my breath in the current political climate. Instead, I think the company will focus even more on unique AI features that are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-sharing-feature-magic-portal-3520837/">being copied by rivals</a> and dedicated AI-forward devices that will work well with all sorts of devices, not just Honor's.</p><p>After all, the Alpha Plan's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/global/news/honor-alpha-plan-mwc2025/">currently laid-out vision</a> states that Honor "is committed to fostering an open and collaborative environment where innovation thrives through partnership." Given that the latest Honor devices work better than ever with Google's own Gemini services, it makes sense to me that Honor would push itself to be the leading international Android brand, especially since Samsung has been so stagnant in the past few years.</p>

<hr>
<p>After all the buzz surrounding a follow-up to the OPPO Find N3, the Chinese phone maker today officially pulled back the curtain on the Find N5. And its big claim to fame is being the world’s thinnest foldable yet.</p><p>OPPO’s latest book-style foldable pushes the limits of design, measuring just 8.92mm when folded and 4.21mm when open. Even with its sleek build, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a> packs a 6.62-inch cover display and a spacious 8.12-inch inner screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fanz2BcmypJMCMbjNNavfL" name="OPPO-Find-N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fanz2BcmypJMCMbjNNavfL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2400" height="1350" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OPPO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find N5 sticks to a familiar look with its bold circular camera module, flat edges, and curved corners, just like its predecessor. But OPPO has taken things up a notch, refining the design to make it even slimmer, barely edging out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>’s 9.0mm thickness.</p><p>Meanwhile, other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> are chunkier, tipping over 10mm when folded.</p><p>Beyond its remarkable thinness, the Find N5 is also the most water-resistant foldable yet, thanks to its IPX9 rating. While dust resistance is still missing, this marks a big step toward making foldables as tough as regular smartphones. OPPO also upgraded the titanium hinge, making the inner display’s crease far less noticeable than the competition.</p><p>Inside, the Find N5 is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, paired with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. It runs on ColorOS 15.0.1, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>. And when it comes to battery life, it’s got you covered with a 5,600mAh, plus super-fast 80W wired charging and 50W wireless charging if you’re using AirVOOC.</p><p>The Find N5 sports a 6.62-inch OLED cover screen and a massive 8.12-inch OLED inner display, both packing a 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, and 2160Hz PWM dimming to cut down on flicker. And if you’re into stylus action, OPPO's Pen works with it—just don’t expect it to come in the box.</p>

<p>Teaming up with Hasselblad again, the Find N5 packs a solid camera setup: a 50MP main shooter with an f/1.56 aperture, an 8MP ultra-wide, and a 50MP telephoto lens for 3x optical zoom. Selfies and video calls are covered with 8MP front cameras on both the outer and inner displays.</p><p>The Find N5 is hitting shelves in plenty of European and Asian markets, starting at around $1,867. That said, don’t hold your breath for a U.S. release since OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-says-it-will-not-be-launching-the-oneplus-open-2-this-year">already said no foldables are coming stateside this year</a>.</p>

The foldable has the distinction of being the thinnest around, and at 4.21mm when unfolded, it is 0.14mm thinner than the Magic V3 — which I didn't think was possible. <br><br>While I didn't get to test the Find N3, I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Ope</a>n (which is just a rebrand of the N3) extensively, and the Find N5 builds on that foundation while delivering better cameras, brighter panels both inside and out, and a bigger battery. The ultra-thin design basically means that the Find N5 feels like a regular phone most of the time — it is just 0.4mm thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> when folded — and it makes using the device an absolute delight. <br><br>It has a new hinge mechanism that uses titanium, and while that's undoubtedly a good thing, what I like about the change is that the crease is barely visible this time. That was the case on the Open too, but the Find N5 takes things to a whole new level, and honestly, I can say the same in a lot of other areas. The device even gets IPX9 ingress protection and a massive 5600mAh silicon battery that lasts more than any other foldable I used until now, and there's 50W AirVOOC alongside 80W charging. <br><br>The Find N5 isn't just a great foldable — it's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> you can buy in 2025.</p>

<p>OPPO unveiled the Find N5 on February 20, and the foldable is set to go on sale in the coming weeks. It is available in a single configuration with 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage, and comes with ColorOS 15.0.1 based on Android 15.</p><p>The phone costs</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XvocrkJ9NQrCe4fwFr3Pq4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvocrkJ9NQrCe4fwFr3Pq4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find N5 clearly builds on the design of its predecessor; it has a similar aesthetic with contoured edges and flat sides, and the in-hand feel is exquisite. But what I like the most is the ultra-sleek profile; the foldable is thin and light enough that it is just like using a regular phone when it's folded, and that is a huge deal. At 8.93mm, it is chunkier than the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but not by much, and coming in at 229g, it doesn't weigh that much more either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="opSz7tyQ2e4KtCvmfiKGv4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 angled view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/opSz7tyQ2e4KtCvmfiKGv4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's when you unfold the Find N5 that you realize just how thin it really is; at just 4.21mm, the foldable is only a smidgen thicker than the width of the USB-C port, and that's incredible. I got a similar feeling when using the Magic V3, but where the Find N5 has an advantage over Honor's foldable is that the flat sides make it just that little bit better to hold and use. There's enough width along the sides to comfortably hold the device, and the 7000-series aluminum mid-frame adds decent rigidity to the overall structure.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hW2c44Mu3Zy4UMEW6yx2b4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 unfolded" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hW2c44Mu3Zy4UMEW6yx2b4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I would have liked a leather back like last time, but OPPO is using a fiber material on the Find N5 — ostensibly to save weight — and the silky texture makes it easier to hod the device. On the plus side, it doesn't pick up any smudges whatsoever, and I didn't feel the need to use a case with the foldable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ViGgQy5BbGPHL8GGUuomd4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 back view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ViGgQy5BbGPHL8GGUuomd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera island is cleaner this time around, and the oversized module dominates attention at the back. Given the svelte profile of the foldable itself, the camera module protrudes quite a bit from the chassis, and there is a wobble when using the device while it's unfolded on a table — this isn't a problem when it's folded.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uAWUoW2qnUZfK4B7kuxNj4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to other foldables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uAWUoW2qnUZfK4B7kuxNj4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, the alert slider is intact, and it's located on the left. The volume and power buttons are on the right, and like most other foldables, the Find N5 uses a side-mounted sensor baked into the power button to unlock. It is fast and reliable, and I didn't see any issues in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eKjWtvtti3KobiBqXecGi4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 in Flex Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eKjWtvtti3KobiBqXecGi4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find N5 is available in two colors, and the white model is the one to get if you need a device that stands out visually. Interestingly, the foldable gets the distinction of being the only device in this category with IPX9 ingress protection in addition to IPX8, so it is able to withstand high pressure jets in addition to submersion in water. Like other foldables, there's no rating against dust ingress, but it has the usual seals and gaskets to ensure dust doesn't get into the hinge or any of the other moving parts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qeZ42PWqbmP8JJeNUGv9b4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qeZ42PWqbmP8JJeNUGv9b4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Talking about the hinge, the Find N5 uses a redesigned hinge mechanism that uses 3D printed parts and a titanium alloy, and it is 26% thinner than time while delivering 36% better durability. It's now called the Titanium Flexion Hinge, and it has a smooth articulation and doesn't take as much force to unlock.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YPiJSfJtCbTfAkACDJ7rk4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to other foldables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPiJSfJtCbTfAkACDJ7rk4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are two distinct advantages to the new hinge system: the Find N5 stays locked at any angle between 50 and 150 degrees, and that makes it much more versatile than the Magic V3. The best use case for this mode is to shoot photos in interesting angles with the camera, and it also has productivity benefits.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yjbFdNzuYPQ7UrkiFnyhf4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yjbFdNzuYPQ7UrkiFnyhf4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the biggest gain is the crease; the Find N5 still has a crease in the middle when it's unfolded, but it is nowhere as visible as other foldables. I didn't even notice it after a day of use, and it doesn't affect usability at all. The crease is so shallow that it makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ill-admit-it-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-better-than-i-imagined">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> look outdated when using both foldables next to each other. <br><br>In fact, the design and svelte profile makes the Find N5 feel futuristic when you put it next to Samsung's foldable. So I guess it's a good thing from Samsung's point of view that this device isn't launching in the U.S.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-n5-panels"><span>OPPO Find N5: Panels</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="p3hjTAU3RjSKM9zDYmCss4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 inner panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3hjTAU3RjSKM9zDYmCss4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>along with the 20.7:9 ratio means it feels like a regular phone, and honestly, I just used the outer panel most of the time. The outer display goes up to 1600 nits in outdoor use, and hits 2450 nits in HDR content. It has Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and color vibrancy is among the best of any foldable I've used. You get a good range of customizability as well, and I like the selection of always-on styles available within ColorOS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C67LiPiktwNTxXon7P8go4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 YouTube video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C67LiPiktwNTxXon7P8go4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The inner panel is noteworthy as it is a tablet-sized 8.12 inches — the biggest of any book-style foldable yet. Colors are fantastic, and the inner panel is ideally suited to view content or play games; I had a lot of fun with Balatro on this device. It goes up to 1400 nits in outdoor use, and 2100 nits when viewing HDR content, and there was never a scenario where I felt like it didn't get bright enough even under intense sunlight. While I didn't have OPPO's stylus (it isn't bundled in the package), you can use it with the foldable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EytDFasFyd4VchLPNgmWz4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 with Balatro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EytDFasFyd4VchLPNgmWz4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both panels go up to 120Hz and leverage LTPO to dynamically adjust refresh on the fly, and the inner screen even gets an anti-reflective coating that makes a noticeable difference when using the device outdoors. Another advantage is that it has a dual shielded protective layer that leverages an elastomer material to deliver better resistance in the event of a tumble. The outer panel uses a custom Nanocrystal Glass, and it held up without any issues after taking two tumbles onto a tiled surface.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JAXQrtqActJZpt9hJUUMn4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 selfie camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JAXQrtqActJZpt9hJUUMn4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get loud stereo sound as well, and it makes a difference when viewing content on the inner panel. Basically, I didn't see any problems with the inner or outer screens, and OPPO did an incredible job in this area.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-n5-hardware"><span>OPPO Find N5: Hardware</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jSHoK2nmz9gfGXTqvRxZh4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to other foldables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSHoK2nmz9gfGXTqvRxZh4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find N5 has the distinction of being the first foldable featuring the Snapdragon 8 Elite platform, but unlike the OnePlus 13, ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra, and a multitude of phones that run Qualcomm's latest silicon, it's using seven cores instead of the standard eight. <br><br>The reasoning is that with you get better efficiency with a seven-core design, and honestly, there's no way of knowing in regular use that it is any different to other phones powered by the same platform. It is just as fluid in demanding tasks, and games run just as well. The only limitation is that it doesn't quite have the same thermal thresholds, so you see some throttling earlier than usual — that is the case with all devices in this category, so it isn't unique to the Find N5.</p>

<p>Even then, I didn't see any issues getting stable framerates in visually-demanding games. In fact, the only way to see that the foldable is using a non-standard option of Qualcomm's silicon is via synthetic workloads; the Find N5 didn't get quite as high a score in Geekbench's multi-core tests, but it doesn't make a noticeable difference in real-world use. It hit a stability score of 55.9% in 3DMark's Steel Nomad stress test is 55.9%, and went up to 48 degrees. While that is hotter than other foldables, it was localized to the middle, and it didn't feel uncomfortable to hold at the sides <br><br>The foldable is sold in a single 16GB/512GB configuration, and it doesn't miss out when it comes to connectivity. I didn't see any issues while making calls or with cellular connectivity in general. If anything, the foldable had better connectivity than most other devices I tested recently, and that's likely due to the 360-degree antenna design. <br><br>In a similar vein, the vibration motor is pretty good; it doesn't deliver the granular feedback that you get on the Find X8 Pro, but it is one of the better options I've used on a foldable. <br><br>There really isn't anything missing on the Find N5; even though it is using a modified Qualcomm chipset, you just don't notice that in regular use, and that alone illustrates just how powerful mobile platforms are getting.</p>

<p>The Find N5 lasts longer than any other foldable I tested until now. Even though it's thinner than other foldables, there's a massive 5600mAh battery under the hood, and it easily lasts a day even with heavy use. I've had the phone for a week now, and there was never a point where I had to worry about the battery running out before the end of the day — even during a week where I was basically travelling most of the time. <br><br>Like most other 2025 phones, the Find N5 is using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon battery tech</a> to great effect, delivering much better density and longevity than previous years. It uses 10% silicon in the anode, and OPPO says the battery is 30% thinner than what's used in most foldables because of the inclusion of silicon — it's thinner than the 4800mAh battery in the N3. <br><br>There's even 80W charging, and it takes just over 47 minutes to fully charge. The best part is that the device gets 50W AirVOOC wireless charging, and although I didn't have OPPO's charging puck, it should work just as well with the OnePlus AirVOOC magnetic charger that debuted alongside the OnePlus 13. The only caveat is that just like the OnePlus 13, you'll need to use a magnetic case to take advantage of the AirVOOC tech. <br><br>The convenience of AirVOOC along with the standard 80W charging means you don't really need to plug in the Find N5 overnight, and I'm just glad that we are getting to a point where foldables last as long as regular phones.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VR8H5qz7bUi9W43EFXXjr4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 back view with camera island" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VR8H5qz7bUi9W43EFXXjr4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO knows how to deliver a strong camera package, and there's a lot to like on the Find N5. The foldable gets a 50MP Sony Lytia LYT700 main camera; this is the same sensor that's used to great effect in the Find X8. It's joined by a 50MP Samsung JN5 telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, and an 8MP wide-angle lens with autofocus. <br><br>Both the main camera and telephoto modules have OIS, and you get an 8MP camera tucked inside both the inner and outer panels. Interestingly, you can use the tele lens to shoot macros, and it does a good job in this regard. There's 4K60 10-bit HDR video as well, but it's limited to the main and zoom lenses — the wide-angle only goes up to 4K30. Hasselblad integration is intact, and you get orange accents in the interface and the distinctive leaf shutter sound. <br><br>There's also a Hasselblad Master mode that's basically a manual mode, and you get the usual set of shooting modes and filters that debuted on the Find X8. The camera interface itself hasn't changed, but because the Find N5 is a foldable, you can use FlexForm mode to good effect and take photos in interesting angles. On that note, you can use the viewfinder with the outer panel, giving you the ability to take selfies with the rear cameras, and this is what I did most of the time — I just used the selfie cameras when making video calls. <br><br>You get the same set of AI editing features as the Find X8, including an unblur option that does a good job restoring details, and a fantastic eraser mode that's among the best you get on any Android device.</p>

<p>Thanks to the LYT700 imaging module and latest-gen Hasselblad camera tuning, the Find N5 takes outstanding photos in daylight scenarios. You get good dynamic range and white balance, and colors look natural; there isn't too much saturation. <br><br>Foliage is rendered accurately, and there isn't any issue with aggressive smoothing. Macros came out really well too, and this is an area where the Find N5 does a better job than just about every other foldable. The wide-angle lens is the weakest sensor at the back, but it still does a decent job in most situations, even if you don't get the same color vibrancy in low-light. <br><br>On that note, the main camera takes outstanding photos in challenging conditions. It preserves intricate details and minimizes highlights, and there isn't any visible noise. The tele lens is really good as well, and you get the same caliber of shots as the main camera at 3x.</p>

<p>There is a noticeable difference in detail retrieval at 6x, but you still get great shots, and the phone uses AI to smooth out images beyond 10x, delivering passable shots at up to 30x. The phone does a great job with portrait shots, but there are situations where you get excessive blooming in the background; this was a problem on the Find X8 Pro when it debuted, but a software update sorted out those issues — I believe that will be the case on this device as well. <br><br>I still think the Find X8 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> have an edge in low-light, but the Find N5 has every other foldable beat when it comes to the cameras. If anything, the cameras on the Find N5 are better than the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9, and that's a big deal in and of itself.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-n5-software"><span>OPPO Find N5: Software</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qMRKi6bHy8bUhQbY6qXqs4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 Android 15 Easter egg" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qMRKi6bHy8bUhQbY6qXqs4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find N5 runs ColorOS 15.1 based on Android 15, and having used the Find X8 and Find X8 Pro quite a bit in the last four months, the software felt familiar. ColorOS 15 has a new interface with vivid colors, and it bundles a decent set of AI utilities; the Find N5 has a nifty call summarization and instant translation feature, but they'll be rolling out at the end of Q1. <br><br>Multitasking is a pretty big use case on a foldable, and OPPO's Boundless View is back on the Find N5. The mode makes it extremely easy to set up a split-screen pair and multitask on the device, and I want other manufacturers to borrow this mode as soon as possible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EvULaRM8DpQsMLbCE2LKo4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 multitasking" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvULaRM8DpQsMLbCE2LKo4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's new this time is split-screen suggestions; if you're switching between two apps in unfolded mode, ColorOS 15 suggests creating a split-screen mode instead, and it's intuitive. You can also save these split-screen pairs on the home screen if you need quick access. <br><br>Other foldable mainstays like an app dock and taskbar are intact, and while the notification pane now defaults to a split option with the toggles to one side and notifications on the other, you can switch back to a unified option if that's what you like (as I do). <br><br>The Find N5 is optimized incredibly well, and the foldable has a fluidity that you just don't get with many devices in this category. I didn't see any slowdowns whatsoever, and most of the time, I didn't even realize I was using a foldable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vCMDvCbBo9qGhPSvUfpVo4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 drawer on the taskbar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCMDvCbBo9qGhPSvUfpVo4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have two issues with the software; the app grid is still limited to 4x4, and I just don't understand why that's the case. Every other Android phone I use has the ability to switch to a 5x5 grid, and not being able to do that on the Find N5 is annoying. The second is that there's still plenty of bloatware on the device, and while it can be easily uninstalled, I don't want to see any bloatware on a phone that costs this much.<br> <br>With the Find X8, OPPO introduced the ability to share content with iPhone uses via O+ Connect, and it's extending that feature to macOS with the Find N5. You'll need to install O+ Connect on your MacBook, and you can easily transfer content to and from the Find N5, view photos on the MacBook, and even control your MacBook using the foldable.</p>

<p>When it comes to software updates, the Find N5 will pick up five Android platform updates alongside six years of security updates, and that's better than most foldables. OPPO is doing a good job rolling out updates on time, and the device should make the switch to Android 16 shortly after it becomes available in Q2 2025.</p>

<p>Honor's Magic V3 is the closest rival to the Find N5. It also has a svelte design, great hardware, and an outstanding camera package. It may not be as powerful, but there are no problems gaming on the device, and Honor leads the industry when it comes to eye comfort tech. Having used both devices, I think the Find N5 has a slender edge with the design and cameras, and I generally prefer using ColorOS to MagicOS. That said, these are minor differences, and both foldables are among the best around. <br><br>There isn't anywhere as much of a choice if you're in North America. While I like the design and software of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the cameras just don't hold up in 2025, and it isn't as comfortable to hold and use. The only other option is the Galaxy Z Fold 6, but that's hilariously outdated next to the Find N5, and I honestly wouldn't recommend the device.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-n5-should-you-buy-it"><span>OPPO Find N5: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LeLXWHdSnfmDEMxacnSXt4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to other foldables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LeLXWHdSnfmDEMxacnSXt4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a foldable that feels like a regular phone</li><li>You want a foldable without a visible crease</li><li>You need the latest internals and the best cameras</li><li>You need standout battery life</li><li>You want reliable ingress protection</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You're in North America</li><li>You need a clean software interface</li></ul>
<p>One of the main reasons why I like the Find N5 so much is that it doesn't feel like a foldable. When interacting with the outer panel, I felt like I was using a regular phone, but I still have the versatility of unfolding the device and accessing a tablet-sized panel. That is a big deal, and while Vivo and Honor also have ultra-thin foldables, I think OPPO did a better job overall. <br><br>Both the inner and outer displays deliver outstanding color fidelity and contrast levels, and I didn't see any issues in this regard. The unbelievably-thin design makes using the inner panel that much more enjoyable, and while I was worried about the durability of the device in the beginning — it is the thinnest foldable, after all — it hasn't been a problem. <br><br>It is just as fast as a regular phone, and it holds up very well even during extended gaming sessions. Similarly, the battery life is outstanding, and it outmatches every other foldable I've used up to this point — even with heavy use, I easily got a day's worth of battery. <br><br>The cameras are the best of any foldable yet, and you get a good amount of versatility as well, which isn't always the case. The software is packed with useful features too, and OPPO managed to find a nice balance with its AI suite. <br><br>In fact, my only annoyance with the device is with its positioning. With OPPO taking the lead this time, the Find N5 won't be available in as many global regions, and it isn't coming to North America. That's a real shame, because the Find N5 is a fantastic showcase for what's possible with foldables, and it effortlessly outshines what Samsung is doing. If you're in a country where the Find N5 is going on sale and are interested in switching to a foldable, you should consider picking it up — this is the best foldable I've ever used.</p>

<p>MWC 2025 is coming up fast and TECNO is highlighting what users can expect from its software and smartphones.</p><p>To start, the company's press release states that TECNO had taken strides to "advance" how the multitude of human skin tones appear on its cameras/photos. Achieving this pushed TECNO to expand its "Skin Tone Database" to accomplish "true-to-life representation." Its devices will utilize a new, expanded Multi Skin Tone Color Card, packed full with over 372 color patches.</p><p>These patches facilitate "inclusivity" as they reportedly reflect skin tones in Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. TECNO has also taken steps to create a "region-specific" 186-patch color card for people in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>These color cards are step one of TECNO's goal of displaying skin tones appropriately. Backing this up is the company's "skin tone restoration engine." Packaged within its Universal Tone engine, TECNO says its software will ensure human skin tones are "precise" through "color calibrations." Regarding exposure, TECNO states it will ensure the appropriate adjustments are made to keep everyone's skin vibrant and consistent, even in "challenging scenarios," such as your background.</p><p>TECNO teases attendees will see a demo of its enhanced color card for mobile imaging during MWC 2025.</p>

<p>The other side of its MWC 2025 announcement is a teaser for new TECNO AI systems. The company states it is preparing to unveil a new AI-powered intelligent product ecosystem. TECNO is reportedly interested in developing and producing more "practical AI" as it looks to tackle the interest of global markets. To achieve this, TECNO has teased a new product launch for its CAMON series of smartphones.</p><p>The press release adds that TECNO is also "likely" preparing to debut a pair of AI glasses and a new laptop, which could join its MEGABOOK series.</p><p>The Chinese OEM teases the possibility of MWC Barcelona attendees witnessing the prototype for its upcoming "ultra-thin" Phantom Ultimate 2 tri-fold. At the moment, nothing is definite; however, TECNO states there's a chance it could have the tri-fold prototype available on the floor for people to see for themselves.</p><p>Another early reveal could involve TECNO's Starry Optical Fiber material. Details state this material incorporates "ultra-fine optical fibers" with mini-LEDs to create a sparkling effect.</p><p>MWC 2025 will happen in Barcelona, Spain from March 3 to March 6.</p>

<p>The idea of a more "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tecno-ai-foldable-strategy-interview">practical AI</a>' from TECNO was discussed last year when it was present at IFA 2024. The company launched its AI assistant, Ella, which had been upgraded with new capabilities thanks to Google's Gemini. Ella can conduct an AI search, deliver real-time analysis, and more. However, during an interview with Android Central, TECNO stated Ella has over 600 system-wide functions to aid users.</p><p>The OEM also touts Ella's ability to help bridge the language gap as it features more local languages, aiding its usage in more countries.</p><p>What's more, TECNO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">originally teased</a> the Phantom Ultimate 2 tri-fold in 2024, but users didn't get to see it up close. The concept was highlighted in videos and imagery, stating it would feature a 6.48-inch cover display and a 10-inch 3K OLED panel internally. The company also showcased the phone's ability to be used in a unique 1/3 setup, meaning one portion of its three screens can remain on a table as a keyboard.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-67">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A new “Display” button on YouTube for Android TV lets you switch between Artwork, Lyrics, and Video modes for a more immersive music experience.</li><li>The Lyrics mode shows live, synced lyrics alongside the album art, making sing-alongs easier than ever.</li><li>The “Display” button (eyeball icon) sits between Thumbs Down and Save during music video playback.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android TV users can now enjoy a more immersive music video experience on YouTube, thanks to a new feature that makes it easier than ever to belt out your favorite tunes or just soak in the visuals while jamming.</p><p>The YouTube app on Android TV is rolling out a handy new feature for music lovers, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/18/youtube-tvs-display-music/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. During music video playback, you’ll now see a "Display" button marked by a little eyeball icon. Tap it, and you’ll get some extra visual flair to amp up your viewing experience.</p><p>The new “Display” button sits right between the Thumbs Down and Save buttons. If you’re all about karaoke nights, you’ll love this update.</p><p>You'll see three options when tapping the button: Artwork, Lyrics, and Video. Pick "Artwork," and you’ll see the album cover front and center, set against a background that matches its main color, with the artist and song details right below. Go for "Lyrics," and the album art shifts to the side while live, synced-up lyrics take the spotlight.</p><p>The new feature is rolling out on YouTube for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-tv">Android TV</a> (version 5.22 and up) and is also popping up on other smart TV platforms</p><p>This option has some useful potential, but it’s not without its quirks. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-android-tv-lyrics-3527564/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> dug into it and found a few headaches, like the app struggling to remember your preferences.</p><p>It might save settings for a single video, but more often than not, it snaps back to the default video view. And forget about keeping those settings consistent across multiple videos—it’s hit or miss.</p><p>On top of that, there’s a noticeable drop in sound quality when you switch to Artwork or Lyrics modes, probably because it pulls audio from YouTube Music instead of the original video. So, while it’s a neat addition, there’s still some fine-tuning needed.</p><p>YouTube’s new “Display” feature on Android TV feels like a nod to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>’s earlier experiments with live lyrics during casting. Back in late 2022, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-tests-ui-live-lyrics">YouTube Music rolled out a revamped casting interface</a> that brought scrolling lyrics, album art, and track details to the forefront, all set against a blurred album art background.</p>

<ul><li>Sony’s latest mid-ranger is finally making the jump to Android 15, keeping up with its promise of three major OS updates.</li><li>The update (build 70.1.A.0.425) is under 1GB, though Sony hasn’t shared a detailed changelog.</li><li>Expect Private Space, UI tweaks, Bluetooth LE Audio broadcasting, pop-up windows, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Sony Xperia 10 VI is now getting the much-awaited Android 15 update, adding it to the list of Sony phones that have already made the leap to the new OS.</p><p>Sony's newest mid-range phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-10-vi-goes-official">launched in June of last year running Android 14</a>. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyXperia/comments/1irpnn8/xperia_10_vi_android_15/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a> has spotted that it's now making the switch to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_10_vi_receiving_android_15_update-news-66601.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>). This reaffirms that Sony is keeping its word on delivering three major Android upgrades for this device.</p><p>The Xperia 10 VI’s Android 15 update is rolling out with the build number 70.1.A.0.425, and it’s a lightweight download at under 1GB. Sony hasn’t dropped a detailed changelog, but chances are it’s packing the same goodies as other Xperia models that already made the jump to Android 15.</p><p>Sony has now brought Android 15 to five Xperia phones since last year, with the Xperia 10 VI being the latest. Even with a smaller lineup, Sony stays committed to keeping its devices up to date. Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">Samsung is dragging its feet</a> on pushing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> to its older flagship phones.</p><p>The Xperia 10 VI’s Android 15 update packs a bunch of features that other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sony-phones">Sony phones</a> have already been enjoying. You’ll get Private Space for tighter security, updated Wallpaper & Style choices, tweaks to Side Sense, a revamped Quick settings panel, Bluetooth LE Audio broadcasting, handy pop-up windows, and some SIM setting adjustments.</p><p>All the details about the Android 15 update for the Xperia 10 VI are now live on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://helpguide.sony.net/mobile/xperia-10m6/v1/en/contents/changes_update_software_android_15.html" target="_blank">support page</a>.</p><p>The Xperia 10 VI’s latest OS update is rolling out just three weeks after the Xperia 10 V got its turn. It’s a bit surprising, though, since the 10 VI is the newer model—you’d think it would’ve been first in line. Either way, both phones are now on board with the latest software.</p><p>These phones are set to get Android 16 and maybe even Android 17. Sony is also keeping the security patches coming for years.</p>

<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3 launched yesterday</a> and while we're still soaking in all the new features, one user on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/1iswu8a/oneplus_watch_3_meda_in_china_misspelled_on_the/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_body&embed_host_url=https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-watch-3-typo/">Reddit</a> has noticed a minor error with the wearable.</p><p>It has nothing to do with the Watch 3 itself, but with a typo on the back panel. The company ended up engraving "Meda in China" instead of "Made in China," on these wearables (first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-3-typo-mistake-3527878/">Android Authority</a>). While this may seem like a minor issue, it raises questions about how the Watch 3 cleared final quality checks.</p><p>While not many people have been able to get their hands on this wearable as official sales don't begin until February 25, the first few who did receive this batch seemed to have got the ones with the typo. This includes Android Central's Nick Sutrich, who also received the watch from the typo- batch.</p>

<p>The Reddit thread showcased mixed reactions from users. Some made fun of this odd situation, while others expressed their disappointment with the company's oversight and attention to detail.</p><p>What's more, Android Authority noted this same typo on Watch 3 renders located on OnePlus's website. The site suggested this typo might somehow be intentional, though a simpler alternative is that the error has been copy-pasted in multiple places.</p><p>OnePlus has yet to comment on this mistake. Android Central has reached out to them to check if this typo will be corrected on the other watches that will soon be on sale. We will update this article once we have more information.</p><p>Typo aside, the OnePlus Watch 3 has mostly attracted positive attention this week thanks to its powerful five-day battery life, backed by the same OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, and several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">key upgrades over the Watch 2</a>. But we did also note that the Watch 3's software <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-has-set-interesting-standard-with-wear-os-5-and-oneplus-watch-3">updates will be slower and fewer</a> than the Galaxy and Pixel Watches; this should have a more lasting impact than a typo that'll be hidden by your wrist.</p>

<hr>
<p>Live Captions and Live Translate in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-fresh-ui-makeover-update">Google Meet</a> are gaining a neat feature that'll make it easier to catch up or revisit missed conversations, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/02/google-meet-caption-history.html" target="_blank">announced</a> in a Workspace Blog post Tuesday, Feb. 18. Previously, the transcripts for Live Captions and Translate only briefly remained on the screen as the conversation continued. Now, Google will keep record of the call's transcript for 30 minutes.</p><p>The old behavior for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-googles-live-translate-feature">Live Captions and Translate</a> in Meet had translations or captions disappear when they were "no longer relevant to the current conversation," the company says. While the captions and translations appeared in real-time, as their names' suggest, they might not have remained on the screen long enough for everyone. That's why Google is making the transcripts available for 30 minutes after the captions or translations appear.</p><p>"This update makes it possible to scroll back and review the last 30 minutes of captions at your own pace," Google explains. "This can be particularly helpful if you’ve missed a portion of the conversation or you want to review specific details mentioned earlier in the conversation."</p><p>The captions are scrollable, so users can go as far back as they need to (within the half-hour window) while continuing the call with the current speakers still visible. After a user has caught up, they can click a "Jump to the bottom" button to return to the real-time translations or captions.</p>

<p>Humane announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.humane.com/hc/en-us/articles/34374173951373-Important-Update-for-Consumer-Ai-Pin-Customers">post</a> on Feb. 18 that it will officially be shutting down and moving on from the AI scene as its "business priorities have shifted." The company was looking for a buyer after seeing a massive dip in sales <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-ai-brand-humane-looking-to-sell-sources-say">in May last year</a>. Now it looks like HP went ahead and acquired them for $116 million.</p><p>Humane's AI pin was a unique device created by two ex-Apple designers in 2018. It had an AI voice assistant, camera, speaker, and laser projector all built into the device. Now, according to the company's FAQ page, these $700 pins will be bricked and will “no longer connect to Humane’s servers,” after Feb. 28, at noon PT.</p><p>Following that, “all customer data, including personally identifiable information will be permanently deleted from Humane’s servers.” The company added that it has stopped selling AI pins and canceled orders that have not been fulfilled. Humane will now be selling all of its assets including the pin's operating software CosmOS, 300 patents, and patent applications, to HP by the end of this month (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/truly-a-middle-finger-humane-bricking-700-ai-pins-with-limited-refunds/">Arstechnica</a>).</p><p>"Humane’s AI platform Cosmos, backed by an incredible group of engineers, will help us create an intelligent ecosystem across all HP devices from AI PCs to smart printers and connected conference rooms. This will unlock new levels of functionality for our customers and deliver on the promises of AI," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://humane.com/media/humane-hp" target="_blank">said</a> Tuan Tran, president of technology and innovation at HP.</p>
<p>Android Central's Andrew Myrick saw it coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-current-problem-with-tech-ai-devices-why-its-your-fault">quite early</a>, predicting that "it could end up being a bigger flop than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/phones/windows-phone/what-would-microsofts-windows-phone-look-like-in-2024-its-like-a-micro-pc-running-windows-12-in-your-pocket" target="_blank">Windows Phone</a> or LG's smartphone business." Why, he argued, would enough people spend that amount on an AI pin when you could get a better-looking gadget like a smartwatch that does everything this pin would?</p><p>Still, many early adopters <em>didn't</em> see this coming. Customers who bought the AI pin were left furious as the company stated that they wouldn't be getting a refund if their device wasn't within the 90-day return window. Humane's FAQ page stated that "all device shipments before November 15th, 2024, are not eligible for refunds. All refunds must be submitted by February 27th, 2025.”</p><p>In a Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/humane/comments/1isq5rx/what_in_the_entire_f_not_happy_at_all_feel_like/">thread</a>, a user wrote that they felt duped considering the device will now effectively act as a paperweight. Some said that they liked the device and were waiting to get updates that would improve the overall performance of the pin.</p><p>"Cancelled my account last month. Being an early adopter means that you get to experience the latest tech, and sometimes you lose like this. No regrets," a user added.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I, for one, will miss Humane. For all it got wrong, it was a bold stab at what gadgets might lie beyond the smartphone.

<p>Other early Humane adopters suggested that this pin should've been sold as a phone accessory, rather than an expensive standalone device.</p><p>Unfortunately for these Humane pin buyers, there's nothing left for them to do except back up any stored pictures, videos, and notes from .Center before the Feb. 28 deadline.</p>

<ul><li>Google is bringing a similar feature to Circle to Search to iOS for the first time.</li><li>Search Screen with Google Lens lets you search anything in the Chrome or Google apps for iOS, with AI Overviews in tow.</li><li>This feature won't fully match Circle to Search, but it is coming to Android as well.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is bringing a similar feature to Circle to Search to the Chrome and Google Search apps for iOS. The company announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-lens/lens-on-ios-ai-overviews/" target="_blank">blog post</a> today, Feb. 19, that it's updating Google Lens in the Chrome and Search apps for iOS to let users "select and search what’s on your screen." Since the feature supports "drawing, highlighting or tapping" and doesn't require taking a screenshot, it's eerily similar to how Circle to Search works on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>.</p><p>Of course, unlike Circle to Search, the updates to Google Lens won't be available throughout iOS. That simply isn't possible due to the restrictions Apple has in place for third-party iPhone apps. However, Android Central tried the new Google Lens functionality in the Chrome and Google apps for iPhone — and it's quite similar in feel to Circle to Search. That is, provided you want to look up something you saw on the web and not, say, a social media app.</p><p>The way it works is simple. After finding something in Chrome or the Google Search apps you want to search, tap the three-dot menu in the toolbar and press <strong>Search Screen with Google Lens</strong>. It's all the way at the bottom, so you'll have to scroll for it. From there, tap, draw, or highlight something on your screen to search it. Depending on the query, you might get an AI Overview summarizing the response.</p><p>Google says that the update is rolling out starting now for "English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are available." The company adds that Search Screen with Google Lens will hit the Google app for Android and iOS first, with the Chrome desktop and mobile apps to follow. With that being said, Android Central was able to test this feature on both the Chrome and Google apps for iOS immediately on an iPhone 16 Pro running iOS 18.</p>

<p>It sounds like this functionality will make its way to the Chrome and Google apps for Android, too — even if it's a bit redundant on devices with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. It's not the first time Google has slowly brought Android exclusive AI features to iOS, though. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-android-auto-chat-summary-brief-spotted">Gemini Live</a>, a conversational and natural voice-first AI interface, started on Android before making its way to iOS.</p><p>For now, Search Screen with Google Lens is a bit difficult to reach in the Chrome for iOS app. However, the company plans to eventually add a Lens icon in the address bar for quick access to the feature in the future.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus announced that its latest flagship phone will now feature a night mode setting on Instagram.</li><li>This tool is known for capturing images/videos in low light settings and will be built into the in-app camera.</li><li>Users are urged to test out the moon icon when it pops up on Instagram.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>In a community post, OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1798899690201153539" target="_blank">announced</a> that its newest flagship device the OnePlus 13's Night Mode feature will be integrated to optimize photos taken on Instagram.</p><p>It is a known fact that with some devices, Instagram's in-built camera reduces the quality of the images captured, and adding additional effects could further compromise the quality. That said, when using social media apps such as Instagram it's an added task to be switching between the phone's camera and the app to put out a photo.</p><p>However, with its latest update, the company says it has heard its users "loud and clear." OnePlus said it has now teamed up with Instagram to enable users to better capture those dark sky/cozy dinner shots easily. This feature will be built directly into the in-app and will be seen as a 'crescent moon' icon. The app will detect that the user is in a low light setting and will prompt them to use the Night mode. The mode once turned on, will use multi-frame processing to brighten shots and reduce noise in the said image. All without ripping out the quality from these shots.</p>

<p>It looks like OnePlus is building on something that began with other Android phones in December 2024. A similar moon icon showed up on devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Samsung Galaxy S24 </a>last year, enabling them to capture better low-light images, with the help of Camera Extensions API (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/12/instagram-on-android-low-light-photos.html?utm_source=syndication" target="_blank">Android Developers Blog</a>). The feature is also available to users with any Pixel device from the Pixel 6 series and up, Samsung Flip 6 or Fold 6, and will be expanded to more devices in the future.</p><p><strong>Here’s how it works for OnePlus 13 users:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Open Instagram’s camera</li><li>When the scene gets dim, Night Mode kicks in <strong>automatically, </strong>look for the moon icon 🌙 at the top.</li><li>Tap the shutter, hold steady for a few seconds, and the app then shoots an image in Night mode.</li></ul>
<p>It is important to note that users need to have the latest Instagram version installed on their devices for this feature to show up. However, it remains unclear when or if this feature will show up in previous-generation OnePlus devices.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to OnePlus about this and will update the article once we have more information.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Apple just announced the iPhone 16e, providing a much-needed upgrade over the incredibly outdated iPhone SE. While the 16e is more expensive than the phone it's replacing, it's still much cheaper than the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9. All while managing to provide about 90% of the same experience that you would get with the standard iPhone 16.</p><p>Normally, I don't pay close attention to when Apple or Samsung release these cheaper alternatives. The cost-cutting measures that are taken usually make for phones that just aren't all that appealing. However, the iPhone 16e is the first time that I've taken a second look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/">press release</a>.</p><p>For one, Apple has finally ditched the Home Button and rounded frame for good, providing a budget option that actually looks modern. Sure, we sacrificed the Home Button for the notch, but hey, beggars can't be choosers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AHGz9BYP7932QkqQcEJJaE" name="iphone-16e-side-view-render" alt="iPhone 16e side profile render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHGz9BYP7932QkqQcEJJaE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1120" height="630" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We also have all of the expected differences, such as the iPhone 16e only being equipped with a single wide-angle rear camera, limited to a 2x optical zoom. MagSafe isn't built-in, but give <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">case makers</a> a few weeks and that problem will swiftly be remedied. However, we can't help but wonder why Apple wouldn't include MagSafe on a phone that shares the design as the one that introduced it.</p><p>What I wasn't expecting was for the iPhone 16e to be able to take full advantage of Apple Intelligence. This includes the addition of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-made-the-right-decision-to-ditch-the-mute-switch-on-the-iphone-15-pro">Action Button</a>, allowing you to ask ChatGPT about life's most important questions. Or, I don't know, point the phone at something, hit the Action Button, and enjoy Apple's version of Google Lens.</p><p>All of this is made possible thanks to Apple's A18 processor, which is another obvious inclusion with the iPhone 16e. However, when looking at Apple's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/?modelList=iphone-16e,iphone-16,iphone-16-pro-max" target="_blank">Compare iPhone Models</a>" page, there's one (seemingly) tiny difference as the 16e is using a "binned" version of the A18.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="t5si5YMrmbX7vSmrEHpFSd" name="apple-a18-graphic" alt="Apple A18 chip graphic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t5si5YMrmbX7vSmrEHpFSd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of having a 6-core CPU paired with a 5-core GPU like the iPhone 16, the A18 in the 16e "only" includes a 4-core GPU. This isn't anything ground-breaking, as companies have been doing this for years, including Apple.</p><p>What makes it interesting is that this is the cheapest phone that has built-in AI capabilities. Both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-tested-samsung-galaxy-s25-google-pixel-9">Google's Pixel 9 and Samsung's Galaxy S25</a> retail for $799, while the iPhone 16e comes in at just $599. And yes, I know there are cheaper phones out there and you can just download Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever other AI app.</p><p>The difference is that Apple Intelligence isn't just the ChatGPT integration with Siri. Apple is also bringing its other AI features to its cheapest iPhone, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/revisiting-apple-clean-up-vs-google-magic-eraser">Clean Up for photos</a>, Image Playground for AI-generated images, and more. That's built-in integration that you just won't find on any of the alternatives. Well, at least not yet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ayQP3ZsBLgHmA53vvnTezQ" name="iphone-16e-visual-intelligence-response" alt="Visual Intelligence response on iPhone 16e" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ayQP3ZsBLgHmA53vvnTezQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-major-specs-render-design-changes-leaked">Google's Pixel 9a</a> could be right around the corner, with recent rumors pointing to a mid-March launch. It's expected to simply be a cheaper version of the Pixel 9, powered by the Tensor G4 and the 9a is apparently set to share the same RAM and storage configurations.</p><p>Meanwhile, we don't know if Samsung is planning to release a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sasmung-galaxy-s25-fe-could-be-called-s25-slim">Galaxy S25 FE</a>, although it would come as a bit of a surprise if it doesn't. As we've seen with the Galaxy S24 FE and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10">Tab S10</a> series, Samsung isn't afraid of using a MediaTek chip. Meaning that it wouldn't be completely on par with its flagship brethren, as the S25 relies on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>That being said, Samsung proved that it could still provide an excellent AI experience even with the switch to MediaTek. Rumors are already suggesting that the S25 FE could be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">Dimensity 9400</a>. Which, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-vs-mediatek-dimensity-9400-vs-google-tensor-g4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">based on our recent comparison</a>, might not be the flagship equivalent of Qualcomm that we were hoping for.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1415px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.83%;"><img id="Ri5t9SatZcsjr9hhZCJW7X" name="google-pixel-9a-alleged-renderings-leaning.jpg" alt="A supposed rendering of the Pixel 9a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ri5t9SatZcsjr9hhZCJW7X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1415" height="790" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, there's one important factor to take into consideration, and that's the price. Assuming that Google and Samsung keep prices the same, this means the Pixel 9a will come in at $499, undercutting the iPhone 16e. While the Galaxy S25 FE would set you back $649, about $150 more than the 16e.</p><p>Although I won't be picking up an iPhone 16e for myself, I am curious about how well it will perform those AI-powered tasks. If it's able to keep up with the iPhone 16, then Apple has yet again put some immense pressure on both Google and Samsung.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-date-official" target="_blank">Google I/O 2025</a> is right around the corner and the invite-only affair will be live-streamed for the world to see and learn more than it ever wanted to know about <del>AI</del> Google. You probably know a little bit about Google I/O but chances are that stops once you get past the first-day keynote speech.</p><p>Google I/O is a lot more than that. But it's also something you aren't particularly interested in or think you need to care about no matter how big an Android fan you might be.</p>
<p>So what's the big deal and why are so many Android enthusiasts talking about Google I/O? They're really not. I'll explain.</p>
<h2 id="keynote-speeches-are-an-outlier-2">Keynote speeches are an outlier</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LTtQJqtxv6zyMCLuip8MHD" name="Google-IO-2024-Sundar-Pichai.jpeg" alt="Sundar Pichai on stage at Google I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LTtQJqtxv6zyMCLuip8MHD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everything you know about Google I/O probably comes from one of the keynote speeches. There is a day-one keynote where Sundar and company get on stage to talk about the new and hopefully exciting things that are coming to the world of Android and Google, and there are "secondary" keynotes like <em>What's new in Chrome</em>.</p><p>These are often fascinating. Historically they've given us a good look at what Google thinks we want even if the last few have morphed into an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-keynote-made-cool-ai-features-look-boring">AI drinking game</a>. This is what most of the tech press will be covering and it is all the information the average Android fan cares about.</p>
<p>So what about the rest of the three days? If you like programming and development, the rest of the time is for you.</p><p>I don't mean just workshops and tutorials for coding practices (though those are at I/O, too). You can learn about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-in-android-studio-debut">tools developers need</a>, new changes to how third parties can integrate with core features, and even updates on licensing and agreements you need to follow to develop for the Google ecosystem.</p>
<p>It's good stuff and very important. It's also not something most people care about, which explains why tech publications never talk about it. Would you rather see another article about what's coming in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> or one about updating your developer toolkit to leverage new APIs?</p><p>That's because you're (probably) not a developer. You do not need to know about any of this stuff, no matter how important it all is.</p>
<p>That's the thing; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-improving-the-tools-app-developers-use-is-just-as-important-as-any-android-update">it is important</a>. More important than incremental UI changes or new AI features will ever be, because these tools are what builds an Android/Google ecosystem.</p><p>The same goes for any platform. Apple and Microsoft would not be where they are today without third-parties building reasons to use them. Think about it — do you want to use a smartphone platform that has zero apps? You didn't answer "yes" but if you did I'll mail you an old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/launcher-10-android-phone-windows-phone-os-style">Windows phone</a>. That was said in jest but it shows exactly what I mean — Windows on phones died because the app ecosystem just wasn't there.</p>
<p>Developer conferences exist to try to make sure that doesn't happen. Hour after hour of complicated and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/">confusing presentations</a> might seem pointless to you, but the person building the next great idea is paying close attention.</p><p>It's OK that Google I/O isn't for you. What you can do is follow us to see the new and exciting things coming and leave the rest for the people who need it. You can then enjoy what they've done with everything they learned.</p>

<ul><li>Google is likely to reintroduce the “Battery Health” settings page with Android 16 for Pixel devices.</li><li>The page displays battery condition, and capacity, and provides tips for extending battery lifespan.</li><li>Google is also tipped to be working on a new feature for Pixel phones that will recalibrate battery measurements over weeks.</li></ul>

<hr>
<p>Android 16 beta 2 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-is-here-with-new-media-camera-and-graphics-updates">released</a> late last week for Pixel device owners, which has been a significant update over the first one, with upgrades to the camera and media settings. New findings now reveal that Google is probably bringing the long-awaited “Battery health” settings page again with the latest beta.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/16/android-16-pixel-battery-health/">9to5Google</a> and their APK Insights of the Settings Services app bearing version 1.1.0.717462792 — has revealed strings regarding a new Battery Health feature, which was ventured back in 2022 — with Android 13 QPR1. While it didn’t turn up to be live, it appears the search giant is giving it a try again this time with Android 16.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1344px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.62%;"><img id="njxfRzKJS5GdEGuVoQuYpT" name="Pixel-battery-health-android-16" alt="Android 16's battery health feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/njxfRzKJS5GdEGuVoQuYpT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1344" height="2992" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new page can be found in Pixel phones featuring the latest beta and users can navigate to Settings> Battery> Battery Health — right above the Battery percentage toggle. Going in further showcases the “View battery health status and tips to extend your battery’s lifespan” section.</p><p>Right underneath, Pixel phone users will be able to check their battery condition, which shows whether it is normal or not. Battery capacity presumably indicates it's lifespan. If the phone is brand new, it is likely going to show 100%, and it should gradually decrease as the phone is used for longer periods, like a couple of years, for example.</p>
<p>Pixel phone users can further get to know how to take care of their device’s batteries with the help of guides and relevant articles provided in the support tab. Additionally, there is a Charging optimization toggle, which can be enabled.</p><p>On the whole, the new inclusion looks to be a significant improvement over the previous spotting in the Android 13 QPR1, notes 9to5. The same added section, previously just featured the support articles on how to take good care of the device’s battery by enabling adaptive charging, and other such suggestions.</p>

<p>The publication has further found out through the APK strings that Google will likely offer a new ability to “improve battery measurements” by bringing in a recalibration process, which will be carried out over weeks. Post which, the battery capacity status will likely be updated. If at all users see a decline in the status, they might perceive their battery lasting “less time between charges.”</p><p>It is encouraging to have the feature in the works, which can turn out to be quite useful for Pixel owners if it rolls out via the Android 16 stable release.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="is-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-worth-it-2">Is the Motorola Razr Plus (2024) worth it?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. The clamshell device is just as impressive as Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6 in just about every way imaginable, but it goes on sale way more often. You get efficient Android performance thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3s processor, plus a great camera with a 2X telephoto sensor, Moto AI software features, and a durable folding hinge. </p><p>The Razr Plus doesn't get quite as many software updates as Samsung's 2024 flip phone, but that's a small price to pay when you consider how many deals are regularly available for the device. After all, there's a reason we called it the "perfect flip phone" in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>.</p>

<h2 id="will-there-be-a-motorola-razr-plus-released-in-2025-2">Will there be a Motorola Razr Plus released in 2025?</h2>
<p>Although we don't have any official information just yet, a number of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">rumors and leaks</a> have suggested that we should be getting a new Motorola Razr Plus at some point this year. </p><p>This 2025 is expected to retain its vegan leather finish and large cover display, with the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> under the hood. You can also expect the phone to sport some new and improved AI features. If we're lucky, Motorola will keep the $999 price tag for the 2025 phone, but there's a chance it'll go up a bit, à la Google's latest offerings. </p>

<ul><li>GSMA entries in the IMEI database by Google give us the official model numbers for the Pixel 10 series.</li><li>The entries are a sign that the Google Pixel 10 lineup is nearing regulatory approval.</li><li>The phones are likely about six months away from release, and will include the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With the Google Pixel 9 already about six months old, we're already starting to look ahead to the Google Pixel 10 series. It looks like Google is, too, because four new GSMA database entries point to the presumed model numbers for each Pixel 10 variant, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-google-pixel-10-series-model-numbers-leaked-gsma-database/" target="_blank">SmartPrix</a>. For those unfamiliar, this IMEI database is hosted by the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) and phones are added to it as they near regulatory approval.</p><p>The four unreleased smartphone models added to the GSMA database have Google, Inc. listed as the manufacturer — all but confirming these are part of the Google Pixel 10 series. These models are expected to be the Google Pixel 10, Google Pixel 10 Pro, Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>According to the entries, the Google Pixel 10 series will have the following model numbers:</p>
<ul><li>Google Pixel 10: GLBW0, GL066</li><li>Google Pixel 10 Pro: G4QUR, GN4F5</li><li>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: GUL82</li><li>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: GU0NP</li></ul>
<p>Compared to the average leak, these listings are extremely reliable because they come straight from the GSMA and Google. Typically, phones start appearing in databases and regulatory filings as they get closer to release. Due to the new Pixel release window in August, the Pixel 10 series is likely about six months away — that's why we're starting to hear more about the unreleased devices now.</p><p>You'll notice that the Pixel 10a isn't listed here, and that's because it's still over a year away from release. The Google Pixel 9a, a midrange phone and a successor to the Pixel 8a, isn't even out yet. Although the release for the Pixel 9a is nearing, it makes sense that the Pixel 10a isn't more than a rumor right now.</p><p>Speaking of rumors, you can read all about the Google Pixel 10 series and everything we want to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">in this complete guide</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung announced it's expanding Digital Key support through the Wallet app for Polestar and Volvo models.</li><li>The initial update is limited to the Volvo EX90 and the Polestar 3; however, Samsung states more vehicles will be added.</li><li>The company recently included several Audi models in the Wallet's Digital Key.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is extending its digital aid to more vehicles with a new update inbound for a Wallet feature.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-wallet-expands-digital-key-support-for-select-volvo-cars-and-polestar-vehicles">company announced</a> a Digital Key expansion through the Samsung Wallet app to two more car brands: Volvo and Polestar. Not every car under these brands will support the company's digital key. The post states the Volvo EX90 and the Polestar 3 are the first to receive this Digital Key expansion update for Galaxy phone users.</p><p>The press release states "more vehicles will follow;" however, Samsung does not state when drivers of either brand could see more cars added.</p><p>There's no specific date, but Samsung states drivers can expect its Digital Key expansion to hit the Volvo EX90 "this month" in Europe, North America, Latin America, and Asia. The Polestar 3 is also expected to receive it in Europe, North America, and Asia "this month."</p><p>Of course, Digital Key support means users can use their phones to lock, unlock, and start their cars. Samsung reiterates using UWB (ultra-wideband) connectivity for these features, which can be activated remotely. NFC is available with a Digital Key for "tap-to-unlock and start." Samsung Wallet even lets users share their Digital Key with others; however, the only restriction is it must be done between Galaxy devices.</p><p>The company draws attention to its EAL6+ security certification, which is stated to protect users against unauthorized access.</p>

<p>Samsung has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-digital-car-key-can-now-unlock-certain-kia-bmw-and-genesis-models">slowly expanding</a> its coverage of Digital Keys for various car brands, like Kia, BMW, and Genesis models. That update featured limited vehicles for each brand, which first kicked off in South Korea. Mirroring the update today, the cars received UWB and NFC support to assist users in ways that are most useful to them.</p><p>Most recently, Samsung brought its Digital Key via the Wallet app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/your-samsung-phone-is-about-to-double-as-a-digital-key-for-certain-audi-cars">to select Audi vehicles</a>. The company announced its initial availability for the following models: the A6 e-tron, the Q6 e-tron, and the A5. Compatibility isn't so widespread as Samsung stated the Galaxy S20 series to the Galaxy S24 can utilize its Digital Key with Audi. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on" target="_blank">Galaxy S25</a> will likely find support for Audi vehicles, too.</p><p>Elsewhere, the BMW app on Android and iOS brought "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bmw-digital-key-plus-android-support">Digital Key Plus</a>" support to Galaxy and Pixel phones. This could be an alternative if users would rather lean on BMW's app instead of the Samsung Wallet. During its rollout, the post informed users of its limited compatibility with BMW cars manufactured from 2022 onward.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google seems to be doing some damage control after it deleted several cultural events from its official holiday list on the Google Calendar. Even though this move was made last year in 2024, several users took notice of it now and were left disappointed by this move. Black History Month, Indigenous People Month, Jewish Heritage, Holocaust Remembrance Day, and Hispanic Heritage have also been removed, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/calendar/thread/322570334/why-is-pride-month-removed-from-the-google-calendar?hl=en" target="_blank">a Google product expert</a> (as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/608858/google-calendar-missing-events-holidays" target="_blank">The Verge</a>).</p><p>While this may just seem like any other update that Google tends to make, without announcing the change it seems like it didn't want to grab a lot of attention when the move was made. Several users took to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/calendar/thread/322035139?fbclid=IwY2xjawIOCbtleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHaAaRLxfNUJ_ngEQv6jC11CtlYv4Pjgrcgztv2pABS_SMe7bE9lPjglvYw_aem_qKRtk6CAhPutSKpxGKrcpw" target="_blank">Calendar's help page</a> to express their concerns on the issue, and probably find out why Google chose to make this move without giving them a heads up.</p><p>But Google does have its side of the story. Earlier, the Calendar team relied on a manual approach to fill out important dates and events. This meant the team had to seive through and enter each event while keeping in mind the cultural celebrations across numerous countries. According to the company, this time-consuming process resulted in some events being missed, which highlighted a need for a more streamlined approach.</p><p>In a statement to The Verge, Google’s spokesperson Madison Cushman Veld said, "We got feedback that some other events and countries were missing — and maintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn’t scalable or sustainable," Veld added.</p><p>Google only put out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/google-calendar-changes-cultural-moments/">public statement </a>on Feb. 12, following some backlash it received. It said that it wasn't "feasible to put hundreds of moments in everyone’s calendars." And that by showing only public holidays and observances from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://timeanddate.com/" target="_blank">timeanddate.com</a> it will be more consistent with other online calendar providers. However, it has left the calendar open for those who'd like to add holidays/events manually.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-move-seems-off-2">Why this move seems off</h2>
<p>Google may have removed significant events like Black History Month, Pride Month, and others, but this has sparked a debate not just for me, but others too on representation and visibility. As someone who lives in Toronto, Canada, I've been exposed to enough diversity, and to understand and experience different holidays that are so important to the North American community is not only a privilege but also comes as a reminder for me to be an ally.</p><p>While Google may push it off by stating sustainability reasons, it comes off as the company valuing efficiency over cultural sensitivity. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/google-calendar-changes-cultural-moments/">community support thread</a>, one user wrote:</p><p>"What benefits do you get from seeing marginalized communities suffer? That is disrespectful and sadistic. I hope you change ... not recognizing the hard work of these kinds of communities for rights, equality, and recognition."</p><p>While another wrote:  "By removing Black History Month, Pride, and Women's History Month -and others - GOOGLE is attempting to delegitimize these designated months. It seems cowardly  - and backward.  What is GOOGLE afraid of?"</p><p>This move even though made late last year, came as a surprise to many seeing the change in the new calendar year when users noticed the events missing in both desktop and mobile apps. This made them believe that it could be an impact of recently inaugurated President Donald Trump's executive order that overturned diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.</p><p>Following this, several companies, including Google, said it was reviewing some diversity initiatives and effectively removing its goal to hire more employees from underrepresented groups. This is surprising since Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/google-diversity-equity-inclusion-program-trump-16a937d5d9b6447251c4c40c2ad1c915">prides itself </a>on hiring people from underrepresented groups for more than a decade now. But in a recent 10-K report that Alphabet filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Google effectively omitted this line“committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.”</p><p>With the already sensitive political scenario in the U.S., this move from Google tipped the scales, making it a little more difficult for these communities to feel seen according to many users.</p>
<h2 id="a-possible-workaround-2">A possible workaround</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GHEQX2MzNyM5Fon5gx34cU" name="Google-doodle-martin-luther-king-day" alt="Martin Luther King Day Google Doodle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GHEQX2MzNyM5Fon5gx34cU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There seems to be no end to this debate, while Google tried to justify its move by stating that, as a company, it continues to celebrate and promote a variety of cultural moments across its products.  Additionally, it said that Google Calendar is customizable, so users can go into their calendars and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/13748345?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&sjid=9012651685422336560-NC" target="_blank">add all the important events</a>, just like they would to a friend's birthday or an upcoming meeting, the company argues.</p><p>The tech giant also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/google-calendar-removes-black-history-month-pride-month">confirms</a> that these changes will not affect other cultural acknowledgments, such as Google Doodles, which frequently remind users about important dates and events.</p><p>But it misses the point. The question isn't about personalization, it is more about collectively acknowledging these events on a larger scale and showing allyship with the people who've contributed to the betterment of these marginalized communities.</p><p>Some users have simply decided to boycott Google Calendar as their first choice, in a digital protest so to speak, while some continue to advocate on these community threads for people to add these events manually to their calendars.</p>

<ul><li>Google was spotted going live with a new dedicated website for its Tasks app.</li><li>The website is light, providing a view of your active Tasks, completion marks, repeat options, and full/quick Task creation views.</li><li>Google's Gemini on the web recently picked up a Task and Keep extension, which lets users ask the AI to create new items to complete on their schedule.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is giving one of its most underrated apps some space to shine for users with busy schedules.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/18/google-tasks-website-2/">9to5Google</a>, the company recently went live with a dedicated website for the Tasks app. Google keeps things simple as the Tasks website is extremely light with options to create new tasks and complete them in its main view. Users will find a "My Tasks" box centered on their screen with empty bubbles that you can click to complete a task.</p><p>The "Completed" button produces a drop-down menu if you're curious about everything you've accomplished.</p><p>The "Add a Task" option from the My Tasks box is a quick way to add something. Users are asked to deliver a task title, some details if necessary, and when it should be completed: Today, Tomorrow, or you can click the Calendar option to select a date. Another option is similar to Twitter's (oops, X's) repost icon. Clicking that will let you "repeat" it, so you won't have to retype the task's contents.</p><p>The left-hand side hosts your task categories and a proper "Create" button. This is your standard task creation view as it creates an overlayed box for information. Unlike the quick add method, the Create button gives a full view of your title, manual date/time input, if it should repeat, and a description box.</p><p>Additionally, as the publication notes, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tasks.google.com/tasks/">dedicated Google Tasks website</a> will not redirect users to the Calendar app. The two have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-calendar-for-android-finally-adds-a-dedicated-tasks-view">become inseparable</a>, but now, users can have more organization with which Google app they want to interact. Tasks still appear in the Calendar app.</p>

<p>Google Tasks has gone under the radar for years, turning it into quite the underrated app — especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tasks-best-gmail-feature">when it comes to Gmail</a>. The company added a Task creation button when checking your emails, which lets you create one, as well as a link back to the message. Users can add their own notes to ensure they remember what needs to be done.</p><p>This level of creation mirrors what users would find in the Tasks app, which is buried in the Calendar or accessible through its dedicated website.</p><p>What's more, in September, Gemini on the web <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gets-google-keep-and-google-tasks-extensions-support">picked up extensions</a> for Tasks and Keep. Users can type @Google Tasks when talking to Gemini to create a new item remotely, without diving into the app yourself. Google detailed several prompts users can utilize, like "Remind me on [date] at [time] to [task]" or "Add [task] in my to-dos."</p>

<hr>
<p>Apple today <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/">announced</a> the iPhone 16e, a $599 spiritual successor to the iPhone SE with a 6.1-inch screen and an A18 chip. There's a lot to like about this midrange smartphone, and it has the potential to shake up the market — potentially disrupting phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>. However, Android users should only be worried about one iPhone 16e specification, and that's the Apple C1 modem.</p><p>5G modems are one of the rare mobile device components that only a few companies on the planet have created with success. Qualcomm, MediaTek, Samsung, and Huawei are a few of them, and that's basically the end of the list. The iPhone 16e represents a breakthrough for Apple because it's the first device to use an Apple-designed modem, called the C1.</p><p>Just like how Apple developed its own in-house silicon and phased out Intel for its Mac processors, you can expect future iPhones to eventually use Apple C-series modems exclusively. The company told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-reveals-first-custom-modem-chip-shifting-away-qualcomm-2025-02-19/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> that Apple will roll out its own modems across all of its products, though the exact timeline for that rollout is unclear.</p><p>The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro lineups use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-x75-5g-modem">Qualcomm modems</a>, which have, to date, been faster and more reliable than anything Apple has been able to develop on its own. For $1 billion, the company bought "the majority" of Intel's modem business in 2019. It wanted to make its own modems, but as of 2023, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphone-modem-chip-failure-6fe33d19" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>  report detailed Apple's struggles — and thus we got iPhones with Qualcomm modems for two more years.</p><p>Now, it seems the company is finally on the right track to ditch Qualcomm in favor of its own 5G hardware. The Apple C1 chip features a baseband modem fabricated using the 4-nanometer process and a 7nm transceiver, per Reuters. It lacks millimeter-wave 5G support, but Apple says it offers "industry-leading efficiency" that leads to better battery life.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qualcomm believes it's still the industry leader in cellular technologies.</p><p>"The best commercial smartphones currently feature our leading 5G-Advanced modem-RF system, which uses AI to optimize for the fastest and highest-capacity networks in every country," a Qualcomm spokesperson told Android Central. "We'll soon be unveiling the future of connectivity at MWC Barcelona."</p><p>Apple has no plans to sell C-series modems externally, and that's unlikely to change. So, why should Android fans care? The iPhone 16e and the C1 modem matter because they outline the blueprint for large Android OEMs to ditch Qualcomm themselves for their own in-house chips. Following the precedent Apple just set, it's possible that one day we could see Samsung use Exynos chips for both mobile processors and modems, which would be huge for the Android market.</p>

<p>Apple's reasons for using its own C-series modems are quite clear. For one, they're likely cheaper. Apple spent a billion dollars buying part of Intel's 5G business and maybe more on research and development, but it also pays a fortune to Qualcomm for the licensing of its technologies and the use of its modems. Based on napkin math and build-of-materials estimates from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/how-much-revenue-qualcomm-will-make-through-iphone-16-5g-modem-sales/" target="_blank">WCCF Tech</a>, Apple could pay Qualcomm over $2.5 billion dollars if it meets its sales targets for the iPhone 16 lineup.</p><p>Aside from cash considerations, in-house modems allow Apple to tightly integrate its modems, processors, and software for greater efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="android-phones-could-use-a-lower-bom-and-more-efficiency-too-2">Android phones could use a lower BOM and more efficiency, too</h2>
<p>The good news? There's absolutely no reason why Android phones from Samsung or Google couldn't also benefit from a lower build-of-materials cost and greater efficiency. If one of those companies managed to build an SoC and modem good enough, it could leave Qualcomm behind once and for all — result in Android phones with better battery life and potentially a lower price tag.</p><p>Android phones are a bit trickier than iPhones, because modems are typically integrated at the SoC level. For instance, because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> chipset, it also uses a Qualcomm modem. Apple and Samsung would both love to use their own in-house modems, but they're working in reverse. Apple made its processors first, then worked on modems. By comparison, Samsung already has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9a-modem-tensor-g4-rumored-changes">Exynos Modem 5400 ready</a> — it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-rumors">inside the Google Pixel 9 series</a> — but it can't quite get its Exynos processors up to par.</p><p>Apple's strategy is simple. Start with cheaper, lower-stakes phones to iron out any potential issues with the Apple C1 modem without tweaking flagship iPhones before its 5G technology is ready for primetime. And in a way, Samsung is already employing this strategy. Plenty of Samsung devices already use Exynos processors and modems as the company desperately tries to ramp up its chipmaking quality.</p><p>All that's left is for Samsung to make an Exynos chip that can go toe-to-toe with Qualcomm's best. When it does, Samsung will be able to leave Qualcomm behind, having near complete control over the processors, modems, and software in its devices for peak efficiency.</p><p>Apple is officially proof that it's possible. However, if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims">recent yield estimates for Exynos chips</a> are any indication, Samsung has a long way to go.</p>

<p>So, you’re in the market for an ultra-durable smartwatch. For Apple iPhone owners, the choice is simple: go with the Apple Watch Ultra 2. But for Android phone owners, it’s a bit more complicated. Two top-notch models worth considering are the new OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra. Both are fantastic options, but which one should you choose? We’re here to help.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-watch-3-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-design-and-durability-2">OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: Design and durability</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XGMfVFB3GyuriuV4tB2hi" name="oneplus-watch-3-workout-watch-face-with-shoes-01" alt="A OnePlus Watch 3 with a fitness watch face on a pair of workout shoes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XGMfVFB3GyuriuV4tB2hi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 comes in an Obsidian or Emerald finish with a stainless-steel case and titanium bezel with a PVD coating for extra durability and scratch-resistance. It has a 2D sapphire crystal display for even further strength and ruggedness.</p><p>The watch meets MIL-STD-810H military-grade durability standards, so you can be confident that it can withstand the elements and day-to-day use. It boasts an IP68 and 5ATM rating so it’s resistant to both water and dust: you can comfortably go for a swim, shower, or run in the rain with this watch on.</p><p>Equipped with a 1.5-inch LTPO AMOLED 466 x 466 screen, you’ll get up to 2,200 nits of brightness, so you can easily view the screen in even bright sunlight. While it’s on the larger and heavier side when it comes to smartwatches, it’s still comfortable to wear all day.</p><p>What fans will especially appreciate is that it has a redesigned crown compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> that can now actually rotate, not just be pushed in for selections. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">his initial review</a> after using the OnePlus Watch 3 for 10 days, Nicholas Sutrich says the crown’s design is “phenomenal,” and even more comfortable to use than the rotating crown on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> thanks to the larger size and the textured and offset angle.</p><p>Battery life is what really sets this smartwatch apart. It employs the same dual-chip architecture as the previous generation OnePlus 2, which consists of a Snapdragon W5 chip to handle the more intense features, like workout tracking and apps, and an upgraded BES2800 chip to tackle everything else that runs in the background.</p><p>Thanks to this dual-chip set-up along with the 631mAh Silicon NanoStack battery, the same one the company uses in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> smartphone, you get up to five days or 120 hours per charge in smart mode, which is the standard, everyday mode. This decreases to up to three days or 72 hours in heavy usage mode, but you can get as much as up to 16 days of use in power-saving mode. Leveraging VOOC fast charging, you can plug it in for 10 minutes for an entire extra day of usage.</p><p>Sutrich calls the battery life “legitimately insane,” adding that a quick 25-minute charge got him from just 19% to 99% when using the included charging dock and a OnePlus 80W charger. I once had mine at 20% battery and was still able to do a 30-minute workout, a 40-minute walk, and get through the rest of the day in power-saving mode without it dying on me. That’s pretty incredible!</p><p>Along with the standard selection of watch faces from which to choose, including using your own photos, you can also use a Video Watch Face with the OnePlus Watch 3. While this will drain the battery more quickly, it’s cool to have a moving, animated image of your own as the face. I, for example, use an image of water hitting the rocks on a beach that provides a nice soothing reprieve when I don’t need to see my stats on screen.</p><p>You also get access to download tons of apps, including Google apps like Gmail, Maps, and Wallet. The OnePlus Watch 3 is ultra-affordable and comes with two years of software and security support.</p>

<p>How does the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra compare? As Samsung’s answer to the Apple Watch Ultra, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is the company’s ultra-rugged smartwatch, designed for outdoor adventurers. And it has plenty of features and design functions to match.</p><p>Available in Titanium Gray, Titanium White, or Titanium Silver, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has a same-sized 1.5-inch Sapphire Crystal Super AMOLED display with a slightly higher resolution at 480 x 480. The Dynamic Lug System makes it more comfortable for all-day wear. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Michael Hicks says in his review</a> that the watch is somewhat clunky, though he grew accustomed to having it on his wrist over time.</p><p>Along with the standard band that comes in the box, you can opt for a Bespoke model, choosing from Marine, Trail, or PeakForm, depending on the activities you do the most. Hicks found it simple to swap bands using the Dynamic Lug system, though this limits the options to Samsung bands only.</p><p>Unlike the OnePlus Watch 3, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra does not have a rotating bezel. It does, however, have a Quick Button that you can customize to open whatever function you like, and do things like pause an activity during a workout.</p><p>As an extremely durable smartwatch, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is made from a Titanium Grade 4 frame and boasts an incredible 10ATM water resistance. This means you can swim even deeper with it (down to 100 meters for up to 10 minutes). It also has an IP68 rating and meets the same MIL-STD-810H rating for durability.</p><p>Additionally, this smartwatch is rated to operate at more altitudes as well, from 500 meters below sea level up to 9,000 meters high. This makes it a good option for swimmers, cyclers, hikers, climbers, and those who love to engage in other extreme outdoor sports.</p><p>Choose from a wide range of watch faces, and the watch even automatically switches to Night Mode so you can more easily check your stats at a glance in the dark. Peak brightness is higher at an impressive 3,000 nits, so viewing the screen in sunlight is comfortable, too. Hicks says it “looks fantastic in direct California sunlight, richly colorful and unimpeded by reflections.” You can access all the Google apps your heart desires as well as Galaxy services and other compatible third-party apps.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has a smaller 590mAh battery that promises about 2.5 days or 60 hours of regular use, up to 48 hours in Exercise Power Saving mode, and up to 100 hours or four days in Power Saving mode. It won’t last as long as the OnePlus Watch 3 but Hicks finds these numbers to be accurate following Samsung’s software update patch that fixed initial battery life headaches. It supports WPC-based fast charging with a compatible WPC wireless charger.</p><p>A plus with this smartwatch is that the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra comes with four years of software and security support, twice as long as the OnePlus Watch 3. However, it’s also twice the price. There is an LTE option if you want cellular connectivity on the go without your phone, though this adds to the bottom line and recurring costs as well.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how these two smartwatches compare when it comes to basic specs.</p>

<h2 id="oneplus-watch-3-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-what-you-can-do-with-them-2">OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: What you can do with them</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G8Kf9rkCF3cCrn95J9FVHL" name="oneplus-watch-3-60-second-health-check" alt="Using the new 60-second health check-in feature on a OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G8Kf9rkCF3cCrn95J9FVHL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that we have established that both these watches are ultra-durable with fantastic, bright screens and good (or even better) battery life, what can you do with them?</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3, as noted, employs a dual chip architecture that makes it both battery efficient and powerful. Running Google Wear OS 5, it captures all the data you would expect from a premium smartwatch. It has advanced heart rate monitoring thanks to the 8-channel optical heart rate sensor along with vascular health monitoring, a wrist temperature sensor, and a 16-channel optical pulse oximeter sensor. Sutrich indeed says that health tracking has been drastically improved compared to the OnePlus Watch 2. In fact, he calls it “monumental.”</p><p>There are more than 100 sports modes from which to choose, along with fat burn efficiency in running mode, which serious runners will appreciate. There are 11 pro workout modes as well, including ones like racket sports whereby the watch can analyze metrics like strokes and swing speed. There’s also auto-detection for six common workouts.</p><p>The OHealth app has been updated to include a new health data view that summarizes key metrics about your health and wellness. This includes not only activity but also sleep, with more accurate sleep tracking than in previous generation models as well with features like a score and even snoring data. Sutrich loves how the OHealth app now presents the data, calling the organization concise with the laying not wasting any space. “I really love that I can view everything on my watch afterwards,” he adds.</p><p>A 60-second health check-in feature that measures heart rate, blood oxygen, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age all at once in a single minute is coming via an over-the-air update in March 2025. There’s also ECG readings but this feature isn’t available in North America with no plans to arrive here either.</p><p>Speaking of mental wellness, there’s also a new 360 mind and body feature that checks in on your heart rate variability, stress relief, and breathing to provide stats as well as tips to help you improve.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9Tpd5FVeGcDAeu3mAesDZd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-run-activity.jpeg" alt="The main run activity data screen on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Tpd5FVeGcDAeu3mAesDZd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is, as mentioned, designed primarily for adventurers and athletes. As such, it’s a pretty powerful smartwatch in its own right.</p><p>Running on an Exynos W1000 processor, it also comes loaded with WearOS 5 as well, affording advanced performance and smooth operation. Hicks says it isn’t markedly faster than previous-generation phones, but you won’t notice a lot of lag and it can handle demanding tasks without issue.</p><p>You can track tons of different workout types as well as sports. This includes multi-course workouts in the new Multi-sports tile, ideal for those who have signed up for a triathlon, for example. Cyclers will appreciate the Functional Threshold Power (FTP) measurement, which clocks their maximum cycling power in four minutes using AI-powered metrics.</p><p>You’ll also enjoy features like personalized heart rate zones along with Samsung’s BioActive sensor and a temperature sensor.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="iZuuQFvr93XmEpcerxjbvL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-sos-emergency-shortcut.jpeg" alt=""Press the Home button 5 times to call an emergency number" reads the text on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZuuQFvr93XmEpcerxjbvL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are some additional cool features with both these smartwatches. While the OnePlus Watch 3 works with all brands of Android devices (sadly, no iPhone support with the OHealth app just yet), you’ll get an enhanced experience when using it with a OnePlus phone. This includes the ability to use the watch as a controller for compatible video playback sites, like TikTok and YouTube Shorts. You can also use it as a camera controller with both OnePlus and OPPO phones.</p><p>The Watch also has features like Find my device and an SOS mode for safety, ideal for those who go running in the early morning or late-night hours, for example, or in case of any type of emergency.</p><p>There are useful safety features in the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra as well, including an emergency siren and emergency alerts.</p><p>It, too, works with all brands of Android devices (no iPhone support either) but you get specific features and a more seamless pairing with a Samsung Galaxy phone. It also works wonderfully with other Samsung devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a>. With this smart ring, the two devices together can provide more precise and accurate tracking day and night, especially during sleep.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xrhfyJ4WfQ3V2nya8pUDj" name="oneplus-watch-3-workout-watch-face-with-shoes-02" alt="A OnePlus Watch 3 with a fitness watch face on a pair of workout shoes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xrhfyJ4WfQ3V2nya8pUDj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When the decision comes down to the OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, you can’t go wrong with either. If you have a OnePlus phone, the obvious choice is the OnePlus Watch 3. If you use a Samsung Galaxy device, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is a no-brainer option. But if you aren’t tied to either ecosystem or you have one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> from another brand, this is where it gets tricky.</p><p>There’s no denying that the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is expensive, much more expensive than the OnePlus Watch 3. But it has features that extreme athletes will appreciate, including the 10ATM rating that makes it the ideal choice for those who often engage in water sports and activities.</p><p>However, it’s a lot of watch for everyday users. If you’re just looking for a solid and rugged smartwatch for everyday use, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the better option. Not only is it rugged and durable as well, albeit with a lesser water-resistance rating, but you also get a much longer battery life. It has enhanced sensors and can track all types of sports and activities. You might not get some of the same intricate features, but you get others, like those pro workout modes if you play tennis, for example, or you’re a serious runner.</p><p>At a fraction of the price, the OnePlus Watch 3 offers better value. However, since it’s only supported via software for half the time, you’ll have to take this into consideration as well. This doesn’t mean you <em>have</em> to replace it after two years: the watch will continue to work provided you take care of it. But this limitation is worth keeping in mind.</p><p>That said, even if you upgraded with a newer model two years from now at the same price, you’re still coming out ahead and not breaking the bank now. So, go with the OnePlus Watch 3 unless you’re a serious athlete who owns a Samsung Galaxy phone and wants the best pairing possible with that device.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out a couple of updates, beginning with iPhones, which receive a "Search Screen with Google Lens" in Chrome and the Google app.</li><li>The company is also upgrading AI Overview's visual search knowledge through Lens for more "novel" cases.</li><li>The search feature hitting iPhones is reminiscent of Android's larger Circle to Search feature, which lets users surface it anywhere for help.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is bringing a major search function for Apple's iPhones while also improving the search experience across all devices.</p><p>In a press release, the company states iOS devices — specifically iPhones — will soon receive a familiar "screen search" capability. Google states Apple's smartphone users will be able to "draw, highlight, or tap" anything on their screen to run a Search; however, its usage is limited. The post states iPhones can only use this screen search function in Chrome or the Google app for iOS.</p><p>In short, tapping the three-dot menu at the bottom of Chrome iOS' UI will surface a short menu with a "Search Screen with Google Lens" option. When tapped, your screen will turn multi-colored, indicating the time to draw or highlight what you're curious about. After a brief wait, Google Lens will run that query through the Search engine and display any relevant information.</p><p>Moreover, iPhone users can add a question <em>after </em>the query is completed, in case they're interested in learning more about the subject.</p><p>The post states this screen search will work for articles, products, and videos found in Chrome or the Google app on iOS. There's more to this as the company teases it will soon add a Lens icon to the address bar in Chrome for iPhones, similar to the web-experience.</p><p>The company adds iPhones will begin receiving this update "this week" globally for Chrome and the Google app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:442px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:135.75%;"><img id="GrFewEFxKgRzva7poXueYe" name="google-lens-ios-chrome-update-screen-search" alt="Google Lens is bringing an update to iPhones that lets users search content on their screens by drawing, highlighting, or tapping in Chrome and the Google app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GrFewEFxKgRzva7poXueYe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="442" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the tech giant is giving Search's AI Overviews an upgrade. Google states it's rolling out an update that expands the bite-sized tool's knowledge of imagery for better assistance. According to Google, AI Overviews will now leverage "advanced AI models" through Lens to "provide information on the contents of more novel or unique images."</p><p>Google states, that with this new upgrade, users won't need to write a question to aid the AI in discovering the information they need. The visual search <em>should </em>be enough to surface answers to images that are out of the norm: like a shattered windshield.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:155.04%;"><img id="9HDhgRZeVDtxQB5Dqsymij" name="google-lens-ai-overviews-visual-search-upgrade" alt="Google Lens is upgrading its visual search capabilities on Android and iOS as AI Overviews become more knowledgeable about "novel" subjects/imagery." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9HDhgRZeVDtxQB5Dqsymij.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="387" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update is preparing to roll out in the Google app on Android and iOS "this week" for English-language users where AI Overviews are available. The company states this expansion of knowledge will hit Chrome and desktops "soon."</p><p>It goes without saying that the "Search Screen" function for iPhones is a slightly toned-down variant of Android's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. Apple's devices are restricted to only a couple of apps, and it's unclear if that'll be extended in the future. Nevertheless, those on Android with Circle to Search support can surface the AI-backed function anywhere on their device for assistance.</p><p>Also, the last Google Lens update was in October, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-search-ads-video-function-update">brought recording capabilities</a> to Android. To expand its visual search prowess, users can record a short video of something they're curious about and Lens will run its contents through Search. The engine should return an AI Overview packed with bulleted information about what you've recorded.</p>

Would the OnePlus Watch 3 launch with Wear OS 5, or an older version like some TicWatches? And how quickly would the two promised version updates arrive on the OnePlus Watch 2?</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Wear OS Weekly</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o8KRGSTt4mbFxn3wdtWvtU" name="lloyd-wear-os-weekly.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot Lloyd wearing a Galaxy Watch and Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8KRGSTt4mbFxn3wdtWvtU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/wear-os-weekly">weekly column</a> focuses on the state of Wear OS, from new developments and updates to the latest apps and features we want to highlight.</p></div></div>
<p>Thanks to the OnePlus Watch 3 and clarification from the OnePlus PR team, we have our answers. And I think it's set a precedent for what to expect from any Wear OS watch that doesn't have "Galaxy" or "Pixel" in the name.</p><p>My colleague Nick Sutrich got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">hands-on time with the OnePlus Watch 3</a> this past week, and he's highly positive about it so far. It's a major hardware <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">upgrade over the OnePlus Watch 2</a> thanks to the active crown, fixed health tracking, eye-friendly display, smarter coprocessor, and larger battery capacity.</p><p>OnePlus promises a five-day battery life, and Nick's Watch 3 has surpassed this estimate so far. Some credit must go to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon battery</a>, but we can also consider its switch to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>: Google added some battery-saving background changes last year that'll pay off in subtle ways for OnePlus Watch 3 buyers.</p><p>We're still diving into the OnePlus Watch 3's software to try and flesh out what's new and different. But when we asked OnePlus, their answer was very illuminating:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Gmail supporting email sync, reply functionality, and folder management; Google Wallet supporting boarding passes, concert tickets, and membership cards; and Google Maps syncing and navigating more seamlessly. Google's website should also have a run-down of the upgrades between Wear OS 4 and 5 if you are interested in additional specifics.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Google app minutiae aside, that last portion is illuminating because OnePlus's rep was essentially saying to go to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/versions/5/features">"Explore Wear OS 5 features" page</a> on Android Developers. Unlike Samsung's unique version of One UI 6 Watch or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mobvoi.com/us/blog/Wear-OS-4-Upgrade-and-Enhanced-Functionality-for-TicWatch-Pro-5-Series?_id=66d6bfb9a743410012e83485&srsltid=AfmBOoprXT2-rUbgzYaxIkP0slEidkLhKrZf4KoBbjBFCRyz4Rn7gv-G">Mobvoi's specific update list for Wear OS 4</a>, OnePlus largely put its software update in Google's hands.</p><p>This isn't to say that the OnePlus Watch 3 software is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> clone. OnePlus has its UI quirks, video watch faces, and health features specific to the OHealth app, such as the 60-second health checkup tool.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BJeicXMMd2fC3PVqGZ59rg" name="oneplus-watch-3-phone-video-control" alt="The Short Video Control function on the OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BJeicXMMd2fC3PVqGZ59rg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I did note one unique feature: You can prop up your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and then swipe through TikTok or YouTube Shorts videos using your watch display. I have no idea how many people would want to navigate their feeds with their phones propped up, but at least OnePlus tried something new!</p><p>But by and large, OnePlus is offering a "stock" Wear OS experience, and some of its "new" Wear OS 5 features are things that were missing from its version of Wear OS 4, like emergency SOS, camera controls, and the ability to transfer your watch to a new phone.</p><p>I'm perfectly fine with OnePlus focusing on hardware and health upgrades with the Watch 3. It seems to have paid off, and compared to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> that work best within their ecosystem, I think you can wear this with just about any Android phone brand without missing any features because of the "stock" Wear OS approach.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G8Kf9rkCF3cCrn95J9FVHL" name="oneplus-watch-3-60-second-health-check" alt="Using the new 60-second health check-in feature on a OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G8Kf9rkCF3cCrn95J9FVHL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now for the downsides: OnePlus says the Watch 3 will receive two OS updates — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> — and two years of bi-monthly security updates through early 2027. OnePlus committed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-how-many-updates">three years of security updates</a> for the Watch 2, so we're not sure why OnePlus has apparently decided to cut back one year of support.</p><p>As for the OnePlus Watch 2, the OnePlus rep said that "Watch 2 users are expected to receive their OS 5 updates in Q3 of this year." That July–September stretch is when we'd expect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> to launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, meaning OnePlus will be a year behind them.</p><p>Up until this point, Wear OS brands like Xiaomi and Mobvoi have fallen a year behind Google and Samsung, only launching Wear OS 4 around Q3 2024. OnePlus obviously has a leg up by launching Wear OS 5 only half a year behind Samsung, but I'm not sure why the OnePlus Watch 2 — which has the same Snapdragon processor — would need another half a year or so.</p><p>At this point, I can only assume the year-long update gap between the Wear OS co-creators and third-party partners will never close. Samsung and Google had some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/long-wear-os-5-update-delay-feels-like-bad-sign">trouble updating their watches to Wear OS 5</a>, but nothing like what their partners have experienced.</p><p>General Wear OS trends aside, I'm not sure why the OnePlus Watch 3 will (presumably) stop receiving security updates well before it gets Wear OS 7 in late 2027. That seems a bit odd, and I'd like to think OnePlus will still provide <em>some</em> sporadic security support afterward, not just drop major changes and then ignore the Watch 3 entirely.</p><p>As it is, with Samsung and Google promising four and three years of support, respectively, OnePlus's two-year promise feels like the one potential blemish to an otherwise exciting OnePlus Watch 3 launch.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-137">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Hidden code in the latest Google TV Streamer update suggests built-in support for backlit remotes might be on the way.</li><li>Code reveals options for "Never," "Standard" (lights up for 5 seconds), and "Scheduled" (only from 6 PM to 6 AM).</li><li>It is being speculated that Google could be working on a premium remote that will support this feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The new Google TV Streamer update has some hidden code that points to built-in support for backlit remotes in the works, hinting at possible new hardware additions to the Google TV lineup.</p><p>While most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> devices stick with basic, non-backlit remotes, there are a few exceptions. A few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-4k-tvs-chromecast">high-end TVs</a> with built-in Google TV and some models, like the Walmart Onn Pro, already come with backlit remotes. Still, getting them to work smoothly on Google TV usually means relying on custom tweaks from the manufacturers.</p><p>On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a> doesn’t come with a backlit remote, but it looks like Google might be tuning in to what users have been asking for.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aftvnews.com/google-tv-is-gaining-native-remote-backlight-controls-could-a-new-premium-remote-be-coming/" target="_blank">AFTVNews</a>, the recent Google TV Streamer update includes code mentioning backlight support for compatible remotes (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-tv-settings-for-backlit-remotes/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). The feature is tucked away in the Settings app code and isn’t accessible just yet.</p><p>Most Google TV devices come with basic, non-backlit remotes. It might seem like a small thing, but throw in some backlighting, and suddenly your late-night binge sessions get a whole lot easier.</p><p>The latest update reveals code for three backlight modes: "Never" (always off), "Standard" (lights up for five seconds after a button press), and "Scheduled" (same as Standard but only between 6 PM and 6 AM).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:580px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.10%;"><img id="Ett3gyUKUATJzBrTxVvfpg" name="Google-TV-backlit-remote-support" alt="strings of code in a Google TV Streamer update hinting at support for backlit remotes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ett3gyUKUATJzBrTxVvfpg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="580" height="337" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AFTVNews)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, finding this feature in the code doesn’t mean it’s definitely coming. Plenty of times, stuff like this gets spotted but never actually makes it to users, or it takes forever to show up.</p><p>At present, backlit remotes on Google TV and Android TV depend on third-party manufacturers. The potential native support for this feature could make things easier for manufacturers and boost the availability of backlit remotes.</p><p>While these code changes hint at wider support for backlit remotes, it’s unclear if the Google TV Streamer will get in on the action. AFTVNews is tossing around the idea that Google might be working on a shiny new premium remote, which could be something to keep an eye on.</p>

Yes, there's a new Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and other improvements, but Galaxy AI tricks and One UI 7's visual overhaul are just as crucial. To get the most out of your new Galaxy S25, you'll absolutely want to do these six things first.</p><p>Aside from the latest Galaxy AI tools, Samsung also made changes to One UI 7 that you'll want to customize to make your own. Whether you're a longtime Samsung user or you're new to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Galaxy phones</a>, this list highlights everything you need to try with your Galaxy S25 — and it covers the Galaxy S25, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p>

<h2 id="1-change-your-lock-screen-notification-preferences-2">1. Change your lock screen notification preferences</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GKP2f3qt6z2YRUiDrhbPL7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-lock-screen" alt="View of the lock screen on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GKP2f3qt6z2YRUiDrhbPL7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The very first thing you should do after setting up your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> is check your lock screen notification settings. Samsung made a questionable change with One UI 7 on the Galaxy S25, making the default setting for lock screen notifications "Icons" rather than "Cards." Essentially, this means your phone will buzz and buzz by default while not showing notifications — with only minuscule status bar icons appearing.</p><p>To save you from pulling your hair out trying to figure out what's wrong, open up the <strong>Settings app</strong> and head over to the <strong>Notifications </strong>page. Tap <strong>Lock screen notifications</strong>, and pick either <strong>Dot</strong>, <strong>Icons</strong>, or <strong>Cards</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.00%;"><img id="YRQA2VyJuvfoJv2ojNs2Kg" name="how-to-change-lock-screen-notifications-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="How to change lock screen notifications on Galaxy S25 and One UI 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRQA2VyJuvfoJv2ojNs2Kg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2000" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Any option is fine, but pay attention to the graphics that show how each setting will change how your notifications appear. Making this choice early can save a lot of headaches down the road. Pretty much every Samsung Galaxy S25 reviewer became initially confused by this perplexing tweak, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-one-change-almost-ruined-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-for-me">as we unpacked in-depth here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="2-curate-your-now-brief-settings-2">2. Curate your Now Brief settings</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-3" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone"><strong>Now Bar</strong></a> and <strong>Now Brief</strong> with the Galaxy S25, and they dynamically change to show you the information you need throughout the day. By default, the Now Brief can be pretty sparse, only showing the weather and perhaps a news story or two. To make the Now Brief more unique to you, navigate to <strong>Galaxy AI</strong> > <strong>Now Brief </strong>in the Settings app.</p><p>The first option you'll see is a toggle called <strong>Expand Now Brief without unlocking</strong>, which makes the Now Brief accessible by tapping the Now Bar on your lock screen. However, some of the more helpful tweaks are under the <strong>Content to include</strong> tab. You can toggle each of the following Now Brief content types either on or off based on your preferences:</p>
<ul><li>Health and Wellness</li><li>Travel</li><li>Events and tasks</li><li>Routines</li><li>Digital Wellbeing</li><li>Communication</li><li>Moments</li><li>Gallery stories</li><li>Traffic updates</li><li>News</li><li>Smart home</li><li>Music and podcasts</li><li>YouTube Shorts</li></ul>
<p>This will help ensure the Now Brief is showing the things you want — and avoiding the things you don't. Like with any of these Galaxy AI features, personalization is key.</p>
<h2 id="3-create-gifs-with-ai-select-2">3. Create GIFs with AI Select</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="esQjsLPHXvRfKmB5amLHxX" name="ai-select-icons-sidebar-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="AI Select in sidebar on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/esQjsLPHXvRfKmB5amLHxX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>GIFs are great for sharing on social media, but they're often hard to make without dedicated third-party tools. It's easy to make anything into a GIF with the Samsung Galaxy S25 using a feature called <strong>AI Select</strong>. Once you have something on your screen you want to use to make a GIF, swipe from the right of the screen to open the <strong>Edge panel</strong>. From there, tap <strong>AI Select</strong> at the top of the list.</p><p>Then, select something on your screen, and tap <strong>Create GIF</strong>. When you're ready, tap <strong>Record</strong>, and everything you do on your selected portion of your screen will become a GIF. You'll have 30 seconds to record, or you can press the <strong>Stop</strong> button to end things early.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6SwRSs8SWxdmiYm4oRDmkb" name="AI-Select-Create-GIF" alt="Creating a GIF with AI Select on the Samsung Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6SwRSs8SWxdmiYm4oRDmkb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you're finished, make sure you tap either the <strong>Copy</strong>, <strong>Share</strong>, or <strong>Download</strong> icons — GIFs aren't saved automatically. This is one of the more underrated features on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series. It's simple, but it makes turning a video into a GIF surprisingly easy.</p>
<h2 id="4-use-multimodal-ai-to-generate-images-with-drawing-assist-2">4. Use multimodal AI to generate images with Drawing Assist</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HbvT9jcNdUQrvCx76rhbaj" name="sketch-to-image-results-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Sketch to Image results on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HbvT9jcNdUQrvCx76rhbaj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar to AI Select, there's an AI Drawing Assist feature you'll want to use after getting started with your Galaxy S25. If you've used Sketch to Image, AI Drawing Assist will feel quite familiar. It's basically Sketch to Image but with multimodal input support. That means you can remix a photo with a drawing or text or generate an AI image from a note and text instructions.</p><p>The way it works is simple. You can access AI Drawing Assist from anywhere by swiping the <strong>Edge panel</strong> open, and tapping the third option in the list. After you select something, tap <strong>Drawing Assist</strong> and either draw or enter a text prompt of what you want to change. Then, tap <strong>Generate</strong> and watch Galaxy AI work its magic.</p>

<p>Aside from the system-wide version of AI Drawing Assist, there are versions build specifically for the Samsung Gallery and Notes apps. The good news is that whenever you want to create a generative AI image, you can call up AI Drawing Assist without leaving the app you're currently using.

<p>Google is rolling out a supercharged version of Gemini, and it debuted on the Galaxy S25. It can now take actions on your behalf, coordinating between multiple apps with multiple steps. Try asking Gemini something like "Find me a movie theater nearby and text the address to mom." Then, the revamped version of Gemini can use Google Maps and Google Messages to take those actions off your hands, which is something it couldn't do before.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> is also better at understanding what's on your screen and its context. For example, if you trigger Gemini while watching a YouTube video, you can use the <strong>Ask about screen</strong> button to have it respond to your prompt in the right context. If it's been a while since you gave Gemini a proper look, your new Galaxy S25 is a good reason to try it again.</p>

<p>We've long seen Google's Magic Eraser remove unwanted objects from photos, and Samsung may have took <em>slight</em> inspiration from that when it made the Object Eraser. Well, with the Galaxy S25, Samsung took a bit <em>more</em> inspiration from Google's Audio Magic Eraser. The Samsung Galaxy S25 offers a feature called Audio Eraser that can remove unwanted background noise from videos — and it'll even let you pick which sounds to erase.</p><p>In the Samsung Gallery app, you'll have the option of removing sounds like <strong>Voices</strong>, <strong>Noise</strong>, and <strong>Music</strong>. With a slider, you can adjust how aggressively Audio Eraser should mute these sounds. It's possible to compare the edited version to the original until you're pleased with the results. This could come in handy, especially in loud and crowded environments. If you want to play around with the feature on your new flagship, we have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">complete guide to Audio Eraser here</a>.</p>

<p>It turns out that plenty of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features Samsung added to the Galaxy S25 series are pretty neat. Throughout my time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">reviewing the base Galaxy S25</a>, my favorite feature happened to be AI Select — creating GIFs has always been too difficult, and this phone makes it painless.</p><p>After you've tried out everything on this list — which applies to all Galaxy S25 models — there are a few more things you should check out if you have a Galaxy S25 Plus or Galaxy S25 Ultra. For starters, both of those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-uwb">higher-end models support ultra-wideband (UWB)</a> for precision finding of item trackers, and use the ProScaler for QHD+.

<p>Okay, the headline might be a little harsh, but I feel like the Play Store has evolved (or devolved) into one of those massive indoor flea markets with every square inch packed to the point that it's spilled out into the parking lot with people setting up tables.</p><p>To continue this random but apt analogy, you'll head over and see the same stores that have been there for years. You'll also see a few newcomers who are trying to fit in while offering a bunch of goodies for cheap. Then, there are those who don't fully understand the concept of a "flea market" and are there for all of the wrong reasons.</p><p>This is pretty much how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Play Store</a> shakes out, with many of the usual suspects holding ground in the "Top Charts." Occasionally, a new app or game will slowly (or quickly) arrive with a lot of excitement before nestling in with the rest and bumping others out. Then, we have the nefarious apps. The ones that have a nice coat of paint, but are only there to either drain your Play Store balance or worse.</p><p>Thankfully, there are a few trusted Play Store alternatives that I've been enjoying to help make finding apps exciting again.</p>

<p>My first problem comes with actually finding apps. As of early February 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://42matters.com/google-play-statistics-and-trends">42matters claims</a> there are almost 2.1 million apps on the Play Store. Apparently, more than 1,100 new apps are published every day, with an average of almost 42,000 apps arriving every month. This brings me to my first issue with the Play Store — search.</p><p>How is it that a search engine can be so bad at search? Sure, it works fine if you know the name of the app that you're looking for. But try to search for "KWGT" or "icon packs." You'll get plenty of results, but there's no rhyme or reason for how the options are displayed. And it's not like you can just sort by "recently updated" or by the highest rating.</p><p>Of course, this problem really only surfaces when searching for more broad terms, but it's still something that drives me crazy. It also drives me crazy that, with some app listings, it's practically impossible to see the last time that it was updated.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EWhvh7FUSaHBrtsrkQQgF5" name="play-pass-halls-of-torment-pokemon-silver-s25-ultra-odin-2-pocket-dmg" alt="Play Pass on the S25 Ultra with Halls of Torment on the Odin 2 and Pokemon Silver on the Pocket DMG" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EWhvh7FUSaHBrtsrkQQgF5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of which, I can't tell you how many times I've gone to open and use an app, only to have to wait for it to be updated, despite the fact that it <em>should have been</em> updated overnight while my phone was charging and while I was asleep. No, it's not some game-breaking problem, but if I check the box for an app or my phone to do something, I expect it to be done.</p><p>Oh, and don't even get me started on games. One of the biggest reasons why I'm still subscribed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-games-google-play-pass">Play Pass</a> is that it surfaces games that aren't just looking for ways to extract as much patience and money from me as possible. Which is exactly what most of the "Top Charts" consist of anymore. It's not entirely Google's fault, but both Apple and Google are a bit to blame here.</p>

<p>Wouldn't ya know, for the 2.1 million apps on the Play Store, there's a whole world of apps that are available. Many of which are FOSS or "free and open source software," and are just a few taps away.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://f-droid.org/en/">F-Droid</a> is probably something you've heard of before, as it's essentially the Play Store for FOSS apps. The only "catch" is that you first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-sideloading">need to sideload</a> the F-Droid app or one of the clients like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Store">Neo Store</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/Droid-ify/client/releases">Droid-ify</a>. And honestly, you'll probably want to try out Neo Store or Droid-ify because the F-Droid app itself looks rather archaic.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ytsrCpM3kzEtQkJPEhX4E5" name="scrcpy-android-droid-ify-s25-ultra" alt="Scrcpy for Android app listing in Droid-ify on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ytsrCpM3kzEtQkJPEhX4E5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is where my anti-Play Store journey began, as there really are a lot of fantastic open-source apps that don't get the recognition they deserve. Yes, there's a lot more digging and nuance involved, but in the end, it's well worth it.</p><p>But what if you're like me and have a curated list of open-source apps that you want to download and keep updated? Well, that's where Obtainium comes in.</p>
<h2 id="obtainium-to-the-rescue-2">Obtainium to the rescue</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MsJEAsPt5eYktJVJPjLXE5" name="obtainium-s25-ultra-odin-2-pocket-dmg" alt="Obtainium website on the Odin 2 with the app on the S25 Ultra and Pocket DMG" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MsJEAsPt5eYktJVJPjLXE5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I first learned about Obtainium early last year, as I was expanding my knowledge of retro gaming on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handhelds</a>. See, there are a decent number of recommended and reliable emulators on the Play Store, but there are even more that aren't. At the time, this was before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">Nintendo wrecked Switch emulation</a>, so Obtainium made it easy to keep Yuzu and its forks updated.</p><p>With Obtainium, you're able to bypass F-Droid or the Play Store and get apps and updates directly from the source. However, there are "over a dozen source websites, including GitHub, GitLab, and F-Droid."</p><p>The process of adding apps can still be tedious, especially if the majority of them come from GitHub and you end up bumping up against the rate limit. That can be solved by signing up for a GitHub and/or GitLab account and generating a Personal Access Token that is added to Obtainium.</p><p>However, there's also a solution to being able to keep the list of apps across devices, without needing to manually add them every time. Obtainium lets you export the list of apps that you've curated, complete with any specific information that you've added such as the name or category. So as long as you keep the exported JSON file backed up, you can just download Obtainium and import the list when you get a new Android device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="X5MLwehvqGcnp2ZecisgC5" name="obtainium-updates-notification-odin-2" alt="Update notification from Obtainium on the Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X5MLwehvqGcnp2ZecisgC5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fun doesn't stop there, however, as you can also add things and set them to "Track-Only." With this, you'll be notified when there's a new release, but it's not actually an app that can be downloaded. I use this to keep track of when new drivers are released, along with tracking multiple forks of the same app.</p><p>Because I've been getting more and more open-source apps, and not just the ones on Android, I've also started using GitHub more and more. So, when I learned that I could create a repo and upload my exported list of apps, I got pretty excited.</p><p>This way, I don't have to try to remember what cloud storage service I uploaded it to while keeping my "open source world" tied together quite nicely. Plus, there are a bunch of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/">crowdsourced app configurations</a>" that can be added with just a couple of taps.</p><p>Look, I know that this isn't a path that many will venture down, and it's okay if you don't really have issues with the Play Store. But if you're like me and want something better, and that gives you more control, definitely check out Obtainium.</p>

<ul><li>Google’s Teams-to-Chat migration tool is now fully live for everyone.</li><li>Workspace admins can move entire Teams chat histories to Google Chat.</li><li>Migration requires linking a Microsoft account and uploading CSV files for channels and user mapping.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently introduced a new tool that makes switching from Microsoft Teams to Google Chat a breeze, and it’s now open to everyone.</p><p>After rolling out in open beta last December, Google’s Microsoft Teams to Google Chat migration tool is now fully live. A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/02/release-notes-02-14-2025.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> confirms that Workspace admins can now move entire Teams chat histories over to Google Chat (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/google-chat-wants-to-help-you-dump-microsoft-teams-for-good" target="_blank">TechRadar</a>).</p><p>First, link up your Microsoft account to start the migration process. You’ll need to upload a CSV file with the list of Teams channels you want to move over. If you’ve got specific email addresses in Teams that need to match up with Google Chat, you can toss in a second CSV file to map those out.</p><p>Keep in mind that the migration only works if the users already have accounts in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> and have Google Chat enabled. Once that’s sorted, pick the starting date for the messages you want to bring over. Hit go, and the tool will start moving your data.</p><p>When it’s done, all your migrated spaces, messages, and chat history will be live and ready for the right users in Google Workspace.</p><p>After the migration wraps up, admins can access detailed reports that highlight any hiccups like skipped content, errors, or warnings that popped up along the way.</p>

<p>Workspace admins can start moving Teams chat data over to Google Chat right away. And if you’re looking to shift other types of data from different services, Google’s got your back with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6003169" target="_blank">helpful guides</a>.</p><p>Only folks who have both Google Super Admin and Microsoft Teams Global Admin roles can pull off this migration.</p><p>If your organization is stuck using both platforms (or other tools), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-now-works-with-slack-and-microsoft-teams">Mio can help make them play nice together</a>, as per TechRadar. Google even gave Mio a thumbs-up last year, backing it as a go-to for linking Teams, Zoom, and other video calling platforms.</p>

<p>Google brought Gemini to iPhone through integration with the Google app first, and only created a dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini app</a> for iOS in November 2024. However, Gemini support within the Google app for iOS remained available. Now that the Gemini app for iOS has been available for many months, Gemini is no longer available in the Google app on iPhone.</p><p>Google announced the change in an email to Gemini users on iOS late Tuesday, Feb. 18.</p><p>"We’re making some changes to create an even better Gemini experience on iOS," the company wrote in the email. "Gemini is now available as its own app, and that’s now the best place to use Gemini.

The company says that the dedicated Gemini app for iOS supports all the same features that were once accessible in the Google app for iOS. More recently, the Gemini app for iOS has been updated to support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-android-auto-chat-summary-brief-spotted">Gemini Live</a> in more languages for conversational chatting, and its latest update is <strong>version 1.2025.0570102</strong>.</p><p>The Gemini app for iOS also brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-update-brings-2-0-flash-experimental-model-and-google-home-photos-extensions-to-ios-app">additional support for Gemini extensions</a> for apps like Google Maps and YouTube.</p>

<p>If you try to use the Gemini panel in the Google app on iOS now, it will show a screen that reads: "Gemini has its own app. Download the Gemini app for iPhone." Presumably, the Gemini panel will soon be removed from the Google app for iOS altogether.</p>

<ul><li>Your Pixel Watch will now require an extra step to trigger an Emergency SOS call following an update.</li><li>After pressing the Pixel Watch crown five times, you'll need to hold the screen for three seconds to complete a call.</li><li>This tweak is designed to avoid accidental triggers, and can be modified in your Pixel Watch settings manually.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Emergency SOS is a life-saving feature on wearables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Google Pixel Watch</a>, but it runs the risk of diverting resources from real emergencies due to accidental triggers. As such, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-emergency-sos-confirmation-update-explained">Google announced last month</a> that it would be adding an extra step to the Emergency SOS process in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/320517148/emergency-sos-with-touch-and-hold-confirmation-on-pixel-watch" target="_blank">community post</a>. Now, this change appears to be widely available on Pixel Watch following an update.</p><p>An updated version of the Personal Safety app for Wear OS, carrying version number <strong>2025.01.23.721858245.2-release-wear</strong>, brings the change to all Pixel Watch models in supported regions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/18/pixel-watch-emergency-sos-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.safetyhub&pli=1" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> listing for the app has also been updated to reflect this tweak, and notes that the Personal Safety app for Android phones also has the extra step for Emergency SOS.</p><p>By default, pressing the Pixel Watch crown five times consecutively or more will call up the Emergency SOS screen — but you'll now need to touch and hold the Pixel Watch screen for three seconds to start a call with emergency services. If you don't complete the "press and hold" requirement within 20 seconds, the Emergency SOS screen will be closed automatically to avoid accidentally triggering a call.</p>

<p>The change is designed to make it "less likely to accidentally trigger an Emergency SOS call during activities like exercise, while ensuring fast and easy access to initiate a call when you need it the most," the company explained in the original community post.</p><p>Google is also making it optional to manually set your Pixel Watch to call emergency services after a five-second countdown, eliminating the "touch and hold" requirement. Users can change this by opening up the settings on their Pixel Watch,  and navigating to <strong>Safety and emergency</strong> > <strong>Emergency SOS</strong>. From there, tap<strong> Ways to start SOS</strong> and choose<strong> Automatically call</strong>.</p><p>Per usual, the feature requires location sharing and a network connection, and is limited to supported countries and regions.

The company says this was the result of an editing mistake and wasn't intentional. You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-says-there-was-no-intent-to-mislead-in-phone-3a-camera-comparison">read more about the situation here</a>.</p><p>The original, unedited story is below.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-157">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Nothing will offer a 50MP periscope telephoto lens on the Phone 3a series, in a first for the company.</li><li>The Nothing Phone 3a will offer four cameras total, with three being 50MP sensors.</li><li>The main and front-facing cameras support 4K video recording.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>In typical Nothing fashion, the company is teasing its way toward the official launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-camera-button-official-teaser">Nothing Phone 3a series</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">which will happen Tuesday, March 4</a>. Ahead of that unveiling, Nothing gave fans a preview of the Nothing Phone 3a camera system in a YouTube video comparing it to the latest iPhone 16 camera system. Notably, it includes a few major upgrades over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a lineup</a>.</p><p>Nothing says that the Phone 3a series will have a 50MP main camera sensor, which is designed to capture more light and more detail than its predecessor. That's one of three camera sensors on the Phone 3a with a 50MP size. You'll also get a 50MP front-facing camera and a 50MP rear periscope telephoto lens.</p><p>That last bit is important, because we don't often see high-quality telephoto cameras on midrange phones. The 50MP periscope telephoto lens on the Nothing Phone 3a is said to offer 3x optical zoom, plus 6x "in-sensor zoom" — which likely uses sensor crop to provide optical-quality detail via digital zoom. It's also aiming to deliver "60x ultra zoom" on the Phone 3a.</p>

<p>The final rear camera on the Nothing Phone 3a is an 8MP ultrawide camera. As such, the Phone 3a's camera arsenal will include a 50MP main sensor, a 50MP telephoto lens, and an 8MP ultrawide camera on the rear. Then, there will be a 50MP front-facing camera to round out the offerings. On paper, it seems to be a standout camera system for a midrange device.</p><p>Nothing adds that all four cameras support Ultra HDR for photos, with the main and front-facing cameras adding 4K recording with stabilization. There's also what Nothing calls the "TrueLens Engine 3.0," which "harnesses elite hardware to produce professional-grade, true-to-life photography through a combination of AI tone mapping and scene detection" and "understands every image and tunes it to strike a classic photographic balance with next-generation computational technology."</p><p>This isn't the first time Nothing has teased out Phone 3a details. It previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-qualcomm-soc-teaser-ceo-announcement">teased a return to a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip</a> for the lineup. For more, we'll have to wait until the official Phone 3a reveal on March 4.</p>

<p>Google is reportedly preparing an update to Gemini that brings a little more convenience to its conversational uses.</p><p>The upcoming changes were spotted by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-live-conversation-summaries-apk-3526918/">Android Authority</a>), who states Gemini Live could receive a chat "summarization" feature. In an APK dive of the Google app v16.6.23, the tipster states Google has added Gemini Live support for "automatic" chat summaries. These summaries will allegedly follow that same bite-sized trend of how Gemini Live delivers information to regular queries.</p><p>The post states Google's support for auto-summaries will "direct" Gemini Live to display content in a "brief, paragraph-style." The summaries will be broken down into titled, bullet point sections with short, one sentence explainers for users.</p><p>This is all contained in an overall section, which Gemini Live will supposedly give a title and brief overview about before delivering specific details. From the example, it seems Gemini Live will even resurface what it asked you (things about your interest or for extra context).</p><p>The APK dive didn't expand on whether Gemini Live's recent file support will be included in its automatic chat summaries.</p><p>The tipster also presumes Google could provide this automatic summarization feature at the end of Gemini Live chats.</p>

<p>Meta Connect 2025 begins on September 17, 2025. The 5th annual Meta conference will focus on Meta Quest headsets, AI glasses, and other AI developments. But you won't have to wait until the fall to learn more about Meta AI.</p><p>In the same Tuesday reveal, Meta announced LlamaCon, a developer conference focused on their open-source AI, Llama. It takes place on April 29, and Meta says it will share "the latest on our open source AI developments" to help devs "build amazing apps and products, whether as a start-up or at scale."</p><p>On Threads, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared this news, listing both dates and saying, "LlamaCon is a new event for developers building with Llama. See you there!" with a short video of an actual Llama wearing some kind of AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>.</p>

<p>We know from recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">Meta earnings</a> that the latest Llama 4 version should arrive soon, and that the company intends to spend a massive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-plans-to-spend-billions-on-ai-2025">$65 billion on AI in 2025</a>. A conference dedicated to announcing the new version and jumpstarting dev engagement with their Llama platform makes sense for Meta.</p><p>Meta has said the new Llama 4 will enable "a host of new product innovation in areas like speech and reasoning" in order to make Meta AI more voice-based, and that pivot will be an important one before Meta Connect 2025, which we believe will focus primarily on AI glasses.</p>

<p>Meta revealed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Orion AR glasses</a> at Connect 2024, and we'll likely see more AR prototypes in 2025, if not a consumer-ready version.

<p>Samsung's next foldables are expected later this summer, but these new rumors purport a positive upgrade.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold7-and-Galaxy-Z-Flip7-with-significantly-more-efficient-displays-Leaker-names-key-features-and-highlights.962127.0.html">NotebookCheck</a> highlighted a post by X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PandaFlashPro/status/1890286598627234114">PandaFlash</a>, which rolled through some supposed Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7 changes (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-could-have-better-battery-life-but-not-for-the-reason-you-might-expect">TechRadar</a>). According to the tipster, both foldables will see a "longer battery life" as they "consume less power" thanks to a Samsung display change. The tipster says this "highly efficient" tech change should aid both devices in lasting longer for users scrolling or gaming.</p><p>Supposedly, a test was conducted with the Fold 7, showing that it lasted roughly 55 minutes more with this new screen tech alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>.</p><p>The tipster moved into some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">rumored Flip 7-specific specs</a>, stating Samsung has "improved its hinge durability." The clamshell could see a slightly thinner body, "all-new flexible glass," which could lead to its supposed "less visible crease" compared to the next Fold. Samsung is rumored to have improved the Flip 7's charging speed, despite it's stagnant 25W charger.</p><p>PandaFlash claims the Fold 7 will see a 200MP primary camera and a slightly thinner build, too. This is supposedly based on a "prototype" of the book-style device.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"Confirmed"Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 Displays are Highly Efficient, Consuming less Power and offering longer battery life.Galaxy Z Fold 7 Test Battery backup is increased around 55minutes, with Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1890286598627234114">February 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Samsung may prefer to stick with the same battery and charger for its foldables, but improve on that foundation, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-ultra-battery-charging-test-highlighted">kind of like its Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. The Korean OEM stuck with the same battery and 45W charging for its recent Ultra; however, a test showed the company quickened its 0% to 70% and 0% to 100% charging times over the S24 Ultra. We'll have to wait and see if the improvements given (if they happen) are enough to warrant the same old, same old.</p><p>There <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-future-galaxy-s-phones-battery-charging-rumors">is a report</a> that Samsung is interested in (finally) upgrading its Galaxy phone battery tech in the future, potentially reaching 6,000mAh to 7,000mAh capacities.</p><p>Recent Flip 7 and Fold 7 rumors state the company could give the devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-finally-give-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-the-screen-upgrades-they-need">a display upgrade</a> they've been craving — aside from the supposed "efficiency" swap. The Flip 7 could see a 6.8-inch internal display and a 4-inch cover screen. The Fold 7 could grab a bigger 8-inch main screen and a 6.5-inch cover. This is another area that Samsung has become pretty stale in so, hopefuly, this one proves true.</p><p>Tipster highlighted the Flip 7 and its cameras, claiming that consumers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-alleged-galaxy-z-flip-7-camera-specs-detailed">might not get too excited</a> about them this year.</p>
