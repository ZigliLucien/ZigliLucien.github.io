                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>YouTube started cracking down on users watching videos with ad blockers in October 2023, preventing video playback if an ad blocker is in use. </li><li>Now, the platform is also taking steps to block third-party apps from circumventing ads, and videos might not play properly while using apps that attempt to avoid ads. </li><li>As YouTube has consistently done, it is urging people to subscribe to YouTube Premium if they don't want to watch ads.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-global-efforts-clock-ad-blockers">attempt to thwart ad blockers</a> on the platform now covers third-party apps, as explained in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/269521462/enforcement-on-third-party-apps?hl=en" target="_blank">community announcement</a> on Monday, April 15. The video streaming site first started to crack down on users employing ad blockers to avoid watching ads in October 2023 in browsers. If you tried to watch a video on YouTube while using an ad blocker, playback would be paused until YouTube was whitelisted or the ad blocker was disabled. However, for months, a few apps could get around ads using YouTube&apos;s API. </p><p>That appears to be over, as YouTube says it is "strengthening our enforcement on third-party apps that violate YouTube&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>, specifically ad-blocking apps." A popular app that served as an alternative to watching YouTube ads was AdGuard, and some browsers include ad-blocking functionality as well. YouTube Vanced was another as well, before it shut down in 2022 due to legal reasons. </p><p>While YouTube&apos;s ad blocker crackdown on the web featured a pop-up that clearly instructed users to disable their ad-blocking software, the platform&apos;s approach to third-party apps with ad blockers is more subtle. Users who try to watch a YouTube video on one of these apps might notice buffering problems that prevent playback. Alternatively, the YouTube API might show "the following content is not available on this app" as an error message.</p>

<p>"We want to emphasize that our terms don&apos;t allow third-party apps to turn off ads because that prevents the creator from being rewarded for viewership," YouTube explains, "and Ads on YouTube help support creators and let billions of people around the world use the streaming service."</p><p>YouTube is once again pushing users who want an ad-free experience to subscribe to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a>. It costs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-raising-price-of-youtube-premium">$14 per month</a> and, among other things, removes all ads on the platform. YouTube Premium subscribers can watch videos uninterrupted, but a portion of their subscription fee is still shared with creators in the YouTube Partner Program.</p><p>"When we find an app that violates these terms, we will take appropriate action to protect our platform, creators, and viewers," YouTube said. </p>

<ul><li>Telegram launches a Sticker Editor — a new way to create personal stickers</li><li>The created stickers can be combined into a sticker set, which can be shared with other users.</li><li>Telegram also has plans to bring 16 new features to the platform later this month. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Telegram is introducing a new ability to the popular messaging platform that lets anyone quickly create stickers and entire sticker sets — thanks to a new editor.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://telegram.org/blog/sticker-maker">announcement blog post</a>, Telegram explains how the feature works and shows it in action. Users easily choose any photo from their device&apos;s gallery and "add text, drawings — or countless animated stickers, emojis and GIFs that exist on the platform." For instance, a simple cat photo can be turned into visual art without much user effort.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://telegram.org/file/400780400575/1/RiTI5hhBHxs.5364408.mp4/fc4535d49ea0d8c0ec" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://telegram.org/file/400780400575/1/RiTI5hhBHxs.5364408.mp4/fc4535d49ea0d8c0ec"></video></div>
<p>Users can further pick a photo, and with a single tap, they can "cut out objects and remove background." They can also manually erase parts in a photo or restore them and even add an outline to get the "classic sticker look," notes Telegram.</p><p>Users can head over to the app&apos;s keyboard, open the stickers pane, and click the "+" button, which eventually opens up the new sticker tool. Once a sticker is created, they can send it or add all similar stickers to a separate sticker set, which can be pulled up whenever required, just like emojis.</p><p>The feature works similarly to the WhatsApp photo editor, allowing users to generate stickers from their device&apos;s albums. Google Messages has a similar feature called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-photomoji-google-messages">Photomoji</a> that lets users react to messages using photos or send them as stickers.</p><p>The sticker set can be created, and Telegram will utilize the app&apos;s AI to suggest different emoji that correspond to the image, which can then be selected in a chat the next time you use a particular emoji.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://telegram.org/file/400780400593/8/DvM7H4axK64.4832881.mp4/9f58afe487f6d2f42f" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://telegram.org/file/400780400593/8/DvM7H4axK64.4832881.mp4/9f58afe487f6d2f42f"></video></div>
<p>"On Telegram, emojis act as shortcuts for stickers. When you type an emoji in a chat, Telegram automatically offers matching stickers you can send."</p><p>Telegram is one of the most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">popular messaging platforms</a> and has featured stickers for a little less than a decade now. However, this new ability to create your versions is a refreshing change to add more personality to conversations. Users can combine the existing and new ones into a single pack under themed collections.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://telegram.org/file/400780400204/3/f5g3L4wA-as.3545233.mp4/d9349564763781c847" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://telegram.org/file/400780400204/3/f5g3L4wA-as.3545233.mp4/d9349564763781c847"></video></div>
<p>Moreover, once a user creates stickers and puts them in a sticker set, they can further share them with other users through a "<em>t.me</em>" link, which lets other Telegram users add them to their accounts. The new update also adds "neat link previews for all sticker and emoji sets."</p><p>In addition to stickers, Telegram says it further has plans to announce at least 16 new features to the messaging platform later this month.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus phones will not be sold at 4,500 retail chains across six states in the southern and western parts of India.</li><li>The retailers association noted encountering 'significant obstacles' with OnePlus, including delays in processing warranties, and slender profit margins.</li><li>The sales ban will go live on May 1.</li></ul>
<p>OnePlus has always counted India as its biggest market; at one point in its ten-year journey, the manufacturer noted that a full 50% of its global sales came from the country. And that&apos;s particularly true in 2024 considering the manufacturer sells a lot of budget models under the Nord series — including the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-ce4-review">Nord CE4</a> — which sell incredibly well in India.</p><p>But OnePlus&apos;s momentum may come tumbling down in a key part of the country. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/mobile-retail-chains-to-discontinue-sale-of-oneplus-devices-from-may-1-due-to-unresolved-issues-12616181.html"><em>Money Control</em></a>, select Indian retailers in the southern and western regions are set to enforce a sales ban on OnePlus in the coming weeks, following issues with profit margins, delays with warranty processing, and needless bundling of products.</p><p>If the ban goes through, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a>, tablets, and accessories will be taken off shelves of over 4,500 retail outlets in six states: Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. These aren&apos;t small retailers either; the likes of Poorvika, Sangeetha, Big C, and Pooja will no longer carry OnePlus from May 1.</p>

<p>The South Indian Organised Retailers Association is a body that oversees issues facing major retail chains in the south, and its president, Sridhar TS, sent a letter to OnePlus India informing the company of its decision:</p><p>"Throughout the past year, we have encountered significant obstacles associated with selling OnePlus products, which remain unresolved. As esteemed partners, we had hoped for a more fruitful collaboration with OnePlus. Regrettably, the ongoing issues have left us with no alternative but to discontinue the sale of your products in our stores. ORA painfully wishes to inform our collective decision to halt the retail of OnePlus products in our establishments from 1st May, 2024."</p><p>These grievances include delays with warranty and service claims, along with slim profit margins, and bundling of accessories with products: "We have experienced instances where we are compelled to bundle products or services with OnePlus devices, limiting our flexibility and hindering our ability to cater to diverse customer needs. Consequently, this has resulted in stagnant inventory and loss of sales. Despite our persistent efforts to address these concerns with your company, little progress or resolution has been achieved. Promises made have not been fulfilled, leaving us with no recourse but to take this drastic measure."</p><p>Obviously, the move affects the company&apos;s ability to make its products available to mainstream consumers, but the impact may not be severe. While OnePlus sells its phones and accessories at offline stores these days, a sizeable majority of the company&apos;s sales are still via online channels — like its own website, and Amazon India — and those are unaffected.</p><p>There&apos;s also the fact that retailers are unable to match the enticing offers that are exclusive to online sales, and this has been a point of contention for nearly a decade. I remember retailers blocking sales of Xiaomi products back when the manufacturer was starting out in India, so this particular tactic isn&apos;t new.</p><p>OnePlus, for its part, says that it "values all the support" it has garnished from its retail partners over the last seven years, and that it is working with the retailers to address highlighted issues. </p><p>In a statement to Android Central, OnePlus said: "At present, we are working with our partners to address the areas highlighted, ensuring our continued commitment to a strong relationship going forward."</p>

<ul><li>After suing Google years ago for its alleged monopolistic practices regarding Android and the Google Play Store, Epic won in a surprise jury verdict last year.</li><li>As part of the decision, Epic has been tasked with submitting a proposed injunction to the court for consideration. In simpler terms, the court wants to know what changes Epic wants to see on the Google Play Store and Android.</li><li>The court filing comes a few weeks after Epic announced that it will bring the Epic Games Store to iOS and Android as an alternative app marketplace "later this year."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-loses-antitrust-court-battle-against-epic">Epic won an antitrust case against Google</a> last year concerning the company&apos;s practices managing the Google Play Store and Android. But even when the verdict was reached, we weren&apos;t quite sure what Epic had won. Now, we know exactly what Epic wants an open Google Play Store to look like, as the company laid out its wishes in a proposed injunction and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epics-remedy-following-google-case-jury-verdict" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>Put simply, Epic wants complete parity between the experience of downloading apps and making payments on the Google Play Store, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/epic-games-store-arriving-on-android-later-this-year">third-party app stores</a>, or via sideloading. There are a lot of specifics related to that principle outlined in the proposed injunction, which is 16 pages long. Asking the company to remove screens warning users about the consequences of downloading apps from unknown sources and eliminating deals with carriers and OEMs that elevate the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play Store&apos;s</a> standing are just a few examples. </p><p>Epic is also asking for an open in-app purchase market, where developers can link to wherever they choose for digital payments. It called out Google&apos;s User Choice Billing, which is a "sham compliance program," according to Epic. </p><p>Basically, Epic doesn&apos;t want Google to be able to offer anything that other competing app marketplaces can&apos;t. That includes exclusive apps, integration with Android APIs, and requiring use of the Google Play Store to connect with other Google products and services. Of course, Epic also wants to specifically bar Google from retaliating at developers for going around the Google Play Store. </p>
<p>However, this proposed injunction is far from being enacted. Google has a chance to respond with a filing of its own by May 2, and a May 23 hearing will see the two sides explain their position with their own economic experts. The judge&apos;s final decision will likely look different than what Epic is currently asking for. Amidst all this, Google says that it still plans to appeal the original verdict. </p><p>"Epic&apos;s filing to the US Federal Court shows again that it simply wants the benefits of Google Play without having to pay for it," a Google spokesperson told Android Central. "We&apos;ll continue to challenge the verdict, as Android is an open mobile platform that faces fierce competition from the Apple App Store, as well as app stores on Android devices, PCs and gaming consoles."</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>WhatsApp is apparently enhancing its search functionality with Meta AI, initially rolling out to English-speaking users worldwide.</li><li>Despite the AI upgrade, users can still navigate WhatsApp traditionally, ensuring continuity and ease of use for finding messages, groups, and contacts.</li><li>Meta is also extending Meta AI testing beyond WhatsApp to Instagram and Messenger users in specific regions.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta appears to be trying out Meta AI, its answer to ChatGPT that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-tests-new-generative-ai-features-across-platforms">it launched last year</a>, with more WhatsApp users globally.</p><p>Meta AI is showing up in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging app</a>&apos;s search bar for more English-speaking users worldwide after initially limiting it to certain regions, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/meta-starts-limited-testing-of-meta-ai-on-whatsapp-in-different-countries/" target="_blank">WABetaInfo</a>. This means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> is giving its search a big boost with some serious AI power.</p><p>Even though WhatsApp&apos;s search bar is getting an AI upgrade, you can still find what you need the old way, the report says. Finding messages, groups, and contacts will supposedly work just like before.</p><p>It seems like WhatsApp is testing different ways for people to access Meta AI. In India, some users can find it in the top right corner of the Chats tab, as shown below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:693px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.23%;"><img id="Nbc3WV8cbGdXME9U5nYVPc" name="Whatsapp-Meta-AI.jpg" alt="Whatsapp Meta AI integration with the search bar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nbc3WV8cbGdXME9U5nYVPc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="693" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this point, it&apos;s uncertain whether WhatsApp will keep offering Meta AI through both the search bar and the app bar icon in future releases. Presumably, this helps Meta figure out which way people like it best and how to make Meta AI the easiest to use.</p><p>The experiment seems to be active for both iOS and Android users. WABetaInfo further notes that Meta AI works independently and won&apos;t remember your past chats.</p><p>Meta is said to be putting privacy first with this experiment. The company is only collecting information if you choose to chat with the AI, and even the suggestions you see are just random; Meta is apparently not tracking your WhatsApp activity to come up with them.</p><p>Besides WhatsApp, Meta is testing Meta AI with Instagram and Messenger users in India and certain parts of Africa, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/11/whatsapp-trials-meta-ai-chatbot-in-india-more-markets/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>. According to a Meta representative, the social media giant is publicly testing various generative AI-powered experiences in a "limited capacity."</p><p>This all suggests Meta is planning to use its massive user base across different apps to make its AI offerings even better in the future. We might even see some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-ai-powered-photo-editing-tools">AI image editing features from Instagram show up in WhatsApp</a> soon.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a> formerly ranked as one of the best Android phones on the market, and two years on, it still holds up as a stellar option for most people, with Tensor processing power and some truly next-level camera software.

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="why-should-i-buy-a-refurbished-phone-2">Why should I buy a refurbished phone?</h2>
<p>There are two big reasons why you should consider buying a refurbished smartphone: <em>sustainability </em>and <em>value</em>. </p><p>Regardless of what mainstream smartphone manufacturers claim, the only truly sustainable smartphone is a refurbished (or used) one. Companies may reduce their footprint by incorporating recycled materials into their devices or by offsetting their energy use, but this is merely harm reduction, not true sustainability. Raw materials are still being mined to go into these new phones, and a large number of emissions are still being generated through the manufacturing and distribution process. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-refurbished-phones">Refurbished phones</a>, on the other hand, extend the life of existing devices and, in most cases, provide the user with a nearly indistinguishable experience. And since refurbished smartphones are considerably cheaper than new devices, it&apos;s a good chance for the budget-conscious consumer to experience some of the best Android technology without breaking the bank. </p><p>For example, the innovative Galaxy S23 Ultra hit store shelves in February 2023 with a steep $1,199.99 price tag. Fast-forward a year later and you can get the still-excellent device refurbished at a $320 discount, no trade-in required. Simply put, instead of ordering a new phone every single year, buying your next device refurbished might be a great way to help your bank account and the planet in one fell swoop.  </p>
<h2 id="is-renewed-the-same-as-refurbished-2">Is renewed the same as refurbished?</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, "renewed" and "refurbished" are marketing terms used by merchants to describe the identical process of inspecting and repairing a used device to meet like-new standards. </p><p>No matter which term the retailer uses, it&apos;s important to do your research and read reviews to make sure that the company is participating in proper refurbishment protocols. You should also double check that the refurbished phone comes with a warranty before finalizing your purchase. </p>

<p>Lynn writes:</p><p><em><strong>I&apos;m being inundated with spam email. I signed up for FairEmail in the hope it would unsubscribe me but that resulted in receiving even more spam. It&apos;s mostly dating crap with no unsubscribe at the bottom. What should I do?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Lynn, and everyone else who has written to me with the same problem. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gmail-spammers-are-winning-the-war-on-your-inbox">Spam in your inbox</a> sucks, I know it does because it happens to me, too!</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure it happens to everyone, and that makes it both a significant problem and a clue that it must be working for the spammers who love to send it out. Nobody would bother if people weren&apos;t clicking on it.</p>
<p>Clicking it is something you should never do, even though everyone does it from time to time, because the subject line tricks us into thinking it&apos;s not spam. These guys and gals are good sometimes.</p><p>Two reasons why you shouldn&apos;t click it? It&apos;s almost always someone trying to steal money. If that&apos;s not enough of a reason, clicking them will tell your mail provider to show you more like it instead of shipping it off to the spam folder.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PAdAkSQQjLHtyczY2d6w2M" name="Gmail-spam.JPG" alt="Gmail spam folder on desktop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PAdAkSQQjLHtyczY2d6w2M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is something all online email providers do — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-improves-gmail-spam-detection">filter your incoming mail to try and weed out the spam</a>. Your IT department probably does the same if you use email for work. Some third-party services will filter your mail, too, if you feel like you need even more help. If you want to use one, check the reviews and make sure it&apos;s trustworthy before you give it access to your inbox.</p><p>The best two tools to fight spam in Gmail are right in the app, though: marking a message as spam and building a filter.</p>
<p>Anytime you see spam that didn&apos;t automatically get sent to the spam folder, you should mark it as spam in Gmail (or your specific email provider). This will send the message out of your inbox and tell Google that you think it is spam. When enough users say messages from a particular sender are spam, the servers will learn to filter them out automatically.</p><p>You rarely need to look in your spam folder. Messages stored there don&apos;t count against your mail storage space, and they are automatically purged after a certain amount of time. The only time you should have to interact with the mess in the spam folder is when a message you&apos;re looking for doesn&apos;t show up; it could have accidentally been filtered out.</p>
<p>A note about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/unsubscribing-from-mailing-lists-in-gmail-for-android-just-got-a-lot-easier">unsubscribing</a> — only use this feature when it&apos;s not spam! An example would be signing up for a newsletter from an online store, then seeing the company send you email after email and making you wish you hadn&apos;t done it.</p><p>For "regular" spam, you&apos;re probably not subscribed to anything. Your mail program just gets confused when it sees a list of recipients because it <em>looks</em> like a subscription email. Since opening a spam message tells your email program you read it, I don&apos;t bother most of the time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:863px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.69%;"><img id="gskauaqe8soysnRCE6T2AX" name="gmail-filter.png" alt="Gmail filter settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gskauaqe8soysnRCE6T2AX.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="863" height="541" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of filters, they are a heckuva powerful tool for fighting spam and sorting your email any way you like. They aren&apos;t difficult to create, but it can be confusing the first time you dig into it all. The best resource I&apos;ve found to explain the process <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en">comes straight from Google</a>.</p><p>What you can do is build a filter that deletes any mail from a sender or an entire domain. It will skip the inbox, it won&apos;t be marked as read, and it won&apos;t get downloaded to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a>. Be sure to build the filter so it <em>deletes</em> the message, not archives it.</p>
<p>We&apos;ll never be able to stop spam. We can use the tools at our disposal to kill as much of it as we can, though.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has been spotted rolling out a new UI change to its bottom toolbar in Meet for desktop users.</p><p>The bottom row of available options and features in Google Meet now features an up arrow beside the microphone and camera buttons. As Android Central&apos;s Nick Sutrich spotted, clicking the arrow produces a small, pill-shaped floating UI right above the toolbar.</p><p>For microphones, this menu shows which device manages your voice while the other is for audio. Users can click on each of the shown devices to open a submenu full of all available hardware that can get the job done. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-10-google-meet-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Meet</a> displays the default microphone/audio source of your desktop computer or laptop. Beneath, users will find auxiliary devices like headphones.</p><p>There is also an option to test the device if something isn&apos;t working properly. Clicking on the camera option will reveal a menu that mirrors the microphone&apos;s selection.</p><p>Google popped in a small cogwheel for additional settings when opening the floating UI action bar. Opening this brings users to Meet&apos;s general settings page. The company hasn&apos;t brought any changes to this, aside from users finding a more convenient spot to access it.</p><p>Users can still open the app&apos;s settings by clicking on the three-dot menu at the end of the toolbar near "end call."</p>

<p>Users on desktop using Google Meet should begin seeing its subtle UI changes in the bottom toolbar. Additional internal tests show that the UI is appearing on more desktops and laptops, signaling its widespread reach.</p><p>Google has been slowly updating Meet since 2024 began, with features like video effects and portrait touch-up. The former, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-combining-backgrounds-and-filters">launched in January</a>, delivered goofy backgrounds, filters, and appearance adjustments to Meet. The Workspace app also gained some AI assistance, courtesy of Duet AI, for its Studio lighting and sound on desktop.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-web-gains-portrait-touch-up">Portrait touch-up</a> rolled out in March, bringing with it two modes: subtle and smoothing. Google stated the features were designed to make users feel "comfortable and confident" when using a webcam in Meet. There were other appearance-based features like under-eye lightning and eye whitening, as well.</p>

<ul><li>A hidden feature in the Meta Quest v64 update upgrades the headset's automatic room scanning feature.</li><li>Objects in the room will be automatically identified and named, like tables, screens, and couches.</li><li>The upgrade makes mixed reality experiences better and easier to use than ever before.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Mixed reality experiences on the Meta Quest 3 are about to get a lot better thanks to an upgraded room scanning feature that can automatically identify and name objects in your room. Previously, objects like tables, couches, windows, and other objects in the room would need to be manually measured and mapped.</p><p>The update comes hidden inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-v64-update-improves-passthrough-casting-and-microphones">V64 firmware update</a> and was initially posted found by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Squashi9?t=MlAnLFoWud9VPA5Jx4b_5A&s=09">X (formerly Twitter) user Squashi</a> and posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1779243399897350223">by X user Luna</a>. Meta didn&apos;t document the feature but had posted about it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-aria-automatic-room-mapping">in late March</a>, showcasing a research project it finalized that could automatically map objects in a room. No one expected the feature to be implemented so quickly after the initial announcement.</p><p>To try it out for yourself, open settings on your Meta Quest 3, tap Physical space, then launch the setup tool found under the spaces tab.</p>

<p>Meta announced enhanced passthrough quality as part of the V64 update but hasn&apos;t officially documented the new automated room scanning feature. I tried the room scanning feature on my Quest 3 and was blown away by the results.</p><p>Not only did it perfectly identify every supported object in my living room, but the names and categories of each object made them uniquely usable in mixed reality. For instance, my dining room table can automatically be used as a desk in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/facebook-launches-virtual-office-app-horizon-workrooms-oculus-quest-2">Horizon Workrooms</a>. Additionally, sitting on a couch can automatically launch seated mode to make casual gaming or video watching easier.</p><p>This is the latest move in Meta&apos;s strategy to make playing VR and mixed reality experiences as effortless as possible. The company just launched a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-horizon-worlds-instant-replay-feature">instant replay feature</a> in its social app, Horizon Worlds, which automatically captures great gameplay moments in supported worlds, eliminating the need for manual gameplay recording.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new set of rumors suggests Google is switching up its naming behavior for the Pixel 9 series, which may change its upcoming Fold.</p><p>Information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-name-3433990/">Android Authority</a> suggests Google will move away from the "Pixel Fold 2" title in favor of calling it the "Pixel 9 Pro Fold." An alleged Google insider was attributed to this rumor, which states the supposed device has retained its "comet" codename internally.</p><p>Moreover, it seems that Google had continued to refer to its next foldable as the "Pixel Fold 2" until "a relatively recent point." There&apos;s also a possibility that this new name won&apos;t stick around for launch, so we&apos;ll have to wait and see what happens.</p><p>This apparent name change for the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Fold</a> appears to be part of a bigger branding shift for Google. The publication states the upcoming series will see the following names: Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>" alongside the newly rumored Fold name change.</p><p>While not explained, rumors add that Google software for its 2024 devices seems to double down on these sudden name changes.</p>

<p>Curiously, Google&apos;s rumored change from the "Pixel Fold 2" to the "Pixel 9 Pro Fold" could mean the device will launch later this fall with the rest of the Pixel 9 series cast. The publication noted the same, speculating the company could treat its next foldable like a proper flagship phone.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review#section-google-pixel-fold-should-you-buy-it">our Pixel Fold review</a>, the original foldable shined as a device for those big-screen lovers. However, it fell off with its battery life, graphical performance, and UI. More importantly, the Pixel Fold featured the Tensor G2 instead of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3</a> that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8</a> series offered only a few months later in 2023.</p><p>A rumor from February stated the next Fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-fold-2-tensor-ram-rumors">could feature</a> Google&apos;s Tensor G4, which could (potentially) delay its launch. This past rumor and what we&apos;re hearing now sort of line up, with speculation pushing the foldable beside the Pixel 9 series for the fall of 2024. The Tensor G4 was rumored to use Samsung&apos;s 4nm process and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-likely-to-bring-satellite-connectivity-to-pixel-9-series">a new modem</a> but would only offer "minimal" improvements over the G3.</p><p>Additionally, the upcoming Fold could deliver 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.</p><p>We&apos;ll have to wait and see what Google&apos;s true plans are later this year. The company&apos;s usual I/O event is coming up in May, so if we don&apos;t see the Fold there, these rumors might hold water.</p>
