As one example, you can get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2SFTGQ6"><strong>$80 off the 128GB Fire Max 11 tablet</strong></a> during the sale, for powerful performance at an even more approachable price than usual. The Fire Max 11 rocks around 14 hours of battery life—more than most tablets at this price point—along with a beautiful 11-inch screen. With this limited-time discount, you can get this larger storage configuration for nearly as cheap as the 64GB version, without the annoyance of lockscreen advertising.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet</a> is the company's closest thing to a premium-level option, with a vibrant, 11-inch display and 128GB of storage (or 64GB for a little less). At $80 off during Amazon's Spring Sale, this Fire tablet might be worth your time, dropping to a price almost as low as the 64GB version. Plus, get around 14 hours of battery life per charge, dual-speaker audio, and both rear- and front-facing cameras.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a tablet with a large screen; long battery life is a priority for your tablet purchase; you want a tablet that can seamlessly integrate with other Amazon and Alexa devices.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;d rather save more money on a configuration with less storage or lockscreen advertisements; you&apos;re looking for a tablet screen with a higher refresh rate than 60Hz.</p><p>The Fire Max 11 tablet landed second in our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Best Amazon Fire tablets</a>, primarily due to its huge screen and powerful performance compared to some of the company&apos;s other options.

In addition, features like Show Mode and the Home Dashboard make this tablet easy to use with other Alexa-enabled devices.</p><p>This particular deal is for the 128GB Fire Max 11, making it almost as affordable as the lower-storage 64GB version. Still, if you&apos;re looking to save around $15 more than this discount is offering, it&apos;s worth noting that both storage configurations come with expandable storage using MicroSD cards of up to 1TB.</p>

Everyone has a favorite tech brand it seems.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web&apos;s longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div>
<p>It&apos;s important to note that this is only a U.S. thing and has nothing to do with Apple&apos;s business elsewhere. Just as we saw when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/eu-finds-apple-guilty-abusing-its-dominant-market-position-spotify-antitrust-case">EU went after Apple</a> and changes were made that only affected products sold in the EU, any results in this trial only affect business done in the U.S.</p>
<p>Having said that, the complaint against Apple claims that the company:</p>
<ul><li>Degrades and undermines cross-platform messaging apps and rival smartphones, including introducing deliberate incompatibilities to prevent Android users from seamlessly sending messages to iPhone users.</li><li>Makes it difficult for U.S. app developers to list "Super Apps," which have a broad array of functions and make it easier for consumers to switch from one phone manufacturer to another </li><li>Blocks cloud gaming services on iPhones by historically refusing to list cloud gaming apps on the Apple App Store. Cloud gaming allows consumers to stream and play video games seamlessly across different devices independent of phone hardware.  </li><li>Limits basic functionality when consumers try to use third-party cross-platform smartwatches with iPhones.</li><li>Restricts digital wallet competitors by allowing only Apple Wallet access to the iPhone's "tap-to-pay" functionality.</li></ul>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wQQUCm7lcl0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Much of this list sounds like it comes straight from an angry user on the Android subreddit, and as a result, people are tripping over themselves to rush to Apple&apos;s defense. However, it&apos;s important to know a few things about the word "monopoly" in this context though, because it&apos;s not what you think.</p><p>The DOJ addresses this in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQQUCm7lcl0">a press conference</a>. The Supreme Court <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/atr/monopoly-power-and-market-power-antitrust-law#:~:text=&apos;%20%5BFN34%5D%20By%20contrast%2C,control%20prices%20or%20exclude%20competition.">defines monopoly power</a> as "the power to control prices or exclude competition." As stated in the complaint, Apple has that power in the smartphone market. The DOJ states that while having monopoly power doesn&apos;t necessarily violate antitrust laws by itself, it does "when a firm acquires or maintains a monopoly not because it has a superior product or superior business acumen, but by engaging in exclusionary conduct." </p><p>The Justice Department claims Apple has done just that, just as it claims that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/us-justice-department-google-antitrust">Google abused its monopoly power</a> in search. Therefore, the Justice Department must prosecute.</p>
<p>Forget about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ios-17-android-group-chat-workaround">green bubbles</a> and the price of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch">Apple Watch</a> for a moment. A company that can use its influence to stifle competition instead of simply providing a better product is bad for business. It&apos;s bad when Google does it. It&apos;s bad when Amazon does it. It&apos;s equally bad when Apple does it. Even a hint of illegal behavior should be investigated and, if necessary, litigated.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-me-2">What does this mean for me?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VSGsmjDpiESgUi2DdCH42B" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-review-hero-16-9.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S24 Plus on a corner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VSGsmjDpiESgUi2DdCH42B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4036" height="2270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn&apos;t about Google or Android or any other company. It&apos;s about Apple. </p><p>It almost feels like it is, though. It is important to remember the DOJ isn&apos;t doing this so that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-the-real-reason-imessage-isnt-available-android">iMessage can work on Android</a> or so iPhone users can use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch</a>. It just so happens that Android is the only competition in these spaces, so a "level playing field" in the U.S. smartphone market means Samsung, Google, and Motorola benefit.</p><p>The DOJ has the Herculean task of holding all tech companies to a set of standards, so we see Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and now Apple at odds over antitrust laws. Whether you think it does a good job at keeping a level playing field makes no difference — it has to try and enforce existing laws and help shape new ones. </p>
<p>Sometimes, that means a company you like ends up in court; sometimes, it&apos;s the company you don&apos;t like. But both times, you benefit.</p><p>If the Justice Department has its way (doubtful) Apple would be forced to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone">better integrate iMessage with accepted standards</a>, more work would be done to use third-party smartwatches on the platform, and there would be fewer obstacles when moving from iOS to Android. None of those things may happen; it is still a win for consumers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Z2MbiqEcTUtvawQryYpuX6" name="pixel-watch-2-final-review-3.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 while charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z2MbiqEcTUtvawQryYpuX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>No single company should have an insurmountable advantage in the consumer market unless it&apos;s because the products it sells are better in every way, and even then, it should not be able to leverage this to drive competition out of business. And no, your anecdotal evidence doesn&apos;t count; just because you like a thing doesn&apos;t mean everyone does.</p><p>Great artists steal. You&apos;ve heard that before, and whether you want to admit it or not, it&apos;s true. Smartphone software is the epitome of this statement — Samsung, Google, and Apple have been lifting ideas for years, and in the end, we are the beneficiaries. Do you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">enjoy using your phone</a>? If so, thank Palm and BlackBerry.</p><p>If one company is allowed to kill off competition by abusing its position in the market, we are the ones who suffer. Apple isn&apos;t going to thank BlackBerry for iMessage, and Google isn&apos;t going to thank its hardware partners for 50% of Android&apos;s features, but we would not be here without them.</p><p>Being able to kill off your business rivals is against the law for our benefit, and we should welcome seeing investigations like this, even when it&apos;s the company you like.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>WhatsApp is potentially working on generative AI image-editing features teased since September.</li><li>These AI-powered editing tools, including Backdrop, Restyle, and Expand, are expected to allow users to enhance their images conveniently.</li><li>The AI image editing tools will be accessible through the sparkle icon within the existing menu of WhatsApp's image editor.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp may be tinkering with some generative AI image-editing features, which were initially teased back in September.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/Whatsapp-Image-Editing-AI-Tools.html" target="_blank">AssembleDebug</a>, who dug into the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> beta release for Android (v2.24.7.13), these AI-powered editing tools are going to let you spice up your images. For instance, you can slap on text-to-image backdrops, tweak your pictures with some style, and even expand the background.</p><p>As per the tipster, when you&apos;re posting a status update or sending an image to someone on WhatsApp, you&apos;ll see these new options—<em>Backdrop</em>, <em>Restyle</em>, and <em>Expand</em>—right there in the image editor window.</p><p>While Meta previously confirmed that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-tests-new-generative-ai-features-across-platforms">adding AI backdrop and image restyling tools for Instagram and Facebook</a>, the company hadn&apos;t let slip anything about these features coming to WhatsApp before.</p><p>As seen in the screenshot below, these AI image editing tools are hiding under the sparkle icon, right up there in the same menu where you find other editing tricks on WhatsApp like rotating, cropping, slapping on stickers, and adding text.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:422px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:177.73%;"><img id="yjQUsN5ggxBDGbXiaGs9SQ" name="whatsapp-AI-editing-tools.jpg" alt="Whatsapp AI-powered image editors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yjQUsN5ggxBDGbXiaGs9SQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="422" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AssembleDebug / TheSpAndroid)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you might have guessed, <em>Backdrop</em> allows for switching up the background by typing in a text prompt. <em>Restyle</em> is more about jazzing up the whole image with cool effects. And if you need to go bigger, <em>Expand</em> lets you enlarge those images.</p><p>That said, using AI to stretch or extend an image&apos;s background isn&apos;t exactly new news. Adobe Photoshop has already been offering a similar feature with its own AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-photography-apps-android">image-editing tools</a>.</p><p>AssembleDebug mentioned he couldn&apos;t quite get the new features up and running yet. So, it looks like while this feature is in the works, the actual features might still be under development. So, we&apos;re still in the dark about how Restyle, Backdrop, and Expand will actually appear in the app.</p><p>WhatsApp loves rolling out new features regularly to keep its loyal users hooked and to lure in fresh faces, and these AI-powered tools may help keep things exciting and draw in new users.</p><p>Sure, there&apos;s often some concern about AI messing with our images, but the idea of easily sprucing up pictures for quicker sharing seems pretty harmless. It just means WhatsApp messages could come with nicer-looking images without us breaking a sweat.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Oops, I did it again.</p><p>After the Pixel 6 broke my heart, I ended up going back to the Pixel 8. Feeling lost? Let me recap.</p><p>There I was, enjoying my experience with my precious <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a>, and things were going great. It lived up to my expectations; it made me happy. Sadly, it was not a perfect relationship. Roughly two years of short-lived happiness ended abruptly, and we broke up.</p><p>The reason why I ended up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-experience-with-google-pixel-6-two-years-later">dumping the Pixel 6</a> was simple: it just wasn&apos;t usable every day anymore. The device would hang up on me, I had a ton of network problems, and the Bluetooth would only play nice when it was in the mood. Google didn&apos;t design the Pixel 6 for sustained heavy usage, and the phone just couldn&apos;t take it anymore.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8tXJ5t3pZfs2Yqyg5AhBJ9" name="google-pixel-6-6pro-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro and Google Pixel 6 standing upright on a white table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8tXJ5t3pZfs2Yqyg5AhBJ9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once that was done and dusted, my next primary device was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</a>. This was partly because I was curious and partly because I wanted to reaffirm my belief in the longevity of flagship phones. This experiment had a more cheerful ending, leading me to conclude that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-ultra-aged-better-than-pixel-6">Samsung&apos;s phones age far more gracefully than Pixels</a>.</p><p>Now, I have taken everyone — including myself — by surprise and have cautiously switched back to a Google Pixel — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, to be more specific. Before you grab your pitchforks and torches, calm yourself. No, I am not a "hater" of either phone, Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel, so I have no issue bouncing back and forth between either brand or even using both simultaneously.</p><p>What&apos;s ultimately the most important factor isn&apos;t brand loyalty. All I care about (and so should you) is a good quality product that&apos;s worth my while and my hard-earned money. But there&apos;s more to the story than just curiosity.</p><p>Sure, I wanted to test out the latest Pixel to see for myself whether it had improved over the Pixel 6. But I was also sorely missing a couple of Pixel-exclusive features that no other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> has.</p>
<h2 id="now-playing-on-the-pixel-lock-screen-2">Now Playing on the Pixel lock screen</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kuFvM9PmU6gVVVTVSdNKLD" name="google-pixel-8-now-playing-lock-screen-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Now playing on the Pixel lock screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kuFvM9PmU6gVVVTVSdNKLD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-now-playing-feature-google-pixel">Now Playing</a> is, in my opinion, the most underrated Pixel feature of them all. This music identification feature is seamless, automatic, and so darn good at what it&apos;s supposed to do.</p><p>You no longer have to ask, "Hey, what song is that?" because the Pixel does it for you. It records the song with a time stamp, lets you browse the list and favorite tracks, and you can even share songs right out of the Now Playing app.</p><p>Forget Shazam, Now Playing is the ultimate song tracker slash audio identification app, and it is baked into modern Pixels. I tried to use alternatives on my Samsung, but nothing came close to this. There isn&apos;t a lock screen widget that&apos;s as good as this, either.</p>
<h2 id="yelling-stop-at-my-phone-apos-s-alarm-to-turn-it-off-2">Yelling STOP at my phone&apos;s alarm to turn it off</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3172px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Wyg5pBMj8yjZYbcyhUgwKN" name="google-pixel-8-alarm-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Alarm ringing on a Google Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wyg5pBMj8yjZYbcyhUgwKN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3172" height="1784" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It had become somewhat of a weird tradition for everyone in the household to start yelling "STAHPP" at my Pixel every time the alarm would ring.</p><p>In case you weren&apos;t aware, you can simply command your Pixel&apos;s alarm to turn off verbally when it goes off. This includes simple answers like "snooze" or "stop," but because the alarm is pretty loud, you need to be a bit louder when speaking to your Pixel.</p><p>Call it an idiosyncrasy, but I missed screaming at my Pixel to turn off the alarm. It&apos;s dumb, it&apos;s chaotic, but it&apos;s also fun. The fact that it confuses people hanging around you is an added bonus. It&apos;s a great conversation starter if anything. Every phone should have this feature.</p>
<h2 id="pure-unadulterated-stock-android-with-a-pixel-twist-2">Pure, unadulterated stock Android with a Pixel twist</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hALmJJX8DMtGiHX894TjkM" name="pixel-8-29.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hALmJJX8DMtGiHX894TjkM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Android 12 Material You</a> facelift, Android on a Pixel is unmatched. The UI is mouth-wateringly delish to look at. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> has an even better look, and I absolutely love the look of my Pixel 8 running it.</p><p>Although One UI and dynamic color theming as well as themed icons, it just doesn&apos;t have the soul of a Pixel. The charm of the stock Android phone lies in the little things like the shape of the Quick Settings menu, the clock, the At a glance widget, and the fluid animations.</p><p>It&apos;s so easy to get used to the subtle software tweaks added by Google. I almost forgot that all phones don&apos;t have the ability to copy text from just about anywhere or translate text selected within an app without taking screenshots or any extra steps. Then there&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a>, all of which deliver superior results.</p><p>Once you get used to Google&apos;s spin on stock Android, it&apos;s really hard to move on from there. Despite switching over to Samsung&apos;s better-functioning phone, I still yearned for these little built-in options and abilities. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-makes-pixel-8-stand-out-among-other-android-phones">No one does cool, seamless software tweaks like Google does</a>.</p>
<h2 id="peak-android-photography-2">Peak Android photography</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="h6AQpeWJTGDxx9SacuHZMa" name="Google-Pixel-8-new-camera-ui.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Google Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h6AQpeWJTGDxx9SacuHZMa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This section is extremely subjective, but I&apos;m the expert here so bear that in mind before bullying me in the comments section. I&apos;ve tested tons and tons of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, and when it comes to picture quality and color, Google is the undisputed champ.</p><p>Between the iPhone 15, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-vs-google-pixel-8">Galaxy S24, and the Pixel 8</a>, the Pixel wins the battle when it comes to photography. Hand on my heart, the Pixel 8&apos;s camera is superior. I find the camera app to be more user-friendly, with easily findable and usable modes and just better photography overall.</p><p>I love the color tones and accuracy that the Pixel 8 delivers, with vibrant hues that are true to life. The level of detail is stunning, and the motion unblur kicks Samsung and Apple&apos;s butts. Night mode is phenomenal, too.</p><p>I&apos;m not here to persuade you that the Pixel 8 has the best cameras. Picture quality is subjective to the eye of the beholder. For me, Google has the right formula, but it might not be the same for you. However, this was a big feature that I craved when using the Samsung phone as my primary device. And it&apos;s not just my Pixel 8; my Pixel 6 could whoop the S22 Ultra with its hands tied behind its back. Photography is Google&apos;s forte, so if you ever ditch a Pixel, you&apos;ll miss the photography experience.</p>
<hr>
<p>This doesn&apos;t make up for the poor build quality and longevity of Pixels in general, nor does it negate my poor experience with the Pixel 6. However, these features are enough to make me want to give Google&apos;s Pixel ecosystem another shot. It makes me hope that the Pixel 8 doesn&apos;t walk down the Pixel 6&apos;s path, and though there&apos;s no way for me to confirm this right now, only time will tell whether newer Pixels are built to last.</p>

<ul><li>Google added support for 30 U.S. banks to the Google Wallet app in March, bringing the total number of supported banks to over 5,000.</li><li>The move follows roughly a hundred new banks that were added to Google Wallet in December and January.</li><li>Google's growing base of supported banks in Google Wallet comes as the company plans for a Google Pay shutdown in the U.S.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Wallet is getting bolstered with new features each month as it becomes Google&apos;s primary digital banking and wallet app on Android. The company previously announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-changes-june-shutdown-announced">Google Pay will officially be shut down</a> on June 4, 2024, at least in the U.S. Ahead of the forced transition, Google is making sure as many banks are supported in Google Wallet as possible. In March, that meant adding 30 new banks to the Google Wallet app in the U.S. </p><p>Google has made steady progress adding supported banks to the Google Wallet app in the U.S. It brought 42 new banking institutions on board in January, and 44 banks joined in December 2023. Now, as documented on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12059326?co=GENIE.CountryCode%3DUS&sjid=12120385823364741247-AP#zippy=%2Cother-participating-banks" target="_blank">Google support page</a> and first discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-wallet-adds-30-new-supported-banks-us-march-2024/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>, there are 30 more newcomers in the Google Wallet app. </p><p>Below is the full list of banks added to the Google Wallet app this month, including financial institutions from 14 different U.S. states. People who use these banks can now add digital bank cards to the Google Wallet app for Android. </p>
<ul><li>AtoB </li><li>Bank of Odessa (MO) </li><li>Beach Cities Commercial Bank (CA) </li><li>BFG Federal Credit Union (OH) </li><li>Chillicothe State Bank (MO) </li><li>Citizens Bank of Eldon (MO) </li><li>Coastlife Credit Union (TX) </li><li>Community Bank of Oelwein (IA) </li><li>CorePlus Federal Credit Union (CT) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants Bank (Cannon Falls, MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants National Bank (Fairmont, MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants National Bank (Luverne, MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants National Bank (MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants State Bank (Brownsdale, MN) </li><li>First Farmers & Merchants State Bank of Grand Meadow (MN) </li><li>First National Bank of Le Center (MN) </li><li>First State Bank (OH) </li><li>Fortress Bank (IA) </li><li>Lusitania Savings Bank (NJ) </li><li>One Detroit Credit Union (MI) </li><li>Pacific Postal Credit Union (CA) </li><li>Pay by Extend </li><li>Ravalli County Federal Credit Union (MT) </li><li>Sidney State Bank (MI) </li><li>Sixth Avenue Baptist Federal Credit Union (AL) </li><li>SubZero / Avaya </li><li>The Bank of Star Valley (WY) </li><li>Waterfall Bank (FL) </li><li>Windward Bank </li><li>Xformative Payment Systems (NY)</li></ul>
<p>You&apos;ll notice immediately that many of these banks are smaller, and you might not have even heard of them before. In fact, six First Farmers & Merchants branches are included in the total of 30 new banks added to Google Wallet in March. That&apos;s partly because nearly all of the major U.S. banks are already supported by Google Wallet. In total, more than 5,000 banks in the U.S. work with Google Wallet. </p><p>Still, it&apos;s important for Google to continue working with smaller, local banks to get them into the Google Wallet. Not everyone uses a major bank, so getting these niche institutions onboard is key to making the Google Wallet ubiquitous among Android users. </p><p>Beyond bank cards, Google is actively adding support for new features in the Google Wallet app. It previously announced plans to add more supported U.S. state IDs this year. More recently, Google made it possible to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-support-apple-wallet-file-format">use Apple Wallet passes in the Google Wallet app</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>If you are still a OnePlus 9 series or a OnePlus 8T user in the U.S., you may likely see a new OTA update on your device that brings the latest Android 14 version.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/t-mobile-oneplus-9-pro-9-8t-android-14-oxygenos-update-3427875/">Android Authority</a> notes that the company has started rolling out new updates to the OnePlus 9, OnePlus 9 Pro, and the OnePlus 8T in the U.S. These devices on the T-Mobile network will likely receive the OxygenOS 14 update soon, as some users already see the OTA updates.</p>
<p>Per the screenshots shared on Android Authority, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-8t-review">OnePlus 8T</a> running on T-Mobile received the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-oxygenos-14">OxygenOS 14</a> update with <strong>KB2007_14.0.0.300(EX01)</strong> version, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-review">OnePlus 9</a> received the LE2117_14.0.0.212(EX01) firmware update.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-review">OnePlus 11</a> was promised four Android versions and five security updates, and the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12">OnePlus 12</a> also followed the same update cycle as the predecessor model. </p><p>Overall, it is encouraging to see OnePlus keeping up to its promise and giving older OnePlus devices a fresh experience with the latest update rollout.</p>

<ul><li>The Google Pixel Fold is set to get a fan-favorite feature from the OnePlus Open, as it has been spotted in the Android 15 Developer Preview 2.</li><li>The feature, known as "swipe up to continue," allows users to continue using apps on the cover screen after closing the main screen. </li><li>Pixel Fold owners have three default settings for the new feature: <strong>always</strong>, <strong>swipe up to continue</strong>, and <strong>never</strong>. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google released the second Android 15 Developer Preview this week, which means that a ton of new features and changes are being discovered. The big one is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">support for satellite connectivity</a>, but there are plenty of more under-the-radar additions. Namely, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold</a> is borrowing a fan-favorite feature from the OnePlus Open, known as "swipe up to continue."</p><p>As Android expert Mishaal Rahman first explained via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-fold-swipe-up-to-continue/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>, Android 15 DP2 gives Pixel Fold owners a new default setting for how their smartphone will respond when the cover screen closes. Previously, if you closed the Pixel Fold&apos;s main screen, the cover screen would remain off unless you changed the default setting to <strong>always </strong>or <strong>only games, videos, and more</strong>. Still, there wasn&apos;t a way for Pixel Fold to selectively choose whether they wanted to continue using an app on the cover screen each time.</p><p>OnePlus had the idea of giving users the option of swiping up on the cover screen to continue using the app they just had open on the main screen. This lets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> users decide whether to continue using an app situationally rather than be locked into a default preference. Now, Google is following suit with the Android 15 Developer Preview 2. The <strong>only games, videos, and more</strong> option in the Pixel Fold settings app has been replaced with a <strong>swipe up to continue</strong> toggle. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Android 15 DP2 on the Pixel Fold has added the "swipe up to continue" screen lock feature I first reported was coming! This feature is ripped right from the OnePlus Open, and it lets you choose which apps to continue on the outer screen.https://t.co/9OUrieHgUJ<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1770912506820636774">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>That leaves Pixel Fold users with three possible default settings under the <strong>Continue using apps on fold </strong>page. <strong>Always</strong> will automatically turn on the front display when you close the Pixel Fold. <strong>Never</strong> automatically locks the Pixel Fold when you close it, every single time. </p><p>Google describes the new <strong>swipe up to continue</strong> as follows: "Fold your phone and swipe up on the front display to continue using the app, or wait a few seconds for the screen to lock."</p><p>Swipe up to continue was not present in Android 15 Developer Preview 1, and it was only added in the second release. It figures that Google will publicly release the feature to all Pixel Fold owners alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. However, it is confirmed to be working on Pixel Fold units running Android 15 DP 2. </p>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest announcement involves a major shift in the in-app content that EU folks will find for Fitbit watches by June 2024.</p><p>According to an updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14237121?hl=en">support page</a>, Google will remove access to all third-party apps and clock faces from the Fitbit app gallery. The company adds that this decision was made to comply with new "regulatory requirements" set forth by the EU. </p><p>Users have until June 2024 to download and install any third-party apps and clock faces they&apos;d like on their Fitbit smartwatch.</p><p>This decision will impact the following Fitbit devices:</p>

<p>The support update adds that after the June 2024 deadline, users will only find Fitbit and Google-made apps and clock faces when searching for new content. It&apos;s important to know that this decision will not impact users in the U.S. or other countries.</p><p>Google recently confirmed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/fitbit-third-party-app-removal-3427913/">Android Authority</a> that any third-party content you&apos;ve downloaded will remain on your device after the given date.</p><p>Unfortunately, Google hasn&apos;t stated which new regulations have forced this change for countries in the European Union. It&apos;s not clear if this is a result of the EU&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA) or another agreement the company is forced to comply with.</p><p>The good news is the company has left Fitbit&apos;s range of trackers and its own Pixel Watch and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> alone in the decision to remove third-party content. Additionally, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/22/google-fitbit-apps-faces-eu-removal/">9to5Google</a> noted, the Sense 2 and Versa 4 were already without third-party apps since launch. Those devices could only access third-party clock faces via the App Gallery, but even that is disappearing in just a few months.</p>

<ul><li>Further digging into Google's second Android 15 preview shows increased security efforts to protect devices connected via USB.</li><li>When attempting to switch USB modes, users will have to verify that it is them through various lock screen security methods.</li><li>Google detailed its second Android 15 preview yesterday (Mar. 21), offering insight into its satellite connectivity and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest Android 15 preview gives users better insight into how it will protect your files when connected via USB.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-15-change-usb-mode-authentication/">Android Police</a>), Android 15 Developer Preview 2 shows the software will require more "authentication" during USB-connected moments. To change which USB mode you&apos;re in, Rahm discovered users must verify it&apos;s truly them via lock screen measures such as their PIN, fingerprint, pattern, or password.</p><p>Such efforts will likely help give users peace of mind that nefarious actors can&apos;t connect their devices to a computer and rip all of their sensitive data. However, Rahman notes that there is a slight security flaw with this within the developer preview.</p><p>He states that if "Developer Options" is left enabled, someone could still access your phone&apos;s saved contents through "USB debugging." This would virtually "verify" them, enabling them to copy all of your content to another device.</p><p>Rahman suggests that users should leave their device&apos;s Developer Options disabled as a precaution until Google rectifies it.</p><p>In addition to transferring files, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> DP2 requires users to authenticate the USB mode switch if swapping to Webcam, MIDI, PTP, and USB tethering.</p>

<p>Google revealed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">second Android 15 preview</a> yesterday (Mar. 21), and with it came another gaze into its satellite connectivity. The company is preparing to bring satellite connectivity for text messages and calls. Regarding the former, the preview showed Google&apos;s support for SMS/MMS and RCS apps to send <em>and </em>receive messages.</p><p>Another aspect of the preview involved upgrading the NFC experience for users, making Android&apos;s tap-to-pay feature smoother and more reliable. Android 15 was also seen supporting a range of apps for a foldable&apos;s cover display, meaning developers have more flexibility for the end user.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/03/the-second-developer-preview-of-android-15.html#:~:text=target%20Android%2015-,App%20compatibility,-To%20give%20you">its timeline</a>, Google is right on time with its second developer preview for Android 15. The next major software&apos;s open beta should begin next month in April, with its final release slated for sometime after July.</p>
