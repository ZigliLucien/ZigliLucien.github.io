                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google appears to be preparing a new Pixel Tablet feature called "Look and Sign."</li><li>It's unclear what Look and Sign might do, but it could offer a way for people to interact with the device through sign language, or more basic hand gestures. </li><li>Look and Sign is likely similar to Look and Talk, which is available currently on the Nest Hub Max.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> is already a great smart home companion thanks to its included charging speaker dock. With it, the Pixel Tablet essentially works as a Nest Hub Max, answering questions with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> and managing your smart home devices. However, the Pixel Tablet might become more like the Nest Hub Max in a future update, according to an APK teardown of the Google Search app from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/16/pixel-tablet-assistant-look-and-sign/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. </p><p>The teardown reveals an upcoming feature that Google appears to be trying to hide. It&apos;s disguised as "LnS" in code references, and this stands for "Look and Sign." This feature sounds similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/how-to-set-up-look-and-talk-nest-hub-max">Look and Talk</a>, which is currently available on the Nest Hub Max, and the two might function in a comparable way. Look and Talk can detect when someone is looking at and speaking to a Nest Hub Max, taking advantage of the device&apos;s built-in camera. It can simplify things and cut "Hey Google" out of the process.</p><p>Look and Sign was discovered in version <strong>15.15 </strong>of the Google Search app, which is still in beta. In the update, 9to5Google reports that some in-app references to Look and Talk now point to Look and Sign. While the Look and Talk feature isn&apos;t available on Pixel Tablet just yet, it has been reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-could-get-nest-hub-max-features">in development since October 2023</a>, which is why it appears in the Google Search app. </p><p>Notably, Google decided to redact certain parts of pages related to Look and Sign. Even for an unreleased feature that needs to be force-enabled, this is rare to see. Take a look below: </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1616px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.83%;"><img id="Q2UsVK4UXJnYUoBmzYMX4H" name="Google-Pixel-Tablet-LNS-9to5Google.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing Look and Sign on the Pixel Tablet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q2UsVK4UXJnYUoBmzYMX4H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1616" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is clearly keeping the exact method of activating Look and Sign under wraps. It could be taken literally to mean that Pixel Tablet will be able to detect someone using sign language. This wouldn&apos;t be outlandish, but it is somewhat of a lofty goal that would take advanced machine learning to process. That processing would all have to happen on-device for privacy and speed considerations, too. Another route Google could take with Look and Sign is gesture detection, which is kind of like how a thumbs-up can trigger an on-screen effect in certain video calling apps.</p><p>Since this feature is clearly in the early stages — and the similar Look and Talk feature hasn&apos;t been publicly released for Pixel Tablet after months of internal testing — there&apos;s no way to know when Look and Sign might debut. However, we&apos;re likely going to learn a lot from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O 2024</a> event, which is slated for next month. That might give us some insight into when Look and Sign will roll out. </p>

<p>The Google Pixel Tablet serves two functions: it's a killer tablet when used freely, and it docks into a speaker hub to control your smart home. As such, it shares many features with the Nest Hub Max, and it might be getting a new one soon.</p></p>

<ul><li>Google Maps on Android has received a beta update that lets users sync their 3D building view on a phone with their Android Auto consoles.</li><li>The sync only works <em>before </em>connecting to a vehicle, meaning users can toggle it on or off and the AA console will reflect that change.</li><li>Google Maps rolled out 3D building view on Android Auto for navigational purposes by default in February.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is pushing out a beta update for Maps that brings better synchronicity between Android phones and Android Auto consoles.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/16/google-maps-android-auto-3d-buildings-setting/">9to5Google</a>, version 125 of Google Maps, which is arriving in beta, sports a change to its "Show 3D Buildings" toggle that syncs it with Android Auto. It&apos;s important to note that the setting will only sync from phone to console if it&apos;s toggled on (or off) before users establish a connection with their vehicles.</p><p>The beta shows that toggling on 3D buildings during navigation on Maps for Android will now enable the visual setting on Android Auto. This removes the necessity for users to have it on in one place and then have to dive into AA&apos;s settings to produce the same effect.</p><p>If the 3D buildings were enabled during startup, testing shows that users can toggle it off on their Android phone without disrupting their vehicle&apos;s console. Moreover, the rate at which the synchronization works between Android and Android Auto seems much more stable.</p><p>With the small change spotted in beta, it&apos;s unclear how long it will take Google to roll this out properly to all users. Users can still manually control the 3D buildings toggle manually through their Android Auto displays if they choose.</p>

<p>Google Maps rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-3d-buildings-in-google-maps-wider-rollout">3D buildings during navigation</a> for Android Auto displays in February, which should aid users when traveling to new cities. The visual aid was always present in Maps, however, it was only during simple map exploration sessions. With it available by default during navigation, users can find their way better in cities that support the visual aid.</p><p>The feature&apos;s arrival only works with light mode in Google Maps. Swapping to dark mode makes the useful models disappear. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-testing-3d-buildings-during-navigation">wasn&apos;t always like this</a>, so it&apos;s a little odd that Google removed it once it arrived two months ago in a stable fashion.</p>

<p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 is a decent enough phone with a lovely and large edge-to-edge screen, nice textured vegan leather back, and support for fast and wireless charging. But when it comes to performance, there’s still some work to do. Still, for those looking for a simple solution, the price is definitely right.</p></p>

<p>Looking for a new phone that hovers around the $300 price range? You’re looking in the budget category, and when it comes to entry-level phones, the Samsung Galaxy A25 and Moto G Power 5G 2024 are two that fall into this range. They both combine premium features with won’t-break-the-bank pricing. But which one should you choose?</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a25-vs-moto-g-power-5g-2024-the-looks-2">Samsung Galaxy A25 vs. Moto G Power 5G 2024: The looks</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KV8opTKQrpZdxZ2NcsMBxE" name="samsung galaxy a25 colors.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KV8opTKQrpZdxZ2NcsMBxE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy A25, one of many in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide#section-galaxy-a25-delivering-timely-upgrades">the A series line</a>, might be a “budget” phone, but some of its specs suggest otherwise. It has a sizeable 6.5-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED screen that offers 1,080 x 2,340 resolution and up to 1,000 nits peak brightness, along with Samsung’s Vision Booster to assist in bright sunlight. </p><p>Eye Comfort Shield helps protect your peepers from harmful blue light. The screen also boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, which you wouldn’t expect in a phone of this price, confirming that it can keep up with everything from video streaming to gaming. </p><p>Available in black, blue, light blue, and yellow (though colors may vary by country), it has a plastic back, which is to be expected given the price, along with a plastic frame and glass front. A fingerprint sensor is on the side, a departure from the typical on-screen optical sensor you see in the latest, more premium phones. You can also use face unlock. </p><p>It comes with either 128GB or 256GB storage, but you can expand this to up to 1TB via microSD card. That’s a big plus because most premium phones only come with built-in storage, and you need to rely on cloud storage after that (or be diligent about how much of a packrat you are with apps, files, photos, and more). </p><p>The 5,000mAh battery will keep the Samsung Galaxy A25 powered for up to two days per charge, and the phone supports super-fast wired charging at 25 watts with an optional adapter. However, there is no support for wireless charging. </p><p>One thing worth noting is that the Samsung A25 does not have a water-resistant rating, so you’ll need to be mindful of where you use it. You’ll not only want a protective case, but you might even want to consider a waterproof case if you plan to take this phone with you to the beach or even use it by the pool. </p><p>Other features include dual SIM, USB-C, Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth 5.3, and NFC. You don’t get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> support, though this phone likely won’t be used for heavy productivity anyway. One interesting inclusion is a 3.5mm headphone port for wired headphones and earbuds when you want to enjoy private listening. There are also stereo speakers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4042px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="kTnw7sTkoqADapsuaTTuhM" name="Moto-G-Power-5G-2024-review-1.jpg" alt="The Moto G Power 5G 2024 on rocks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kTnw7sTkoqADapsuaTTuhM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4042" height="2274" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 has an even larger 6.7-inch full HD FHD+ edge-to-edge display, but it’s just an LCD, so don’t expect it to be as bright and clear as the AMOLED or OLED screens in other phones, including the Samsung Galaxy A25. In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G Power 5G 2024 review</a>, Android Central’s Derrek Lee confirms this, saying color and contrast aren’t as good as it is with phones that have OLED screens, but the display is still sharp. </p><p>The resolution is on par with the Samsung Galaxy A25 at 2,400 x 1,080, but the peak brightness taps out at about 500 nits. Keep this in mind if you live somewhere that’s sunny or you often raise screen brightness to see better in certain situations. Lee says it can be difficult to see the screen outdoors. On the plus side, the phone offers 120Hz refresh rate. </p><p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 comes in just two finish options, Midnight Blue or Pale Lilac, and has a nice, tactile feel to it. This is thanks, in large part, to the vegan leather back that’s typically reserved for higher-end phones, so the phone looks a little more expensive than it actually is, though the leather can be easily scuffed, says Lee. </p><p>He does say, however, that the phone feels warmer and more comfortable in his hand when compared to glass or plastic, though it still has a plastic frame. Like with the Samsung Galaxy A25, this phone has a fingerprint sensor on the side, and you can glance at the camera to leverage face unlock. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 steps up its design with a more premium vegan leather back.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Storage-wise, there’s only a single 128GB variant, but the Moto G Power 5G (2024) does have a microSD card slot that can accommodate an optional card up to 1TB in size, so you can add more. </p><p>It has the same all-day 5,000mAh battery but supports faster TurboPower wired charging at 30 watts, which Motorola says will get you an extra day in just 40 minutes. You’ll need to buy that charger separately in most cases or one that supports faster charging than what’s provided in the box. It also supports 15W wireless charging, a worthwhile feature if you prefer using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">wireless chargers</a>; maybe you already have one on your desk. It’s rare to find wireless charging in a phone at this price point. </p><p>While the Moto G Power 5G 2024 is supposedly water-repellent, it does not have an official water-resistance IP rating. So, you still need to be careful when using it around water or even walking in the rain. Keep it tucked away as a precaution. </p><p>With Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, Wi-Fi, USB, stereo speakers, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, this phone is comparable to the Samsung Galaxy A25 in many ways.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a25-vs-moto-g-power-5g-2024-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy A25 vs. Moto G Power 5G 2024: Specs</h2>
<p>Before diving into the performance and cameras, let’s take a look at how these two phones compare on specs alone.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a25-vs-moto-g-power-5g-2024-performance-basics-2">Samsung Galaxy A25 vs. Moto G Power 5G 2024: Performance basics</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BmwMADwGWSC79AKf4dX2rE" name="samsung galaxy a25 selfie.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BmwMADwGWSC79AKf4dX2rE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the end, it comes down the performance. The Samsung Galaxy A25 is loaded with an Exynos 1280 processor and 6GB RAM though you can upgrade to 8GB RAM with the 256GB storage variant (this may be country dependent). </p><p>Running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, you get Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6.1</a> on top as well for further personalization of the phone’s home screen and functions. The phone also supports up to four generations of OS upgrades and five years of security updates. This isn’t as much as Samsung offers with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">newest premium phones</a>, but it’s still decent for a phone you might only want for a few years until you’re ready to upgrade. Chances are you’re getting this phone for a teen or tween who will use it for a few years before needing something higher-end. </p><p>Along with stereo speakers, you also get Dolby Atmos immersive audio, a surprising feature given that this is a budget phone. We can’t speak to how it sounds since we haven’t yet reviewed this phone. But you should experience pleasurable sound whether listening from the built-in speakers or a good pair of wireless (or wired!) headphones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xB33HoBhXQ6mUZ7BgTeXgc" name="Moto-G-Power-5G-2024-review-13.jpg" alt="The Moto G Power 5G 2024 home screen indoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xB33HoBhXQ6mUZ7BgTeXgc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By comparison, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7020 processor, and Lee says it is more than capable with regular use. This is also thanks to the 8GB RAM along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">RAM Boost</a> that can provide up to 8GB of additional virtual RAM if needed (he didn’t find that he did). This is sufficient for most everyday tasks, and you won’t experience slowdowns. However, it might not be powerful enough to handle more intense gaming sessions. Lee says the phone struggled to run some Android games. He experienced issues like dropped frames, which was a frustrating experience for gamers. </p><p>It comes with Android 14 out of the box as well, but keep in mind that Motorola doesn’t offer as much long-term support. You only get one major OS upgrade and security updates for three years, so this isn’t a phone you can hold onto for years and years to come. </p><p>The stereo speakers also offer Dolby Atmos support. A neat inclusion is Moto Secure, a place where you can manage security, control app permissions, and create a secret folder. Ideal for using this as a shared phone, or one you can hand off to your kids from time to time, there’s also something called Family Space. With this feature, you can create individual user profiles, limit screen time, and control app access to ensure a safe experience for young ones while still enjoying a full, unfiltered experience yourself.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a25-vs-moto-g-power-5g-2024-taking-pictures-2">Samsung Galaxy A25 vs. Moto G Power 5G 2024: Taking pictures</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3513px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wwoguYWbh9DY4isSBjM9LC" name="Moto-G-Power-5G-2024-review-6.jpg" alt="The Moto G Power 5G 2024 with a light behind it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wwoguYWbh9DY4isSBjM9LC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3513" height="1976" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given its low price, you get a pretty good set of cameras with the Samsung Galaxy A25. It has a 50MP main camera with optical image stabilization (OIS). There’s also VDIS for video capture, with a 500Hz motion sampling rate for better capture when capturing footage in rougher terrain, like a moving vehicle or while on a hike. </p><p>This is combined with an 8MP ultra-wide camera and 2MP Macro camera, which is likely more of a novelty than a useful camera that will yield quality photos. There’s also a 13MP front camera for taking selfies. </p><p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 has a 50MP main camera with an expanded frame, optical image stabilization (OIS), and an 8MP ultrawide lens with Macro Vision. The 16MP front camera is good enough for selfies, and the phone has an auto-enhanced Face Retouch feature. </p><p>Lee was able to get decent shots in good lighting with the main cameras on the Moto G Power 5G 2024, but don’t expect much detail in photos, especially when it comes to low-light photos. It’s nothing to write home about, but decent enough for photos and videos to share via social media. </p><p>Another cool camera feature is the ability to show your palm to the camera to start a countdown timer. It will then capture four different poses in four photos so you can choose the best one. This isn’t quite as advanced as features like Best Take in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a> series or Apple iPhone’s Live Photos. But it’s a fun to have feature, especially for kids who want to take phone booth-inspired selfies with friends.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy A25 is one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-prepaid-cell-phones">the best prepaid cell phones</a> you can buy. It’s ideal for a teen and tween, an elderly person who just needs something simple to keep in touch, or anyone who doesn’t require the best of the best when it comes to features. Indeed, we name this phone among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-students">the best phones for students</a>. It’s a reliable device that you can use for the basics, plus capture decent photos, play games, stream videos, and more. </p><p>When it comes to the Samsung Galaxy A25 and Moto G Power 5G 2024, the Samsung Galaxy A25 is the better all-around choice. They both come in at around the same price point, but with the Samsung Galaxy A25, you get the option for more built-in storage if desired (tacked onto the 1TB card you’ll likely buy as well). You’ll get better gaming performance and presumably better cameras. Plus, it’s supported with OS and security updates for much longer. </p><p>The only upsides with the Moto G Power 5G 2024 are wireless charging and the potential to withstand light rain or water droplets better with its “water-repellent” design. It also has a larger screen, but as an LCD with low peak brightness and issues viewing it outdoors in bright sunlight, size might not matter here. </p><p>The safer bet is the Samsung Galaxy A25, which you can use for several years and then trade up to something more premium. Since it’s supported for longer, you could even hand it down to your second kid or another young family member or friend who can continue using the phone until they’re ready for something more feature-rich down the line. </p><p>If you want to save even more, check out our picks for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300">the best Android phones under $300</a>, including models that are even less than these two devices.</p>

It’s a perfect phone for a young child as their first to test the waters. It’s also great for students on a budget, or to finally get your elderly parent or grandparent into the world of mobile technology.</p></p>

<ul><li>Version 1.54 of the official YouTube VR app on the Meta Quest now supports 8k (4320p) SDR video.</li><li>HDR video is still limited to 4K, but the Meta Quest 3's display resolution isn't quite 4K resolution.</li><li>Google is likely laying the groundwork for the YouTube VR app to run at 8K on higher-resolution Android XR headsets, which will come later this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been on a roll with YouTube VR updates lately, and the company&apos;s latest update on the Meta Quest platform now supports 8K SDR videos in immersive mode. As long as you&apos;re on YouTube VR app version 1.54 or higher, any non-HDR video that&apos;s been uploaded in 8K should give you the option to play it at full resolution when in immersive mode.</p><p>Below is a screenshot of a clip from The Avengers running at 8K in the YouTube VR app on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fL2kBZwfqQXiY8DHd4LHGH" name="meta-quest-3-avengers-8k-youtube.jpg" alt="Watching The Avengers in 8k in the YouTube VR app on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fL2kBZwfqQXiY8DHd4LHGH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube VR screenshot by Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To find content in 8K, you&apos;ll just need to search for "8K videos" within the YouTube VR app. When you pull up a video, tap the video settings icon in the bottom left and select 4320p from the list of available options. Keep in mind that HDR videos will still only play at a maximum resolution of 4K for now. Below is a screenshot of what the player looks like when selecting 4320p resolution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vgM2oPTpS2XhnEBdwgaWYN" name="meta-quest-3-8k-youtube.jpg" alt="Watching an 8k video in the YouTube VR app on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vgM2oPTpS2XhnEBdwgaWYN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube VR screenshot by Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Note that YouTube doesn&apos;t have a ton of 8K content just yet, but the number of 8K videos on the platform is growing.</p><p>This update comes after Google updated YouTube VR for the release of the Meta Quest 3, supporting "tablet" mode so you can watch videos while still seeing the real world around you thanks to the headset&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-v64-room-scanning-update">upgraded mixed reality cameras</a>. To switch between immersive and tablet modes, just click the icon at the top of the YouTube player that looks like two arrows pointing at each other.</p>
<h2 id="8k-videos-but-no-8k-headset-2">8K videos but no 8K headset?</h2>
<p>But this latest update begs the question: why? The Meta Quest 3&apos;s displays look great but they aren&apos;t quite 4K resolution, let alone 8K. I checked out a handful of videos for myself and saw that there&apos;s a notable quality difference between 4K and 8K when viewing them in headset.</p><p>Just as with the toggles between 720p, 1080p, and 4K, each resolution increase also comes with a bitrate increase that helps reduce compression artifacts and make videos look crisper. Still, an 8K video viewed through the Meta Quest 3&apos;s fairly limited resolution won&apos;t blow you away the way a TV of the same size and full 8K resolution would.</p><p>But I surmise that this update isn&apos;t <em>really</em> for the Meta Quest platform at all. Instead, it&apos;s rumored that Google will be showing off Android XR at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O 2024</a> — that&apos;s the company&apos;s upcoming special version of Android built for mixed reality headsets — and YouTube VR in 8K could be a centerpiece to the company&apos;s plans to launch an Apple Vision Pro competitor with Samsung later this year.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung XR headset</a> is said to be launching later this year and would utilize extremely high-resolution OLED displays that could potentially take advantage of the newfound resolution boost in YouTube VR. That, alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2</a> that&apos;s said to be powering it, could help Samsung differentiate itself from Meta&apos;s gaming-focused headsets.</p>

<hr>
<p>A dive into the latest version of Google Photos shows the company&apos;s plans to help keep our galleries clean and a new tab.</p><p>As spotted by AssembleDebug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/17/google-photos-hide-clutter-and-memories-ui-revamp/">PunikaWeb</a>, version 6.79.0.624 of Photos shows that Google is working on a "Hide clutter" option for the main gallery view. A string states the function will keep "backed-up" screenshots, GIFs, and memes hidden.</p><p>For now, the code shows that the feature will be tucked away inside the "Personalize your grid" function when tapping the three-dot menu in the Photos tab.</p><p>Additional digging shows that your hidden screenshots and GIFs are still accessible via their respective albums in Google Photos. The function&apos;s goal is to remove them (if desired) from the app&apos;s main gallery view if things become too cluttered.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:479px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.26%;"><img id="Y4ZaLMsCnjDZ8ANQ3qGeHe" name="google-photos-memories-ui-tweak.jpg" alt="Google Photos is preparing a UI tweak for its Memories tab." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y4ZaLMsCnjDZ8ANQ3qGeHe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="479" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PunikaWeb)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another discovery was made concerning the app&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-memories-view-rollout">Memories</a>" tab UI. AssembleDebug noticed that Google is looking to change how collages are shown. Rather than display them as crinkle-cut snapshots, Photos will display Memories cards with rounded corners, similar to widgets on Android.</p><p>Memories is also gaining a new setting that lets users disable the ability for Photos to generate AI titles automatically. The toggle for "Help me title" will apparently be tossed into the app&apos;s <strong>Settings > Preferences > AI features by Labs</strong>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/17/google-photos-collections-tab-clutter-filter/">9to5Google</a> conducted an APK deep dive, which surfaced the company&apos;s upcoming revamp of the "Library" tab in Photos. The redesign will swap the old Library name for "Collections" instead. Most of the tab&apos;s contents seem to remain the same. The code shows minimal work done to reduce the amount of space the top row of shortcuts takes up.</p><p>A user&apos;s available albums follow suit below as folders with previews for "People," "on this device," "Albums," and more. The publication adds that Photos will soon display how much of a folder&apos;s contents have been backed up or if the feature is disabled in the Collections tab.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when Google plans to roll out these small updates for Photos at this time.</p><p>The recently discovered clutter-reducing option for stored GIFs and the like will likely aid the app&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-photo-stacks-google-photos">Photo Stacks</a>" feature. The company rolled out the feature in January, which places visually similar photos taken around a similar time together in a single stack. Users can then hop into a stack to see which version they want to keep and discard what they don&apos;t.</p><p>A more recent find shows that Google Photos is preparing a feature to help users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-app-recover-storage-spotted">reclaim some storage</a> space for their Cloud data.</p>

<ul><li>Android 15's code offers more details on the software's upcoming "quarantine app" feature.</li><li>The code suggests that the software's service, like Play Protect, could be responsible for quarantining a malicious or "misbehaving" app to protect users.</li><li>A quarantined app can no longer offer notifications, ring the device, and many other features that have become commonplace.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Shortly after the start of Android 15&apos;s first beta, signs in its code seem to point toward a new "quarantine" feature for rogue applications.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-quarantine-apps-3434663/">Android Authority</a>), Google appears to be working on a new quarantine feature that isolates an app that could be dangerous. Rahman noted that quarantining an app in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> functions similarly to disabling an app in Settings or suspending it through Digital Wellbeing.</p><p>In testing, the safety protocol will still display the app&apos;s existence on your home screen; however, it will disable all notifications from it. Pre-existing instances (windows/activities) of the app will be "hidden" and it also loses its ability to ring your Android device.</p><p>Rahman discovered that a quarantined app cannot "receive broadcasts" from the OS or other apps on a device. Furthermore, services cannot query it, but it seems that the app&apos;s activities still can.</p><p>Google is likely working on a new "QUARANTINE_APPS" permission toggle for users to grant services like Play Protect. This could mean that Android will be responsible for confining apps away from the rest of a user&apos;s system.</p><p>It&apos;s still unclear if this app quarantine feature will drop with Android 15 or some time after. Rahman states that neither Play Protect nor the Play Store have the appropriate feature at this time. Once available and when called to action, Android 15 may alert users that it has quarantined an app "for your safety."</p>

<p>Google&apos;s Android 15 development continues as the software crossed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">first beta milestone</a> on April 11. The beta&apos;s opening allows eligible Pixel owners and more developers in on the software&apos;s testing to begin preparing apps for its official launch. The first beta included additional assistance for app creators developing products for large devices like foldables.</p><p>The company also included support for app archiving and unarchiving, while improving TalkBack&apos;s support for braille displays.</p><p>According to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/overview#timeline">development timeline</a>, Google&apos;s first beta timing arrived right on schedule. Interested testers are in for a couple more betas before Android 15 moves into "Platform Stability" toward the summer.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>From the moment my son learned his new smartwatch had the Dinosaur Game — yes, the one from Chrome that everyone loves — he was hooked. While the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch isn&apos;t designed to play games all day, there&apos;s no denying how the right feature can get you to immediately love a product from the moment you first try it.</p><p>Thankfully, the rest of the experience on the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch lived up to the initial impressions. Everything from the powerful parental monitoring app to the simple watch UI works well — although I&apos;d argue that the phone app could be slightly more intuitive — and it sits well atop the list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">best kids smartwatches</a>.</p><p>If the watch has one particular negative, it&apos;s that it <em>only</em> works on T-Mobile&apos;s network. No Wi-Fi support means you&apos;ll always need to keep a line on your plan just for the watch.</p><p>We&apos;ve seen some customer reviews mention that the watch doesn&apos;t hold up over time, but that wasn&apos;t a problem for the boys who tested it for Android Central. If you&apos;re concerned about durability, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=syncup+kids+watch+screen+protector&crid=1AABI0CNFIXBB&sprefix=syncup+%2Caps%2C236&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_2_7">Amazon sells</a> several different kinds of protectors to keep it looking new. So far, though, the preinstalled screen protector has been all we needed.</p><p>Chris Wedel originally reviewed the watch for Android Central back in 2021, so I&apos;m taking another look at it in 2024 after T-Mobile has made some notable updates and changes over the years.</p>

<p>The T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/commerce/smart-watch/t-mobile-syncup-kids-watch">sold exclusively through T-Mobile</a>. T-Mobile offers the watch for free when you add a new watch line to your account. Otherwise, the watch is $174 at full price. A watch line on T-Mobile typically costs $10 per month.</p><p>The watch only comes in one color, black, but it ships with two watch bands in the box, so you can change the colors up a bit. The included cloth band is black with teal edges, while the clasping silicone band is all black.</p><p>You&apos;ll also find a charger and pamphlets inside the box. A film screen protector is preinstalled on the watch and can help keep the display from getting scratched for a while. If you&apos;re concerned about durability, you can grab a pack of screen protectors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-SyncUp-Protector-Anti-Scratch-Sensitive/dp/B09WRCR8HP">from Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>Since our original review was published in 2021, T-Mobile has updated the watch with some very important feature updates. Chief among these is the addition of video calling and scheduled school mode, both of which were complaints in our original review.</p><p>When enabled, school mode disables games, the camera, sounds, the alarm clock, and task reminders. It can be set up on a simple schedule or manually enabled. I found this invaluable, as my son would inevitably get distracted and begin playing the aforementioned dinosaur game while he was at school, causing some obvious problems among the other students.</p><p>The watch&apos;s new video calling feature was quite good in my testing, although video availability depends on signal strength. Thankfully, the video frame rate will be slowed down to accommodate signal strength and will automatically be turned off in areas with poor signal. It works exactly as you would expect and can be activated from the watch or from the parents&apos; app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.87%;"><img id="E2h8AS65m77YVBkTLM9ETG" name="T-Mobile-SyncUP-Kids-watch-screenshots-health-calls-tracking.jpg" alt="Screenshots from the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch phone app showing step tracking, video calling, and real-time location tracking" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E2h8AS65m77YVBkTLM9ETG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2199" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Communicating with my son via video or voice calls is dead simple. Calls can be initiated from the watch or the SyncUP phone app. Audio calls and text messages use carrier voice and SMS messaging services, while video calling is handled through the SyncUP app on your phone. Kids can only call or message whoever you&apos;ve put on their contact list</p><p>While T-Mobile hasn&apos;t improved the keyboard from the watch&apos;s initial release, my son preferrs using the built-in voice messaging feature anyway. He&apos;s familiar with this type of functionality from using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids">Garmin Bounce</a>, but he can always use any of the available emojis, premade messages, or even take a picture if he needs to tell me something a different way.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Setup was dead simple, and calls and messaging couldn't be easier to use.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The watch&apos;s form factor is similar to that of many other kids&apos; watches, with its thick, square design. It&apos;s made entirely of plastic—including the display—so it will survive a fall from most heights, even straight onto concrete. The downside to a plastic display is that it scratches easily, so make sure you have a screen protector on it to keep it from getting permanently scuffed up.</p><p>Navigation is handled entirely via the touch screen, but the side button can be used at any time to navigate back to the watch face. A satisfying zipping sound emits from the onboard speaker as you navigate, making navigation feel oddly tactile, considering there&apos;s no physical rotating crown. If the speaker gets tinny from getting wet, there&apos;s a built-in water ejection function that&apos;s particularly handy since this watch is fully IP68 water and dust-resistant.</p><p>The watch ships with a comfortable cloth wrist strap that is preinstalled and uses a simple Velcro-like fastening method. My son preferred this band over the rubberized one included in the box. Our previous reviewer&apos;s son preferred the other one but any standard 20mm watch band will work with the watch, that way you&apos;re not confined to just these two bands.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Virtual boundaries and video calls made me feel safe while my son was out and about.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The charger that ships with the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch is impressively well-built and designed. It uses a USB-C plug to connect to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">favorite USB-C charger</a>, and POGO pins connect strongly to the watch itself. Unlike some other smartwatches, I never ran into a situation where the watch didn&apos;t charge when I put it on the charger.</p><p>On average, I found the watch boasted a 2-day battery life under normal use. That included a few gaming and messaging sessions throughout the day, but gaming or using the built-in real-time tracking feature will drain your battery quite quickly.</p><p>Thankfully, the watch has a built-in safety mechanism that shuts off gaming and other battery-draining features once it gets below 20%.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EcVfNUyZ926j2jyb6D23uc" name="T-Mobile-SyncUP-KIDS-Watch-pairing-with-app.jpg" alt="Syncing the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch with the app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EcVfNUyZ926j2jyb6D23uc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Within the companion app, you can look at your child&apos;s activity and see their step count for the day or view their history. You can also set up a step goal for your child to encourage them to keep going. My son enjoys this part as it helps him feel like he reached an important goal every day.</p><p>From the SyncUP KIDS app, parents can create alarms and tasks. This helps keep my son on task with homework and chores and reminds him when it is time to get ready for bed. While there isn&apos;t a points reward system like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gabb-watch-review">Gabb Watch</a> or Garmin Bounce have, you can include a reward message that&apos;s automatically sent when they complete a task.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2907px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.71%;"><img id="F4Yw49yx3XDSrfDgmcNNEG" name="T-Mobile-SyncUP-Kids-watch-screenshots-chores-permissions-school-mode.jpg" alt="Screenshots from the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch phone app showing the chores list, permissions, and school mode feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F4Yw49yx3XDSrfDgmcNNEG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2907" height="1416" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The login for the app is the same as you&apos;d have for your T-Mobile account, and you can enable biometrics if you prefer a quicker app sign-in.</p><p>The app does a good job of making the process of adding the watch easy. After adding in your child&apos;s info, you can input the contacts you approve of your child communicating with. Setting my wife up as another parental user on the watch was as easy as putting her phone number in the invite section and having her go through the sign-up process.</p>

<p>I&apos;m happy to see that the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch supports geofencing in what is called Virtual Boundaries.</p><p>The app will notify you once the watch enters the designated area. Chris Wedel used this often for his son during school days, letting him know when his son arrived and left school. This feature can help ease a parent&apos;s mind as their child begins to have more and more experiences away from home. An emergency contact button and 911 dialing are also available as added safety options.</p><p>Aside from the automated location alerts that can be set up, parents can also manually locate their child using the app or even turn on live tracking. This will ping the watch every 10 seconds for a maximum of 15 minutes. However, keep in mind that using this feature will quickly deplete the watch&apos;s battery life.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>My son loved the included dino game and step tracking but was hoping for some more available apps.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The camera can also take silly pictures that your child can store on the watch and later send as messages. The quality is good enough for a watch and generally looks great on the watch face. It&apos;s nice being able to receive pictures like this, as it makes spontaneous moments fun.</p><p>The app situation is also pretty barebones, but that&apos;s not bad if the goal is to reduce distractions. The apps are limited to step tracking, the camera, a media folder, communications, timers, a calculator, and a few games. The games available are few and simple: Tic Tac Toe, Puzzle, Voice Changer, and Dino Run.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-t-mobile-syncup-kids-watch-what-needs-work"><span>T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch: What needs work</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Nce9KSpEPau3bskCsUde6e" name="T-Mobile-SyncUP-KIDS-Watch-home-screen.jpg" alt="The T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nce9KSpEPau3bskCsUde6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though the watch does a good job of managing battery in poor cellular coverage areas, it would be helpful if it had the option of Wi-Fi calling or messaging. The T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch lacks any connectivity option other than the 4G LTE.</p><p>The device utilizes the cellular network to manage calls and texts as they come through normal SMS, and when the network connection is poor, it&apos;s going to obviously struggle.</p><p>Supporting Wi-Fi would not only help in this regard but also prolong the life of the watch itself. Having poor network coverage means the watch will constantly waste battery searching for an LTE signal, and it also means you can&apos;t use the watch&apos;s vital communication features unless you&apos;re in range of a T-Mobile tower.</p><p>The network availability could also deter potential users from this smartwatch. Even though T-Mobile has substantially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-t-mobile-everything-you-need-know">expanded its network</a>, that mostly applies to 5G signals which this watch doesn&apos;t support.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Having no Wi-Fi support means the watch could suffer from poor indoor network coverage.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While I don&apos;t necessarily need it, some customers have asked about the possibility of getting popular messaging apps like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp on the watch. Watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.angelwatchco.com/kb/messaging-and-the-line-slash-lite-lite-app/understanding-messaging-on-angel-watch">Angel Watch</a> support WhatsApp, which is more widely used worldwide for communication. This isn&apos;t as important for a U.S.-only watch, but it would still be nice to have some more options.</p><p>I also find the app UI to be a little confusing, partly because it&apos;s fairly slow to load. You have to find the watch in the list of family members on the app home screen to open watch options. Tapping the watch thumbnail on the main map screen does nothing, which was very strange to me. Once I figured out how to find the watch, things were OK, but this step was needlessly confusing.</p><p>Lastly, I&apos;d love to see more health sensors on a future version of the watch. Step counting is nice, but most adult smartwatches support things like heart rate monitoring, stress monitoring, and more. It would be nice to have this on a kids watch like the Angel Watch Series R has.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mvFTyawswJ927t67vGdEg" name="Garmin-Bounce-watch-faces.jpg" alt="One of the dozen different watch faces available on the Garmin Bounce kids smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mvFTyawswJ927t67vGdEg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If the watch features or network capabilities are reasons to give you pause when considering the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch, don&apos;t worry. The options for connected kids&apos; smartwatches are plentiful. My son&apos;s favorite smartwatch is also our top pick: the Garmin Bounce. While it doesn&apos;t have the dino game or a camera, it&apos;s got even better battery life than the SyncUP, a points reward system, and Wi-Fi support.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for a watch with even better cameras, the TickTalk 4 has two cameras so your child take even more photos. It also supports video calling. While there aren&apos;t any games on this watch, it does have free iHeartRadio Family music. This, along with many other features, can be limited or turned off within the TickTalk companion app. The downside is that it&apos;s missing geofencing support.</p><p>Our other choice is the Angel Watch Series R. While the app is clunkier than what&apos;s offered by the T-Mobile SyncUP, the Angel Watch supports WhatsApp for richer communication. In addition, a series of health sensors make it possible to monitor heart rate and other health data throughout the day, making it one of the only kids&apos; watches with more advanced health features.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-t-mobile-syncup-kids-watch-should-you-buy-it"><span>T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fpDKdv2oegaNc7DQjRc7Hc" name="T-Mobile-SyncUP-KIDS-Watch-home-button.jpg" alt="The T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Smartwatch home button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fpDKdv2oegaNc7DQjRc7Hc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if ...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a watch with great communication options.</li><li>You want a watch with good safety features.</li><li>You are a T-Mobile customer.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if ...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You live in an area with poor T-Mobile coverage.</li><li>You want a watch with health sensors.</li><li>You want a watch that supports 3rd-party apps.</li></ul>
<p>The T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch would be my pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">best kids smartwatch</a> if it were offered outside of the confines of T-Mobile&apos;s network. While you&apos;re not likely to find too many places with poor T-Mobile network coverage these days, being restricted to a single LTE network is strangely confining, especially when there&apos;s no Wi-Fi support to help with coverage in buildings.</p><p>But, if you&apos;re a T-Mobile customer or looking to join T-Mobile&apos;s excellent network, this is a superb option that&apos;ll only cost you $10/month since the company gives the watches away for free with a new watch line.</p><p>It offers nearly every feature you could think of or want — except for a points reward system for chores and tasks — and includes excellent voice and video calling, plus lots of text and voice messaging options. The setup is super simple, and everything is handled through your T-Mobile login. All in all, it&apos;s a superb choice for anyone on T-Mobile, so long as you don&apos;t have issues with indoor reception.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="why-should-i-shop-for-refurbished-tech-2">Why should I shop for refurbished tech?</h2>
<p>Recycled materials and plastic-free packaging are all well and good, but if you really want an eco-friendly gadget, the best thing you could do is buy used or refurbished. Buying one of these pre-owned devices completely removes the costly manufacturing process altogether, thereby reducing your environmental impact considerably. It also (hopefully) tells the tech companies that they don&apos;t necessarily need to roll out a new device every single year for the rest of our lives.</p><p>Everyone from Samsung to Amazon and Back Market have an excellent selection of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-refurbished-phones">refurbished phones</a> and other devices that have been renewed to meet like-new standards. In most cases, they&apos;re are also covered by a warranty and are dramatically cheaper than their brand new counterparts. In other words, it can help the environment <em>and</em> your bank account at the same time. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-greenwashing-2">What is greenwashing?</h2>
<p>As we mentioned above, greenwashing is a deceitful marketing tactic that merchants use to make consumers believe that they&apos;re supporting a sustainable business, even when the company in question has done very little or nothing to actually reduce their environmental impact. Just about every market is guilty of it nowadays, and it&apos;s up to you, the consumer, to spot the sketchy strategy before you spend your hard-earned money. </p><p>One piece of advice would be to keep an eye out for companies that use vague buzzwords like "green", "earth-friendly", and even "eco-friendly". Unless they&apos;re accompanied with certifications and transparent, verifiable business practices, these claims have no substantial backing. </p><p>Similarly, be wary of distractions. A phone shipped out with 100% recycled exterior packaging is great, but it has very little impact when the company takes part in environmentally-destructive practices elsewhere in the manufacturing process. As a rule of thumb, explore the company&apos;s website and find their sustainability policies and goals before adding any product to your cart. If they&apos;re vague, unspecific, or non-existent, it&apos;s probably greenwashing. </p><p>Although they don&apos;t exactly have a spotless environmental record, you can also take a look at our guide to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-samsungs-galaxy-for-the-planet-initiative">Samsung&apos;s Galaxy For The Planet initiative</a> to see how one major tech company is attempting to tackle the climate crisis. </p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, a lot of the best T-Mobile phones also double up as some of the best phones in general, but that doesn&apos;t always mean it&apos;s easy to choose one. Whether you&apos;re a new customer or have been with the carrier for many years, there are quite a few great options worth checking out, and we&apos;ve rounded up the best among them to help you out.</p><p>Perhaps the most important thing to consider while choosing a good Android phone is to ensure that it offers all the features you need, at a price you can afford. Our top vote goes to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra because it&apos;s the ultimate flagship that has just about every feature you could think of. Alternatively, you can go for the Google Pixel 8 as it offers a wide variety of flagship perks at a very reasonable price. Then we have budget options like the OnePlus Nord N30 5G, which includes all the essentials and even has some features that you won&apos;t find on much more expensive devices.</p>

It&apos;s now priced at just $349 and for that price, you&apos;re getting a smartphone that features Google&apos;s efficient Tensor G2 SoC (the same chipset found in the last-gen Pixel 7 Pro), a flagship-level camera quality, and some of the finest haptics in this price bracket.</p><p>Since this is a Pixel phone, you can also look forward to top-tier software support. It won&apos;t be an exaggeration to say that Google has gone out of its way to transform the Pixel 7a into a premium mid-range device. There are even premium features such as an IP67 certification and wireless charging included in the mix.</p>

If you want to save some cash, we suggest checking the Samsung Galaxy A54, the Google Pixel 7a, or even the OnePlus Nord N30 5G, all of which are some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" target="_blank">best cheap Android phones</a> you can get.</p>

There are more than a few reasons why these are our favorites, including their super comfortable fit, their impressive Dolby Atmos and spatial audio features, and their adaptive active noise canceling (ANC).</p><p>With $50 off the purchase price, it might be worth your time to grab these capable earbuds while the discount lasts.</p>

<p>In our opinion, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-review">Jabra Elite 10s</a> are the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a> on the market today, and you can save $50 on them while this deal lasts. Buyers love the Elite 10s for their solid audio quality and features, like spatial audio and ANC. Plus, they're comfortable to wear, they offer up to 30 hours of battery life with the charging case, and they're rated IP57 for dust and water resistance.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are only a few left in gloss black and titanium black at Best Buy, though you can also get this deal on the cocoa and cream colors if you get there too late—or check them out from some other retailers.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want earbuds with premium audio and listening features, such as ANC, Dolby Atmos, and EQ presets; wireless charging is a major priority for you in headphones; you&apos;re looking for an especially comfortable pair of earbuds.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> ; you prefer bigger name-brand options like earbuds from Sony or Bose; you want hi-res codec support. </p><p>The Jabra Elite 10 earbuds feature powerful and clear audio from 10mm drivers, along with EQ presets, a useful, adaptive ANC, and beautiful spatial audio. The Jabra app also makes it easy to configure audio however you want, while built-in microphones let you talk on the phone or use voice assistants like Siri. On their own, these earbuds offer up to 8 hours of battery life, or up to a total of 30 hours with the use of the charging case.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that the head tracking feature offers a pretty cool surround sound-like audio feature, though it can make the battery life drop pretty substantially. While they aren&apos;t as durable as the classic Jabra Elite 8 Active, they will still hold up pretty well compared to most earbuds.</p>
