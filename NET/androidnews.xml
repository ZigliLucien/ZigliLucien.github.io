<ul><li>Google has announced its June feature drop, which includes several updates like rolling out display port support for its Pixel devices.</li><li>The Pixel 8 and other Pixel Pro devices can now be rediscovered when offline or without power through the Find My Device network.</li><li>Other updates involve Pixel Tablet doorbell notifications, Recorder app improvements, a manual camera expansion, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Here in June, Google is announcing a few new updates to its Pixel phones and the Pixel Tablet.</p><p>As detailed in a press release, Google is bringing some useful user-facing features to its Pixels, such as display port support. With a USB-C cable, Pixel users can now watch movies and shows on a larger, secondary display. Once connected and with a video running, your Pixel devices will ask if you&apos;d like to "mirror" your display to an external screen.</p><p>This is rolling out on the Pixel 8, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>, and 8a.</p>

<p>Next, Pixel users are now picking up "power-off Finding" through the Find My Device network. Google states that users can begin rediscovering their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> or Pixel Pro devices even if it&apos;s turned off.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-pixel-8-find-my-device-powered-off">explained how this works</a> in May, stating Pixel owners can relocate their phone "several hours" after its battery dies or manually powered off. Before it&apos;s turned off or all power is lost, your Pixel device will send one final ping to the Find My Device network of its last known location.</p><p>Unknown callers are a curious occurrence, which is why Google is rolling out "Reverse Phone Number Lookup." The company states users can conduct a reverse search on a number in their call logs.</p><p>From the "Recents" tab in the Phone app, users can find that unknown caller, tap the number, and tap "Lookup." The search will begin from there, delivering any relevant information users need about that unknown phone number.</p>

<p>The Pixel Recorder app is getting a useful update today (June 11) that brings more detailed summaries. Google states that these summaries will include the names of speakers. Additionally, important transcriptions can be exported into Google Docs or simple text files.</p><p>Google&apos;s Pixel camera is gaining some additional HDR enhancements via HDR Plus. The company states this new feature will let Pixel owners find the "best moment from your photo in HDR Plus with just a single shutter." Google hopes this aids users in finding the best shots with folks who are smiling and in focus without blurring.Â </p><p>This is rolling out for Pixel 6 and newer phones, as well as the Pixel Tablet and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>.</p><p>Additional camera updates are here through "Manual Lens Expansion." Google states this update lets users manually decide which camera should capture a photo. The Pixel 8 Pro, 7 Pro, 6 Pro, and Pixel Fold are in line for this camera enhancement.</p><p>Lastly, the company is bringing its Gemini Nano AI model to the developer options for the Pixel 8 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>.</p>

<p>Joining this June Pixel feature drop is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> with an update that helps users keep tabs on their homes. The post states that the tablet is picking up doorbell notifications in Hub mode when docked. If someone has rung the doorbell, your docked Pixel Tablet will display a quick snapshot of who&apos;s at the door <em>before </em>you go and check.</p><p>The Pixel Tablet is also picking up a Google Home "Favorites" widget for the home screen. This will let users quickly access their most important smart home devices without needing to dive into the main Home app. From the widget, users will find a device&apos;s appropriate controls, like sliders for managing the lights, locking your doors, and more.</p><p>These features for Google&apos;s Pixel phones and the Pixel Tablet should begin rolling out throughout the week.</p>

<hr>
<p>It is that time of year when we expect Google to launch its feature drops for Pixel devices, and the search giant just did it for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-june-2024-feature-drop-detailed">Pixel phones</a> next to the Pixel Watch models.</p><p>The popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-car-crash-detection-pixel-4">car crash detection</a> feature that was only on Pixel phones is now available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, with the latest feature drop. Pixel Watch 2 users can now dial emergency services if they get into a severe car crash. The new feature is paired with Emergency Sharing on the Pixel Watch 2 to help share real-time locations with the user&apos;s emergency contacts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="kMRm7cMHhoycbzrZnkvYqM" name="Pixel-Watch-2-car-crash-detection.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 2 Car Crash detection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kMRm7cMHhoycbzrZnkvYqM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, improvements to fall detection can be seen with the new update, especially for falls from bicycles. The latter applies to both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> and the Pixel Watch 2.</p><p>Next up is the Google Wallet, a handy app for smartwatch users. As part of the new update, both Pixel Watch models&apos; can link their Paypal account to the wallet app. The feature will be available for users based in the U.S. and Germany. The new feature aims to allow its users to make payments hassle-free by providing multiple options.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="gzcDQiEcuWNPKw5jtBe3CN" name="Pixel-Watch-2-PayPal-linking.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 2 with PayPal support" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gzcDQiEcuWNPKw5jtBe3CN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is also bringing a major revamp for its Home app for users running on WearOS 3 and above-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a>. It allows users to easily access their smart home devices faster and easier from their wrists. It includes accessing users&apos; Google Home favorites with just a swipe on the Pixel Watch â thanks to a new Wear OS tile. Users will then be able to adjust the temperature and dim the lights, as well as more, from the latest Google Home app.Â </p><p>Further, users can access their smart home from their preferred watch face complication on the Wear OS-powered smartwatch. They can add a shortcut to the watch face, and tapping the shortcut allows the users to make adjustments right on their wrists.

<hr>
<p>Apple previewed iOS 18 at the companyâs WWDC 2024 developer conference, and thereâs one big highlight for Android users â <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone">RCS messaging</a>. After years of dealing with SMS and MMS messaging when texting an iPhone user from an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, the experience will improve starting this fall. Android users have been waiting for this for a <em>long </em>time, yet Apple barely spoke about RCS messaging during its iOS 18 showcase. It was an afterthought that came separate from all the other messaging features in iOS 18.</p><p>Itâs clear that Apple is not thrilled about adding RCS to the iPhone. The company wasnât <em>technically </em>forced to support RCS, but the industry assumption is that it did so to try and appease the European Union. After all, at one point, iMessage was at risk of becoming a cross-platform service under Digital Markets Act requirements. A few months after Apple announced support for RCS messaging, the EU announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-dma-core-service-apple-imessage-ruling">iMessage wouldnât fall under the âcore platform serviceâ designation</a>.</p><p>Make no mistake, Appleâs choice to subtly reference RCS messaging during WWDC was intentional. The company isnât thrilled about supporting it, and it doesnât want to undercut iMessage in any way. There was a clear separation between iMessage and RCS in the keynote â both in terms of the times the features were announced and in the features themselves.Â </p><p>This isnât surprising at all. Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/16/apple-rcs-coming-to-iphone/">dropped</a> the original announcement of RCS right in the hands of 9to5Mac, neglecting to even put out a press release or provide further details about the move, only adding that your bubbles will still be green. Apple doesnât care about RCS, and to be honest, neither do the companyâs users. Itâs a move to appease regulators and nothing more, so why give it a bunch of stage time at WWDC?</p>
<h2 id="rcs-is-coming-to-ios-18-but-who-knows-what-it-will-look-like-2">RCS is coming to iOS 18, but who knows what it will look like</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6AzNj8935kArmVpTEVcAhK" name="imessage-android-thumb-cisj.jpg" alt="iMessage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6AzNj8935kArmVpTEVcAhK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Apple officially announced RCS messaging would come to iOS 18 at WWDC â before, we knew it was coming in 2024, but werenât 100% sure when â it didnât provide any new details. Apple is using the RCS Universal Profile, and this should let RCS messages send over Wi-Fi or data, allow for higher-quality photos and videos, and add key features like message reactions and read receipts. However, we also know that Apple is <em>not</em> replacing iMessage with RCS. Plenty of things that people love about iMessage will still be exclusive to that service.Â </p><p>We loaded up the first iOS 18 developer beta to see if there were any hints at how RCS might be implemented. When you draft a message in the Messages app on iOS, an empty text field will read either <strong>iMessage </strong>or <strong>Text Message</strong>. On iOS 18, the language is further clarified, reading "<strong>Text Message SMS</strong>." For now, there isnât a way to send an RCS message in iOS 18. There isnât even a new setting in the <strong>Messages</strong> tab in the redesigned iOS 18 Settings app related to RCS.</p><p>If Apple <em>really</em> doesnât want RCS to come to iOS 18, it could delay its addition to the operating system until closer to its public release. We assume that Apple will want this tested externally before iOS 18 fully rolls out, so itâll probably appear in a developer beta at some point. Until that happens, what RCS messaging will really look like in iOS 18 is anyoneâs guess.</p>
<h2 id="everything-new-to-imessage-won-x2019-t-work-with-rcs-xa0-2">Everything new to iMessage wonât work with RCS Â </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kZ7KqDVLAUUMALmRBYbdc3" name="iMessage-Text-Formatting.jpg" alt="New formatting options for iMessage." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kZ7KqDVLAUUMALmRBYbdc3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple announced a few new Messages features in iOS 18, but didnât bring up RCS at all during this portion of the showcase. I think this was intentional, making the point that the latest and greatest iOS has to offer wonât work with RCS. You can schedule iMessages for a later date or time, use new text formatting options like bold or strikethrough, and use any emoji to âtapbackâ to messages.Â </p><p>Of these, we know that the <strong>Send Later</strong> feature wonât come to RCS chats, and neither will the new text formatting options. The new tapback emoji choices <em>might</em> work on Android with RCS, but if they do, itâll be of no thanks to Apple. Google has already found ways to show tapbacks on Android with clever workarounds, and thereâs no reason it couldnât do the same with an expanded emoji library. After all, Android users have been able to react to messages with any emoji for a while now.</p><p>Either way, the point is the same. Apple didnât talk much about RCS because there isnât anything to talk about. Itâs focused on adding new features to iMessage, and RCS is just <em>there</em>.Â </p>
<h2 id="apple-wants-you-to-know-rcs-still-isn-x2019-t-imessage-2">Apple wants you to know RCS still isnât iMessage</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="dMrppiFeGQKcUvyYPHraMf" name="google-messages-and-imessage-icons.jpg" alt="Google Messages And Imessage Icons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dMrppiFeGQKcUvyYPHraMf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Joe Maring / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The movement for RCS is twofold. There are technical reasons for wanting RCS, like improved security, more advanced features, and better media quality. Another important reason for wanting RCS on the iPhone is to try to erase the âgreen bubbleâ stigma. Itâs a real thing, especially among younger generations. iPhone users donât mock Android users because their texts use SMS instead of RCS. They mock them because any green bubble message is <strong>not iMessage</strong>. Itâs that simple.Â </p><p>To be clear, I donât think shaming people for their phone of choice is an okay thing to do, and not every iPhone user behaves this way. However, some do, and itâs why younger generations are flocking to iPhones at impossibly-high rates for fear of being labeled as an outcast.Â </p><p>For that, the RCS move does nothing. At the end of the day, RCS is not iMessage. And by the way Apple chose to reference (or, <em>not</em> reference) RCS at WWDC, I think it wants to remind users of that.Â </p>

<ul><li>Apple is considering adding third-party AI models like Google Gemini to iOS 18, following the integration of ChatGPT.</li><li>Apple's Craig Federighi emphasized that users might prefer different AI models for specific tasks, and Apple aims to let users choose their preferred model.</li><li>Allowing users to choose their AI model could set Apple apart from competitors like Google and Samsung.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>An Apple executive has revealed that the company is open to adding third-party AI models like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> to iOS 18, after bringing ChatGPT to the platform.</p><p>At WWDC24, Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI to integrate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-use-chatgpt-on-chromebook">ChatGPT</a> into iOS 18. This means that if Siri can&apos;t answer a question, it will pass it on to ChatGPT for a detailed response. This collaboration boosts Siri&apos;s abilities and combines the strengths of both AI models.</p><p>After the keynote, Craig Federighi, Apple&apos;s software engineering chief, hinted at even bigger plans for AI in iOS. In an interview, he mentioned the potential of adding Gemini alongside Apple&apos;s current OpenAI partnership (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/10/craig-federighi-says-apple-hopes-to-add-google-gemini-and-other-ai-models-to-ios-18/" target="_blank">9to5Mac</a>).</p><p>Federighi&apos;s comments back up reports of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-google-in-talks-gemini-ios-18">Apple&apos;s potential partnership with Google</a>, hinting at the integration of Gemini into iOS. He suggested iOS 18 might adopt a multi-model approach, offering more choice and customization in mobile AI assistants.</p><p>"We think ultimately people are going to have a preference perhaps for certain models that they want to use, maybe one thatâs great for creative writing or one that they prefer for coding," Federighi said during the interview moderated by YouTuber iJustine. "And so we want to enable users ultimately to bring a model of their choice."</p><p>Federighi said Appleâs pick of ChatGPT reflects the company&apos;s focus on top-notch tech for users. With this partnership, Siri gets to use OpenAIâs GPT-4o without extra costs or new accounts. Plus, Apple keeps your privacy safe by not logging queries or IP addresses. Basic features are free, but you can subscribe for premium AI perks.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that while Federighi confirmed Apple&apos;s plans to bring more AI models to iOS 18, especially through its partnership with OpenAI, he didnât actually mention Gemini.</p><p>Anyway, this could be a big deal for the future of AI on Apple devices. Allowing users to choose their AI model would set Apple apart from competitors like Google and Samsung, who stick to one AI assistant. If Apple takes this route, it could lead the way in giving users more control over their AI experience.</p><p>The first beta of iOS 18 doesn&apos;t yet have Apple Intelligence features. These smart functionalities are set to be tested over the summer. The full public release of iOS 18 is expected in September.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There&apos;s a lot of choice if you&apos;re interested in buying a Xiaomi phone in mid-2024; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> continues to be my recommendation if you need a smallish phone, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">14 Ultra</a> has one of the best overall camera packages you&apos;ll find today. Then there are the value flagship offerings â the 13T Pro in particular is a standout choice.</p><p>While most manufacturers moved away from the idea of a mid-cycle refresh, Xiaomi&apos;s T series devices are an integral part of its phone portfolio, and last year&apos;s 13T series picked up a huge upgrade: Leica integration. Xiaomi needed a way to differentiate the 13T series against the POCO F5 and F5 Pro, and adding a few Leica effects and filters goes a long way in achieving that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Me938xzHVTwNNvx4wxBfGf" name="xiaomi-13t-pro-3.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 13T Pro long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Me938xzHVTwNNvx4wxBfGf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the 13T Pro when it launched, and I switched back to the device recently to see how it holds up against 2024 value flagships. I&apos;m still not a fan of the design; the large rectangular camera island at the back with curving sides just doesn&apos;t look cohesive, and it comes across as half-done. While the blue version of the phone has a faux leather back, the black model has a glass back with a glossy finish that&apos;s just mundane.</p><p>The plastic sides don&apos;t quite have the same feel as the likes of the Xiaomi 14, but they don&apos;t have a glossy coat either, and that at least makes using the device a little easier. That said, I like the way the back curves to meet the mid-frame; even though the front of the phone has a flat panel, the curves at the back make a noticeable difference in usability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5LgUajSateJYfsC3ktQ7Qh" name="xiaomi-13t-pro-9.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 13T Pro long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5LgUajSateJYfsC3ktQ7Qh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the 13T Pro comes into its own is the screen; the 6.67-inch AMOLED panel has excellent colors and contrast levels, and it gets incredibly bright in daily use. The Xiaomi 14 managed to get a smidgen brighter in auto mode while outdoors, but the 13T Pro has absolutely no issues in this area, and like most Xiaomi phones, the stereo sound coming out of this thing is highly detailed, and <em>loud</em>.</p><p>Interestingly, Xiaomi went with a 144Hz refresh for the 13T series, and while I didn&apos;t notice too much of a difference between 120Hz and 144Hz, the 13T Pro has a level of immediacy and fluidity that I didn&apos;t notice outside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>. Of course, you&apos;ll need to go into the settings to manually toggle the 144Hz mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kgnM2WqRZXWn7ddY3caapi" name="xiaomi-13t-pro-12.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 13T Pro long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kgnM2WqRZXWn7ddY3caapi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a similar vein, the Dimensity 9200+ continues to deliver outstanding performance. It delivers stable framerates in demanding games, and the best part is that there is no noticeable overheating. Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> has better figures in synthetic testing, it tends to get hotter as well, so if you want a gaming-focused phone that manages thermals, this is still a great option.</p><p>Another upgrade is around ingress protection, with the 13T Pro getting IP68 dust and water resistance as standard. This brings it closer to the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> and Xiaomi 14, and is a good move from Xiaomi, considering the 12T models only had IP54. On that note, the vibration motor is much better this time as well, and it has granular feedback.</p>

<p>Where the 13T Pro truly differentiates itself from its predecessors is the cameras; the phone has a 50MP Sony IMX707 main camera with OIS, a 50MP zoom lens with 2x optical zoom, and a 12MP wide-angle that&apos;s much better than previous years. The camera isn&apos;t as good as the Xiaomi 14, but it has much better versatility than previous years, and the Leica collaboration means you get more shooting modes and effects.</p><p>But what I liked better is the battery life. The 13T Pro is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-xiaomi-phones">best Xiaomi phones</a> in this regard, and the 5000mAh battery managed to last a day and a half with relative ease. There wasn&apos;t a single day where the battery went below 20% even with heavy use, and there just isn&apos;t any need to be anxious in this regard. On that note, the 120W charging tech ensures a full charge takes just 28 minutes, and that party trick doesn&apos;t get old.</p>

<p>As for the software, the 13T Pro switched to HyperOS in February, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>-based interface isn&apos;t noticeably different to MIUI 14. What is noticeable is that the overall interface has better fluidity and optimization, and in that sense, it is distinctly better than MIUI 14. The software itself is identical to what you get on other Xiaomi phones, and if you&apos;ve used MIUI for a while, you&apos;ll be immediately familiar with what&apos;s on offer.</p><p>The 13T Pro will get four Android OS updates, but given Xiaomi&apos;s glacial pace in this area, it&apos;s likely you&apos;ll need to wait at least until Q1 2025 to pick up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. That said, the phone will be updated to Android 17 when that becomes available, so it should be good for long-term use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JSoKzRbViZMNifJQ7BsX4h" name="xiaomi-13t-pro-8.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 13T Pro long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JSoKzRbViZMNifJQ7BsX4h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi sells the 12GB/512GB model of the 13T Pro in the U.K., and while it went on sale earlier in the year, it is back up to its Â£699 ($890) retail price. That&apos;s still Â£149 ($190) less than the Xiaomi 14, and you get a larger screen and a bigger battery. If you want to maximize value, the standard Xiaomi 13T retails for Â£549 ($699), and while you don&apos;t get as much storage (it&apos;s sold in an 8GB/256GB configuration), it has the same set of cameras, same AMOLED panel, and same battery.</p><p>The only difference is that the 13T takes an additional 15 minutes to charge the 5000mAh battery as it has 67W charging tech. Honestly, you don&apos;t notice the difference in daily use, and for my money, I&apos;d get the Xiaomi 13T â it is the best value in Xiaomi&apos;s portfolio.</p>

<p>Considering where the 13T series is in its product cycle, Xiaomi is bound to start heavily discounting the devices as it starts to shift attention to the upcoming 14T models. I also like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO F6</a> quite a bit, and while it has better cameras, they&apos;re not quite in the same league as the 13T series, so if that&apos;s a priority, you should pick up the 13T or 13T Pro.</p>

<p>Jabra announced this morning (June 11) new versions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-review">Elite 8 Active</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-review">Elite 10</a>, featuring what it claims to be the worldâs first LE Audio smart case.Â </p><p>The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 and Elite 10 Gen 2 each offer unique features. The Elite 10 is perfect for daily use, while the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 is built tough for your workouts. However, the real game-changer is the smart case, which enables wireless streaming from any device with a USB-C or 3.5mm port. With dual USB-C and 3.5mm compatibility, it provides universal streaming and connectivity.</p>

<p>A built-in chip in the case makes connecting and streaming audio from various devices a breeze. It also offers lower latency than standard Bluetooth, ensuring better audio and video sync and Hi-Fi sound quality. Plus, the 2-in-1 cable turns the charging case into a versatile adapter for spatial sound streaming directly to the earbuds.</p><p>The new models feature improved Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) that blocks up to twice as much noise as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-true-wireless-earbuds">previous versions</a>, especially in the mid- and low-frequency ranges. They also have six-microphone call technology and enhanced AI algorithms for clearer calls, prioritizing your voice over background noise.</p><p>Battery life is solid, too. The Elite 10 Gen 2 offers six hours of playback, extendable to 27 hours with the wireless charging case and ANC on. Theyâre IP57-rated for dust and water resistance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 provides up to eight hours of battery life, extendable to 32 hours with the case and ANC on, and is fully sweatproof, waterproof, and workout-proof with an IP68 rating for the earbuds and an IP54 rating for the case.</p><p>Both models support hands-free voice assistance, as well as Google Fast Pair, Swift Pair, and Spotify Tap playback. They also feature a semi-open design to relieve ear pressure and make ANC listening more comfortable, with soft silicone tips for added comfort.</p><p>The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 starts at $229 and comes in navy, black, and new colors Coral and Olive, available from mid-June.

<ul><li>WhatsApp is testing a new feature that reminds users of their status' privacy settings before sharing.Â </li><li>Users can choose to share their status with either all contacts, specific groups or pre-set contacts, making it easier to share with specific audiences without needing to constantly adjust privacy settings.</li><li>The new update is only available to some Beta testers at the moment, via the Google Play app and will be rolling out to others in the coming days.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>According to a recent report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-12-27-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>, WhatsApp is testing a new feature that will add another layer of privacy to your status updates. The publication states that the new WhatsApp beta Android<strong> 2.24.12.27 </strong>update discovered that WhatsApp is rolling out a status privacy confirmation feature.Â </p><p>This means that users can control who sees their individual status updates. Anytime a user uploads a WhatsApp status, a prompt appears right before they hit share, showing them their status&apos; privacy settings and asking them if they wish to change it. By showing the status privacy settings before sharing content, users can post their status updates to specific groups without adjusting their settings for each status individually.</p><p>Users can share a status update withÂ <strong>All contacts </strong>orÂ <strong>Specific contacts</strong> previously set up by the user. Right now, WhatsApp lets users control who gets to view Status updates through<strong> Settings > Privacy;</strong> users can also select who views their updates on the Status Editor page.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1732px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.29%;"><img id="AjhYCbtQBh9uAqyLhjZgcC" name="WhatsApp-status-update-beta.png" alt="Whatsapp status update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AjhYCbtQBh9uAqyLhjZgcC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1732" height="819" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this new update, WhatsApp aims to remind users to whom this status update is visible and adjust their privacy settings, ensuring that their content reaches only the "intended" contacts.Â </p><p>While we aren&apos;t sure when this update will roll out to users, WABetaInfo says that the status privacy confirmation feature is currently available to some beta testers who install the latest updates of WhatsApp beta for Android from the Google Play Store. It will roll out to more people in the "coming days."</p><p>Meanwhile, the messaging app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-status-updates-tray">recently announced</a> that it will allow longer status updates and voice notes. This allows users to upload WhatsApp status videos for up to one minute. These changes allow users to share longer moments and stories with their friends and family.Â </p><p>Additionally, WhatsApp is said to be improving the overall status experience by lining up the most relevant updates at the beginning of the list. This means updates from people you frequently talk to or contacts pinned in the Chats tab will be the first to pop on the horizontal list (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/whatsapp-beta-android-status-privacy-pop-up/">Android Police</a>).</p><p>Android Central has contacted WhatsApp about this, but it did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article once we have more information.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>For as much time as Apple spent talking about "Apple Intelligence," you might have thought the WWDC 2024 Keynote was four hours long. Surprisingly, it was actually shorter than last year&apos;s Keynote by about 20 minutes and was six minutes shorter than Google I/O 2024. With Apple starting to make the developer betas available, we wanted to have some fun and take a look at everything iOS 18 stole from Android.</p><p>This number has been steadily rising in recent years, but at first glance, iOS 18 takes the cake. There are a staggering number of things that Apple claims are "revolutionary," completely ignoring the world that uses Android.</p>
<h2 id="home-screen-and-lock-screen-2">Home Screen and Lock Screen</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a8usycLRxsvGBXKnoREMJ6" name="ios-18-home-screen-themes-layouts.jpg" alt="Home Screen themes and layouts on iPhone with iOS 18" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a8usycLRxsvGBXKnoREMJ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s only fitting to kick off this list by talking about the "new" customization options. For the first time ever, iPhone and iPad owners will be able to put their app icons and widgetsÂ <em>wherever they desire</em>. Until now, installed apps would fill the grid, only letting you change the order they were in, remove them, put them in folders, or push them around with widgets.</p><p>I can&apos;t help but laugh at this point, simply because this has been possible on Android since the beginning. Not to mention the various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-launchers">third-party app launchers</a> that give you all of the tools you would need to create a truly custom interface.</p><p>Speaking of personalization, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Material You</a> has come to iOS. Of course, it&apos;s not the same implementation that Google uses, but it&apos;s basically the same, as iOS 18 makes it so you can change the color of your app icons. While we still hope to see the ability to use app icon packs, it&apos;s at least a step in the right direction.</p>
<h2 id="control-center-2">Control Center</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Frhfiup2YEFdRXhShHgg5" name="ios-18-control-center.jpg" alt="Control Center redesign on iOS 18" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Frhfiup2YEFdRXhShHgg5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the most part, Apple left Control Center unchanged for the last few releases. iOS 18 changes that, as there are now multiple panels for you to swipe through in order to access different quick toggles and settings. You can even customize the Control Center using a new Controls Gallery, adding various toggles from Apple or third-party developers.</p><p>In addition to the "main" Control Center panel, iOS 18 also adds panels for smart home controls, media playback, connectivity, and more. iPhone owners will also be able to resize different widgets here, something that actually would be nice to have on Android.</p>
<h2 id="on-device-ai-2">On-device AI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hj8YhntmS8oLPGThkM7Mck" name="apple-intelligence-ios-18.png" alt="Apple Intelligence examples on iPhone running iOS 18" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hj8YhntmS8oLPGThkM7Mck.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There was a big reason why Apple did its own speed run through the various product categories, and of course, AI is to blame. The second half of the WWDC &apos;24 Keynote presentation was dedicated to "Apple Intelligence." Apple attempted to explain how Siri is basically being infused with Large Language Models and AI while showcasing different ways we should expect it to work.</p><p>Apple also shared that much of how Siri can interact with your phone and apps is handled by an on-device AI model. For times when you&apos;re trying to do something that your phone can&apos;t handle, it leans on "Private Cloud Compute" servers. And if you ask Siri a question that it can&apos;t answer, OpenAI and ChatGPT will swoop in to save the day.</p><p>Needless to say, Google got there before Apple with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Nano</a> model, which is found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>. It, too, relies on servers when the model can&apos;t do what you&apos;re asking. But it will be interesting to pit Gemini against Siri to see which comes out on top.</p>

<p>Although I use the Photos app on my own iPhone, the majority of my photo library management still goes through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>. It&apos;s pretty apparent that this is also the case for Apple employees, as there are quite a few familiar features making their way to iOS 18.</p><p>Collections are pretty self-explanatory and are coming to the native Photos app on iOS 18. A new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-collections-tab-highlights-automated-suggestions-new-design">Collections tab</a> has already been slowly rolling out on Android phones as Google continues testing the feature, although it appears to be a slightly reworked version of the current Library tab with a bit more emphasis on auto-generated albums like People & Pets. Memories are another type of collection, but they are getting juiced up with AI on Apple&apos;s Photos app, allowing you to enter a prompt, and your device will create a collage or movie.</p><p>Arguably, the biggest addition to Photos on iOS 18 will be the ability to remove unwanted objects from the background. It&apos;s just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> for the iPhone, but without the need for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> or the Google Photos app to achieve it.</p>
<h2 id="mail-and-messaging-2">Mail and Messaging</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EZNgCCr7AGvNM575ZJiit5" name="ios-18-mail-changes.jpg" alt="Categories in Mail app on iOS 18" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EZNgCCr7AGvNM575ZJiit5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Getting the boring stuff out of the way first, Apple didn&apos;t pay too much attention to its built-in Mail app. However, it is gaining "on-device categorization," meaning that there will be categories based on the types of emails that are residing within your inbox. These are essentially the same as what Inbox by Gmail introduced all the way back in 2015.</p><p>Speaking of Inbox by Gmail, the Messages app is getting another feature that Android&apos;s various SMS/MMS apps have had: the ability to schedule a message. There&apos;s really not much else to explain here other than that you can pick the date and time, type out the message, and schedule it. Groundbreaking.</p><p>The topic that everyone seemed to be talking about leading up to the WWDC &apos;24 Keynote was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a>. All of that hype accounted for a split-second mention as RCS will arrive on the iPhone with iOS 18. And yes, the "blue bubble" war will rage on, as non-iPhone users still show up with a green bubble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9gFTt4U66uj3G5ogBtA7c6" name="ios-18-genmoji.jpg" alt="Genmoji in iOS 18" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9gFTt4U66uj3G5ogBtA7c6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a feature that literally nobody asked for, Apple is trying to "flex its muscles" with its AI-powered "Genmoji." Using the on-device LLM, write a prompt explaining what you want the emoji to look like, wait for it to be generated, and pick from the provided options. While it&apos;s not <em>exactly</em> like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-gboard-emoji-mashups-and-how-create-your-own">Google&apos;s Emoji Kitchen</a>, the premise of Genmoji is definitely the same.</p>

<p>Both Android and iOS have offered ways to natively store your passwords, but weren&apos;t available as true competitors to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-password-managers-android">best password managers</a>. Google began changing that in 2022 with the ability to add a shortcut to your home screen.</p><p>iOS 18 is doing something similar, as there&apos;s finally a dedicated Passwords app across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and even Windows. Coming as little surprise, there was no mention of an Android version of the app being released.</p>

This aims to help improve the gaming experience by reducing the amount of potential interference caused by apps in the background.</p><p>After making its debut with macOS Sonoma in 2023, Game Mode is coming to the iPhone and iPad. It hopes to ensure the smoothest gaming experience possible, without needing to worry about a different app hogging up all of the resources. Additionally, Apple claims Game Mode "dramatically reduces audio latency with AirPods, and makes wireless game controllers incrediblyÂ responsive."</p>
<h2 id="quot-tap-to-cash-quot-2">"Tap to Cash"</h2>

<p>This one was pretty funny to me, as Apple is bringing "Tap to Cash" to the iPhone. What makes this funny is that you&apos;ll no longer be able to do this on your Android phone via GPay. The "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-changes-june-shutdown-announced">GPay</a>" app has been deprecated in the U.S. in favor of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> app, which does not offer peer-to-peer transactions.</p>

<h2 id="ios-18-is-the-biggest-update-in-years-2">iOS 18 is the biggest update in years</h2>
<p>I&apos;m sure there are things that I missed, but it appears as though iOS 18 is morphing into an Android skin. Even if you ignore everything in regard to Apple Intelligence, there are so many changes and additions coming that it&apos;s enough to make your head spin. Whether you love it, hate it, or don&apos;t care, there&apos;s little denying that iOS 18 should be a massive step in the right direction for iPhone owners.</p>

<ul><li>Google rolled out the highly-anticipated Find My Device network for the Android ecosystem in April 2024.</li><li>Now, the first wave of Find My Device-supported item trackers is starting to hit the hands of reviewers and buyers.</li><li>Early reports indicate Find My Device is less reliable than Apple's Find My network, and Google's extensive opt-out options may be the reason why.Â </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> have plenty of advantages over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhones</a>, and there aren&apos;t a ton of iOS features that truly make Android users jealous. With that in mind, Apple&apos;s Find My network is certainly something that Android users were a bit envious of â and if they weren&apos;t, they should&apos;ve been. The network uses over a billion active devices and works with $29 item trackers (AirTags) to make finding your tech and other items painless. Apple goes as far as to say that your phone can&apos;t go a single city block without updating its location in Find My.Â </p><p>Google finally came up with a real answer to Apple&apos;s Find My network with Find My Device. It&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">a crowdsourcing network for Android</a> that works similarly to Find My. In fact, Google makes the same claim that Find My Device includes over a billion active devices. The network just rolled out in April and became more widely available in May. Now, the first wave of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/pebblebee-announces-google-find-my-device-compatible-trackers">Find My Device-capable item trackers</a> is shipping.Â </p><p>But the experience of using Find My Device so far hasn&apos;t been the one Google billed. Some reviewers have already pointed out that Samsung phones might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/09/android-find-my-device-network-rollout-problems/" target="_blank">automatically hibernate the Find My Device app</a> , and that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pebblebee-tag-android-review/" target="_blank">Find My Device won&apos;t find your items</a> in every case. There are a lot of reasons this may be the case, but I suspect it is because Google is making it too easy for users to opt out of participating in Find My Device at all.Â </p><p>It&apos;s rare that we would ever criticize a company for being <em>too</em> protective of user privacy, but that may be the case here. Google&apos;s choice of language and default setting options make it seem like using Find My Device to the full extent could compromise your safety. Reality is much simpler: you help me find my lost items, and I&apos;ll help you find yours. Crowdsourcing only works if people buy-in, and so far, it doesn&apos;t seem like people are buying into Find My Device.Â </p>
<h2 id="why-the-find-my-device-network-isn-apos-t-working-as-well-as-find-my-2">Why the Find My Device network isn&apos;t working as well as Find My</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ahfn5hKtPxgHXMwPvAB6mR" name="find-device-3.jpg" alt="Find My Device list of devices against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ahfn5hKtPxgHXMwPvAB6mR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are some availability issues with the Find My Device network, and they may play a role in the network not being as robust as Google originally claimed. Despite the Find My Device network <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">rolling out widely last month</a>, it&apos;s still not showing up for everyone. This could be a small part of why Find My Device has come with mixed results in the early going, but there are bigger factors as to why this is the case.Â </p><p>According to Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14796936?sjid=4241641955613578632-NC" target="_blank">official support page</a>, there are four options for your participation in the Find My Device network, including opting out of it altogether. Before we even break down each one, that&apos;s probably too many choices. When faced with more than a couple of settings toggles, casual users are likely to just switch a feature off instead of sifting through the complicated explanations for each one.Â </p><p>The other problem is that the default Find My Device setting is <strong>With network in high-traffic areas only</strong>. So, most Find My Device users are only participating in the network in places like airports or busy city streets. In other words, the majority of Android users aren&apos;t contributing to Find My Device in many places.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="t8sWjiJCHqgnHTnPQahecR" name="find-device-2.jpg" alt="Find My Device home page log in to Google account against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t8sWjiJCHqgnHTnPQahecR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The setting that will really help the crowdsourcing effort is <strong>With network in all areas</strong>. There are also <strong>Without Network </strong>and <strong>Off </strong>options. However, all the settings I&apos;ve listed are found under the <strong>Find your offline devices</strong> page, and are not covered by the <strong>Use Find My Device</strong> toggle. That&apos;s because you can still use Find My Device to locate and erase your devices without contributing to the crowdsourced network in some cases. This feels like a big miss because users aren&apos;t incentivized to go all-in on Find My Device.Â </p><p>If there were a real privacy concern associated with Find My Device, I would be all for the expansive customization options, including opt-in and opt-out features. But there isn&apos;t one, as Google explains: "Device locations are encrypted and private from Google. Only you and those you share your devices within Find My Device will be able to see their locations."</p><p>The bigger concern with personal item tracking is people using trackers to stalk or harm people, which Google&apos;s Find My Device crowdsourcing settings don&apos;t cover. There is a separate suite of unwanted tracker detection features offered by Apple and Google to try and quell those concerns. Instead, the Find My Device privacy settings are intended to avoid the unlikely (and nearly impossible) event that your phone contributing to the network compromises your location.Â </p><p>This doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense because there is no way for a user to know which Android device contributed to the crowdsourcing effort that provided them with the location of their own device. Even in low-density areas, who knows which person, house, or car updated a device&apos;s location in Find My Device.Â </p>

<p>This hasn&apos;t been an issue with Apple&apos;s Find My device network, and that&apos;s because Apple didn&apos;t overcomplicate things. If you turn on Find My, you get access to all the remote access and finding features, and contribute to the crowdsource network in exchange. If you turn it off, your devices won&apos;t contribute to Find My, and you&apos;ll lose the benefits of Find My as a result. It&apos;s simple.</p><p>I fear that in trying to appear privacy-conscious, Google is limiting the effectiveness of the Find My Device network. The overcomplicated settings page may make it seem like there&apos;s a reason to be wary of contributing. Plus, the default setting will only make the network useful in high-density areas. There are a lot of people that live in or near U.S. cities, but there are also many who don&apos;t. Â </p><p>Sometimes too much choice is a bad thing, and that could be the case with Find My Device. It should be simple. Contribute to the Find My Device network and get the benefits, or opt out and don&apos;t.Â </p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch FE is turning out to be another interesting product in the Samsung products portfolio, which has been in the news lately. While it has been rumored to launch alongside the upcoming Galaxy foldables, new info suggests that the release might be sooner.</p><p>According to reliable tipster ArsÃ¨ne Lupin on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-fe-release-date-price-leaks/">SamMobile</a>), the Galaxy Watch FE is heading for a June 24 launch right before the anticipated<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor"> July Unpacked event</a> where we will be witnessing the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and the Z Flip 6, next to the Galaxy Watch 7 series.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Watch FE will release June 24th<a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryLupin/status/1799064847210119471">June 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Meanwhile, another Amazon Italy listing spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-pricing-leaked-via-amazon/">YTECHB</a> has revealed the smartwatchâs pricing, which is set at â¬199 (~$215).Â  The pricing affirms that it falls under the cheaper smartwatch segment or an entry-level Galaxy Watch, as the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> will likely be priced at $299, considering the predecessor Galaxy Watch 6âs launch last year.</p><p>Interestingly, in the U.S., the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> is available at $239 on Samsung&apos;s website, and the upcoming Watch FE is likely to be priced at around $200. It will be interesting to see what customers might lean into, considering that Watch 6 will have more features than the upcoming Fan Edition since it will be a toned version of the former.</p>
