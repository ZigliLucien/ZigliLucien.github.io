<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>OPPO is teasing its upcoming Find X8 phones, revealing that they’ll feature AI-powered reflection removal for photos.</li><li>Product manager Zhou Yibao showcased this feature using a cultural artifact from the Chengdu Museum, where the original photo had a distracting reflection.</li><li>Once the AI tech was applied, the reflection disappeared, leaving a stunning, clear image.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OPPO has been drip-feeding hints about its upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>, and now a company executive reveals that the devices can get rid of annoying reflections in your photos.</p><p>OPPO&apos;s Find series product manager, Zhou Yibao, shared on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/OzPyD5dOI" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that the Find X8 series will feature reflection removal for your photos, and unsurprisingly, it&apos;s all powered by AI (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_find_x8_series_will_remove_reflections_from_your_pictures-news-64783.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>In a demo, Zhou highlighted a cultural artifact from the Chengdu Museum in China. While the original photo looked great, it had a noticeable reflection on the artifact&apos;s surface that distracted from its beauty.</p><p>But once the AI imaging feature was applied, the reflection vanished, leaving behind a clean, crystal-clear image.</p><p>To further show off how well this new feature works, Zhou asked his social media followers to post pictures with reflections. He then demonstrated how the device effortlessly gets rid of those pesky elements, as you can see in the visuals he shared.</p>

<p>Zhou explained that this feature is made for those moments when reflections and glare mess up your photos. Think of times like capturing an aerial view through a plane window or pretty views while riding a train.</p><p>Although reflection removal tech isn’t brand new, it started getting noticed when Huawei showcased it back in 2020. It wasn’t until Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-object-eraser-can-now-automatically-erase-shadows-and-reflections">added this feature to its S22 series</a>, though, that it really took off and caught everyone’s attention.</p><p>Still, it’s a fantastic addition to the Find X8 series, letting you nail that perfect shot through airplane windows or office glass.</p><p>Now that OPPO is embracing a reflection removal feature, you can bet other Chinese smartphone brands will hop on the train and add it to their lineups, too.</p><p>On top of that, the Find X8 series is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-and-x8-pro-specs-leak">gearing up for some impressive hardware upgrades</a>, featuring a 10x periscope camera that outdoes the 6x zoom from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>. Plus, the rear camera module is expected to have a unique square design with rounded edges.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube detailed what's coming up for Shorts, beginning with an option to record three-minute-long videos.</li><li>Shorts will soon display a "template" icon, so creators can quickly hop on the latest trends with their unique touch.</li><li>Other Shorts updates include customization for the Home feed, community engagement, and Veo's AI assistance for "later this year."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>October is looking like the month for Shorts as YouTube details what&apos;s coming up for its short-form content.</p><p>YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/tall-updates-coming-to-shorts/">highlighted several updates</a> arriving for Shorts later this month, beginning with longer videos. Starting on October 15, content creators can craft Shorts up to 3 minutes long. This longer duration for Shorts pertains to videos that feature a square "or taller" aspect ratio.</p><p>It&apos;s worth remembering that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-takes-aim-at-tiktok-with-these-new-reels-features">Instagram&apos;s Reels</a> can reach a maximum of 90 seconds (a minute and a half), so YouTube will have that beat by 30 seconds. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/camera-tools#:~:text=Videos%20you%20record%20in%20TikTok%20can%20be%20up%20to%2010%20minutes%20long.">TikTok lets its users</a> record 10-minute-long videos in the app<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>YouTube&apos;s Shorts update also includes new templates. The post states users can find templates after tapping "Remix" on a Short they enjoy. "Use this template" will let you take a trend or a sound clip and use that in your creation.</p><p>Speaking of following trends, YouTube teases that there&apos;s more in store for "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-remix-music-video-rollout">Remix</a>" regarding videos and music videos from the platform. "In the coming months," the post states creators can pull "multiple clips" from a variety of sources across YouTube and plug them into a single Short.</p><p>Customization is preparing to hit YouTube&apos;s primary home feed on mobile. Shorts are everywhere, and often in these two-by-two boxes. The platform states it will introduce a "Show fewer Shorts" option inside the three-dot menu of a Shorts suggestion box.</p><p>Be advised: YouTube states it will show fewer Shorts "temporarily" on your Home feed if you hit that option.</p><p>The company is also looking to drive more engagement between communities and the activities that trend via Shorts. According to the post, pausing a Short will display a new option in the top row called "Trends." This opens a dedicated Shorts Trending page, where users can find what&apos;s new and catching viewers&apos; attention.</p><p>Additionally, Google is adding a comment section preview in the Shorts feed, showing how others feel about a Short without having to open the section.</p>

<p>Today&apos;s post reiterated an announcement during September&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/made-by-youtube-2024-ai-hype-updates">Made by YouTube event</a> involving Google&apos;s AI model Veo. The AI software is a video-generation model featuring an "advanced understanding of natural language and visual semantics." YouTube stated Veo&apos;s inclusion on the platform would come to the benefit of Shorts.</p><p>Now, the company states Veo will arrive "later this year" with its AI generation tools. Such options will let users create backgrounds and produce unique concepts that might&apos;ve been far too difficult without Veo&apos;s assistance. However, it&apos;s worth noting that any usage of Veo will result in a "generated with AI" content label on your Short.</p>

<p>Smart rings are all the rage these days as more and more companies step into the ring (so to speak) with their own takes on the wearable tech. For some time, Oura was the only big player with its well-received Oura Ring Gen 3, but other smaller companies have since created their own models that have caught our attention. We even got a major player to join the fray, with the Galaxy Ring making a splash in 2024.</p><p>A smart ring can be used as a standalone health monitoring wearable, meant to track your heart rate, blood oxygen, sleep, body temperature, and even some exercises. They can be used on their own or in tandem with a smartwatch; although your mileage may vary as you may end up with duplicate data, smart rings are meant to be a low-maintenance and distraction-free way to keep track of your health. There&apos;s no screen, and everything is tracked passively in the background, with minimal interaction with the actual ring.</p><p>So, which smart ring is right for you? We&apos;ve reviewed a number of smart rings already, which you can check out for yourself in this guide, but we&apos;ll also include some honorable mentions that we haven&apos;t tested yet.</p><p>And with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">October Prime Day sales event</a> right around the corner, we&apos;ll be on the lookout for best smart ring deals so you can save a few bucks.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring (Gen 3)</a> has been available for a few years now, but it is undeniably still the king of the smart ring. After a fairly rough start, with the ring still missing many promised features, Oura has been on a roll, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-resilience-metric-tracks-stress-recovery">adding new features every year</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-natural-cycles-partnership">partnering with other companies</a> to bring more capabilities to the ring.</p><p>Sleep tracking is one of its strong points, which is great since some people prefer not to wear smartwatches to sleep. Thanks to its snug fit on your finger, the Oura Ring is great at tracking sleep, determining what stages you&apos;re in throughout the night, and logging any detected movements. Sleep tracking is quite detailed, and while there&apos;s no sleep apnea detection, it provides enough information to help users self-diagnose.</p><p>Beyond sleep tracking, the Oura Ring can automatically detect certain activities, such as running, gardening, and even dancing. Yes, dancing. In the years that I&apos;ve used the ring, I&apos;m always surprised to see it ping my phone after a party, asking if I had been dancing at a certain time. Thanks to its accelerometer, it can be surprisingly intuitive, although it&apos;s not perfect.</p><p>The Oura Ring monitors your temperature, which can help detect illnesses or even track menstrual cycles. All this information adds to your Readiness score, which will help you determine how ready you are for the day and what you can do to improve your daily readiness. The best part is that Oura syncs with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> and apps like Strava. Plus, it lasts a full week on a single charge, meaning you rarely have to remember to charge it.</p><p>Unfortunately, to get the most out of the Oura Ring experience, you&apos;ll have to subscribe to a membership. It only costs about $6 a month, but it&apos;s still an extra financial burden you&apos;ll have to take into account.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring (Gen 3) review</a></p>

<p>RingConn is a relatively unknown company, but its products are surprisingly solid. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Gen 2</a> launched in 2024, and while it&apos;s mostly similar to its predecessor, it comes with some welcome additions that make it a great option if you&apos;re looking for a smart ring that doesn&apos;t come with a subscription.</p><p>Where most smart rings go for a circular design, the RingConn Gen 2 has a squircle shape, which looks rather fresh. And even with how glossy the silver model I tested is, the finish doesn&apos;t scratch or scuff nearly as easily as the Oura Ring, which is a plus for people who like to work out or perform other activities with their ring on.</p><p>Another thing the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring has going for itself is battery life. Lasting as long as 12 days, you can go nearly two weeks without worrying about charging it, and when you do, you can use the charging case that you can also carry around (although it&apos;s too big for most pockets).</p><p>The app experience is pretty intuitive, providing easy-to-read visual representations of your daily progress compared to the day before, as well as your various health metrics. You&apos;ll also enjoy the timeline feature that logs various events that you can easily track. The ring can track certain workouts, but it doesn&apos;t do it automatically, and the options are limited.</p><p>Sleep tracking is one of the ring&apos;s strong points, as it is capable of sleep apnea monitoring, which should help users who worry that they might suffer from the condition or help those that do keep track of any improvements. Unfortunately, this drains the battery quite a bit.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring review</a></p>

<p>Amazfit makes some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> on the market, so it only made sense for the company to launch its own smart ring. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Amazfit Helio Ring</a> is a decent first effort, and while it falls short on some features, the company makes up for it with a good design and some compelling health and fitness features. Plus, it looks like the Amazfit is welcoming feedback and making changes accordingly, which is a very good sign.</p><p>The Helio Ring features a very sturdy design, which, in my use, felt like the most durable option out of the smart rings I&apos;ve tested. While there&apos;s only one finish, the brushed metal actually fares well when wearing the ring during workouts, which is more than I can say for the Oura Ring.</p><p>While Amazfit says there&apos;s no automatic workout detection, the ring does passively log certain activity types in the calorie section of the app, which I find interesting. It tells me if I was on a "light walk" or doing a "light activity," or if I was walking faster than usual, it would say as much. However, these aren&apos;t logged as workouts like the app would do with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch">Amazfit smartwatch</a>.</p><p>Speaking of, the Helio Ring is best used with an Amazfit smartwatch. This is because the ring can&apos;t log many workout types on its own, so the Amazfit app uses AI to merge data from both the ring and watch to give you a comprehensive view of your day. You can also choose to <em>only</em> collect heart rate data from the ring if you prefer.</p><p>The downside is that you would need to purchase a separate device to take advantage of these features. Additionally, the Amazfit Helio Ring has the shortest battery life of smart rings we&apos;ve tested at just four days. Still, since reviewing the Helio Ring, Amazfit has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-gets-permanent-price-drop-and-free-subscriptions">dropped the price of the ring</a>, added a new size (bringing it to three), and got rid of its subscriptions, meaning you can take advantage of all its features for free.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Amazfit Helio Ring</a></p>

<p>Smartwatches aren&apos;t the most comfortable when it comes to sleep tracking, which is where smart rings like the Ultrahuman Ring Air come in. This smart ring has a comfortable design that makes it easy to wear all day and night, ensuring you can get the full range of your health metrics when you&apos;re awake or asleep.</p><p>When it comes to sleep tracking, the Ultrahuman Ring Air not only provides insights into your sleep stages throughout the night, but it also tells you how well you slept based on factors like your body temperature, restfulness, efficiency, and more. The ring will even track your "Tosses and Turns," which can also provide insights into your sleep quality and the impact that stress or other factors may have.</p><p>The ring also takes how much you&apos;ve slept into account with a Sleep Debt feature. This establishes a baseline for you based on your patterns and calculates the difference between this and the amount of sleep you&apos;ve actually received. This is a good way to know if you&apos;ve fallen behind and need to take time to catch up on your sleep by getting in a nap.</p><p>In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air review</a>, Android Central senior editor Michael Hicks says the ring provided him with actionable data for a concerning metric that he would have otherwise ignored since he does not like wearing smartwatches to bed. To him, this makes the ring worth the initial high price.</p><p>Aside from sleep tracking, the Ultrahuman Ring Air also comes with up to six days of battery life, which is pretty respectable, and some workout tracking. It will also be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-adds-afib-new-app-store-of-powerplugs">first smart ring with AFib detection</a>, which is a big deal. However, Hicks says that you may become annoyed with the flurry of notifications, and the step tracking is fairly unreliable. The ring is also pricey, but at least there&apos;s no subscription.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air review</a></p>

<p>Samsung is probably the biggest name to enter the smart ring game, and while the Galaxy Ring is far from perfect, it has the benefit of being part of the Galaxy ecosystem. As such, the ring connects to Samsung Health and utilizes Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> to provide insights into your health via a sleep score and readiness score.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring has automatic workout detection, something you don&apos;t find on too many smart rings, although it&apos;s pretty limited. You also have get a sleep score based on your sleep quality, and when combined with your other activities and metrics, the Samsung Health app will provide you a Wellness Score. The app uses Galaxy AI to analyze your metrics and suggest ways you can improve them. However, the ring goes beyond just health tracking.</p><p>Samsung is the only major smartphone manufacturer to have a smart ring, so it makes sense for the company to figure out a clever way to make the most out of this. That&apos;s where gestures come in, which allow you to control certain functions on your phone by performing certain movements with your finger. So, by just pinching your designated ring finger with your thumb twice, you can utilize remote capture functions with the camera. You can also snooze alarms without touching your phone.</p><p>In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring review</a>, Android Central senior editor Nick Sutrich notes that these are cool features, but they only work for very specific circumstances and are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-samsung-galaxy-ring-features-are-exclusive-to-samsung-phones">limited to Samsung phones</a>.

It gets up to seven days of battery life and comes with a charging case you can carry around. It also comes in various sizes and a few different finishes, so you&apos;ll likely find one that fits (literally) your style.</p><p>The RingConn Smart Ring uses the same companion app as the second-gen model, which is great because the app is quite informative and makes it easy to see your daily metrics or compare them to the previous day. You also get "medals" based on certain activities or milestones that you hit, which is pretty motivational.</p><p>While most smart rings start at $299, the RingConn Smart Ring is available for $279, which is kind of a steal when you consider there&apos;s no subscription involved, meaning you&apos;ll have access to all the available features.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ring lacks certain features I&apos;d love to see, such as automatic workout detection and support for Health Connect (although Google Fit is supported). The available workout modes are also fairly limited, but the ring supports major ones like running, cycling, and the treadmill.</p><p>If you won&apos;t want to spring for the more expensive Gen 2 Smart Ring, the first-gen is worth the spend.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-smart-ring-review">RingConn Smart Ring review</a></p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Feel the vibrations</strong></em></p><p>Most smart rings don't feature haptics of any kind, but the Circular Ring Slim can vibrate with alarms, timers, and even guided breathing. But that's not all, because this ring also has a "button" that can do things like snooze alarms. And of course, the ring can also monitor your health metrics and last five days on a single charge.</p></p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h2>
<p>So with the growing number of smart rings out there, how do you know which one is right for you?</p><p>First, you should know what kinds of features you&apos;re looking for. Most smart rings come with the basics, such as heart rate tracking, blood oxygen, sleep monitoring, and temperature sensing. However, you have to look at the extra health tracking features these rings offer and how the data is being used. For example, the Oura Ring and Evie Ring use metrics such as temperature sensing to help track menstrual cycles, which could be beneficial to those who experience periods.</p><p>If you want to use the ring to track workout data and aid with recovery, you&apos;ll want a ring that is not only well-built with good water resistance but also features automatic tracking, meaning you&apos;re spending less time looking at your phone. The Oura Ring, Galaxy Ring, and Amazfit Helio Ring all feature this to some extent (and at differing levels).</p><p>Price is a big factor when choosing a smart ring. They cost roughly as much as a smartwatch but can be priced even higher. Sometimes, the upfront cost can seem unwieldy, but in most cases, that&apos;s the only price you&apos;ll pay. In other cases, like with Oura, you&apos;ll also have to consider the monthly subscription cost, which is admittedly fairly low at $6 per month, but it&apos;s still something to consider.</p><p>Lastly, you may want to consider if you want to buy a smart ring to replace or supplement your smartwatch. Smart rings come with a lot of health tracking features, but their functionality is somewhat limited compared to a smartwatch. On the other hand, they&apos;re much less distracting and good at capturing the main metrics, including heart rate and sleep. Some rings, like the Galaxy Ring and Helio Ring, will merge data from smartwatches of the same brand, which helps give you a better overview of your health. Some rings, like the Oura Ring, can also sync with Health Connect or Apple Health, which is also helpful in this regard.</p>

<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Why you can trust Android Central</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">☑️ One of the <strong>oldest and most trusted</strong> Android sites on the web<br>☑️ Over <strong>15 years</strong> of product testing<br>☑️ <strong>Thousands </strong>of products reviewed and tested since 2007<br>☑️ <strong>Dozens</strong> of wearables<strong> </strong>tested every year by our team</p></div></div>
<p>Smart rings are relatively new to the scene, but we have started reviewing them in 2021. Like all other products we test, from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> to smartwatches, we typically spend a couple of weeks with the devices before we give our final thoughts on it. Sometimes, we&apos;ll publish an initial review with early impressions up to a week after we receive a product, then test it for an additional few weeks before publishing the full review. This way, you can be sure you&apos;re getting our full experience with a product.</p><p>We will wear the ring and go about our normal routines, for the most part. That includes exercising or running errands so that the ring can capture as much data throughout the day and night. We may also test multiple rings at the same time if we want to compare how they capture metrics such as step counts (using a manual step counter), heart rate (starting and stopping workouts at the same time), and more.</p><p>Testing a smart ring for a couple of weeks at a time also ensures that we can evaluate the battery life and charging speed, as these devices often last for up to a week or more on a single charge.</p><p>No product is perfect, and we remain honest in all of our reviews. A product may get a high rating but may not be perfect for everyone, or it may get a low score but still have some redeeming qualities that some potential buyers may like. We try to keep this in mind when reviewing smart rings, and this is reflected in our reviews.</p>

<h2 id="of-charging-speeds-ports-and-cables-how-to-pick-the-best-phone-charger-2">Of charging speeds, ports, and cables: How to pick the best phone charger</h2>
<p>There are a lot of features and priorities to try and juggle when picking the fastest phone charger, but here&apos;s the easiest way to narrow down your search quickly: How many devices do you <strong>need</strong> to charge at one time? If you only need something to plug your phone into the wall, grab the Anker 511 Nano 3 or Samsung 45W USB-C Fast Charger and get on with your day. Both are super-small and durable, and they should last you through at least two phones, so long as you don&apos;t yeet &apos;em out a window or step on one accidentally. Anker has color choices and foldable prongs, while Samsung throws in a cable, so both are winners.</p><p>But what about if you consistently need to charge your phone and laptop? What if you need to charge your phone and your smartwatch? Are there any music addicts like me who need to recharge their earbuds every night? That&apos;s where a great charger with two or more ports changes the game. The four-port 120W charger from Spigen and any of UGREEN&apos;s multi-ported Nexode chargers are good options with plenty of ports and power to charge a laptop, phone, tablet, and Bluetooth speaker simultaneously.</p><p>Don&apos;t buy an overpowered charger unless you have devices that support that charging speed. For example, a 65W USB-C charger is wasted on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, because it only supports a top speed of 45W. Of course, the same doesn&apos;t apply if you plan on using the same charger to top up your laptop and phone. All laptops and Chromebooks that charge via USB-C require at least 65W chargers or higher.</p><p>Next, make sure you check your phone&apos;s charging profile and match it with the charger you buy. Luckily, brands like Anker, UGREEN, and Baseus always add support for Apple, Samsung, and Google&apos;s fast-charging profiles. If you don&apos;t ensure this, your phone might not get the max possible charging speed even if the wattage on the charger, the cable, and your phone match.</p><p>And speaking of cables, not all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cables</a> are created equal. Be sure to grab a 5A or higher USB-C cable for chargers over 60W. Likewise, you need 100W USB-C cables for 100W chargers. Without the right cable, you might not be able to tap into your phone or laptop&apos;s maximum possible wired charging speed.</p>
<h2 id="invest-in-a-powerful-usb-c-power-bank-2">Invest in a powerful USB-C power bank</h2>
<p>While expanding your charging collection, consider that a wall charger can&apos;t do you any good if there&apos;s nowhere to plug in while you&apos;re walking around a theme park or stuck in economy on a cross-country flight. Instead, a good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-portable-power-packs" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-portable-power-packs">power bank</a> is the perfect companion to your new wall charger, and reliable USB-C power banks have never been more affordable. They&apos;re a great way to top up any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>!</p><p>In my travel backpack, I always bring along a wall charger with multiple ports (both USB-C and USB-A) and several charging banks. Don&apos;t forget: you&apos;ll need a port on that handy wall charger to power up the charging bank, too! The bottom line is to invest sufficiently in the fastest phone charger money to buy to get the most use out of it.</p>

<ul><li>Spotify detailed the launch of "Offline Backup," a feature that piggybacks off the stored cache data of your music to operate.</li><li>Offline Backup is a playlist on your "Home" tab that collects your music data from your recently played to give you tunes if your signal drops.</li><li>This update is rolling out on Android and iOS and joins Spotify's recent AI Playlist.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Spotify&apos;s rolling out a feature for mobile users that should make that loss of service a little more bearable.</p><p>Hitting the town often comes with the risk of losing cell service, which is what Spotify aims to solve in today&apos;s update. As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-10-03/offline-backup-keeps-the-music-going-when-your-connection-goes-missing/">Newsroom post</a>, mobile users are beginning to receive "Offline Backup," a feature that compiles your music into a playlist ready to go without cell service. Spotify states this feature will appear on the "Home" tab whenever you&apos;ve gone offline.</p><p>Tapping it expands into a playlist; however, there&apos;s a caveat. For Offline Backup&apos;s functionality, users must have recently played "more than five songs" <em>and </em>have the feature enabled. The playlist can be added to "Your Library."</p><p>The Offline Backup playlist can be organized and filtered. The post states users can sort tunes based on artist, mood, and genre.</p><p>Spotify states that it keeps your recently played songs within a cache on your device if you&apos;re listening regularly. Offline Backup is pulling music from that stored data to remove the necessity of relying on a stable connection to grab the music.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1073px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.92%;"><img id="fNd7LmQkKaKnqFtoPjygek" name="spotify-offline-backup-rollout.jpg" alt="Spotify rolls out "Offline Backup" for continuous tunes when your signal is gone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fNd7LmQkKaKnqFtoPjygek.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1073" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>More importantly, Offline Backup shouldn&apos;t appear "dated" or out of touch with your habits. Spotify adds that (if enabled) it will continue to dip into what you&apos;ve heard recently and refresh the offline playlist.</p><p>Spotify&apos;s Offline Backup playlist is rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-06-21/more-choice-for-us-subscribers/">to Premium users</a> today (Oct 3). Users on Android and iOS should see it "this week" alongside Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.</p><p>This is the second update to hit Spotify in the past couple of weeks. At the end of September, the company introduced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotifys-ai-playlist-is-now-spinning-tunes-in-more-regions">AI Playlist</a> to more regions. U.S., Canadian, and New Zealand users can find a curated collection of songs that may pique their interest. Tapping the "+" icon on mobile will produce a drop-down menu with AI Playlist listed.</p><p>Users can give the streaming service&apos;s AI a prompt and it&apos;ll try and compile an ideal playlist to fit your needs. Spotify encourages users to be as descriptive as possible to aid the AI. Users can toss in details like a specific genre, decade, mood, favorite artist, and more to create a unique, personal playlist.</p>

Just a few days before Amazon&apos;s October Prime Day (aka Big Deal Days) is set to kick off, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-razr-2023-256gb-unlocked-infinite-black/6544832.p"><strong>Best Buy is slashing a whopping 40% off the Motorola Razr Plus (2023)</strong></a>, a foldable phone that we considered nearly perfect when it was first unveiled last year. </p><p>That price reduction is applied automatically when you buy the phone unlocked, but <strong>your discount will increase to 50%</strong> if you activate the phone on Best Buy&apos;s website. It&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-motorola-deals-have-come-early-score-40-off-foldable-phones-epic-flagship-discounts-and-more">best Prime Day Motorola deals</a> I&apos;ve seen so far, and the sale event hasn&apos;t even started yet (nor is this an Amazon discount, for that matter).  </p>

<p>Despite being a last-gen foldable, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Motorola Razr Plus (2023) still impresses</a>, thanks to its powerful Snapdragon chipset, durable teardrop hinge, and vibrant cover display that lets you use important apps and features while the phone is closed. It may not have the best battery life and the cameras are nothing to write home about, but with a discount of up to 50% up for grabs, it's a pretty unbeatable opportunity. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-razr-2023-256gb-unlocked-infinite-black/6544832.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="447e72d4-b4e0-4b27-8c34-534d49652041" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Motorola Razr Plus (2023) 256GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Motorola Razr Plus (2023) 256GB: $999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a great foldable phone experience but you don&apos;t want to drop a bunch of cash; you take a lot of selfies or you simply enjoy a stylish phone. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need incredible cameras or loads of battery life; you can afford the newer Razr Plus (2024).</p><p>Obviously, if you can afford it, you&apos;ll have an better overall experience by going with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus (2024)</a>. The upgrades are considerable with the new model, but you&apos;ll probably end up paying around $300 more, so it&apos;s up to you whether or not the 2024 model is worth it.</p><p>For me, I&apos;m happy to lose some fancy AI features and battery life if it means I can save some cash ahead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">Big Deal Days</a> — and it&apos;s not like the Razr Plus (2023) is a serious downgrade. I&apos;m still getting the efficiency of the Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chipset with consistent bi-monthly security updates, and the vegan leather finish gives the phone a premium look and feel. For my wireless needs, that&apos;s more than enough. </p>

<ul><li>Samsung confirmed that the One UI 7 beta, based on Android 15, will drop before the year ends, with the official launch set for 2025 alongside the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>One UI 7 promises to be a fresh redesign for the interface on phones and tablets.</li><li>The upcoming update focuses on three main ideas: simplicity, a unique One UI vibe, and new UI elements that bring positive feelings.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>At Samsung’s Developer Conference, the company revealed that the One UI 7 beta update based on Android 15 is set to drop before the year ends and will officially launch in 2025 with its next flagship lineup.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s timeline for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> update has seen a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-has-allegedly-put-the-brakes-on-the-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">ups and downs over the past few months</a>. Everyone thought the One UI 7 beta would arrive early, but those hopes were dashed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dreary-one-ui-7-beta-forum-update">when the company hit some delays</a>.</p><p>Samsung today officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-celebrates-10-years-of-sdc-and-spotlights-ai-based-innovation-at-sdc24" target="_blank">announced</a> a major delay for the One UI 7 update. The South Korean tech giant hasn&apos;t shared the exact reasons behind it, but it has given developers a new timeline to work with.</p><p>While the updated timeline isn’t exactly shocking, it would really throw off Samsung&apos;s usual pace, considering it kicked off the One UI 6 beta program in August last year, well ahead of the annual Developer Conference.</p><p>One UI 7 is expected to be a huge and fresh redesign for the One UI interface on phones and tablets. Samsung has shared a sneak peek at the exciting features of its next major OS iteration.</p><p>The next One UI version is focused on three main ideas: keeping the user interface simple, creating a unique One UI vibe, and introducing new UI elements that aim to give users a positive emotional kick.</p><p>Sally Hyesoon Jeong, Samsung Electronics&apos; executive VP and head of the framework research and development team, gave a quick rundown of the upcoming update at the company’s conference on Thursday.</p><p>Although Jeong skipped the nitty-gritty details or any visuals, she shared Samsung’s big vision for One UI 7. The update is all about figuring out what users need and simplifying things. Samsung also fine-tuned motion dynamics and introduced a new blur system, which you can see in the revamped home screen grid.</p><p>Samsung’s One UI upgrades aren’t just for the shiny new toys; they actually improve the experience for all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a>. Usually, the firm debuts new features on its flagship models first before sharing the love with older devices—like it did with the recent One UI 6.1.1 update.</p>

<ul><li>Google details a few updates for users, beginning with a more "organized" Search experience on mobile and increased ads in AI Overviews.</li><li>Google Lens is starting a test that lets user record videos in the app and speak their questions aloud for in-depth query results.</li><li>The company is also bringing Circle to Search's music lookup button to even more Android devices following its September debut.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s finishing the week with a few "significant" updates to its Search experience — including Lens.</p><p>The U.S. is set to witness Google Search&apos;s new form, courtesy of the company&apos;s continuation of AI assistance. Google highlighted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-lens-october-2024-updates/">a blog post</a> that mobile users will notice new "organized" Search results "with AI." The company attributes this rollout to a recent wave of feedback from users finding them useful. This update will add a "full-page" experience to Search packed with information from websites (articles), forums, and more.</p><p>It appears that Google&apos;s organization might display results in order based on relevancy or importance. When searching for a recipe, these organized results with AI will display "top recipes" before diving into potential sides, ingredient information, and other relevant results.</p><p>This update is set to roll out "this week," meaning you may notice it by the weekend if not by next week.</p><p>Google adds that "following positive feedback," your Search results will see an uptick in ads. The increase in advertisements concerns Search&apos;s AI Overviews in the U.S. "for relevant queries." The company states it hopes these ads can help users find products and brands that the AI model deemed "helpful" to their search.</p><p>We were warned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-ads-announced">about increased ads</a> coming to AI Overivews in May.</p>

<p>Google Lens is the next stop for the latest string of updates — and there are a few, beginning with recording capabilities. Previewed during I/O 2024, Google teased that Lens would soon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">let users record a video</a> as the backbone of a query. The post states users can open Lens and <strong>hold the shutter button </strong>to begin taking a video. Additionally, users can speak their questions aloud while recording.</p><p>After processing, Google <em>should </em>return an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overview-save-feature-expansion">AI Overview</a> with relevant information concerning the video and your vocalized question. Those enrolled in the SGE (Search Labs) "AI Overviews and more" test on Android and iOS will begin seeing recording in Lens "globally" today (Oct 3). For now, the test supports English queries.</p><p>Lens is also extending its voice capabilities to photos. After snapping a photo, users can hold the shutter button to voice their questions. The result will be similar to what was explained for capturing a video through Lens.</p><p>Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-new-search-feature-lets-you-find-objects-using-a-mix-of-text-and-images">a shopping revamp for Lens</a> in 2022, but that&apos;s getting pushed further with an improved results page. The company states taking a photo of a product (like a bag or top) will see it run through Google&apos;s Shopping Graph and AI models. This will expose users to a detailed results page, featuring product reviews, prices from multiple retailers, and where to buy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:335px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:179.10%;"><img id="piwbeun4UoaUeji8PuJTc8" name="android-circle-to-search-music-look-up-rollout.jpg" alt="Google's Circle to Search gains a music note icon for song lookup." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/piwbeun4UoaUeji8PuJTc8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="335" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, if you were missing Circle to Search&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-new-search-feature-lets-you-find-objects-using-a-mix-of-text-and-images">new music lookup</a> from September&apos;s Android update, worry no more. Google states it&apos;s expanding the availability for users to look up music on their devices through Circle to Search. The feature should be widely available following today&apos;s (Oct 3) update, but give it some time if you&apos;re not seeing it yet.</p><p>Users can use Circle to Search to discover music when watching a video on their device or from external audio sources. On your device, open the tool, and tap the music note icon beside the search bar. Circle to Search will listen in briefly before displaying its results. The AI will also provide a YouTube link to the song for easy listening and sharing.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung recently pushed a SmartThings Framework update that bricked several Galaxy S10 devices.</li><li>Users who downloaded the patch (v2.2.02.1) are caught in a terrible booting loop and some are suggesting that you factory reset the phone through Recovery Mode.</li><li>However, Samsung was aware of the problem and rolled out version 2.2.03.1 of the software to avoid more problems.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A few of Samsung&apos;s five-year-old Galaxy phones are encountering severe problems following a seemingly benign update.</p><p>Users across the globe are grappling with an issue regarding Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10 Plus Note devices following a SmartThings Framework update. As highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s10-bootloop-3487074/">Android Authority</a>, the problems have bricked users&apos; devices, throwing them into an inescapable reboot loop.</p><p>The issue started on October 2 as Samsung pushed the update early that morning. Users on the Samsung Galaxy subreddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/comments/1fueq0i/s10_standard_plus_e_boot_loop/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">created a thread</a> for reports and any potential fixes. Devices received issues almost immediately, with users on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1fummcz/multiple_galaxy_s10_and_note10_series_devices/">Android subreddit</a> stating reports flooded the forum "two hours after."</p><p>While S10 devices were the immediate victims, more reports shed light on a more extensive list of affected phones. It seems the Galaxy S10 5G, Note 10, Note 10 Plus, Note 10 5G, S10e, and the S10 Lite have received issues. An update to the thread states users with a Galaxy M51 and A90 encountered the boot loop.</p><p>Factory resetting your device is one recommended way to alleviate the problems caused by the October 2 SmartThings Framework update. However, users discovered that if your phone can&apos;t function properly (boot up), entering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-factory-reset-android-phone#:~:text=HOW%20TO%20FACTORY%20RESET%20YOUR%20PHONE%20VIA%20RECOVERY%20MODE">Recovery Mode</a> to complete this process is your only avenue.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1fummcz/multiple_galaxy_s10_and_note10_series_devices">Multiple Galaxy S10 and Note10 Series devices bootlooped after an app update.</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android">r/Android</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The good news is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/comments/1fv2qyz/samsung_koreas_initial_statement_posted_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Samsung was made aware of the problem</a>, stopped the initial patch (2.2.02.1), and rolled out one that shouldn&apos;t cause issues (<strong>2.2.03.1</strong>). While this prevents <em>additional </em>devices from getting caught in a horrendous loop, those affected are still reeling. Samsung encourages those users to "visit a Samsung Electronics Service Center for assistance."</p><p>It&apos;s unclear what more can be done at a Service Center, but it&apos;s another potential fix to avoid completely wiping your phone and data.</p><p>If you&apos;re still hesitant about downloading SmartThings Framework version 2.2.03.1, users on Reddit state you can disable auto-updates. Enter <strong>Settings > Apps > Galaxy Store > Galaxy Store Settings > Auto Update > Never</strong>. This would give you time to feel the situation out and see if anything more crops up. Additionally, backing up your device in some form is recommended.</p>

The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 series tablets, which include the 14.6-inch Tab S10 Ultra and 12.4-inch Tab S10 Plus model, both include 5G connectivity as an option. You’ll need, of course, a carrier connection and plan to leverage this; and they afford different frequency band access. Alternatively, you can use Wi-Fi or a hotspot from another connected device like your smartphone to get online.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="how-to-connect-with-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-2">How to connect with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 series</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 series AI-ready tablets, launched in late September 2024, are versatile tablets designed to leverage everything AI has to offer. Once connected, you can enjoy AI experiences on the Dynamic AMOLED 2X displays, which come in a 14.6-inch size for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> or the smaller Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus with a 12.4-inch screen. Each one even comes with an S Pen bundled in for additional input options. </p><p>When the tablets are connected to a Wi-Fi network or, thanks to the inclusion of 5G, you can enjoy AI experiences using the new Galaxy AI Key on Book Cover Keyboards (sold separately). Use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features like Note Assist and Drawing Assist, or even have the tablet function as a home hub to control your connected SmartThings devices, enjoying the 3D Map View to streamline device management. </p><p>Thanks to the long battery life and Super-Fast charging, you can use them on the go, too, which is where you’re most likely to want to leverage a 5G connection with an appropriate plan. Both tablets feature Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi Direct for connectivity. The Tab S10 Ultra has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained" target="_blank">Wi-Fi 7</a> for wireless connections, and the Tab S10 Plus has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wi-fi-6e-faq-what-biggest-upgrade-wi-fi-decade-means-you">Wi-Fi 6E</a>. </p><p>For connecting to a cellular network, the larger Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra includes integrated 5G (Sub-6). The Sub-6 means it can connect to networks below 6GHz, which affords a wide coverage area and great network penetration. But it also results in lower bandwidth and data transfer rates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">compared to the 5G mmWave network</a>.  </p><p>The smaller Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus has both 5G Sub-6 and mmWave. With the latter, you can connect with a relatively short range via high-frequency radio bands, ideal in big cities or spots like airports and concerts. But it isn’t great for smaller suburban towns and rural areas. Penetration isn’t as strong, especially with hindrances like doors, trees, buildings, and walls. But connectivity is generally faster. Keep in mind that mmWave isn’t available everywhere. </p><p>Whichever way you slice it, however, if you decide to invest in a separate 5G cellular plan for either of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 tablet versions, both of which are poised to take the place of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9</a> as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best overall Android tablet</a>, you’ll be able to get online from virtually anywhere and enjoy a speedy connection. </p><p>If you’d prefer not to spend extra to use the 5G capabilities, you can simply rely on secure Wi-Fi networks (always use caution when connecting to public Wi-Fi) or use your phone, like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S24 series</a> device, as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-wi-fi-hotspot-android-phone">hotspot</a>. Just keep track of how much data you’re using if you have a limited amount in your monthly plan.</p>
