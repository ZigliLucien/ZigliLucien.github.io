By default, it pulls up your Samsung Health exercises with a single click, lets you quickly pause or restart a workout without needing the touchscreen, and even triggers an ear-ringing siren in an emergency.</p><p>At the same time, you may want to change your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>&apos;s Quick Button shortcut to something else, like a flashlight. You can also change which exercise it pulls up, disable the siren entirely, or make other simple changes.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to customize the Galaxy Watch Ultra Quick Button in just a few quick steps!</p>

You can also tap the <strong>Settings cog</strong> next to <strong>Samsung Health</strong> (the default option) and change it to <strong>auto-start a specific workout</strong> like Running or Biking. Or, you can open the <strong>Multisport workouts</strong> view.</p><p>5. Back in the Buttons and gestures settings, tap <strong>Start action with</strong>.

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3tTzutDY4ngKuVpkBvovBN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-close-up.jpeg" alt="A side view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and its three buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tTzutDY4ngKuVpkBvovBN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During a workout, the Galaxy Watch Ultra Quick Button has default functions that you can&apos;t change. Tapping it <strong>once</strong> will pause or restart a workout. <strong>Double-tapping</strong> the Quick button while running or cycling will start a new lap, while it will start a new session during weight-lifting activities. And <strong>holding</strong> the Quick button will end a workout, or transition to the next workout during a multi-workout activity (like a triathlon).</p><p>Aside from the fact that we wish Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-copies-apple-watch-ultra-except-for-most-important-feature">made the Quick Button a proper crown</a> so you could scroll through menus, we also wish it had given it more customization options. Ideally, you could give it two shortcuts, one for a single press and one for a double tap. And you should be able to make one of those shortcuts open your favorite app.</p><p>Still, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is Samsung&apos;s first time implementing a third, shortcut-dedicated button across years of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> and Tizen watches. We can hope that future software updates will add new functionality to the Quick Button, so it&apos;s not quite as limited. Even as is, it&apos;s a nice perk for those willing to upgrade over the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra has a revamped Exynos CPU, double the storage, triple the health sensor LEDs, and dual-band GPS, making it faster and more accurate than almost all the fitness smartwatches out there. It's certainly on the expensive side compared to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> but has perks like multi-day battery life and an ultra-bright display to recommend it.</p></p>

This week&apos;s Meta Quest news was chock full of announcements, releases, rumors, leaks, and all sorts of other stuff that you don&apos;t want to miss — even if you technically <em>already</em> missed it. Don&apos;t worry, though, because I&apos;m rounding up all the important stuff you need to know from July 22-26, 2024.</p>
<h2 id="meta-ai-is-coming-to-quest-3-2">Meta AI is coming to Quest 3</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ub0KESi8VEY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>This week, actor and influencer Anthony Hamilton Jr <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9xR5CVJH1I/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">got the chance to try out</a> Meta&apos;s AI upgrade for the Quest early, showcasing a bunch of new features that Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses owners <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">have been using</a> for a few months now.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-ai-coming-to-quest-headsets/">UploadVR</a> notes that this new feature will officially be called "Meta AI with Vision" and Quest 3 users should expect to see this feature pop-up in the Experimental section of the settings menu in August. That should coincide with the v68 firmware update, which is also expected in August.</p><p>The new update is replacing the existing voice commands on Quest with significantly enhanced ones that are allowed to use the headset&apos;s cameras — you&apos;ll have to give it permission first, of course — to view the world around you and answer questions. Hamilton Jr used them similarly to how many people have been using the feature on Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, but we figure people will find other new ways of using it with a VR headset in the future.</p><p>This is the first time we&apos;ve seen an app allowed to use the front-facing cameras to identify the world around you. Previously, all Quest apps were only allowed access to a system-created playspace for the environment, which helps secure privacy but also severely limits mixed reality apps.</p><p>Developers have been calling for Meta to improve this feature and allow access to the camera so better mixed reality apps can be made. While Meta isn&apos;t saying this feature will be opened up to third parties in the future, this is a huge milestone for a potential future where that happens.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3s</a> has been rumored and leaked for months, but this week we got the first look at the potential new budget Quest headset in person from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZGFTECH/status/1816416846796689903">VR Panda on X</a>. VR Panda is a Meta Quest 3 accessory manufacturer that&apos;s been known to leak announcements before, including the Quest 3 as well as headsets from other companies like Pico.</p><p>This track record gives us confidence that the leak is real and it lines up nicely with previous promotional material leaks for the headset, which we expect to be announced at Meta Connect on September 25.</p><p>The front of the Quest 3s sports six cameras divided into two clusters that closely resemble that of an iPhone Pro model (pick a year, they&apos;re all the same). It&apos;s thought that this new headset will sport the same powerful Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset as the more expensive Quest 3, as well as color mixed reality vision, but debut at a $299 price point.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1616px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.40%;"><img id="8VPjRn8Xnm8ZwxgYbqF9Ci" name="meta-quest-avatars-update-2024.jpg" alt="New avatars in testing on a Meta Quest 3, as spotted by @Luna on X" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8VPjRn8Xnm8ZwxgYbqF9Ci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1616" height="1073" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @Luna on X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the years, Meta&apos;s avatar system has received significant overhauls and updates as the company has tried out different art styles and ideas. When Meta made its big <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/metaverse">Metaverse</a> push back in 2021, it made the first moves to get rid of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-finally-getting-rid-its-hideously-ugly-avatars">previously hideously ugly avatars</a>, following that up with giving them legs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-quest-avatars-have-legs">two years later</a>.</p><p>Now, it looks like a handful of Meta employees are testing out a previously unseen avatar design, as shown in the image above and first seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1816175417922908480">by user Luna on X</a>. The new avatars do away with the more cartoony body size ratios that the current system employes — called "Boss Baby heads" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/RJdoesVR/status/1816182629605204229">by some users</a> — and seem to use more realistic graphics, as well.</p><p>Meta hasn&apos;t officially announced a potential overhaul of its avatars yet but, if these turn out to be selected as the new design, we could see them get announced as early as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-connect-2024-dates-announced-quest-3s-expected">September 25 at Meta Connect</a>.</p>
<h2 id="virtual-objects-look-better-in-the-real-world-2">Virtual objects look better in the real world</h2>

<p>This week, Meta updated its development tools to support better mixed reality quality, targeting how virtual objects look in the real world. The new update specifically addressed <em>how</em> virtual objects look when a physical object blocks your view of the virtual object.</p><p>In an example at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/quest-3-mixed-reality-occlusion-v67-sdk-upgrade/">UploadVR</a>, a real computer chair is placed in front of a virtual guitar and the Quest mostly succeeds at making it look like the virtual object is in the real world space. The new update improves the object cutout around physical objects so that these virtual objects look like they&apos;re interacting with the real object.</p><p>Furthermore, Meta&apos;s new update uses 80% less GPU and 50% less CPU processing, meaning developers will be able to make more meaningful mixed reality experiences and games. That could potentially make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5503065683135424/">Spatial Ops</a> look and feel even more genuine.</p>

<p>One of the coolest things about VR is the ability to virtually hang out with someone and make it feel like they&apos;re in the same room with you, even if they are thousands of miles away. User <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1816569990428131785">Luna on X</a> found a new code in an early release version of August&apos;s v68 Quest update that points to Meta further expanding this concept, creating a feature that appears to be similar to Apple&apos;s SharePlay on Vision Pro.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, SharePlay allows iOS and Vision Pro users to make a FaceTime call, then launch an app, movie, or something else and watch it "together" by syncing the playback. This was particularly handy in the COVID quarantine days on phones but needs a VR headset to be enjoyed to its fullest.</p><p>Right now, there&apos;s little information on how this could look or work but, most likely, you&apos;ll make a call using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/in-vr-experiences/social-features-and-sharing/create-or-join-group/">Meta Quest group feature</a>, then launch the app or video of your choice. The group feature is already used to make multiplayer gaming easier, so it makes sense for Meta to expand this to add functionality to make social experiences more seamless.</p>

<p>The Pirate Queen launched in April this year and it helped highlight the importance of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-pirate-queen-vr-education">learning history through virtual experiences</a>. The game, developed by Singer Studios and narrated by Lucy Liu — yes, the famous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005154/">Lucy Liu</a> — puts players in the boots of Cheng Shih, one of the most infamous pirates of all time.</p><p>That adventure has now been nominated for an Emmy, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mixed-news.com/en/the-pirate-queen-wallace-gromit-vr-emmy-2024/">Mixed News</a>. The "Outstanding Emerging Media Program" award also included nominations for the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6744365485575791/">Wallace & Gromit in The Grand Getaway on Quest</a> in addition to three other nominees.</p><p>As VR becomes more prevalent in society, we&apos;re seeing more and more award programs include VR content in addition to VR gaming. There&apos;s a special kind of empathy that comes from experiencing something first person through the eyes of another person, and it&apos;s great to see The Pirate Queen, in particular, receive this nomination.</p>

<p>Last year, Google unveiled the Pixel Watch 2 at the Made by Google event on October 4 and shipped it out on October 12. This year, Google is holding a Made by Google event on August 13; it&apos;s already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-official-teaser-gemini">teased the Pixel 9 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-confirms-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-real-in-official-tease">Pixel 9 Pro Fold in promo videos</a>, but has yet to hint at a wearable announcement.</p><p>If Google does showcase the Pixel Watch 3 in August, we can expect it to ship by the end of August. Otherwise, Google might choose to wait until October, as it did the last two generations.</p><p>The first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> cost $349, as did the Pixel Watch 2. The current rumor is that the Pixel Watch 3 will ship in two sizes that cost €399 and €449, respectively. Even though the Euro is slightly stronger than the dollar, Google currently charges €399 for the Pixel Watch 2, so we assume that means the Pixel Watch 3 will remain at $349 here, with the alleged Pixel Watch 3 XL costing somewhere between $370 and $400.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-watch-3-display-and-models"><span>Google Pixel Watch 3: Display and models</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nNspkxqziKF7nerxoHjztM" name="google-pixel-watch-3-render.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 3 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nNspkxqziKF7nerxoHjztM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rumors began in January that Google would sell<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-pixel-watch-3-could-come-in-two-sizes"> the Pixel Watch 3 in two sizes</a>: 45mm and 41mm. Like the 41mm Pixel Watch 2, the Pixel Watch 3 would have a 1.2-inch AMOLED display, while the 45mm Pixel Watch 3 XL would jump to 1.4 inches.</p><p>Since then, we&apos;ve seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-renders-leak">Pixel Watch 3 renders via OnLeaks</a> that show a very similar design to the Pixel Watch 2, with the same edge-to-edge display, side crown, Google Assistant button, and bottom sensor array.</p><p>The key difference is that Google allegedly made the Watch 3 significantly thicker than the Watch 2, enlarging it from 12.3mm to 14mm. While the rumor is that Google put a thicker battery inside the Watch 3, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-battery-certification-spotted">leaked South Korean certification</a> showed the watch with a 307mAh capacity, just 1mAh more than the Pixel Watch 2. Instead, the extra thickness could come from new health sensors, though we don&apos;t know what.</p><p>The leak also suggests that the Pixel Watch 3 case measures 0.2mm shorter, so perhaps Google managed to shrink the Watch 2&apos;s thick display border to make it a little more petite.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PGZEEHRzjqDg3L33chyFHk" name="google-pixel-watch-3-xl-render.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 XL renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PGZEEHRzjqDg3L33chyFHk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We later saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-xl-renders">Pixel Watch 3 XL renders via OnLeaks</a> that look, unsurprisingly, like a stretched-out Pixel 3. While the display allegedly measures 1.45 inches, everything else about the domed glass display and crown looks the same.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 2&apos;s single size was one of our only hang-ups with its design, so we&apos;re looking forward to having an XL option.</p><p>We&apos;ll close out this section with a very unlikely, but still intriguing feature: Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-patent-shows-touch-bezel-controls">patented</a> "gesture recognition on watch bezel using strain gauges," meaning you could squeeze a smartwatch or touch and hold the outer edge of a display to trigger an action. It has the same principle as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>&apos;s touch bezel, except more specialized. In theory, Google could try to implement a version of this in the Pixel Watch 3.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gTjV2AijgSRpbXZRSUnoQ6" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-fitbit-workout-ui-02.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTjV2AijgSRpbXZRSUnoQ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We&apos;ve yet to hear any rumors about the Pixel Watch 3&apos;s CPU. Given the Pixel Watch 2 used the Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 with a co-processor, the natural progression would be a Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 with CPU upgrades.</p><p>Google could choose to bring back the same chipset instead; smartwatches sometimes keep the same CPU across generations. On the other hand, Google and Qualcomm announced an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-wear-risc-v-upgrade">RISC-V partnership last October</a> to create custom CPUs designed to specialize in Wear OS-related tasks. So it&apos;s possible we could see the fruits of this partnership in the Pixel Watch 3 with a custom chipset.</p><p>We&apos;ve yet to see any smartwatch offer more than 2GB of RAM, so that might remain unchanged. Google offered 32GB of storage last year, but could double it to 64GB with the Pixel Watch 3 to match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch Series 9</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="bY3ha2SoTVKjtzxfVek2nM" name="google-pixel-watch-3-render-02.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 3 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bY3ha2SoTVKjtzxfVek2nM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We expect Google to bring back the same Fitbit-made health sensors: heart rate, blood oxygen, ECG, cEDA for stress, and skin temperature.</p><p>While the Pixel Watch 2 only had Bluetooth 5.0 and WiFi 2.4GHz connectivity, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-fcc-listing-detailed">Pixel Watch 3 rumor</a> suggests it&apos;ll add both WiFi 5GHz and UWB, with the latter used to auto-unlock your Pixel phone when your watch is nearby.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 should have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> out of the box. Google has already promised that this new version will make fitness tracking 20% more efficient, let you follow a specific goal during a workout like maintaining a specific heart rate zone, add new XML watch faces, and include new Complications like "Goal progress." It&apos;s all very fitness-focused, but we assume Google will have other non-fitness software perks up its sleeve.</p>

<p>While there&apos;s a lot to like about the Pixel Watch 2, but it&apos;s not as though this is the <em>perfect</em> smartwatch. Google made some questionable decisions this time around, along with a few more that we were ecstatic to see.</p><p>Nevertheless, we&apos;ve rounded up a few things that we&apos;d like for Google to implement with the next iteration of its smartwatch, to help it maintain its place among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Another size</strong></p><p>If there’s one thing I’ve been asking for since Google unveiled the original Pixel Watch, it’s for there to be a larger size. When it comes to many of the best smartwatches, this isn’t really anything that you need to worry about, as there are usually at least two different options to choose from. However, this wasn’t the case with the Pixel Watch, and Google opted to stick with the same 41mm case sizing with the Pixel Watch 2.</p><p>Even though it’s quite an elegant-looking wearable, it still looks quite comical for those who have larger wrists (like myself.) We’re not even saying that the Pixel Watch 3 needs to have an option as big as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a>, but <em>something</em> larger than 41mm would be nice.</p><p>If Google creates the rumored Pixel Watch 3 XL, that&apos;ll solve one of my only problems with the last-gen watch.</p><p><strong>Smaller bezels</strong></p><p>Another annoyance, for some at least, is that the bezels on the Pixel Watch are simply too large. We were hoping to see some type of improvements made in this regard with the Pixel Watch 2, but alas, it wasn’t meant to be.</p><p>It’s not as much of a problem when using one of the built-in watch faces, which are quite elegant and useful in their own right. But as soon as you want to try using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-facer-on-pixel-watch">Facer</a> or build your own with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kustom.watchface&hl=en_US">KWCH</a>, the bezels stick out like a sore thumb. Given the overall design, it’s not like we expect a bezel-less smartwatch, but just trim up the edges a bit.</p><p><strong>Pick a charging method and stick with it</strong></p><p>Last year, we got “wireless charging,” but it wasn’t the same experience compared to something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a>. You were stuck using Google’s own charger, and if something happened to it, you had to order another cable from Google. This time around, the Pixel Watch 2 uses the same charging method as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Versa 4</a>, courtesy of the pogo pins on the underside of the casing.</p><p>The result is faster charging speeds and a more reliable connection compared to the original Pixel Watch. But it also leaves us feeling a bit weary that Google could change things up again for the next iteration. While we would really love to see true wireless charging, complete with the ability to use reverse wireless charging, we’d also love for Google to pick a method and stick with it. If we’re destined to use Fitbit’s method of charging, so be it; just don’t keep going back and forth.</p><p><strong>Longer battery life</strong></p><p>The Pixel Watch 2 already improves upon battery life, as it’s rated for 24 hours even with the always-on display enabled. For comparison, the only way you could get that much juice out of its predecessor was if you were okay with turning the AOD off.</p><p>It’s definitely a big step in the right direction, but we’d love for Google to push the limits even further. There are a couple of ways that would allow for this, such as a new SoC that is more power efficient or simply using a bigger battery. But in order to squeeze a bigger battery in, it’s likely that this would require a redesigned case.</p><p>Or, ya know, just a larger size option.</p><p><strong>Just include Premium</strong></p><p>There’s something about the Pixel Watch and its successor that continues to pick at me. Prices start at $349, and while that includes six months of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-premium-worth-annual-subscription">Fitbit Premium</a>, there are another six months that you have to pay out of pocket. At least that’s the case if you want to keep using Premium features such as viewing your Stress Management and Sleep Score details.</p><p>Why not just include a full 12 months of Fitbit Premium with every new purchase? I understand the fact that Google is in the business of making money, but it’s not like you see Apple or Samsung hide these kinds of features behind a paywall. Something as basic as a Daily Readiness Score shouldn’t need to be something you need to pay for, so it’s kind of frustrating that this is the path that Google continues to go down.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro was one of the rare smartwatches to last for days between charges. Since 2022, more smartwatches hit this benchmark and have added perks like dual-band GPS and brighter displays that make the Pro a bit outdated. Still, this is a reliable device with years of software support left, and is more comfortable than the Ultra (aside from the wonky band).</p></p>

<p>Why weigh the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Watch 5 Pro, watches released two years apart? Because the Ultra and Pro are Samsung&apos;s only two watches built with extra battery life, many Watch 5 Pro owners are weighing whether or not to upgrade to the expensive Ultra.</p><p>As the person who reviewed both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a>, I&apos;m ready to compare every perk the Ultra offers, but also the drawbacks that might make Pro owners decide to stick with their current watch for now. Samsung has told us that it has no current plans for new "Pro" watches, but that might change in the future, and the Galaxy Watch Ultra is an expensive option.</p><p>Below, I break down every key similarity and difference between the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, to help make your decision easier!</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-watch-5-pro-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Watch 5 Pro: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mJjRWwATDCDjZs6CSKawze" name="Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-vs.-Watch-5-Pro-on-wrists.jpeg" alt="The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro (silver) versus the Galaxy Watch Ultra (black)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mJjRWwATDCDjZs6CSKawze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Watch 5 Pro come in one size, instead of the dual options you get with mainline Galaxy Watches. Of the two, the Pro has a more comfortable design, though not without its drawbacks.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra weighs 14g more and measures about 1.5mm thicker than the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, which is already a fairly large and heavy watch. Both use lightweight and durable titanium, but the Pro has a rounded case that matches its display bezel, while the Ultra has a square-shaped case jutting outside of the circular display at each corner — giving it a squircle look.</p><p>All recent Galaxy Watches have an IP68 rating against dust and water damage and an MIL-STD-810H rating against shock damage. The Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s protections go further: Samsung promises it can withstand altitudes as high as Mount Everest, temperatures from -4°F to 131°F (-20ºC to 55ºC), and deeper depths (10ATM) than the Watch 5 Pro (5ATM).</p>

<p>Both watches have an elevated bezel that helps prevent scratches if you bonk your watch against a wall. The Ultra bezel has lines matching a clock&apos;s hourly graduations, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/what-color-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-should-you-buy">different colors based on the case color</a>. I prefer my Titanium Gray Ultra with orange lines, which match the orange Quick Button and my orange band. Compared to that, the Watch 5 Pro&apos;s appearance is a bit plainer.</p><p>Speaking of bands, the Galaxy Watch Ultra has three default options: the thick elastomer Marine, rubber Peakform, and thin nylon Trail. The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro defaulted to the D-Buckle Sport, a magnetized band that was comfortable for normal use but impossible to secure well during workouts. I disliked it and would have preferred <em>any</em> of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-bands">Watch Ultra&apos;s bands</a>.</p><p>On the topic of buttons, both watches have a Home and Back button along the right edge, while the Galaxy Watch Ultra has a third Quick Button for another shortcut like starting or pausing an exercise, as well as triggering a loud siren with a long press. Neither has the physical rotating bezel of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a>, instead using a digital touch bezel along the display edge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NciCcxeqkyotjjbrFbShPj" name="Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-vs.-Watch-5-Pro-displays.jpeg" alt="The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro (silver) versus the Galaxy Watch Ultra (black)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NciCcxeqkyotjjbrFbShPj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re looking for justification to upgrade your Watch 5 Pro, the outdated display is where I&apos;d start. A 1.4-inch AMOLED with 1,000 nits of brightness, the Watch 5 Pro display is perfectly readable indoors and has the same 320 ppi resolution as the Ultra. But it&apos;s on the dim side in direct sunlight, and you have a lot of wasted black border space along the edge.</p><p>By contrast, the Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s 1.5-inch AMOLED hits a blazing 3,000 nits and looks fantastic every time I go running in sunny weather. There&apos;s virtually no wasted border space, which does have one tiny drawback: while using the digital bezel, your finger is more likely to block the bottom portion of the screen.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-watch-5-pro-hardware-and-sensors-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Watch 5 Pro: Hardware and sensors</h2>

<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra has 33% more RAM, double the storage, and an Exynos CPU clocked significantly higher. Samsung claims the Exynos W1000 can load apps 2.7x faster and perform multi-core tasks 3.7x faster than the Exynos W930 in the Galaxy Watch 6. The Watch 5 Pro&apos;s Exynos W920 isn&apos;t that far off from the W930 for clock speed, but less RAM does have a noticeable impact in daily use.</p><p>While 16GB of storage sounds like a lot for a smartwatch, Samsung uses about 11GB of that on default Wear OS software. So if you plan to stream music or podcasts on your watch while leaving your phone at home, the Watch Ultra has much more room for downloaded playlists — or built-in LTE to stream things instead. With the Watch 5 Pro, you may or may not have paid the extra $50 for it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gPx6ALhoraSnvVS8vif22e" name="Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-vs.-Watch-5-Pro-close-up.jpeg" alt="The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro (silver) versus the Galaxy Watch Ultra (black)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gPx6ALhoraSnvVS8vif22e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the Watch Ultra and Watch 5 Pro continuously measure heart rate and stress, then track blood oxygen, skin temperature, breathing, sleep stages, and other stats at night. They also actively and passively check for AFib issues. The Watch Ultra has newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> health metrics like Energy Score, but we expect the Watch 5 Pro should receive that update later this summer.</p><p>One key difference is that Samsung redesigned the Galaxy Watch Ultra to have triple the number of LEDs along its bottom compared to older Galaxy Watches; this reportedly makes it more accurate for workout tracking, and that proved noticeably true during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">Galaxy Watch Ultra fitness test</a>.</p><p>Another important difference is that Samsung gave the Galaxy Watch Ultra dual-band GPS tracking, which significantly improved the accuracy of my workout results compared to the GPS-only Watch 5 Pro or Watch 6. If you run, hike, cycle, or do any outdoor workouts in areas where tree foliage, buildings, or mountains can interfere with satellite signals, you&apos;ll appreciate this upgrade.</p><p>Still, the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is more <em>comfortable</em> while working out because of the weight, which may matter more if you chose the Pro as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-watch-5-pro-battery-life-charging-and-software-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Watch 5 Pro: Battery life, charging, and software</h2>
<p>Samsung says the Galaxy Watch Ultra lasts 60 hours in normal conditions with AOD active, 16 hours during workouts with dual-band GPS, or 100 hours in power-saving mode. The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro had an original estimate of 80 hours without AOD or 20 hours with GPS.</p><p>In truth, the Galaxy Watch Ultra has lasted closer to two days with AOD and maybe 12 hours while tracking workouts. Because of its much-brighter screen, faster processor with more RAM, and extra sensor LEDs, it burns more battery for everyday tasks. It&apos;s not far off from the Pro if you disable AOD, but it&apos;s not quite at the battery level you might hope for at this price point!</p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is two years old, and my colleague Andrew Myrick — who continued to use the Watch 5 Pro for years — has told me its battery life has been cut in half since then. Thankfully, it has the same 10W charging speed as the Ultra, so both refill in the same amount of time (about 2wo hours).</p><p>The other "longevity" point to consider is that the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro has just two years of software support left through summer 2026, while the Galaxy Watch Ultra gets Samsung&apos;s usual four years of Wear OS upgrades and security patches through mid-2028.</p>

<p>A new Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is hard to find these days. When it&apos;s available, it&apos;s typically on sale, widening the $200 gap between it and the Ultra; but I&apos;d argue that it&apos;s not worth buying new unless you can find one for <em>really</em> cheap, due to all its last-gen downgrades.</p><p>That said, whether you should upgrade from the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro to Galaxy Watch Ultra depends on what you think of your Pro. Can you accept adding extra weight onto your wrist, or is the slimmer Pro a perk worth holding onto? Do you need better health data, more storage, and faster app loading, or can you hold out for another year to save yourself some money?</p><p>You can downgrade to the shorter-lived <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> for something lighter, but for comparable battery life in a newer device, you&apos;ll need the Galaxy Watch Ultra. It&apos;s very expensive, especially once Samsung&apos;s limited-time $350 credit for the Watch 5 Pro ends, so if you <em>are</em> considering an upgrade, now would be the time!</p><p>We&apos;ve included the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro on our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> since it launched, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra is ready to claim that spot.</p>

<p>Foldable phones used to be a far-flung concept from science fiction, but the latest in foldable smartphones brings the ideas of the future to the here and now. Built with strong aluminum frames and cutting-edge ultra-thin glass that can literally fold in half, these phones will amaze you every single time you open and close them.</p><p>Right now, it&apos;s nigh impossible to find a more ideal foldable phone than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. When unfolded, it looks similar to the average smartphone, including a sleek and slim chassis with an all-day battery. But, when you&apos;re all done and just need to fit it in your jeans pocket, you can fold it in half, and it magically seems to fit just about anywhere.</p><p>The beauty of the foldables market is that you don&apos;t just have to have a "normal" shape phone that folds in half. What if you&apos;d rather have a regular-size phone that <em>unfolds</em> into a tablet instead? Or maybe a book-style foldable makes more sense, giving you two screens instead of one. Either way you fold them, these tremendous foldable phones bring the best parts of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> into neat, versatile packages.</p>

<p>Samsung finally increased the size of the outer cover screen with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> improves on that by making it even more useful than ever before. Samsung now lets you fit multiple widgets onto a single panel, although you still need to set up the external display using Labs or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> to get more use out of it.</p><p>At 3.4 inches, this screen is big enough to use a full-sized keyboard to reply to messages, run full apps, and just use the large, inner display less often. That&apos;s convenient for everyday use — it&apos;s certainly more glanceable than having to open the phone — plus, using a smaller display more often will inherently improve daily battery life since the phone doesn&apos;t have to power a big display every time you use it.</p><p>Although the Flip 6 is nearly identical to the Flip 5 in terms of dimensions and weight, we now get dust resistance on the modern flip phone. It&apos;s not very robust, but the IP48 rating is a welcome bump over the last-gen Flip&apos;s IPX8 rating. You also get the latest mobile processor — the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 — as well as a slightly larger 4,000mAh battery.</p><p>Samsung has also upgraded the cameras on the Z Flip 6, ditching the 12MP primary lens for a significantly better 50MP wide camera. Just don&apos;t expect to zoom in very far since there&apos;s still no telephoto lens. And finally, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 has been promised a whopping seven years of major OS and security updates.

<p>The era of the mid-range foldable is finally upon us thanks to Motorola. This year&apos;s budget winner is the spectacular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">Motorola Razr (2024)</a>, which basically a beefed-up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-vs-razr-plus-2023">version of the Razr Plus (2023)</a> but for a stunningly low $700 price tag. That&apos;s $400 less than the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, making it the most affordable new foldable phone you&apos;ll find today. You&apos;ll be making some concessions by saving so much money, but it&apos;s likely this will only bother enthusiasts.</p><p>The Mediatek Dimensity 7300X processor inside is plenty snappy and likely will never show its "mid-range" nature, even when playing games like Honkai: Star Rail. But there&apos;s always the chance that you won&apos;t see the same super-high framerates that a more expensive foldable can achieve. Slower internal storage means that things will definitely take longer to load, though.</p><p>That slightly lower-powered processor paired with a 4,200mAh battery means you&apos;ll actually be able to get through a full day&apos;s use on a single charge, unlike most other flip-style foldables.</p><p>The external 3.6-inch 90Hz OLED display is the star of the show, easily taking on the flagship Z Flip 6 and kicking its butt in terms of functionality. You can do so much with the cover display that it&apos;s like having two phones in one. In fact, you can use the phone in its entirety without even opening up the main screen, because Motorola doesn&apos;t put any restrictions on what you can do with the cover display.</p><p>If an average camera isn&apos;t a true negative for you, this is an excellent way to get in on the flip trend and save a ton of money.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus (2024)</a> is two phones in one, outclassing the Galaxy Z Flip 6 in quite a few surprising ways. The biggest reason to choose the Razr Plus (2024) is the cover screen, which might initially be surprising because it looks <em>very </em>similar to what Samsung offers on the Flip 6.</p><p>So why is it so different if it&apos;s basically the same size? Motorola doesn&apos;t put any restrictions on what you can do with the cover display, which is why we say it&apos;s two phones in one. The smaller cover display on the front acts like a full phone so you can use the Razr Plus more often without having to open it up.</p><p>Yes, that sounds a little silly given how easy Motorola&apos;s hinge makes it to open and close on a whim, but there&apos;s just something nice about being able to use a smaller display for quick tasks. Plus, using that smaller screen more often will improve battery life. The phone&apos;s only real negative point is the lack of dust resistance.</p><p>In addition to a better cover screen, Motorola has two more hardware features that are better than Samsung&apos;s: the display crease, and the curved edges. The Razr Plus&apos;s display crease is basically non-existent compared to the Z Flip 6&apos;s. Sure, both phones fold flat and utilize a waterdrop display curve inside the hinge but Motorola does a much better job of hiding the crease. Plus, the curved edges of the phone make the Razr Plus so much easier to use and more comfortable to hold than Samsung&apos;s flat edges.</p><p>On the software side, Motorola&apos;s modern software update promise isn&apos;t nearly as good as Samsung&apos;s, promising three OS upgrades and four years of software updates. Motorola&apos;s timeless gestures are here in all their glory as well as a new Hello UX and Moto AI. Overall, it&apos;s a phenomenal phone and a great alternative to Samsung&apos;s Flip series.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> is the best large foldable you can buy today. Its size and shape fit somewhere in between the narrow Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the wide Pixel Fold, giving it that Goldilocks appeal. Plus, the display crease on the larger folding display is nearly invisible and you still get an IPX4 water resistance rating so you don&apos;t have to worry if it gets a little wet in the rain.</p><p>The displays are top-notch, as well, offering a dynamic 120Hz refresh rate, 1440Hz PWM dimming, 10-bit color depth, and peak brightness of 2,800 nits. There&apos;s even support for HDR10 and Dolby Vision for spectacular movie watching on that large, cinematic display inside.</p><p>OnePlus offers two great colors, with the Voyager Black colorway sporting a nice textured leather-like material on the back for extra grip. Surprisingly, even the cameras are quite excellent, surpassing the quality of even the best large foldables like the Google Pixel Fold in most tests.</p><p>But good foldable hardware only works as well as the software, and this is where OnePlus really does things right. While there were some weird bugs at launch, the experience these days is nothing short of the best you&apos;ll find anywhere, particularly when it comes to multitasking.</p><p>The brilliant OnePlus Open Canvas concept lets you run several apps at once using a split screen or a unique sliding app concept, where you can dock an app "off-screen" and slide it into the main view at any time. Think of it a bit like looking at a comic book with several frames, each frame containing an app, and you can freely move the frame around as needed. It&apos;s brilliant, and it rounds out the best large foldable you can buy.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is a bit of a stale update that doesn&apos;t justify the $100 price hike one bit. Sure, the crease on the internal display is barely visible anymore, but nearly every other spec mirrors the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Z Fold 5</a>.</p><p>Just like the older-gen Flip, the Z Flip 6 has a robust hinge, closes shut completely flat, and has a non-discernible crease. The screen now has a more durable FTG layer on top, bumping up the UTG found on the Fold 5. Adding to that, Samsung has finally upgraded the ingress protection of its foldables with the Fold 6&apos;s IP48 water and dust resistance. The Armor Aluminum frame is also enhanced for improved toughness.</p><p>Under the hood, the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy processor offers better battery life and faster processing. On the software side, users now get seven years of guaranteed platform and security updates. You get Android 14 (One UI 6.1.1) out of the box that&apos;s laden with Galaxy AI features. The Z Fold 6 supports the S Pen but you need to buy one separately and it still doesn&apos;t fit into the chassis of the phone like the S24 Ultra.</p><p>The novelties end there as Samsung retained the same old cameras, battery, and charging specs on the Fold 6 as the ones we saw on the Fold 5 and the Fold 4.</p><p>This is all very frustrating, and frankly, embarrassing for Samsung, especially considering the price increase. It is perplexing given how much better the cameras on the Google Pixel Fold and OnePlus Open are. We certainly expected Samsung to push the envelope with cameras this year and were pretty disappointed when we found out they didn&apos;t.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3>
<h2 id="what-apos-s-the-best-foldable-phone-2">What&apos;s the best foldable phone?</h2>
<p>We rank the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 as the best foldable phone for most people because of its powerful processor, solid camera performance, good battery life, and large cover screen. Plus, Samsung&apos;s foldable phones have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-motorola-razr-folding-test">proven to be more durable</a>, and capable of withstanding hundreds of thousands of folds more than the competition.</p><p>But a flip style isn&apos;t for everyone, and all of our staff who use foldables regularly prefer the larger form factors of the OnePlus Open or Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. These two phones give you the option of having a tablet-sized display when you need it with the pocketability of a standard phone the rest of the time.</p><p>Plus, companies like Samsung and OnePlus have created powerful multitasking software systems that make it a joy to use multiple apps at once on that big screen.</p>
<h2 id="are-foldable-phones-worth-it-2">Are foldable phones worth it?</h2>
<p>Any fledgling technology tends to cost more, which means that many people often get priced out of choosing a foldable phone as an option. Companies like OnePlus and Samsung often run great deals on their foldable phones, and trading in an older phone could get you hundreds off a new foldable.</p><p>But while large foldables tend to cost more, phones like the Motorola Razr have pushed the price of clamshell foldables to less than half the price they debuted at in 2019. That&apos;s a great track record for getting more foldables into people&apos;s hands affordably, and some even cheaper options from companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-flip-review">TECNO</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Xiaomi</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-disadvantages-of-foldable-phone-2">What are the disadvantages of foldable phone?</h2>
<p>Aside from price, foldable phones are more difficult to repair than traditional slab phones. Our own Andrew Myrick <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-im-skipping-galaxy-z-fold-5">had several problems</a> getting his Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 repaired, and he&apos;s not alone in this conundrum. While many companies like Samsung partner up with shops like uBreakiFix, a broken display on a foldable is still a more difficult, costly process to repair.</p><p>We&apos;ve also seen plenty of examples where foldable displays crack without any obvious damage infliction point. When this happens, there&apos;s a possibility that it could be covered under warranty. The problem is that repair shops aren&apos;t always consistent with how they identify warranty-eligible replacements, and we&apos;ve run into these issues several times when trying to get foldables repaired over the years.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that, traditionally, foldable phones have worse battery life and camera quality than a similarly-priced slab phone.</p><p>While the situation is improving with every year — the OnePlus Open&apos;s camera is better than the OnePlus 12, despite being a few months older — companies like Samsung have been making snail-like progress on camera improvements over the years. That&apos;s particularly true with telephoto cameras, as the company ships the same cameras on its $1,900 Z Fold 6 as it fits on the $799 Galaxy S24.</p>
<h2 id="do-foldable-phones-last-long-2">Do foldable phones last long?</h2>
<p>Normally, a foldable phone will last you years without issue. Most foldable phones are rated for at least 200,000 consecutive folds before the hinge will start giving out, and companies like Samsung and OnePlus tout hundreds of thousands of folds beyond that before problems start to develop.</p><p>Foldables also tend to be more durable when dropped simply because the foldable display is encased within a protective clamshell.</p><p>But ultrathin foldable glass is still just ultrathin glass, and there&apos;s always the probability that it could break when you&apos;re using it normally, however unlikely that may be.</p>

Motorola is unique in this aspect compared to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>, which normally offer a curated selection of first-party (and some third-party) apps. Motorola lets you go crazy with just about any app you want to use from the cover screen, and setting it up is pretty easy.</p><p>Here&apos;s a rundown of how to set up apps on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> cover screen and how to use them.</p>

<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>External display</strong> option.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Panels</strong> option.</p><p>4. Toggle <strong>Apps</strong> on.

<h2 id="using-apps-on-the-razr-plus-2024-cover-screen-2">Using apps on the Razr Plus 2024 cover screen</h2>
<p>Opening apps for the first time on the cover screen may prompt you to "Allow" access to the app from the cover screen. You can also go back into <strong>Settings > External display > App settings</strong> to set the transition rules of each individual app. You must first toggle on the option to <strong>Allow on external display</strong>, then choose from the following:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Don't transition</strong>: When you close the device, the current app will not transition to the cover screen and will not prompt you to open the app on the cover screen.</li><li><strong>Manual transition</strong>: When you close the device, a prompt to open the app will appear at the bottom of the cover screen. Slide the app icon in either direction to open it, or ignore it if you don't want to open it.</li><li><strong>Auto transition</strong>: Closing the phone will automatically continue the app on the cover screen.</li></ul>
<p>These settings only apply to closing the phone. Opening an app on the cover screen and then opening your phone will automatically continue the app on your main display.</p>
<p>Once you allow apps to open on the cover screen, the app should work more or less how it would from the main display, although UI elements will be condensed into the smaller space, so it may not always have the cleanest look. The cameras will also get in the way of some UI elements, but you can always shift up part of the app to move out of the way. If you&apos;re using three-button navigation, <strong>press and hold the multitasking button</strong>, and if you&apos;re in gesture navigation, <strong>press and hold the navigation bar</strong> to toggle apps between full screen and default mode.</p>

<p>When typing in a text field, it can become difficult to see everything you&apos;re typing. When this happens, tap the <strong>Full screen editor</strong> button at the bottom to expand the text field. When you&apos;re done, you can tap the <strong>Exit full screen</strong> button at the bottom to return to the regular text field.</p>

<hr>
<p>These settings don&apos;t just apply to the Motorola Razr Plus 2024. You can use cover screen apps on the cheaper Motorola Razr 2024 and last year&apos;s Razr Plus 2023, both of which have large 3.6-inch external displays. Unfortunately, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Razr 2023</a> does not support cover screen apps as its external display is too small.</p><p>In the meantime, check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-first-things">first 10 things to do with the Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> to help you get set up on your brand-new flip phone, which is one of our favorite devices of the year so far.</p>

<ul><li>Google highlighted an update for Android foldables and tablets that refines the experience of Gmail and Chat.</li><li>Gmail now provides a formatting bar for different fonts and lists while also implementing Smart Compose.</li><li>Google has been spotted upgrading its multitasking experience in Android 15 for its upcoming Fold, which is a trend the company has done before ahead of major launches.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is starting to roll out an update for a couple of Workspace apps that should enhance the foldable and tablet experience.</p><p>The company detailed updates arriving for Gmail and Chat in a Workspace <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/07/new-android-features-gmail-google-chat-apps.html">update post</a>. The initial wave begins with Gmail, which Google states foldable and tablet users will notice a new formatting bar when composing emails. The bar contains font-changing options and the choice to create a bulleted list.</p><p>Another update brings Smart Compose to larger mobile displays in Gmail. Now, foldables and tablets can enjoy "intelligently" autocompleted emails. Google states that the feature functions similarly to its web-based counterpart or what Android phone users experience. While writing, Gmail will suggest text to help you wrap up sooner.</p><p>Users can accept <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9116836?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1">Smart Compose&apos;s</a> suggested text by swiping over it or by hitting "Tab" on an external keyboard.</p>

<p>Speaking of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-external-keyboards-android-tablets">external keyboards</a>, Google states Gmail has picked up a shortcut menu to help folks utilizing these tools have an easier time. Available for Gmail and the Google Chat app, pressing "?" on your keyboard will produce "Shortcuts." Users will see a list of shortcuts usable in the "current app," which would be Gmail in this case.</p><p>Users can press "C" to quickly compose an email or "A" to reply to everyone.</p><p>Google states all Workspace customers, individual subscribers, and personal accounts are receiving this update. The update has started rolling out and you should begin noticing it today (July 26) and beyond.</p><p>This update comes at an interesting time, considering the evidence <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-multitasking-resolution-changes-spotted">in Android 15&apos;s code</a> points toward even better multitasking for Google&apos;s Pixel Fold. It seems the company is interested in making it easier for users to use apps side-by-side. More importantly, the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> could receive a resolution change to 2076x2152.</p><p>It&apos;s not entirely atypical of Google to begin refining certain areas of its ecosystem ahead of major launches. The company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">next hardware event</a> will take place on August 13, after all.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking to buy a new flip phone, then you have quite a difficult choice ahead of you. On the one hand, there&apos;s the new Motorola Razr Plus 2024, which represents a sizeable upgrade over its predecessor. Then, there&apos;s the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, which is an iterative upgrade over an already great flip phone.</p><p>Both phones launched within weeks of each other and hit store shelves on the same day. They also have many of the same specs, while differing in some rather notable ways that could sway your decision in one way or another. However, after spending some time with both, I can help break down the differences between these impressive flip phones to help you decide which one is for you.</p><p>So, who will come out on top in this Galaxy Z Flip 6 vs. Razr Plus 2024 comparison?</p>

<p>Similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-motorola-razr-plus">Motorola Razr Plus 2023 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> comparison, these two phones take a very different approach to design. Motorola&apos;s phone retains the curves and rounded frame of its predecessor, while the Galaxy Z Flip 6 doubles down on the boxy design by adopting an even flatter frame. Both look great in their own way, and it&apos;s really up to personal preference which one has the better design.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> has a matte finish on the frame that I prefer over the more glossy finish on the Razr Plus 2024, but the sharp edges dig into my fingers when using the phone, which can become very uncomfortable over time. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> adopts vegan leather on the back instead of glass, which has a nice feel to it and won&apos;t be subjected to breaking the same way a glass pack panel will, but some may find that it feels cheap depending on the color you get.</p>

<p>Both come in a variety of colors, although Motorola completely avoids the more traditional black, white, or gray/silver color options. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-motorola-razr-plus-2024-should-you-buy">Any color Razr Plus 2024</a> model you get will stand out with options such as Hot Pink (yes, it&apos;s back), Spring Green, Midnight Blue, and Peach Fuzz.</p><p>Samsung also offers an array of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-should-you-buy" target="_blank">colors for the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</a> The regular options mostly avoid the "traditional" colors, although you can still get white and a rather cool-looking black option exclusively at Samsung.com. Otherwise, your options are Silver Shadow, Yellow, Blue, and Mint.</p>

<p>Both phones feature OLED displays, but Motorola may have the lead on this one. The display is larger but also has a higher refresh rate at 165Hz compared to the 120Hz panel on the Z Flip 6. You may not really notice the difference unless you&apos;re gaming, but for some, it can make all the difference. Both displays are also plenty bright, reaching 2,600 nits for the Flip and 3,000 nits for the Razr at peak brightness, so seeing the display outdoors isn&apos;t really an issue.</p><p>Samsung improved the hinge on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and added extra layers to the display to dramatically reduce the crease. The result is phenomenal: The crease is almost non-existent, both physically and visually. Motorola already got this right with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus 2023</a>, and the latest model follows suit.</p>

<p>Motorola made some hinge improvements of its own, as it feels much sturdier than the one used on its predecessor. It&apos;s still not as rigid as the Galaxy Z Flip 6, which may or may not work to its benefit, but it feels a lot better.</p><p>Lastly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-waterproof">Galaxy Z Flip 6 features an IP48 rating for</a> dust and water resistance, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-waterproof">Razr Plus 2024 has just IPX8</a> for water resistance, although the company tells me that some level of dust resistance is inherently incorporated at this level of water resistance.</p>

<p>Both phones are equipped with flagship specs, but the Galaxy Z Flip 6 technically comes out on top in terms of performance. The phone is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> for Galaxy, which is a premium chipset that brings plenty of power and enables new AI capabilities. This is coupled with 12GB of RAM, which should help with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, a flagship chipset that&apos;s positioned just below the 8 Gen 3. It&apos;s plenty capable, although its capacity for AI applications isn&apos;t as robust. Still, with 12GB of RAM, the Razr performs just fine in everyday use, and you likely would not notice a performance gap between these two phones, whether you&apos;re playing games or just juggling multiple apps.</p>

<p>With the Galaxy Z Flip 6, you get the option to choose between 256GB and 512GB of storage, while the Razr Plus 2024 makes that choice for you by only offering 256GB. That should be enough for most (it is for me), but it&apos;s nice to be able to opt for more if you think you&apos;ll hold onto your phone for a while.</p><p>Both feature the same size batteries, and battery life is pretty comparable between the two, offering nearly a full day&apos;s use on a single charge, depending on how you use it, obviously. The difference comes when it&apos;s time to charge the phone, with the Razr Plus 2024 offering nearly double the charging speed of the Flip. Given the larger batteries of these phones, you&apos;ll want that extra speed if you&apos;re in a hurry.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4141px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ktKHfzbBrzuKuhUF9mPQSE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-15.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ktKHfzbBrzuKuhUF9mPQSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4141" height="2329" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung and Motorola continue to offer very different cover screen experiences on their flip phones. While Samsung is more focused on the curated "widget" experience, Motorola gives you that and then some by letting you open nearly any app from the cover screen out of the box.</p><p>Of course, many apps have not been developed with this size screen in mind, but Motorola makes it work quite well. Samsung lets you do this, too, but you have to dig into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock app</a> and find a module to enable an app launcher. It&apos;s a bit of a chore, but once you get it working, it works fairly well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4175px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uvoTMfEfVKtErR9GQ4UeZA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-14.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvoTMfEfVKtErR9GQ4UeZA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4175" height="2348" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, it&apos;s a much fuller experience on the Razr Plus, which lets you seamlessly transition apps from the main and cover screens. Unlike the Z Flip 6, the Razr cover screen also lets you multitask, open apps straight from the notification panel, gives you a fuller quick settings panel, and is overall more customizable. There&apos;s also a neat desk display feature that acts as a desktop screensaver of sorts and lets you interact with the phone when you bring your phone near it.</p><p>That said, both have AODs, and Motorola even borrowed a feature from Samsung that lets you pinch the cover screen to see all your panels at once. They also now have the ability to add multiple widgets to a single panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iL5xwNFHubnBmjoWbQZ2o6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-13.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iL5xwNFHubnBmjoWbQZ2o6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4062" height="2285" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond the experience, Motorola&apos;s cover screen is also larger, sharper, and smoother thanks to the higher resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. By comparison, Motorola&apos;s cover screen still looks nice, but fairly low-res and compact.</p>

<p>Both phones run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, but just like their hardware, these phones have very different approaches to software. Samsung takes more of an "everything but the kitchen sink" approach, shoving tons of software features into its phones. On the one hand, this is great because Samsung has a lot of fun and useful features, and the company often gets access to new Google features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> before most other OEMs.</p><p>On the other hand, if you&apos;re new to Samsung phones, this can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming because there are <em>so many</em> features. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-devices-confirmed">One UI 6.1.1</a>, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 adds new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features that let you generate images with Portrait Studio or Sketch to Image, a Live Effect feature to bring images to life, improved translation features, and more. The Z Flip 6 also gets access to Expert RAW for those of you who want more control over your photos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.79%;"><img id="86BLybNGrt669VDNDU6qQk" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-09.jpg" alt="Photo with a generative AI spaceship on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/86BLybNGrt669VDNDU6qQk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2832" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Motorola&apos;s feature set isn&apos;t quite as robust, but there are some features you&apos;ll like. Gestures are a staple on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a>, allowing you to quickly enable the camera with a twist of the wrist or turn on the flashlight by shopping the phone twice. Unfortunately, Motorola doesn&apos;t have its own preinstalled Gallery app where it can add unique photo editing features like Samsung, but you still get access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> in the Google Photos app.</p><p>Some Google features like Circle to Search are also missing from the Razr, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> is supported with access straight from the cover screen. Motorola has its own version of AI wallpapers that lets you generate images or mimic styles based on images you upload, but it&apos;s not nearly as good as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">AI wallpapers</a> on Samsung (or Pixel) phones.</p><p>Motorola revealed some interesting Moto AI features that will be available sometime soon, but unfortunately, they&apos;re unavailable at launch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3556px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="fBT5eMYwcwUWAyL2SptTL4" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-21.jpg" alt="Control Panel on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fBT5eMYwcwUWAyL2SptTL4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3556" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, UI comes down to preference, with Samsung sticking to its tried and true One UI style and Motorola slowly moving away from the Pixel-like UI.</p><p>Then there&apos;s support. Motorola is pretty consistent with bi-monthly software updates, at least with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>, so we can assume the company will keep this up with its latest phone. Unfortunately, major OS upgrades aren&apos;t as quick or consistent, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-14-is-finally-coming-to-the-motorola-razr-and-razr-plus-and-it-only-took-a-year">Razr Plus 2023 receiving Android 14</a> much longer than other phones. Hopefully, the company will improve on this front, but we&apos;ll have to wait and see. After all, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-receive">Razr Plus 2024</a> will receive three OS upgrades and four years of security updates.</p><p>Samsung is much better with updates, often releasing them monthly for its newest phones and then being among the first to bring a new OS upgrade to its phones.

<p>When it comes to photo quality, these phones are pretty evenly matched. It helps that both feature 50MP primary cameras, although Motorola isn&apos;t known for capturing particularly good images, so it&apos;s surprising to see it keeping up with a Samsung phone.</p><p>Both phones capture plenty of detail during the day, and while the Razr Plus 2024 has a slightly smaller field of view, it manages to get a bit more detail than the Flip and manages a bit better with movement, giving it a bit of an edge. Both capture plenty of light, with the Galaxy adding more contrast while the Razr keeps things truer to life. Color temperature is also slightly different between the two, as the Flip tends to lean towards cooler images than the Razr.</p><p>Both also do well with zoom, and Samsung&apos;s optical-quality 2x zoom manages to match the detail of Razr Plus 2024&apos;s 2x telephoto camera, which almost makes me wish Motorola just went with a secondary ultrawide camera.</p>

<p>Both phones do fairly well in low-light and night images, but the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is consistently better, with more aggressive post-processing that drastically brightens up even the darkest scenes. Motorola can manage some decent low-light and nighttime images, retaining detail and keeping certain elements from being blown out (like in the image below). However, oftentimes it seems Motorola isn&apos;t actually doing any nighttime processing to brighten up an image in darker scenes, making me wonder if Night Vision was even turned on.</p>

<p>When it comes to selfies, Motorola surprisingly seems to have an edge here, keeping my skin tone nice and rich and retaining much background detail while also bringing in some nice natural bokeh when in portrait mode. Samsung, on the other hand, often makes my skin look ashen, and I&apos;ve had to switch to the Razr Plus 2024 multiple times when attempting to take a good selfie.</p><p>You can also see below that the Flip blows out the sky behind me.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6&apos;s camera does have a trick up its sleeve: Camera Assistant. With this app, you can add a 2x zoom button and auto HDR, among other features and enhancements. I would recommend it, as it would keep the phone from blowing out certain elements of the photo, bringing back details in the sky, for instance. Motorola already has auto HDR, which is probably what gives it its edge, and you can also apply auto enhancement powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>, but I find this is often unnecessary.</p><p>Of course, the Razr and Flip come with secondary cameras, but it depends on whether you prefer the Razr&apos;s 2x telephoto sensor or the Flip&apos;s ultrawide sensor, as they obviously serve different purposes.</p><p>Both phones capture 4K 60 video quite well. They also support an Auto Camcorder mode that lets you record with a special UI when the phone is folded at a 90-degree angle, a handy feature when you want to capture a moment quickly.</p>

<p>Deciding between the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Motorola Razr Plus 2024 isn&apos;t exactly cut and dry. Motorola has made tons of improvements to its Razr that bring it neck and neck with the Galaxy in terms of performance, battery life and camera quality. The major differences come down to design, software, and the cover screen experience, and any one of these can be a deal breaker for some.</p><p>If you want all the AI features under the sun, plus an extensive and consistent software update promise, then Samsung is for you, so long as you&apos;re willing to spend the extra $100 on a rather iterative phone. Meanwhile, the Razr Plus 2024 has the best cover screen experience of any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a>, and new AI features on the horizon, but the overall software experience isn&apos;t as robust or interesting.</p><p>Of course, there&apos;s also the camera situation, and a choice between the Z Flip 6 and Razr Plus 2024 means a choice between an ultrawide sensor and a telephoto sensor. So you&apos;ll want to consider how you like to use your camera and which one would make more sense for you.</p><p>Both phones have a different approach to just about everything, but truth be told, I don&apos;t think you can go wrong with either device, so long as you know what experience you want to have when using it.</p>

<hr>
<p>The rumor mill continues to churn potential facts about Google&apos;s Pixel Buds Pro 2, such as the latest batch speculating its market price.</p><p>Information discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-voici-le-prix-des-nouveaux-ecouteurs-sans-fil-a-venir-56714">Dealabs</a> (French) suggests Google aims to raise the price for its next Pro model earbuds across several regions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-buds-pro-2-prices-leak-3465147/">Android Authority</a>). The Pixel Buds Pro 2 will supposedly cost $229 in the U.S. What&apos;s key here is that, if true, this would mark (roughly) a $30 increase over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">original model</a>.</p><p>The publication theorizes the devices will cost 249 euros in the European region and 219 pounds in the U.K. Similar to the U.S., these other regions are also rumored to gain varying price increases. That would still keep them within the price range of the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best earbuds</a>, though.</p><p>It&apos;s still unclear what the catalyst could be behind this supposed price increase for Google. However, something is certainly going on internally as the Buds appeared early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-leaked-ad-design">in a Spigen Amazon ad</a>. The buds appeared bulkier or taller in their case in the leaked accessory promotion. Moreover, the grills that the Pro buds feature are colored the same as the in-ear devices instead of creating separation with a black hue.</p><p>That leaked ad also seemingly confirms that Google isn&apos;t interested in changing the case&apos;s design as it still appears egg-shaped. Although, there&apos;s an interesting new cutout at the bottom of it.</p><p>Information about the buds has been kept relatively quiet, however, the device&apos;s case was spotted picking up<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-charging-case-spotted"> its battery certification</a>. It seems Google is preparing to provide a slightly larger 650mAh battery this year which would be a 30mAh increase over the original version.</p><p>This possible price increase for the Buds Pro 2 might set us on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/european-pixel-9-series-prices-leak">an expensive trend this year</a> as the Pixel 9 series had its European pricing leaked. The base Pixel 9 and the Pixel 9 Pro were rumored to grab some interesting price hikes over the 8 series. Additionally, the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Pixel 9 Pro Fold were on the highest end of that pricing spectrum.</p>
