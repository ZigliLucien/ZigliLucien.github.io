Amazon has slashed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C22BRGLG" target="_blank"><strong>23% off the price of the OnePlus Nord N30 5G</strong></a>, marking an additional $70 off a phone that&apos;s already under $300 and bringing this device back to its lowest price ever.</p><p>We love the Nord N30 for its 5G capabilities, as well as for its battery life and overall design, despite being an economy-level device. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">OnePlus Nord N30 5G</a> is our favorite budget OnePlus phone, and at a 23% discount, it's an even better value pick than ever. The N30 5G is nothing too special when it comes to pure specs, but it punches up well above its price class with a sleek design, all-day battery life, and an array of useful software features.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C22BRGLG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4e3d48bd-f7fb-4079-9881-bfd6241ee0e4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299.99" data-dimension48="$299.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a phone with a 3.5mm headphone jack; battery life and charging speeds are important to you when selecting a phone; you want something affordable that doesn&apos;t necessarily feel cheap.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;d rather go with a more premium phone; gaming performance is a high priority for you; you need more than one OS update.</p><p>The OnePlus Nord N30 5G is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones#section-best-budget-pick">best budget pick OnePlus phone</a>, and this is the lowest price we&apos;ve ever seen for the unlocked device. It comes with 128GB of storage, a 2.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 6.7-inch screen—all for under $200. Other things we liked about this release was the inclusion of a 3.5mm jack and a microSD slot for expanded storage, along with its impressively long battery life and its super fast charging.</p><p>Gaming performance certainly leaves something to be desired, and some prefer phones with more than just one OS update, but if you are just going for all-time-lows in the budget department, this is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-oneplus-deals-2024-usd150-off-oneplus-12-foldable-phone-discounts-and-more">best Prime Day OnePlus deals</a> around. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The second day of the October Amazon Prime Day continues in full swing, bringing us all awesome deals like this one. Amazon has slashed the price of the Fire HD 10 tablet by a neat half, meaning you can buy one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">best Fire tablets</a> launched in 2023 for less than $100. Yes, this is not a drill, this is a real deal.</p><p>The Fire HD 10 (2023) comes in three colors, Black, Ocean, and Lilac, and two storage variants, 32GB and 64GB. You can choose the lock screen ad-supported version or the one without ads, but I suggest saving a few extra bucks and getting the ad-supported one. Since the ads are only on the lock screen, it&apos;s not intrusive or bothersome and you save money.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHZT5S12"><strong>32GB Amazon Fire HD 10 is 46% off</strong></a>, going for $74.99, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BL5PYD69"><strong>64GB Fire HD 10 is 53% off</strong></a>, priced at $84.99 for the rest of today only.</p><p>I personally prefer the Lilac colorway, but you can opt for anything you like in the memory configuration of your choice. The good news is, you can get every color in either 32GB or 64GB. And if that still isn&apos;t enough, the Fire HD 10 has a microSD card slot for expandable storage. Since the sale slashes the 64GB option&apos;s price to so less anyway, I say get that one without doubt.</p>

<p>Enjoy one of Amazon's most premium tablets for an <em>insanely</em> low price, only while this Price Big Deals Day sale lasts. With over half lopped off the price of the 64GB Fire HD 10 tablet, this is the perfect time to invest in this 10-inch tablet from 2023. The battery life is amazing, giving you 13 hours of uptime, and you get Alexa built-in to help control your smart home.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BL5PYD69" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4f8f9eee-b061-4a05-a57d-48408eea55bf" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet 32GB: $139.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet 32GB: $139.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need a tablet that can consistently deliver over 10 hours of battery life; you want something that includes expandable storage via microSD; you plan to use your tablet for gaming.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want a tablet that&apos;s especially lightweight; you need a camera that can deliver high-quality pictures; lock screen ads bother you.</p>
<p>The user experience is pretty neat overall. Amazon equipped the Fire HD 10 (2023) with a 10.1-inch Full HD LCD display with a 1920x1200 screen resolution. The tablet is powered by an octa-core processor and 3GB RAM. That&apos;s more than enough power to be productive and multitask, in addition to light gaming and media consumption. To get the most out of the Fire HD 10, you can also buy a Bluetooth keyboard case to go with, like the one from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0BWG2M9HQ"><strong>Fintie which costs $44.99 on Amazon</strong></a>.</p><p>You get two 5MP cameras, one on the front and the other on the rear. The battery life is fantastic, delivering 13 hours of usage. The Amazon Fire HD 10 also has a 3.5mm audio jack, expandable storage of up to 1TB, dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, and a USB-C port for wired charging.</p><p>Just like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-hd-10-2021-review">the 2021 model</a>, There&apos;s no fast charging on this Fire HD 10 either. For the fastest possible charging time, users are recommended to use a 15W adapter. This will get you from zero to a hundred percent in three hours.</p>

<p>It is an excellent gaming controller, and what makes it different to just about every other product in this category is the size; it has a full-sized design, and that makes all the difference in extended use. The G8 Galileo is just as comfortable to use as my Xbox controller, the button tactility is great, and it has customizable buttons. The G8 Galileo connects via USB-C and has 3.5mm passthrough, and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-G8-Galileo-Controller-Joysticks/dp/B0CM3C9HRG">down to $62 on Amazon</a>, making it a good overall value if you need a mobile controller.</p><p>But there&apos;s a better choice: the G8+. This mobile controller has the same design as the G8 Galileo, but it uses Bluetooth instead of USB-C, and it allows you to use the controller with a wider range of devices — including tablets and the Switch. The best part? The G8+ is just as affordable, and is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN">now available for just $63</a>, making it a terrific deal.</p>

<p>The G8+ is a phenomenal mobile gaming controller. It connects over Bluetooth, has good tactility, and the design is comfortable to use. You get full-size buttons, thumb sticks, and D-Pad, and that alone is a big differentiator. Hall effect joysticks means you don't have to worry about any drift, and after using the controller for over three months, I can safe say that this is one of the best accessories you can buy today.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="28849f4a-14ae-4bbd-809f-2fecbc699eb8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="GameSir G8+ Mobile Gaming Controller: $79" data-dimension48="GameSir G8+ Mobile Gaming Controller: $79">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a full-size mobile gaming controller with good feedback. There are no issues with Bluetooth connectivity, you get customizable paddles at the back, and battery life is decent.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You have a phone with a large camera island.</p>
<p>The GameSir G8+ has excellent build quality, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-plus-review">even with extensive use</a> in the last three months, there are no signs of wear. In the last three weeks alone, I used the controller to play Balatro for over 30 hours — the deck-building rougelite is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playstack.balatro.android">now on the Play Store</a> — and it is just as satisfying to play the game with the controller paired to my Pixel 9 Pro XL as using my Steam Deck.</p><p>The only issue with the controller is that it has clearance issues if you have a phone with a sizeable camera island, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro</a>. If you&apos;re using a Samsung phone, Pixel, or the iPhone, this isn&apos;t a problem. There are no shortcomings with the G8+ as such, and with the controller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN">now available for just $63</a>, this is the ideal time to pick it up.</p>

That&apos;s a 33% saving from the list price, making this a pretty good deal. </p><p>This deal is for the 32GB storage variant that comes with 3GB of RAM. I&apos;d recommend spending a bit more and getting the 64GB variant with 4GB of RAM, for a slightly smoother usage experience. On the other hand, if you just need an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> for automating smart home devices or streaming videos, you could save big with this Prime Day deal.  As a bonus, this deal includes the official folio case, making it superb value.</p>

<p>The Lenovo Tab M9 continues to be a good budget pick, with mostly positive reviews on Amazon and decent specs. The 32GB storage moedel is now just $99.99 with this cool Prime Day deal. As great as this discount is, I'd recommend springing for the 64GB model which has 4GB RAM, which should work better with games. </p>
<p>The Tab M9 features a 9-inch HD display, a 5,100mAh battery, and is powered by the MediaTek Helio G80 SoC. It has a premium metallic finish, the stereo speakers have Dolby Atmos enhancement, and you get an 8MP rear camera.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you need a compact Android tablet; you need a large display on the cheap; you need a value for money budget tablet.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>you need good gaming performance; you need a sharp display; you need a tablet that charges quickly.</p><p>The Lenovo Tab M9 is an Android 12 tablet that typically costs $149.99, but you can now get it for $50 off with this Prime Day deal. This is good for those that want a basic tablet for a bit of couch surfing, checking the video feed of their front door, or catching up on streaming shows. 3GB of RAM is not ideal for Android, so doing anything other than the basic tasks might be a struggle. The 4GB variant of the Tab M9 is something worth considering, and that&apos;s something that&apos;s usually discounted too.</p><p>You&apos;ll have to manage your expectations with budget tablets as they simply cannot offer the same level of performance and features as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a>. Still, for the price, the Tab M9 offers an interesting set of features like Dolby Atmos-enhanced speakers, USB-C, Wi-Fi 5, and two cameras for the front and back. The tablet is also pretty slim at 8mm and doesn&apos;t weigh much, so it should be comfortable to hold for longer durations like for reading ebooks.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You&apos;re looking for an excellent mid-range phone at a great price; you don&apos;t mind a last-gen device; you enjoy taking notes or drawing with a stylus. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need a phone for heavy gaming or top-of-the-line flagship phone specs.</p><p>If you need slightly better specs, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">2024 model</a> has 8GB of RAM and a better 32MP camera. The newer model also has 30W charging, but the specs on the 2023 don&apos;t fall too far behind. The 2023 model&apos;s Stylus processes images with more warmth and has a good LCD 120Hz panel. The Moto G Stylus 5G 2023 has a conventional look and has a plastic back. 47% off is a tremendous deal, but it won&apos;t be around for long.</p>

An overwhelming majority of my TV usage over the last five years has been with the Shield TV Pro, and while the device is going strong, it is starting to show its age; there&apos;s no AV1 decode, and HDR content is buggy at times.</p>
<p>That&apos;s where the Mecool KM2 Plus Deluxe comes in. This streaming box runs Google TV and is based on Android 11, and it is outstanding in daily use. It has 4GB of RAM and uses a quad-core Cortex A55 platform, so it is incredibly fluid — there&apos;s no lag whatsoever. That in itself is a big deal; I used dozens of Android TV boxes over the years, and most of them tended to lag after a few weeks of use.</p><p>That isn&apos;t a problem on the KM2 Plus Deluxe. In fact, it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/i-finally-found-an-android-tv-box-that-rivals-the-shield-tv-pro-and-its-just-dollar119">as good as the Shield TV Pro</a>, has AV1 decode, and the best part is the value — the streaming box retails for $139, but it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Android-MECOOL-Certification-Assistant-Compatible/dp/B0DBV9QXSL">down to just $112 for Prime Day</a>. That&apos;s just over half as much as a brand-new Shield TV Pro, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM">still costs $199</a>.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:  </strong>You need a powerful Google TV streaming box that can handle Dolby Vision content and has AV1 decode. While Dolby Vision was buggy initially, a software update sorted out that issue, and the affordability makes it an easy recommendation.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need DTS-HD audio, and don&apos;t like the Google TV interface.</p>
<p>As it runs standard Google TV, you get full access to the Play Store, and there&apos;s Netflix pre-installed. I didn&apos;t run into any issues while streaming HDR content in Netflix — it has AV1 decode — and while Dolby Vision was missing when I set up the box at the start of the year, that was resolved via a software update, and there are no problems in this area now.</p><p>You get a good selection of ports as well; there&apos;s an HDMI port along with dual USB-A ports and MicroSD card slot, and Ethernet, 3.5mm out, and optical connectivity. The main reason to pick up the Google TV box is the value; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Android-MECOOL-Certification-Assistant-Compatible/dp/B0DBV9QXSL">coming in at $112</a>, it is one of the best streaming solutions at this category, and the deal makes it an enticing choice.</p>

That has allowed models like the DiskStation DS224+ to stand out considerably from their rivals, and a year after its debut, the 2-bay NAS continues to be the best-selling product in this category.</p>

<p>The DiskStation DS224+ usually costs $299, but right now, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1781611-REG/synology_2_bay_diskstation_ds224_compact.html">pick it up for just $239 at B&H Photo</a>, a $60 savings. I&apos;ve been covering NAS deals for half a decade now, and considering how popular the DS224+ continues to be, you&apos;ll need to act now if you&apos;re interested in buying the NAS. If the NAS is sold out at the retailer, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newegg.com/synology-ds224-2-bay-intel-celeron-j4125-2-0-ghz-processor-diskless-system/p/N82E16822108840">get the same deal at Newegg</a>.

<p>The DiskStation DS224+ is the best 2-bay NAS around. It has reliable Intel Celeron J4125 hardware with transcoding — making it a good Plex server — and you get 2GB of RAM, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, and a USB port. The key differentiator is the software, with the DS224+ featuring a wide range of utilities that make backing up data across devices a breeze.</p>

<p>If you need additional drive bays and the ability to slot in M.2 drives, the DiskStation DS923+ is still my go-to choice. The NAS is powered by AMD's Ryzen R1600 and doesn't have hardware transcoding, but it is still a fantastic option if you want to use Plex, and you get dual M.2 2280 slots along with dual Gigabit Ethernet connectivity.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a reliable 2-bay NAS server to back up photos and videos and stream Plex.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need M.2 slots and multi-Gigabit connectivity. In that case, I&apos;d recommend the TerraMaster F2-424, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F2-424-NAS-Storage-2Bay/dp/B0CXPBM2DF">now available for $303</a> (down from $379).</p>
<p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">reviewed the DiskStation DS224+</a> when it launched, and the 2-bay NAS has considerable upgrades that make it a great choice. There are no issues in regular use, and the DiskStation Manager software has plenty of great features that make it easy to back up photos and videos from your phones and other devices.</p><p>The DS224+ does a great job if you&apos;re looking to stream your locally-stored media to various connected devices; there&apos;s a native Plex client, and you get Jellyfin as well. While there are plenty of other choices available, the DS224+ is still the best NAS thanks to the combination of hardware and software. The fact that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1781611-REG/synology_2_bay_diskstation_ds224_compact.html">it&apos;s down to $239</a> makes it a good value; this is the lowest price for this NAS, and I don&apos;t see that changing in the future.</p><p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">also like the DiskStation DS923+</a>, and it is a more powerful NAS with M.2 connectivity. I would have liked multi-Gigabit connectivity, but there&apos;s an easy way to add a 10GbE card (it costs another $100), and you get 4GB of RAM and the ability to add M.2 drives to your storage. Similar to the DS224+, the DS923+ is at its lowest price; it usually sells at $599, but is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1735213-REG/synology_ds923_4_bay_nas_enclosure.html">now down to $479</a>. Again, if you&apos;re eyeing this NAS, you need to act now — the deal is sold out at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newegg.com/synology-ds923/p/0YH-0064-00009">retailers like Newegg</a>.</p>

Things only get better with this awesome Prime Day deal that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J9NQHL"><strong>knocks $100 off the Razr 2024</strong></a>, bringing the price to an all-new low of just $599.99. We praised the Razr 2024 for having a fabulously large outer display, good battery life, and solid app and gaming performance. If you&apos;re waiting to get your first foldable but the high prices have been putting you off, this superb <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-motorola-deals-have-come-early-score-40-off-foldable-phones-epic-flagship-discounts-and-more">Motorola deal</a> on the very capable Razr 2024 is the best entry way.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr (2024) hadn't seen many great discounts until this Prime Day came along. The Razr was priced pretty well to begin with, but this $100 off deal makes it an even more attractive buy. Best to grab it quick before stock runs out!</p>
<p>Unlike the 2023 Razr, the 2024 model gets a massive makeover with the larger outer display, premium vegan-leather finish, great battery life, and a more versatile ultrawide camera. You don't have to pony-up the premium for the Razr Plus anymore as this model should have enough to satisfy the needs of most users.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J9NQHL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6d36819c-7c87-47fc-b8e5-3e4845538e43" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Motorola Razr 2024: $699.99" data-dimension48="Motorola Razr 2024: $699.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>You want an affordable folding phone; you want good gaming performance; you want to use apps on the cover screen.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>Timely software updates are important to you; you need flagship-grade cameras.</p><p>Finding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best folding phone</a> under $1,000 in the U.S. is slim pickings, unless you&apos;re willing to buy something without warranty or support. The Motorola Razr 2023 was one of the few foldables that fit the criteria, but with some severe handicaps. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">2024 Motorola Razr</a> though took us all by surprise as it got many premium features from the previous-gen&apos;s &apos;plus&apos; version, but at the same great price. The massive 3.6-inch outer display lets you apps in fullscreen, making it even more functional than the Galaxy Z Flip 6 which costs nearly double.</p><p>Other than a few software teething issues when we initially tested it, the Razr 2024 has a great in-hand feel thanks to the vegan-leather trim, the processor is more than capable for handling the day-to-day and gaming duties, battery life is good, and the 13MP ultrawide camera now has autofocus so you can capture macro shots of tiny subjects too.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>MediaTek has announced the new Dimensity 9400 SoC, its fourth annual flagship chip built on Arm v9.2 CPU architecture.</li><li>It uses 1x Arm Cortex-X925 (3.62GHz), 3x Cortex-X4 (3.3GHz), and 4x Cortex-A720 (2.4GHz) cores, with 35% and 28% faster single- and multi-core performance.</li><li>The 12-core Immortalis-G925 GPU has 41% boosted performance and 44% improved efficiency.</li><li>The new NPU offers 80% faster LLM prompts and 100% diffusion generation performance.</li></ul>
<p>MediaTek has announced the specs for its fourth-gen flagship SoC, the Dimensity 9400. With Qualcomm set to announce its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4-leak-illuminated-specs-storage-speeds">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> later this month, MediaTek is laying down its own AI-focused challenge now.</p><p>While the last-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-launch">Dimensity 9300</a> topped out at 3.25GHz with its four Cortex-X3 cores, the Dimensity 9400 has one 3.62GHz core and three Cortex-X4s clocked slightly higher at 3.3GHz. The biggest gap is more subtle: MediaTek uses the same Cortex-A720 efficiency chips, but clocked at 2.4GHz instead of 2.0GHz.</p><p>The chip uses TSMC N3E processes technology and is up to 40% more power efficient at hitting last year&apos;s top benchmarks. The new Arm Immortalis-G925 is also 44% more power efficient.</p><p>Aside from the expected CPU gains, the Dimensity 9400 offers a 100% L2 Cache increase and 50% L3 Cache increase, as well as the new LPDDR5X memory interface for up to 10.7 Gbps. This should all help the Dimensity 9400 perform better in areas like loading times without relying as much on RAM.</p><p>MediaTek claims that the CPU hits 3,055 / 9,600 for single- and multi-core benchmark tests in Geekbench 6.2, or 2.8 million for AnTuTu performance.</p>

<p>The most intriguing change comes with a new NPU, which supports its new "Agentic AI engine." According to MediaTek, it&apos;s the "first mobile chipset to offer on-device LoRA training" (Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models) and "high-quality on-device video generation." It offers 50 tokens per second and is 80% faster at LLM prompts than the Dimensity 9300.</p><p>The Dimensity Agentic AI Engine is a bit confusing for laymen, but essentially it&apos;s a framework to standardize how mobile AI applications work, both on-device and in the cloud; in the latter case, MediaTek plans to create an "Agentic Apps Store" in the cloud where mobile OEMs can access certain AI processes. </p><p>"The MediaTek Dimensity 9400 will continue furthering our mission to be the enablers of AI, supporting powerful applications that anticipate users&apos; needs and adapt to their preferences," says MediaTek President Joe Chen. "The Dimensity 9400 continues to build on our momentum of steady growth in market share."</p><p>During a MediaTek presentation, VP of Global Marketing Finbarr Moynihan explained that while the company&apos;s primary sales are in China, customers like Xiaomi and Oppo have expanded into Europe, leading to 30% market share and 50% year-over-year growth. </p><p>Samsung will use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">MediaTek 9300 Plus</a> flagship chip in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 series</a> for the first time, which felt like a major win for MediaTek over Qualcomm and makes us wonder if we&apos;ll see the Dimensity 9400 in more global devices as well.</p><p>Running through the rest of the Dimensity 9400 specs, it has a new 4nm Wi-Fi / Bluetooth chip (as opposed to two separate chips) that&apos;s 50% more power efficient, support for Qi-Fi 7 tri-band MLO, and support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-tri-fold-phone-intrigues-me">tri-fold smartphones</a>; we&apos;ve seen more multi-fold phone concepts in recent months, and MediaTek wants their business.</p>

If you&apos;ve been waiting for the right time to jump on it, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CD8YMKWC"><strong>Galaxy S23 FE Prime Day deal</strong></a> will get you the 256GB variant for the price of the base variant. This is the lowest recorded price yet for this variant on Amazon, making it the perfect time to upgrade to this superb value flagship phone. Best part, Samsung has already begun rolling out One UI 6.1 for it which means you&apos;ll get to enjoy many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features, just like its flagships.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE's 15% discount during the Amazon Prime Day sale might not seem that attractive at first, but it's a pretty sweet deal when you consider you're essentially paying for the base variant but getting double the storage.</p>
<p>The 256GB variant offers enough storage for most people, so you don't have to rely on cloud storage alone. The S23 FE is one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> as it has all the essential features like a large AMOLED screen, IP68 rating, wireless charging, a telephoto rear camera, and solid performance. It will even get four years of OS upgrades.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CD8YMKWC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="3f38afa8-60d5-4049-b5f2-904a5323b03d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S23 FE: $659.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S23 FE: $659.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> You want flagship Samsung features at a low price; you&apos;re happy with four years of updates; you need a dedicated telephoto camera.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>You want the latest FE edition phone; you want a larger display; you want longer support for updates.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S23 FE</a> wasn&apos;t the easiest to recommend when it launched as it  came at a time with the Pixel 8 was just around the corner and the S23 was already getting heavy discounts, in the run up to the S24. Nearly a year later, the Galaxy S23 FE is in a great position as its price is lower, which is what it should have been, and this Prime Day Deal on the 256GB variant makes it a deal hard to pass up. You can expect a superb 120Hz AMOLED display, premium build quality, IP68 waterproofing, wireless charging, and the full arsenal of rear cameras which includes a 3x telephoto camera. </p><p>Samsung has just launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> which comes with the usual expected upgrades like a faster processor and bigger battery, but more notably it will now be eligible for seven years of OS and security updates. It&apos;s priced rather terribly though, just like the S23 FE, putting it in close quarters with the Galaxy S24. The S24 FE will eventually be a great buy sometime next year, when the prices drop to what it should have been to begin with. Till then, we feel the Galaxy S23 FE is still a very good option to consider, especially with these amazing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-early-samsung-galaxy-deals-phones-tablets-and-more">Samsung Galaxy Prime Day deals</a>.</p>
