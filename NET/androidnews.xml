                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I&apos;ve reviewed quite a few Motorola phones over the years—mostly budget and midrange models—and each year, they bring more and more value at affordable prices. At the top of Motorola&apos;s midrange Moto G family in North America is the Moto G Stylus 5G, which often gets some of the better specs of the lineup without stepping into flagship territory. This year, however, Motorola stepped things up quite a bit with the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024.</p><p>While still very much a midrange phone, priced moderately at just $399, the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 feels like it&apos;s trying to be a flagship. When it comes to design, performance, and even some specs, this phone does its best to emulate the flagship experience while retaining its low price tag, and it&apos;s surprising just how well it pulls it off. Heck, some of the specs match or rival those from Samsung&apos;s base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>, but at just half the price.</p><p>Of course, a few sacrifices have to be made, but they&apos;re hardly worth complaining about. Sadly, the marquee feature of this phone is still probably the least interesting thing about it, and there are some software misses despite the changes to Motorola&apos;s UI with Android 14, but those shouldn&apos;t deter you from an otherwise great phone.</p>

<p>The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-launch">announced</a> on May 9, 2024, and goes on sale on May 30 in the United States. You can purchase the phone unlocked from Amazon, Best Buy, and Motorola. In the coming weeks, the phone will be available through various carriers, such as T-Mobile, AT&T, Cricket, Boost Infinite, Boost Mobile, Consumer Cellular,  U.S. Cellular, Spectrum, Xfinity Mobile, Google Fi Wireless, Optimum Mobile, Straight Talk, Total by Verizon, and Visible.</p><p>The phone is available in two colors, Caramel Latte or Scarlet Wave, and retails for $399 before any deals or promotions, although pricing (and certain specs) may differ by carrier.</p>

<p>Each year, Motorola&apos;s smartphones take on completely new looks, with a design that usually spans the company&apos;s entire portfolio, from budget to flagship. This creates a level of uniformity, even if it can make it hard to tell the phones apart just by looking at them from behind. This year&apos;s aesthetic focuses on alternative materials, with a back panel made of vegan leather (a fancy name for plastic) that seamlessly envelops the entire rear of the phone, protruding slightly only for the dual camera system in the top corner.</p><p>As far as hand taste goes, the phone feels incredibly soft and, dare I say, premium. The brushed frame may be plastic (you wouldn&apos;t even know it), but it somehow adds to the premium look and feel of the phone, with a slight glossy finish on both ends toward the rear panel and the display. In regular use, the vegan leather keeps the phone from getting too hot when pushing the processor while also keeping the phone from getting too cool and slippery like a typical glass phone. </p>

<p>On the front is a large 6.7-inch OLED display, which is quite a step up from the LCD panels found on just about every other Moto G phone. The colors on the display are incredibly vibrant, even after I switched the phone to Natural color mode. You can also choose Radiant and Vivid color modes for the display, but I find the Natural mode is plenty. The 120Hz refresh rate also brings home just how nice this display is for a $400 phone. My only complaint is that I feel that the panel may be too contrasty and that darker parts of images and video appear a smidge darker than they should.</p><p>If you suffer from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>, you&apos;ll be happy to know that despite this being an OLED panel, Motorola has included a flicker-prevention setting, which should help make it easier to use the phone.</p><p>Motorola worked some magic around the display to significantly reduce the bezels to flagship levels. I can&apos;t say for sure, but just by looking, I feel as though the bezels on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 are smaller than those of the $699 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a>. Frankly, you could easily mistake this phone for a flagship, no matter which way you look at it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KBb5HZLaJjY4YmXNzeXLCV" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-review-05.jpg" alt="The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 display bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KBb5HZLaJjY4YmXNzeXLCV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At 190g, the phone feels lighter than you might expect, and it might throw you off, but I don&apos;t mind it. For comparison, the much smaller Pixel 8 measures 187g, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> weighs a bit more at 197g despite being shorter and thinner. That said, this is a fairly large phone, so if you&apos;re not used to that, the size may also take some getting used to.</p><p>For protection, the display is protected by Gorilla Glass 3, and the phone features an IP52 rating for water and dust resistance, so try to avoid dunking it. One benefit of the vegan leather back is that there&apos;s one less thing to worry about when dropping it, but you&apos;ll definitely want to grab a screen protector.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KFJqwgZ9YUch59iLTv7okP" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-review-04.jpg" alt="Honkai: Star Rail on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KFJqwgZ9YUch59iLTv7okP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted before, Motorola really went all out with this phone when it comes to specs. Of course, for a $399 phone, there&apos;s only so much you can do, but Motorola seemed to push the specs as much as it could. The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-6-gen-1-snapdragon-4-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 6 Gen 1</a>, which is a curious decision since it&apos;s the same chip powering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2023</a>.</p><p>That said, I don&apos;t hate that Motorola is reusing the chip from last year&apos;s model because it performed surprisingly well then, and it performs even better now. I imagine that&apos;s likely due to the extra RAM (8GB now instead of 6GB) helping keep apps in check. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">RAM Boost</a> is on by default, but I always turn that off and recommend you do, too. You don&apos;t need it.</p><p>In my experience, the phone has no trouble opening and juggling apps, while playing games like Honkai Star: Rail seems like a cakewalk for the chip, even on the highest quality settings. Honestly, I&apos;ve been thoroughly pleased with how well the Moto G Stylug 5G 2024 performs, to the point that I did not really miss using an actual flagship phone. That&apos;s saying a lot for a $400 phone.</p>

<p>And just when you think I was done with the display, Motorola surprises yet again by adding another flagship feature into the mix: an in-display fingerprint sensor. Moto G phones usually opt for side-mounted sensors, so this is quite a shift. The sensor works pretty well and unlocks the phone pretty quickly, even when waking up the display. It&apos;s not as fast as some higher-end phones I&apos;ve used, but it&apos;s about as fast as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a> in my use. My only problem with the sensor is that it&apos;s incredibly low on the display, and I wish it were a bit higher for more comfortable use.</p><p>Face Unlock also works about as well, although I imagine Google&apos;s implementation on the Pixel is a bit more secure.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3957px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o32tJVtuD4Jx8qrHpkrKqk" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-review-18.jpg" alt="The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 lying flat" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o32tJVtuD4Jx8qrHpkrKqk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3957" height="2226" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for battery life, the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 isn&apos;t as long-lasting as some other Moto G devices that offer up to two days per charge. That said, the 5,000mAh battery can get you through the day easily, depending on your use, which is good enough for me. There are also some battery settings that can help prolong battery life, which you might want to turn on.</p><p>Charging is also quite improved, with Motorola doubling the speed from last year&apos;s Stylus model. At 30W wired, the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 charges a bit faster than Samsung&apos;s smallest flagship Galaxy S24, with 15W wireless charging to match even Samsung&apos;s premium flagship phones.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-software"><span>Moto G Stylus 5G 2024: Software</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RbdLrcDosLRyk5ZY2JV7y6" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-review-13.jpg" alt="The quick settings menu on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RbdLrcDosLRyk5ZY2JV7y6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, and with it come a few aesthetic changes that make the software feel a bit lighter and less like a Pixel. That includes the Quick Settings panel, which now has a nice transparent background à la One UI, a redesigned settings menu, an expanded sidebar that lets you add even more apps for quick access, fingerprint sensor animations, and more. It should all still seem pretty familiar, just with a new coat of paint in some areas to give Motorola&apos;s software a bit more individuality.</p><p>Unfortunately, you won&apos;t find much in the way of AI here, despite that being the hot new thing. That may be due to the limited capability of the chipset, but you do have access to the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a> (despite its absence on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a>), and Motorola has a new AI wallpaper feature that creates a wallpaper from a photo in your gallery. Aside from that, you get all the same Motorola flourishes you should expect, such as the popular gestures to open the camera or turn on the flashlight.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tHug2So4BKzdCfm7xWwEeb" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-review-12.jpg" alt="Side panel app shortcuts on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tHug2So4BKzdCfm7xWwEeb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone also supports Ready For, which is being updated to Smart Connect. This allows the phone to connect to a PC or external display to do some pretty interesting tricks like mirroring the phone display, creating a new instance of your phone on a second display, moving files between devices, and even sharing peripherals like a mouse and keyboard between your PC, tablet, and phone. It&apos;s a pretty handy feature for power users who are always on the go and need an easy way to move things from the phone to the computer and vice versa.</p><p>Fortunately, you won&apos;t find much in the way of bloatware, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/glance-reportedly-us-bound-later-2024">dreaded Glance lock screen</a> makes its presence known on this phone. You can opt out of it when setting up the phone, but it will pop up every once in a while with a notification reminding you that it exists and trying to convince you to turn it on. Nice try, Moto.</p><p>Of course, the downside of the Moto G moniker is that, once again, Motorola isn&apos;t going out of its way to bring major updates to this phone. The company promises one OS upgrade (to Android 15, no doubt, which is launching later this year) and three years of security updates.</p>

<p>The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 has just two rear cameras: a 50MP primary sensor and a 13MP ultrawide. Motorola isn&apos;t known for its camera quality, and you shouldn&apos;t expect much from a $400 phone, but the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 does a pretty good job regardless. Images are sharp, detailed, and vibrant, and there&apos;s even a decent amount of dynamic range. The images won&apos;t blow you away, but they&apos;re perfectly useable.</p><p>The phone also does well in low-light shots, which I expect may have to do with the 2µm pixel size as a result of pixel binning. The phone gets plenty of light and isn&apos;t overwhelmed with noise, which is exactly what I&apos;d expect from a phone in this price range.</p>

<p>The ultrawide camera also isn&apos;t too shabby and doubles as a macro camera, which can come in handy. Motorola gives you the option to auto-enhance your images after they&apos;re taken using Google Photos, but I opted to keep my photos naturally processed, which turned out just fine.</p><p>You may also be happy to know that the phone supports 4K video capture, although you&apos;re capped at just 30fps. You can shoot 60fps, but you&apos;ll have to go down to Full HD resolution.</p>

<p>So, this phone has a stylus. Yeah, it&apos;s in the name, and Motorola actually changed the design to make it thicker, almost giving it an S Pen-like aesthetic. That said, despite the changes, like the larger contact area and updated software to make it more responsive on the display, the stylus is probably the least interesting aspect of this phone. It&apos;s nice to be able to pop the pen out and quickly take a note or sign a document, and the text recognition software can be helpful, but these are features I just don&apos;t make enough use of to really care.</p><p>If the stylus had more useful features like Bluetooth support for remote capture, pressure, and angle sensitivity, or other features found on the S Pen, then I might be more inclined to use it and actually care that it&apos;s there.</p><p>It&apos;s not a bad thing that there&apos;s a built-in stylus pen. But I just don&apos;t find it to be a huge selling point, either.</p>

<p>At this price range, there aren&apos;t many phones that I can confidently recommend. You could go for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a> if you&apos;re willing to spend $100 more on a phone with a great camera and access to many of Google&apos;s best AI features. The phone also has a flagship-level Tensor chip, so performance shouldn&apos;t be much of a problem. Unfortunately, storage is fixed unless you shell out more money for 256GB, and charging speeds aren&apos;t nearly as good as the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024. You&apos;ll also have to be a bit more careful with the glass back.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a> is a good phone that features a unique design with a light show on the back, great cameras, and an OLED display. It also comes with up to 512GB of storage and 12GB of RAM, which is uncommon at this price point. Unfortunately, it&apos;s not as easy to buy the Nothing Phone 2a, as the phone can only be purchased from Nothing when you sign up for a developer account. Plus, the phone doesn&apos;t fully support U.S. networks, meaning you might not get the best service.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-a35-just-landed-in-the-us-with-a-sweet-deal-on-the-galaxy-buds-fe">Galaxy A35</a> is a relatively new phone that could be another good option at this price point. The phone has a 6.6-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a 50MP camera system, and better protection thanks to the IP67 rating and Gorilla Glass Victus. The downsides? Starting RAM is only 6GB, there&apos;s no wireless charging, and Exynos chips are hit or miss.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a phone with a built-in stylus</li><li>You want great performance without spending an arm and a leg</li><li>You care about camera quality</li><li>You don't want a phone with a glass back</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this phone if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the latest AI features</li><li>You care about software updates and OS upgrades</li><li>You care about durability from drops and water</li></ul>
<p>To say that my time with the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 was surprising is a bit of an understatement. My daily driver is usually a flagship Motorola or Samsung phone, but while I used the Stylus 5G, I found myself forgetting that this isn&apos;t a flagship phone. Performance is superb, the cameras are much better than I expected, and the software is a nice step up from previous versions.</p><p>Aside from the annoying Glance lock screen that you can fortunately turn off, the biggest downside is perhaps the software promise, which still pales in comparison to Samsung. I would love to see Motorola change this up and offer even two OS upgrades for its Moto G lineup.</p><p>It&apos;s also a shame that the marquee feature on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is losing its appeal. The redesign is nice, but I don&apos;t find the stylus particularly useful in its current iteration.</p><p>Still, this is by far one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">best phones under $400</a>, clearly punching well above its weight. I mean, the specs alone are enough to give the Samsung Galaxy S24 a run for its money... literally. Sure, a flagship chipset and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> are nice, but if you&apos;re not trying to spend $800 on a new phone, you can easily spend half that and still get great performance with the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Sennheiser is known for its HD series of headphones, but the brand has branched out into the true wireless segment in recent years, and the likes of the Momentum 4 and Momentum 4 True Wireless deliver standout audio on the go. Thankfully, Sennheiser continues to make enthusiast-focused products, and the IE200 may just be one of its best IEMs yet.</p><p>The IE200 is the latest introduction in the brand&apos;s IEM portfolio, joining the likes of the IE900 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie600-long-term-review">terrific IE600</a>. It takes the place of the IE300, with Sennheiser aiming to offer the same sound quality at a more accessible price point. Whereas the IE300 started out at $299, the IE200 retails for just $149 — half the cost.</p><p>There are a few differences between the two; you don&apos;t get the same cable or a hard shell storage box, but the design is identical, and most importantly, the IE200 has the same 7mm driver that&apos;s featured in not just the IE300, but also the IE600. That in itself makes the IE200 noteworthy, and what&apos;s also great is that the IEMs deliver a neutral sound, unlike the bass-heavy tuning of the rest of the models.</p><p>Ultimately, the IE200 isn&apos;t just a great starting point, but one of the best-sounding IEMs you&apos;ll find in this segment.</p>

<p>Sennheiser unveiled the IE200 in January 2023, and the IEMs are available globally. They debuted at $149, but Sennheiser is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-200-Ear-Audiophile-Headphones/dp/B0BRPR38JR">selling the IE200 for just $119 on Amazon</a> and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-US/p/ie-200/">own website</a>, making it an even better value. They <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sennheiser-Wired-Audiophile-Stereo-Earphones-Black/dp/B0BRXQYJFN">cost £119 ($150) in the U.K. as well</a>, and in India, they&apos;re <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Sennheiser-200-Audiophile-Wired-Earphones/dp/B0BRXQYJFN">now selling at ₹8,990</a> ($108), a terrific bargain.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cfBrQvhCQaBzZFW5mT55uC" name="sennheiser-ie200-11.jpg" alt="Sennheiser IE200" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cfBrQvhCQaBzZFW5mT55uC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sennheiser retained the same design with the IE200, but given the IEMs budget stature, it doesn&apos;t get a metal chassis. The IE200 instead get a plastic shell, and at 4g, it is one of the lightest IEMs I&apos;ve ever used. It misses out on the flair that you get with the polished metal housings of the IE300, IE600, and the IE900, but at the end of the day, you&apos;re buying these for the sound quality, and that&apos;s where it truly comes into its own.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SeRQ7d5FERwB4PFU9a3uTH" name="sennheiser-ie200-8.jpg" alt="Sennheiser IE200" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SeRQ7d5FERwB4PFU9a3uTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The build quality is outstanding, and the best part is that the IE200 has the same diminutive size, giving it a great fit. The smaller size and lightweight design makes the IE200 one of the most comfortable IEMs around. There&apos;s absolutely no fatigue even with extended use, and even if you have smaller ears, you&apos;re guaranteed to get a good fit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vDmChMQAMdcXt5fqSCgBh9" name="sennheiser-ie200-1.jpg" alt="Sennheiser IE200" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vDmChMQAMdcXt5fqSCgBh9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sennheiser bundles a good selection of silicone and memory foam tips with the package, but you don&apos;t get a hard shell carrying case, with the brand instead offering a carrying pouch. The bundled tips are decent, but you should invest in SpinFit if you want a tighter seal. The way the sound tube is designed to nestle into the ear canal ensures you get great isolation by default, and that isn&apos;t an issue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2a7Dv32ShPaYNu5XwvpVaP" name="sennheiser-ie200-4.jpg" alt="Sennheiser IE200" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2a7Dv32ShPaYNu5XwvpVaP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, the only thing I don&apos;t like about the IE200 is the default cable; the branded cable is passable, but it isn&apos;t anywhere as good as the cable that you get with the IE600 or even the IE300. It ends in a 3.5mm plug, there&apos;s no memory retention, and it doesn&apos;t have a plastic sheath. Like the other models in the series, Sennheiser uses the MMCX standard to connect the cable to the IE200.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gCtGvwaszfrZyn5CZNHPZM" name="sennheiser-ie200-7.jpg" alt="Sennheiser IE200" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gCtGvwaszfrZyn5CZNHPZM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s understandable why Sennheiser didn&apos;t bundle its usual cable with the IE200 — it costs $149 on its own. Anyway, as I already have the IE600, I used the 3.5mm cable that comes with that with the IE200. Outside of the issues with the cable, the IE200 gets everything right on the design side of things.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Z97ewaccWbSeXqTVPgcZeA" name="sennheiser-ie200-12.jpg" alt="Sennheiser IE200" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z97ewaccWbSeXqTVPgcZeA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With an impedance of 18Ω and sensitivity of 119dB, the IE200 is effortlessly easy to drive. If you have a device with a 3.5mm jack, you can easily power the IEMs without any hassle, and any dongle DACs — like the Fiio KA11 or KA13 — will let you maximize the potential of the sound. I paired the IE200 with the Fiio M23 most of the time, and used it with the MIAD01.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pH5fhTTfnCmKazdNRpRrvF" name="sennheiser-ie200-9.jpg" alt="Sennheiser IE200" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pH5fhTTfnCmKazdNRpRrvF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having used the IE600 extensively over the course of the last two years, I was interested in seeing how the IE200 would hold up. It uses the same 7mm driver and retains Sennheiser&apos;s characteristic neutral tuning, but it misses out on the low-end exuberance that allowed the IE600 to shine. You still get detailed bass, but it isn&apos;t as energetic, and you don&apos;t get that rumble.</p><p>The mid-range is where the IE200 excels, with the IEMs delivering a clean sound with a lot of vigor. Instrument notes come through with plenty of clarity and definition, and vocals in particular shine. The treble is similarly detailed, and while it tends to be a bit bright at times, there is no harshness to the sound, and it is close to the IE600 in this regard.</p><p>It is incredibly easy to drive as well; you don&apos;t need a good source to get the most out of the IEMs, but with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android">best dongle DACs</a>, the IE200 sounds great. </p>

<p>There are dozens of great choices if you want IEMs in the $100 segment. Truthear&apos;s Hexa continues to be a good recommendation, and I like the sound of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tinhifi-p1-max-review">TinHiFi&apos;s P1 Max</a>. Etymotic&apos;s ER2XR is a solid option too, with the IEMs offering good bass and mid-range, along with a comfortable fit.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sennheiser-ie200-should-you-buy-it"><span>Sennheiser IE200: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9gaQ3QUF9jxvHxXamkHQcR" name="sennheiser-ie200-2.jpg" alt="Sennheiser IE200" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9gaQ3QUF9jxvHxXamkHQcR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want comfortable IEMs</li><li>You need a neutral sound</li><li>You want a great value</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a bass-focused sound</li></ul>
<p>Overall, Sennheiser managed to do a great job with the IE200. The small design combined with the ultra-light chassis means you get a great fit all the time, and they&apos;re extremely comfortable — most of the time, I didn&apos;t even realize I was wearing the IEMs.</p><p>Obviously, you&apos;re buying the IE200 for the sound quality, and there is a lot to like in this area. While it isn&apos;t deliver as engaging a low-end as the rest of the models in the series, you still get a clean bass, and the mid-range and treble are detailed. If you like IEMs with a neutral sound and want the best value, you can&apos;t go wrong with the IEMs.</p>

<ul><li>With ChromeOS 125, Google is fully integrating Gemini into the operating system.</li><li>Chromebook Plus purchases will include a free year of Google One AI Premium, making these higher-end Chromebooks the best way to use AI in ChromeOS.</li><li>Google appears to be using a similar strategy as Microsoft's Copilot Plus, linking AI features to hardware</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The age of the "AI PC" is firmly underway, and both hardware and software companies are racing to integrate artificial intelligence into their computing devices. Microsoft and Qualcomm had a big moment with Snapdragon X and Copilot Plus announcements last week, and now Google has a handful of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-finally-get-deeper-gemini-integration-and-much-more">Chromebook Plus announcements</a> of its own. Just like laptops that support Copilot Plus, select Chromebook Plus models will gain new AI features throughout ChromeOS. </p><p>It only made sense that Google would eventually add AI features to ChromeOS since the company has already made Gemini a focus of Android and Google Workspace. In fact, some features that have already appeared on Pixel phones—such as Help Me Write, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">Generative AI Wallpaper</a>, Video Call Backgrounds, and Magic Editor in Google Photos—will now come to Chromebook Plus laptops. </p><p>Of course, ChromeOS users have been able to use Gemini through the web client for as long as it has been active. However, the AI chatbot hasn&apos;t been directly integrated into ChromeOS until now. After updating to ChromeOS 125, there will be a Gemini app right on the ChromeOS app shelf. For now, Gemini on ChromeOS is just using a progressive web app (PWA) to open the chatbot in a separate window. In the future, it&apos;s possible that Gemini could play a bigger role in ChromeOS or even succeed Google Assistant. </p><p>Some features are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-chromebooks-arrive-in-all-shapes-and-sizes-starting-today">exclusive to Chromebook Plus devices</a>, and others will come to all Chromebook models. Google says that they&apos;ll be released "through an automatic update over the next week or so." Based on these descriptions, it&apos;s easy to see how Chromebook Plus devices could be a competitor to Copilot Plus laptops. But can Chromebook Plus <em>really </em>compete?</p>
<h2 id="how-chromebook-plus-compares-to-copilot-plus-2">How Chromebook Plus compares to Copilot Plus</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5egdsQZmNDt5eQJRw2uEGa" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-3-update-page-chromeos-120-beta.jpg" alt="ChromeOS 120 on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5egdsQZmNDt5eQJRw2uEGa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The general idea behind Chromebook Plus and Copilot Plus is the same, but the actual implementations of each are different. Chromebook Plus is a hardware class that is comprised of devices that meet a certain criteria of specifications. By comparison, Copilot Plus is a software suite of AI features that can only run on devices with select hardware. The differences between the meaning of Copilot Plus and Chromebook Plus might sound like technicalities, though they are distinct. For starters, there are Chromebook Plus devices already out in the wild, while laptops with Copilot Plus won&apos;t ship until next month. </p><p>Copilot Plus specifically unlocks AI features by requiring laptops—and likely desktops, eventually—to have a powerful neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU needs to support 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS) or more, and right now, only Snapdragon X systems-on-a-chip meet that requirement. It&apos;s important to note that Copilot Plus system requirements are tied to the NPU rather than a specific class of devices. Only Snapdragon X laptops are supported for now, but Copilot Plus will come to more platforms, devices, and form factors in the future. </p><p>Chromebook Plus is a class of devices, unlike Copilot Plus. In order for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> to use the Chromebook Plus branding, it needs to have an Intel Core i3 12th-gen or higher or an AMD Ryzen 3 7000 series or higher processor. From there, Chromebook Plus laptops need to have at least 8GB of memory and 128GB of storage. Surprisingly, there are also webcam and display requirements, with the webcam needing to be at least 1080p and the display needing to be at least Full HD IPS.</p><p>So, buying a Chromebook Plus device will give you a premium Chromebook and a few exclusive software features, with the possibility of more coming in the future. The Copilot Plus designation is more about support for a specific suite of AI features that run on-device. These differences are important to keep in mind when figuring out which is right for you. </p>
<h2 id="bundling-google-one-ai-premium-with-chromebooks-is-brilliant-2">Bundling Google One AI Premium with Chromebooks is brilliant</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1921px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="FYUtc3yNzGDbMb3vy4Wa5A" name="chromebook-ai-feature-release-hero.jpeg" alt="Overview of new Chromebook and ChromeOS features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FYUtc3yNzGDbMb3vy4Wa5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1921" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Microsoft is clearly targeting on-device processing and advanced features with deep OS integration with Copilot Plus. By comparison, Chromebook Plus and its new AI features are much more cloud-focused. There&apos;s no better evidence of that than Google bundling a free year of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> with Chromebook Plus purchases. Among other benefits, the One AI Premium plan includes access to Gemini Advanced and Gemini for Workspace.</p><p>A full year of One AI Premium will cost $240, and it&apos;s a great perk that comes with Chromebook Plus devices. It makes sense to be included with Chromebook Plus laptops since ChromeOS will now put <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> at the forefront of the experience. ChromeOS also excels at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> workflows, and the Gemini for Workspace features like Help Me Write could be a big advantage there. </p><p>On the flip side, it&apos;s only a free year. If you get used to using One AI Premium, you&apos;ll need to pay out-of-pocket after that 12-month trial is over. Then again, you can get a Chromebook Plus laptop for as little as $349, so it&apos;s hard to complain too much. </p>
<h2 id="it-apos-s-not-copilot-plus-but-it-doesn-apos-t-have-to-be-2">It&apos;s not Copilot Plus, but it doesn&apos;t have to be</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="RA7a5hVxnEoXf4ApdhjP3Y" name="copilot-windows-11-wc.jpg" alt="Microsoft Copilot with Bing Chat" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RA7a5hVxnEoXf4ApdhjP3Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The truth is, Chromebook Plus and Copilot Plus aren&apos;t truly competing. A Chromebook Plus device costs a fraction of the price of a Copilot Plus laptop. Additionally, Chromebook Plus uses a bunch of lightweight and cloud-supported AI features, while Copilot Plus uses powerful on-device processing to support advanced features like Recall. </p><p>A better comparison would be Gemini in ChromeOS vs Copilot in Windows. The addition of Gemini to ChromeOS and the advanced Google AI tools included in Chromebook Plus models will probably be all the AI that casual users need. Copilot Plus didn&apos;t exist before, so Microsoft is going to prove to users why they need the exclusive suite of features. All the Chromebook Plus-exclusive features are things users are already familiar with, like Magic Editor and Gemini.</p><p>Chromebook Plus devices won&apos;t come close to beating Copilot Plus devices in terms of on-device AI performance. However, they might provide just enough AI at just the right price to win over casual users. In fact, casual users were the target audience for Chromebooks all along.</p>

What was once the best-selling budget phone now moved up a segment into the mid-range category, and as I noted last year in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-12-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 12 Pro+ review</a>, Xiaomi didn&apos;t really think its strategy through.</p><p>The Chinese manufacturer is nothing if not obstinate, and the Redmi Note 13 series continued in the same vein. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro+</a> in particular stood out for its gorgeous design — it is still one of the best-looking mid-range phones — but the auxiliary cameras weren&apos;t worth the hassle, it missed out on 4K60 video, and most egregiously, it ran <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> out of the box.</p><p>Other than a few design and hardware differences, the situation was unchanged with the Redmi Note 13 Pro, so I decided to use the phone a bit longer and share long-term testing notes instead. Xiaomi insisted that it would deliver the Android 14 update to the phone by the end of Q1, but it failed to do so; the update started going out at the end of April, and it counted toward three of the guaranteed platform updates.</p><p>The Redmi Note 13 Pro also misses out on the hardware side of things, and after using the sporadically throughout the course of 2024, I&apos;m still not convinced you should buy it — there are much better alternatives available.</p>

<p>Xiaomi unveiled the Redmi Note 13 alongside the rest of the models in the series at the end of Q4 2023 in its home market. The series made its global debut in India on January 4, 2024, and went on sale in the country shortly thereafter. You can now buy the phones in most global markets — including the U.K., Germany and France.</p><p>In India, the Redmi Note 13 Pro costs ₹24,999 ($300) for the 8GB/128GB verison, with the 8GB/256GB model retailing at ₹27,999 ($325), and the 12GB/256GB edition available at ₹28,999 ($350). It is sold in a single 8GB/256GB variant in the U.K., where it costs £299 ($381). Over in Germany, the 8GB/256GB model is €289 ($314), and there&apos;s a 12GB/512GB version that retails for €369 ($401).</p>

<p>To Xiaomi&apos;s credit, the brand did a great job with the design of the Redmi Note 13 series, and the Redmi Note 13 Pro looks the part of a mid-range phone. The key difference next to the Pro+ model is that the Pro has flat sides, and Xiaomi says it was an intentional design choice; it wanted to offer a phone with flat sides as an alternative to those users who don&apos;t prefer curved screens.</p>

<p>There are bevels around the sides that make the device a smidgen more comfortable to hold and use, and coming in at 187g, it is distinctly on the lighter side. The frosted glass back doesn&apos;t pick up much in the way of smudges, and the pastel hue adds to the allure of the device. You get the same hue along the sides as well, and it makes the design stand out a bit more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="e9b8JArFJtUDCTsjGuQFgU" name="redmi-note-13-pro-9.jpg" alt="Redmi Note 13 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e9b8JArFJtUDCTsjGuQFgU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera island has a multi-colored pattern, and it adds visual flair to the design. The individual modules are nestled within rings, and the overall effect is rather elegant. Continuing with the positives, you get a 3.5mm jack on the device, and it is great if you&apos;ve got IEMs and want to plug in without needing a dongle.</p>

<p>What I like the most about the Redmi Note 13 Pro is the display; it uses the same 6.67-inch panel as the Pro+ variant, goes up to 1,800 nits in HDR content, and the only difference is that it isn&apos;t curved. The AMOLED panel has vibrant colors and good viewing angles, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in daily use. There&apos;s Gorilla Glass Victus as well, and the phone came away unscathed the few times it took a tumble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qJNwrKt2Sm7pdH7CFcwE9W" name="redmi-note-13-pro-18.jpg" alt="Redmi Note 13 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qJNwrKt2Sm7pdH7CFcwE9W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I would have liked to see more powerful hardware on the device, the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 is good at the basics. This is by no means a gaming phone — there are better choices available if that&apos;s a requirement — but the phone doesn&apos;t lag in mundane tasks, and there&apos;s not much in the way of overheating.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BftV4RNM4fAKEFXRTLKLXW" name="redmi-note-13-pro-21.jpg" alt="Redmi Note 13 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BftV4RNM4fAKEFXRTLKLXW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rest of the hardware is similarly decent, with the phone offering Bluetooth 5.3, a good set of 5G bands, NFC, and an optical in-screen module that&apos;s unerringly accurate — if located a bit lower on the screen than I&apos;d usually like. There isn&apos;t anything awry with the battery either, and the 5100mAh battery consistently manages to last a day and a half between charges. Unlike most phones in this category, you get a charger bundled in the box, and that is good to see.</p>

<p>Coming to the camera, the highlight this year is that the phone gets the same 200MP main camera as the Pro+ model, and it takes great photos in most scenarios.</p>

<p>Daylight shots have good color vibrancy and detail, and the phone does a good job with foliage and clouds. There&apos;s good dynamic range as well, and I like Xiaomi&apos;s color tuning to Samsung in this category. Low-light shots come out with good detail and color rendition as well, and while there is some noise, on the whole, the larger sensor along with tweaks to the tuning means you get usable shots even in challenging situations.</p>

<p>Using the Redmi Note 13 Pro alongside other mid-range devices, there&apos;s the clear sense that Xiaomi intentionally hobbled the phone. It misses out on IP68 ingress protection — you get an IP54 rating instead, and while it allows the device to withstand splashes of water, it doesn&apos;t cover being submerged underwater. Talking of missing features, the phone has 67W charging tech instead of the 120W standard that you get on the Pro+ model.</p>
<p>But what&apos;s particularly irritating is that the device misses out on Wi-Fi 6 connectivity; you get Wi-Fi ac instead, and that just isn&apos;t good enough on a mid-range phone in 2024. Xiaomi trying to nickel-and-dime users on the hardware side of things is in poor taste, and the brand really ought to have done better in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fQhRzkxz8hFo9XQYdbeLqT" name="redmi-note-13-pro-4.jpg" alt="Redmi Note 13 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fQhRzkxz8hFo9XQYdbeLqT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the main 200MP camera is good, the wide-angle lens is sub-par to say the least, and the 2MP macro module shouldn&apos;t have been included at all. Xiaomi still doesn&apos;t offer 4K at 60fps, and there is no justification to not include the feature. The front 16MP camera also needs an overhaul, and while it takes passable shots during the day, that&apos;s just not the case in scenes with challenging lighting situations.</p>
<p>Then there&apos;s the software. Xiaomi had plenty of time to roll out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> to the device out of the box, but it chose to bundle the phone with Android 13 instead; this means the brand doesn&apos;t have to bother with Android 17 in three years&apos; time, and it still gets to say that it delivered three platform updates.</p><p>The software itself still has plenty of bloatware, and while it is optimized better than MIUI 14, I don&apos;t see enough tangible differences to justify the new moniker.</p>

<p>Nothing&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> continues to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best budget phone</a> around. It has a more interesting design than the Redmi Note 13 Pro, and while it doesn&apos;t use glass, the pattern at the back is unique. You also get better hardware, two usable cameras at the back, and the most refined software in this segment.</p><p>If you&apos;ve used a Xiaomi phone in the past and like all the MIUI features, you should take a look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x6-pro-review">POCO X6 Pro</a>. The camera is almost as good, and you get powerful hardware, great battery life with the same 67W charging tech, and it comes with Android 14 out of the box.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmi-note-13-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>Redmi Note 13 Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="22gwC3gpLJgLKZDpTYtHjW" name="redmi-note-13-pro-20.jpg" alt="Redmi Note 13 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/22gwC3gpLJgLKZDpTYtHjW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're currently using a Xiaomi phone</li><li>You need a good AMOLED screen</li><li>You want all-day battery</li><li>You need a 3.5mm jack</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a phone with a good value</li><li>You need clutter-free software</li><li>You need timely updates</li></ul>
<p>The Redmi Note 13 Pro clearly has a lot going for it; the design is among the best in this segment — as is the screen — and the hardware holds up in daily usage scenarios. If you&apos;re coming from an older Redmi phone, you will find plenty to like here. That said, Xiaomi&apos;s abysmal software policy means you don&apos;t get as many updates as you should, and the UI itself isn&apos;t any different to MIUI 14.</p><p>Ultimately, that&apos;s what limits the potential of the Redmi Note 13 Pro. This is a good phone letdown by poor decision-making, and with plenty of great alternatives to choose from, the Redmi Note 13 Pro just doesn&apos;t do enough to justify its price tag. If you need a new phone, you&apos;re better off with the POCO X6 Pro or the Nothing Phone 2a.</p>

A lot of that is down to the hardware; the Open has a gorgeous design, smooth hinge with no visible crease, excellent internal hardware, a larger battery than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, 67W charging, and terrific cameras.</p><p>While there were software issues out of the box, these have been addressed with subsequent updates. With the Open gaining decent momentum, it&apos;s now time to take a look at what the Open 2 could bring to the table. Obviously, there isn&apos;t much in the way of information about the foldable just yet, but that will change over the coming months. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-2-design"><span>OnePlus Open 2: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5YPXRoyAY3swpXj75cfitK" name="oneplus-open-35.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5YPXRoyAY3swpXj75cfitK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus designed the Open in collaboration with OPPO, and that&apos;s immediately evident when viewing the device next to the Find N2. In fact, the Find N3 is identical to the Open, with the only difference being that it is limited to China, whereas the Open is sold in global markets. </p><p>As such, it is unlikely we&apos;ll see any major design change with the Open 2. While OPPO likes to switch up the design of its Find X devices — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a> has a distinct design that stands out — it has maintained the same styling to all of its foldables, and that isn&apos;t likely to change. </p><p>What could be different is a new hinge that is even lighter than the previous generation. Honor has the distinction of the thinnest foldable in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a>, and as this is a key area of contention between all the Chinese manufacturers, it is entirely likely the Open 2 will feature a redesigned hinge. In fact, recent leaks point to the fact that the Open 2&apos;s hinge will be lighter and sturdier, and it will be interesting to see if it ends up being thinner than the Magic V2. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-2-specs"><span>OnePlus Open 2: Specs</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H" name="oneplus-open-25.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Open has an outstanding hardware package, and that is set to continue with the Open 2. The upcoming foldable will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it should retain the same 67W charging tech. </p><p>OnePlus isn&apos;t messing with battery tech this year, and while it has 150W charging available, it isn&apos;t usable in North America, so for devices that are launching globally, it is limiting the charging potential to 100W or 67W. Considering the limited room on a foldable, I don&apos;t see any changes in this area. </p><p>Having said that, the Open 2 is likely to include a larger battery that lasts noticeably longer. There hasn&apos;t been any confirmation about the battery size, but OnePlus is said to offer up to a 5000mAh battery on the foldable. </p><p>The rest of the hardware is likely to be unchanged, but I&apos;ll update this post once we have credible details. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-2-cameras"><span>OnePlus Open 2: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MFbv8pqxhAinWWcVKYewKD" name="oneplus-open-9.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MFbv8pqxhAinWWcVKYewKD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus did all the right things when it comes to the Open cameras, with the foldable offering a fabulous set of lenses at the back. With 2024 phones pushing the boundaries of camera tech — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, Find X7 Ultra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor magic 6 Pro</a> all have sizeable gains — the upcoming foldable should have some of these gains baked in. </p><p>Then again, considering the launch window of the Open 2, it could be a while before we know what camera hardware the device is packing to any reasonable degree. What you need to know at this point is that the cameras should be on the same level as the OnePlus 12, and that&apos;s a terrific starting point. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GkuiDi9EL2qQjKaytP7bEC" name="oneplus-open-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GkuiDi9EL2qQjKaytP7bEC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus usually likes to have a major release in Q4, but it may be doing things a bit differently with the Open 2. While an earlier launch positions the Open 2 against the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, it looks like OnePlus is mulling launching the foldable in 2025 instead. </p><p>That&apos;s an interesting move, and it means the Open 2 will debut alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> instead. Of course, this is just conjecture at this point, and we don&apos;t know if OnePlus is actually delaying the launch until next year. But as always, I&apos;ll update this post once more information becomes available. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-2-what-i-want-to-see"><span>OnePlus Open 2: What I want to see</span></h2>
<h2 id="oneplus-needs-to-add-wireless-charging-2">OnePlus needs to add wireless charging</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fy7EdSSW3TzME3zjwU23HM" name="oneplus-open-39.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fy7EdSSW3TzME3zjwU23HM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t know who signed off on not including wireless charging on the OnePlus Open, but it is the biggest limitation on the device. Sure, the phone was designed in conjunction with OPPO, and the Chinese manufacturer doesn&apos;t offer wireless charging on its own devices — so you don&apos;t get one here.</p><p>However, the Open is sold in a lot of global markets, and with OnePlus positioning it as the ideal alternative to Samsung in North America, it needed to nail the table stakes features. While the battery life itself is much better than Samsung&apos;s foldables, the fact that it is limited to wired charging — no matter how fast — makes it a little less enticing.</p><p>With the Open 2, OnePlus has to rectify this particular issue and offer wireless charging out of the box. While it&apos;s okay for a device like the OnePlus 11 to miss out on it, the Open costs nearly thrice as much at $1,699, and not having the ability to charge wirelessly is a shortsighted move.</p>
<h2 id="polished-software-out-of-the-box-2">Polished software out of the box</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XfwHZfFvCTHoKYvZ8dSYcF" name="oneplus-open-23.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XfwHZfFvCTHoKYvZ8dSYcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a regular complaint with all OnePlus phones, but I want to see better software out of the box with the Open 2, not a few months down the line. Yes, the ColorOS integration made things that much more difficult, but it&apos;s been two years now, and that cannot be the excuse to deliver shoddy software on every new phone.</p><p>OnePlus has shown that it can deliver; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> was devoid of any major bugs, and it was optimized for the hardware. I know achieving the same on a foldable is twice as hard as there are two screens to deal with and numerous scaling issues, but the Open 2 has to do better. And while we&apos;re at it, can I get a 5x5 grid? I still don&apos;t understand why that isn&apos;t available on the Open.</p>
<h2 id="ipx8-water-resistance-2">IPX8 water resistance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U8WKGQq2BDu7mHJeTEyR4C" name="oneplus-open-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U8WKGQq2BDu7mHJeTEyR4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Open has IPX4 water resistance, and that means that it can withstand an occasional splash of water. OnePlus says that the hinge automatically ejects any dust that manages to get in, and even though it isn&apos;t tested, it should do a decent job with any dust ingress as well.</p><p>That said, I&apos;d like to see IPX8 water resistance on the Open 2. That would make the foldable that much more resilient to the elements, and bring it to parity with Samsung&apos;s foldables.</p>
<h2 id="stylus-integration-would-be-nice-to-have-2">Stylus integration would be nice to have</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H" name="oneplus-open-25.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is another one of those features that feels motivated by OPPO. As the brand doesn&apos;t pay particular attention to global markets, adding stylus integration wasn&apos;t a priority, and the Open misses out on it. I&apos;m not saying the foldable should have come with a stylus in the box — even Samsung isn&apos;t that generous — but the ability to use a stylus with the inner screen makes the foldable that much more useful.</p><p>Even if OnePlus decides it doesn&apos;t want to bother making its own stylus, there are plenty of aftermarket styli that do a great job with note-taking and doodling. I have a half-dozen styli in the house, and while I don&apos;t really use them as much as I should, having the option to do so on the Open 2 would go a long way.</p>

They make for a great desktop computer for most people, excelling at things like web browsing, social media, online shopping, and entertainment. If you want a cheap and easy-to-use computer for your living room so you can watch Netflix and browse Instagram on a big screen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebox">a Chromebox</a> is great.</p><p>The drawback is that they&apos;re not mobile; a good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/buy-a-chromebook-not-a-chromebox">Chromebook and USB-C Hub does everything a Chromebox can do</a> and has the benefit of being able to unplug everything and go along with you.</p>
<p>Having said that, there are a few reasons why a Chromebox could be a better choice. The Aopen Chromebox Mini 2 excels at both because of how it was designed and built: its made for enterprise applications. </p><p>Very few people in a Fortune 500 company use a Chromebox as a server or desktop, so what does that mean? A look at the Chromebox Mini 2 tells the story.</p>
<h2 id="xa0-a-typical-chromebox-2"> A typical Chromebox</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2009px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YmFQ3a9v2FhTZinSLaNMiM" name="chromebox-hero.jpg" alt="Chromebox" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YmFQ3a9v2FhTZinSLaNMiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2009" height="1130" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aopen.com/US_en/products_info/AOPEN_Chromebox_Mini_2/">Chromebox Mini 2</a> is like using any other modestly spec&apos;d Chromebox. It runs the Chrome Browser like a champ, having plenty of memory for literally hundreds of open tabs.</p><p>Support for two 4K monitors means the video looks great. The Celeron processor isn&apos;t the strongest chip out there, but it has adequate power for decoding streaming media or any other sort of entertainment you can imagine while being efficient—it isn&apos;t going to get too hot.</p><p>Because it runs the same Chrome OS as every other Chromebox, you have support for many Android applications as well as Chrome-centric apps. If that&apos;s not enough for you, many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-install-and-run-linux-apps-on-a-chromebook">Linux apps</a> will install and run great, thanks to the Intel X86 architecture. </p>

<p>You could use the Chromebox Mini 2 the same way you use any other Chromebox. From a software and usability point of view, not much stands out. Chromeboxes, no matter the manufacturer, are all designed to work the same seamless way and have mostly the same set of features.</p><p>So what makes a Chromebox "Enterprise-grade?" Are companies really using these? How? Why? That&apos;s a lot of questions, and a few of the Chromebox Mini 2&apos;s features tell the entire story.</p>
<h2 id="ready-for-business-2">Ready for business</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LvmdnCXgq3AAam66cdYqJm" name="Aopen-Chromebox-Mini-2-2.jpg" alt="Aopen Chromebox Mini 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LvmdnCXgq3AAam66cdYqJm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Buried among the specs are a few things that you won&apos;t find on most Chromeboxes or Chromebooks. Let&apos;s have a look at each for a better idea of what makes the Chromebox Mini 2 ready for commercial use:</p><p><strong>MIL-STD, fanless construction</strong>. The Chromebox Mini 2&apos;s body is a solid chunk of aluminum that acts as a heatsink. Combined with a low-power chip like the Celeron N4500, that means as long as you provide ambient air, it&apos;s never going to overheat. </p><p><strong>50,000-Hour MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)</strong>. That means the Chromebox Mini 2 was designed to run for 5.7 years without interruption. Attach the power supply to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-767-powerhouse-review">UPS solution</a>, and it will run until it&apos;s time to be replaced five years from now.</p><p><strong>External Power Switch</strong>. The front panel has a set of connectors, so a normally open remote switch can be wired in. This will act as a power button that you can mount remotely, allowing the Chromebox Mini 2 to be placed out of the reach of curious fingers like mine.</p><p> <strong>APAR (AC Power Auto Recovery)</strong>. If the Chromebook Mini 2 loses power, it will return to the state it was in once power is restored. The board has a rechargeable battery and software to enable this, eliminating the need for a technician to be present during start-up.</p>

<p>You&apos;ve probably seen a Windows error screen on a sign or menu somewhere. These features are all designed to make sure you only see what a company wants you to see.</p><p>You&apos;ll find Chromeboxes used for things like POS terminals and control/informational displays in factories. But they&apos;re <em>really</em> popular for powering digital signs. You may not know it, but you&apos;ve likely seen a sign or menu powered by a Chromebox because it&apos;s easy to set up and well-designed for the task.</p>
<p>When you hear the words "enterprise Chromebox" this is what you should think of. Commercial grade is probably a better term because a Chromebox is perfect for many commercial applications. One designed especially for the task, like the Chromebox Mini 2, makes things even better.</p><p>A simple-to-understand but common scenario: I want to place a menu above the bar in my establishment. The best way to do it is to create a simple backend that builds a viewable webpage in any browser because it&apos;s easy to make quick adjustments.</p><p>If I place a Chromebox behind a large display, I can point the browser to that webpage. I can even use two monitors for another view, an ad, or a menu at the other end of the bar. </p><p>If I can wire a remote switch, know that I won&apos;t have to attach a keyboard and do anything if it accidentally loses power. Know it will run for five years without any issues and that you won&apos;t ever have to worry about cleaning a dusty fan intake. When things aren&apos;t more expensive—the Chromebox Mini 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdw.com/product/aopen-chromebox-mini-2-intel-celeron-n4500-fanless-8-gb-ram-32-gb-e/7868777">retails for $260</a>—I know which model I am buying.</p>
<h2 id="also-ready-for-your-living-room-2">Also ready for your living room</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1765px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.60%;"><img id="HYg7PEQNCEYFHmDvWdsnrV" name="disney-plus-hulu-integration-announcement.jpg" alt=""Hulu on Disney Plus" announcement." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HYg7PEQNCEYFHmDvWdsnrV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1765" height="946" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Disney Plus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You probably don&apos;t own an establishment with a bar, so you don&apos;t need a digital sign or menu. But I&apos;ll bet you own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fire-tv-edition-televisions">a television</a>. Everything that makes the Chromebox Mini 2 perfect for a business also makes it great for your entertainment center.</p><p>Maybe you have gone all-out with a surround system and built-in audio receiver stored inside a dedicated media cabinet in your house. Or maybe you just have a big television on a stand in the living room. A Chromebox is a great way to make the most out of it all.</p>
<p>With a Bluetooth or wireless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Backlit-Keyboard-Touchpad-Wireless-Multimedia/dp/B07QNPX8C2/ref=pd_ci_mcx_pspc_dp_d_2_t_5">keyboard combo remote</a>, you should have a full desktop-class web browser attached to your television and audio system that&apos;s also a Chromecast target. I love my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidias-shield-tv-pro-is-still-the-best-streaming-device-in-2024">Nvidia Shield TV</a> and use one in the bedroom, but this is how I control my media in the living room.</p><p>It would be great to have a Chromebox that never needs to be dusted and will run forever as long as I give it a little bit of air. I could even wire in a switch mounted on the outside of the cabinet, allowing me to mount the Chromebox to the television or inside a cabinet out of sight. </p><p>I get access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">streaming services</a> and my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/beginners-guide-plex">own media</a>, minimal network latency thanks to an Ethernet connection, and a great 4K picture on the television I spent too much money on.</p><p>A<del>n Enterprise</del> Commercial Chromebox is just what I&apos;ve been looking for I just never wanted to spend more money for one. Now I don&apos;t have to.</p>
<p>This isn&apos;t a "regular" review of the Chromebox Mini 2. If it were, I&apos;d tell you that if you need a Chromebox and are interested in any of the extra features designed for commercial use, this one is for you. <strong>Five stars all the way</strong>.</p>

<p>A massive leak of what seems to be thousands of internal documents offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/5-cool-google-search-features-you-didnt-know-about">Google Search</a>, suggesting that Google may have been misleading the public about its search engine operations for years.</p><p>The documents were handed over to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/" target="_blank">Rand Fishkin</a> of SparkToro, a software company, who then made them public. Fishkin, a seasoned SEO expert with over a decade of experience, says a source gave him 2,500 pages of documents, hoping to debunk the "lies" Google employees had said about how the search algorithm actually works (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166177/google-search-ranking-algorithm-leak-documents-link-seo" target="_blank">The Verge</a>).</p><p>The documents spill the beans on internal APIs and break down what impacts search results. From these leaked papers, you can get a general sense of what works and what doesn&apos;t for ranking on Google, highlighting the key elements that matter most.</p><p>These leaks cover a wide range of topics, such as Google&apos;s data collection, which sites get a boost for sensitive issues like elections, and how Google treats small websites.</p><p>Interestingly, some information conflicts with what Google has publicly said. For example, Google has denied treating subdomains differently in rankings and claimed they don&apos;t use click-centric signals for content indexing, yet the leaks suggest otherwise, according to Fishkin.</p><p>Other surprises include using a sandbox for new sites, giving sites an "authority score" to bump them up in search results, and more.</p><p>Google has yet to respond to Android Central&apos;s request for comments, but we&apos;ll update this article when we do.</p><p>It looks like Google accidentally made these documents public on GitHub around March 27, and they were taken down by May 7. However, a third-party service indexed them, so they&apos;re still accessible.</p><p>Even though these documents reveal potential ranking factors, they don&apos;t specify the importance of each one in the final ranking, as SEO expert <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak" target="_blank">Mike King</a> highlighted in his overview.</p><p>Earlier this year, Google launched a major Search update that prioritizes "helpful" content. The new algorithms are designed to determine if a webpage is made for search engines or real people.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update"><span>Update</span></h2>
<p>In an emailed statement to Android Central, a Google representative cautions the public not to jump to conclusions without all the facts.</p><p>"We would caution against making inaccurate assumptions about Search based on out-of-context, outdated, or incomplete information," the spokesperson said. "We’ve shared extensive information about how Search works and the types of factors that our systems weigh, while also working to protect the integrity of our results from manipulation."</p><p>Google also mentioned that it does not traditionally comment on the specifics of its ranking systems. Sharing such sensitive information could help spammers and bad actors manipulate the results, as per the company.</p><p>Search is always changing, and Google says it&apos;s constantly tweaking its systems to provide the best results. The spokesperson added that while Google&apos;s core ranking principles stay the same, individual signals can change often, be dropped, or just be tested and never used.</p><p>The search giant also reiterated its commitment to providing accurate information while protecting the integrity of search results. Finally, Google highlighted the potential for misinterpretation of the leaked documents.</p>

<ul><li>Google is shutting down its Business Messages features, which allowed users to chat with businesses via Search or Maps.</li><li>The shutdown will happen in two phases, starting July 15, users can't send new chats to businesses and businesses will stop receiving texts from July 31.</li><li>Customers can still contact businesses through other modes like phone call, emails or through their websites listed on the Business Profiles.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>On Tuesday (May 28), Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/14919062">announced</a> that it will shut down the Business Messages feature on Google Maps and Search. This feature allowed users to chat directly with businesses through their profiles. Businesses could respond to users either themselves or via a chatbot.</p><p>The tech giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/28/google-business-messages-shutting-down/">emailed</a> several business owners, saying they will not be able to receive messages from their Google Business profile starting July 31. </p><p>"We acknowledge this may be difficult news—as we continually improve our tools, we occasionally have to make difficult decisions that may impact the businesses and partners we work with," Google said in the email.</p><p>The removal of Business Messages means users can no longer initiate quick chats with businesses they find on Maps and Search. This feature could negatively impact communication, as instant conversations will no longer be accessible. Google says users can still reach out to establishments via calls or emails.</p><p>On the user&apos;s end, beginning July 15, customers won&apos;t be able to start new chat conversations with your business from Google. And people in existing chat conversations will be notified about the feature phaseout.</p>

<ul><li>Google stated that Chrome users on Android are in line to receive "minimized custom tabs" for in-app browsing.</li><li>When opening a link, users will notice a new down arrow in the in-app Chrome window, which will shrink it into a floating UI window.</li><li>From there, users can quickly re-tap the window to get back into what they were looking at.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest update for Chrome on Android brings "minimized custom tabs" to developers to better the user experience.</p><p>According to a Chromium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/multi-tasking-with-minimized-custom-tabs.html">blog post</a>, Chrome&apos;s minimized custom tabs are a feature that lets users multitask effortlessly and seamlessly in apps. The post states developers will see this change occur automatically during the roll-out of update M124 in Chrome. On the other hand, users will notice a "minimize" icon when opening a link.</p><p>Using Gmail as an example, Google states that Chrome will open at the bottom of their UI when users click on a link.</p><p>From there, the window can fully expand to the length of a device&apos;s display. The top left corner holds a down arrow, which will minimize the Chrome window into a floating square on the bottom right of your display. Users can quickly tap this box to re-open the Chrome window they were just in.</p><p>Google hopes this "enhances the in-app browsing experience." The company adds that this custom tab method is integrated to help users open links and browse better "across surfaces." Essentially, these custom tabs should work well with other apps across Android.</p><p>When minimized, the custom tab only displays the webpage name and site domain. The site&apos;s logo can also appear, though that depends on the website you&apos;re accessing. Otherwise, it seems users will see the Chrome browser logo in its place.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs">Chrome for Developers</a> explains that minimizing custom tabs ensures that users can put them away and re-open them without losing their place. Additionally, a user&apos;s saved passwords, payment methods, and more will appear as if they were using the main Chrome browser.</p><p>Google had originally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-chrome-custom-tabs-feature-might-add-picture-in-picture-support">started playtesting</a> this update for Chrome&apos;s custom tabs in March during version 122 on Android. Most of the feature&apos;s functionality has remained consistent throughout its beta, with the picture-in-picture style tabs acting as a way to help users stay on task. The beta showed that these multitasking custom tabs don&apos;t work well with YouTube.</p><p>However, the YouTube app already lets users hop out of the app with the video continuously playing in a floating window on their UI.</p><p>Refinements are still pouring in for Chrome&apos;s Custom Tabs as the most recent update for them involved "Read Aloud." Chrome Canary users picked up the ability for the browser to read a page&apos;s contents out loud for them earlier this year.</p>

<p>Phone 2a debuted recently as Nothing&apos;s first cheaper Android phone. Since the company has managed to keep the phone in the limelight with prompt updates and new colorways, there&apos;s now a new special edition of the same budget handset.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">Phone 2a</a> is already a great-looking phone as it retains Nothing&apos;s signature translucent design. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheaper Android handset</a> now has a Special Edition, which looks like a new colorway at first glance, yet it still incorporates Nothing&apos;s signature colors.</p>

<p>Until now, the company has blended in colors like red, yellow, and blue for its audio products separately, such as Ear, Ear, and Phone 2a, respectively. Taking things forward, the Special Edition Phone 2a blends in all three colors at the back as part of a new design, making the first Nothing product to feature more than a single or couple of different colors.</p><p>Adam, Design Director at Nothing, has further shared about the product in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/10897-introducing-phone-2a-special-edition">community post</a>, indicating, "We are very happy to unveil Phone (2a) Special Edition. The first product to explore our palette of the primary colors: red, blue and yellow. Its overall aesthetic references some of our design heroes from the past, whilst creating a new expression for a smartphone. Elevating a functional device into a striking piece of art."</p>

<p>Aside from the notable incorporation of three colors, the rest of the Phone 2a looks like a mix of White and Black and features the same glyph interface and identical specifications. </p><p>However, the Phone 2a Special Edition will be available in 12GB RAM and 256GB onboard storage variants and is priced at £349/ ₹27,999 / €379 for the respective markets, the same as the traditional colorway variants featuring the same storage option.</p>

<p>Nothing says users can grab one of these starting today (May 29) through the company site or associated e-commerce platforms. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> turned out to be an excellent choice and a super valued phone for the cheaper Android phones segment that it is competing in. </p><p>There is no better time for interested consumers since the phone is now being offered in four colorways, and the latest Special Edition is believed to be available in limited quantities.</p>
