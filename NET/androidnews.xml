                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>To say Batman Arkham Asylum practically invented the modern third-person brawler genre is an understatement. The game has been as influential for combat in games as Dark Souls, with an endless stream of reviews regularly comparing a new game&apos;s combat to Asylum&apos;s greatness. Because of this, the development team at Camouflaj knew they had their work cut out for them to successfully translate the feeling into VR.</p><p>When Batman Arkham Shadow launches exclusively on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> later this year, Camouflaj&apos;s founder and studio director, Ryan Payton, told me he expects fans to be thrilled with what the team has built over the past four years. "Given our excitement level and our commitment to this franchise, we felt like the best thing we could do is to ensure that the game is as authentic as possible, and we make the best darn Arkham game we possibly can."</p><p>But this isn&apos;t just another 3rd-person brawler that you&apos;ll be playing from the couch. It&apos;s a new paradigm that lets you <em>become</em> The Batman in a way that&apos;s never been done before in gaming. "We wanted to take what is actually beautiful and special about VR and deliver an experience that they wouldn&apos;t get in a flat-screen game."</p><p>Some fans <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/fans-complain-about-batman-arkham-shadow">initially reacted poorly</a> to the VR-only announcement but Payton and team are hoping they keep an open mind to something new after a solid decade of similar games. Core mechanics have to remain familiar enough for it to feel like a part of the series, though, and that&apos;s where we begin with our interview with Camouflaj.</p>

<p>"From the very beginning of the project, we knew that translating that classic, iconic rhythm-based Arkham combat into VR — so it felt like it was native to the platform, leveraged all the strengths of VR, but still felt like not only an Arkham game, but it felt like an evolution of the Arkham game was — continues to be the greatest challenge of this project."</p><p>When I heard this from Payton&apos;s mouth, my shoulders dropped a bit. Previously, I had been tense with excitement and anxiety, both looking forward to hearing more about the new VR entry&apos;s gameplay and worried that I&apos;d learn it was a collection of mini-games instead of a full-fledged Arkham game. After all, the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/502820/Batman_Arkham_VR/">Batman Arkham VR</a> released on Steam and PSVR back in 2017 was barely more than a tech demo.</p><p>I should have known better after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/iron-man-vr-review-for-quest-this-is-what-it-feels-like-to-be-a-super-hero">Iron Man VR</a>, though, which remains one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> available today even though it was originally a PlayStation VR release. That game was largely centered around the unique locomotion required to make you feel like Iron Man, using each of your hands as rocket thrusters to jet around the game&apos;s scenic locales.</p><p>But Batman Arkham games don&apos;t focus on traversal nearly as much as they revolve around intense combat situations.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>"If we couldn't prove that we could deliver on the combat then this game wasn't worth pursuing."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>"We tackled the most difficult thing from the very beginning. If we couldn&apos;t prove that we could deliver on the combat then this game wasn&apos;t worth pursuing. When we pitched the game to Warner Brothers and our partners at DC, we had to prove to them that we had an execution plan in place for combat."</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that Arkham Shadow wouldn&apos;t exist if it weren&apos;t for the passion of the team at Camouflaj. That passion is what gives me hope that this is the Arkham game we&apos;ve waited a decade for and I find this to be a far more exciting announcement than yet another 3rd-person brawler in the same vein as the previous half-dozen Arkham titles.</p>

<p>"Core Arkham combat entails the sense of feeling that you are doing crowd control," says Ryan Darcy, one of the design directors on the title. It&apos;s internally referred to as "spinning plate gameplay" since you, as Batman, will constantly have to counter enemies while fighting off others at the same time. Enemies wouldn&apos;t take turns trying to kill The Batman if he were a real life person, so why should this happen in a video game where you&apos;re supposed to embody him?</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>"We looked at the Arkham franchise and we also looked at other games in the VR space for inspiration, including Beat Saber for some of the rhythm and also Superhot VR for some of its time dilation."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Payton described Arkham Shadow&apos;s combat as a "flow state" that you enter, something that made a lot of sense as we delved further into how it works.</p><p>"We looked at the Arkham franchise and we also looked at other games in the VR space for inspiration, including Beat Saber for some of the rhythm and also Superhot VR for some of its time dilation to help make combat feel really intentional in terms of what you&apos;re doing as a player."</p><p>If you&apos;ve ever played Superhot VR, you&apos;ll understand how incredible it feels to dispatch enemies in slow motion as if you&apos;re a Hollywood action hero. It&apos;s these nuances of combat-focused gameplay that will make Arkham Shadow feel so special and, yet, still familiar to fans of the series.</p><p>"We&apos;ve been experimenting and iterating on this combat over the past four years to ensure that this is a really fantastic interpretation of the Arkham combat that is, in a lot of ways, the driving force of this game like it is with other Arkham games."</p>

<p>Arkham Shadow takes place squarely between the events in Arkham Origin and Arkham Asylum during "a particularly dark time in the Dark Knight&apos;s life." That&apos;s certainly saying a lot given the hero&apos;s origins story.</p><p>In Arkham Shadow, the city is being overrun with rats who carry a pestilence that drives people insane, causing them to wreak havoc in ways they might never normally consider. This particular ploy is a bit different from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Ratcatcher">The Ratcatcher</a>&apos;s normal poisonous gasses, though, and that&apos;s because he&apos;s not the one in charge.</p><p>Rather, The Rat King is pulling the strings behind the scenes, creating a world that challenge&apos;s Batman&apos;s ethos as a super hero. Batman isn&apos;t about killing and certainly would never intentionally harm ordinary citizens, but The Rat King&apos;s wily ways are forcing Batman to make difficult choices.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>"If it's got an Arkham title on the box, it needs to have all the key elements, including not just combat or investigation, cinematics and boss battles, but that that core fluid locomotion."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Payton says that this duo of bad guys was formulated in tandem with Warner Bros and DC Comics, ensuring that the game not only feels like a mainline Arkham story but also fits right in with the comics.</p><p>Batman&apos;s voice remains in the good hands (or vocal cords) of Roger Craig Smith, and even Arkham Veterans like head designer Bill Green are on board. "Bill Green developed the Arkham games up to Arkham Knight and is a project lead on Arkham VR. We feel confident that this is an authentic new entry into the Arkham franchise" because of Bill&apos;s presence on the team.</p><p>Complete with that is what the studio prides itself in: crafting games that "really put players into the body and mind of these iconic comic book characters."</p><p>"If it&apos;s got an Arkham title on the box, it needs to have all the key elements, including not just combat or investigation, cinematics and boss battles, but that that core fluid locomotion. The Rocksteady team did such a great job with with those with those titles, so that ability to run, slide, mantle up, and, most importantly, use the grapple gun to get into positions of power, such as onto the vantage points that you have in predator encounters, be able to zip onto the tops of buildings and things like that."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="X8YAPzbsYuzitk2g4VwdXZ" name="batman-arkham-shadow-official-artwork-grapple-hook.jpg" alt="Official artwork for Batman Arkham Shadow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X8YAPzbsYuzitk2g4VwdXZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Arkham shadow is designed to be more comfortable than the studio's previous title, Iron Man VR.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Locomotion is a tricky subject in VR because of the medium&apos;s propensity to induce motion sickness if all the factors aren&apos;t lined up just right, but Payton told me that Arkham Shadow is less intense than the studio&apos;s previous title, Iron Man VR.</p><p>"Arkham Shadow is more friendly for a wider breadth of users, but we also don&apos;t have teleportation locomotion options in part because it would break the combat paradigm. We need players who will stay in a place for slow-mo combat. But we&apos;ve learned so much about comfort in VR, not just as Camouflaj the organization but as an industry as a whole."</p><p>What that means is that while Camouflaj has been careful to craft a set of gameplay mechanics that feels naturally <em>Batman</em>, players shouldn&apos;t need to worry about how it&apos;s going to feel when they grab Batman&apos;s cape and glide down to street level to take out some thugs.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Fans won't be dissatisfied with Batman's gadgets in Arkham Shadow. In fact, you start the game with the grappling hook, a testament to the verticality of the design.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>A lot of this has to do with Batman&apos;s trademark gadgets, and the team ensures me that fans won&apos;t be dissatisfied with their implementation in Arkham Shadow.</p><p>"Even in the initial prototypes we were looking at core gadgets like the grapple gun, which you have from the very beginning of the game, as well as the Batarang and how that factors into the core gameplay and puzzles. We don&apos;t want to reveal too many gadgets for now because it&apos;s fun to unlock them over the course of the campaign, but we can reveal that Arkham Asylum&apos;s explosive gel will be in this game."</p><p>Fans will recall that Batman draws a nice little Bat Signal in gel on any wall that can be exploded, and this gel could also be used as a trap for any bad guys walking by. Thankfully, the team seems to be focusing on Asylum as the inspiration for much of the game, as many mechanics in the original game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BatmanArkham/comments/86ictc/the_explosive_gel_mechanic_was_best_in_asylum/">remain the best</a> in the series.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hEm4GuGbHvbgU3gjMuKVzY" name="batman-arkham-shadow-official-artwork-batarang.jpg" alt="Official artwork for Batman Arkham Shadow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hEm4GuGbHvbgU3gjMuKVzY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Many of the game's core mechanics were designed to keep players feeling like they were Batman while taking innate human laziness into account.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Arkham Shadow&apos;s early explosive gel prototypes had players drawing the Bat Signal on a wall but that proved to be less fun than initially thought. Payton told me that he found himself "really quickly drawing just a little bit of gel onto a wall, just enough to make the gadget work" so that he could move forward.</p><p>This inherent laziness goes against Batman&apos;s character and Payton noted that "I really didn&apos;t feel like I was Batman at that point." The team ended up turning the explosive gel into a projectile that forms the Bat Signal on the wall, instead, ensuring one of the series&apos; trademark gadgets doesn&apos;t get ruined by human laziness.</p><p>Likewise, the team built a world that looks and feels a lot more like Asylum than it does City or Knight because they wanted players to enjoy a robust and focused main campaign.</p><p>"We have littered the world with collectables just like you&apos;d find in any of the Arkham titles, but we&apos;re building the game in a way that the puzzles and collectables don&apos;t get in the way of the main campaign. Players who are seeking puzzles will need to go off the beaten path to find them so as not to distract from the dark chapter in Batman&apos;s life by offering shiny puzzles along the way."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="43wQDCfQp2YWNjbuWchbKf" name="batman-arkham-shadow-official-trailer-still-gordon.jpg" alt="A still captured from the official story reveal trailer of Batman Arkham Shadow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/43wQDCfQp2YWNjbuWchbKf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Arkham Shadow is designed to be the length of Arkham Asylum, including lots of collectables hidden around the world for completionists.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But this doesn&apos;t mean that Arkham Shadow is a linear game. Far from it, in fact. Camouflaj is aiming for Shadow to be the length of Asylum, give or take an hour or two. "This is going to be the longest game Camouflaj has ever made," building upon the roughly 10-hour campaign in Iron Man VR and making room for all those collectables for completionists.</p><p>It&apos;s also not a game where you&apos;ll just be going from room to room or enclosed in a small space, as some have feared from this being on a standalone VR console.</p><p>"Verticality is a big part of Arkham Shadow but not quite as big as you might expect in Arkham Knight, for example. You can zip onto tops of vantage point and Predator encounters, or the top of some buildings within Gotham City, get into a position of power, and then to glide kick down to an enemy and then get into a big brawl with various enemies that would be placed throughout the world. Is very much part of the core gameplay loop."</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>"Arkham Asylum, with its Metroidvania-like structure, is our main source of inspiration for how exploration is going to work."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>That&apos;s music to my ears, as I often get too distracted in open world games that don&apos;t do a good job of keeping players engaged and focused on the main campaign.</p><p>"We decided to actually go and look at the first entry in the franchise, Arkham Asylum as our main source of inspiration for how exploration is going to work. So if you remember from that game, it&apos;s not a linear game by any stretch, right? There&apos;s a bit of a Metroidvania inspired flow and structure to it. [Arkham Shadow] has a lot of freedom in the structure that we&apos;ve created, so it feels open. It feels like you have a lot of player autonomy, even if it&apos;s not a fully open world game."</p><p>Notably, the game&apos;s Quest 3 exclusivity will keep its player base fairly limited for the time being. Meta sold over one million Quest 3&apos;s last Holiday season after its initial successful October launch and has likely sold many more in the six months since then. As a first-party Oculus Studios developer, Camouflaj is mainly focused on building the biggest and best game they can to beef up the Quest library.</p>

<p>"The ambitions for Batman Arkham Shadow have been really high since the very beginning. We knew that we were going to be pushing the limits of the hardware, given how big of environments we want to create, and also that we wanted to hit the visual quality we believe Arkham fans are going to expect, given just how beautiful all the previous Arkham games are. We knew early on what the specs for the Quest 3 were and were thrilled to be able to develop an exclusive game for such powerful hardware."</p><p>While we&apos;ve yet to see gameplay footage of the title, it won&apos;t be long until we see the first visual confirmation of what we&apos;ve covered here. Batman Arkham Shadow&apos;s gameplay debut is expected at Gamescom in August and, as an Arkham fan myself, I couldn&apos;t be more excited to see how Batman&apos;s real VR debut is going to take off when the game launches later this year.</p>

<ul><li>Netflix's Pat Flemming detailed the company's upcoming UI changes for smart TVs for a "new TV experience."</li><li>The changes involve providing an in-card show/movie preview when hovered over with your remote alongside content descriptions, genre, episode count, and more.</li><li>The company plans to start this redesign test with a "small group" of subscribers on smart TVs before rolling it out to more folks if it goes well.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Netflix is beginning to test a new home screen design that only a handful of smart TV owners will receive for initial feedback.</p><p>According to an interview between Netflix&apos;s senior director of product, Pat Flemming, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172351/netflix-redesign-homepage-experience-test">The Verge</a>, the changes should help users cut down on the "gymnastics they do with their eyes." Flemming was referring to the current experience Netflix offers with today&apos;s home screen as users often have to scan up the screen to view a show/movie preview.</p><p>Flemming added, "we really wanted members to have an easier time figuring out if a title is right for them."</p><p>The proposed redesign will still feature a large recommended or new title as the initial offering; however, shows and movies will receive a preview card when hovered over. When selected with your remote, the show/movie&apos;s title card will expand and display a quick teaser video.</p><p>Beneath the expanded card, users will find the content&apos;s description, year of release, episode count, and genre.</p><p>Joining this "new TV experience" for finding shows and movies is the removal of the Netflix app&apos;s sidebar on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">smart TVs</a>. The top row of the app will now host your profile icon on the far left, and options like Home, Shows, Movies, and My Netflix will be in the center.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1063px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.44%;"><img id="Q3bLTnrUCPvvkZKHmrEe3U" name="netflix-proposed-smart-tv-ui-redesign.jpg" alt="A look at the proposed home screen changes for Netflix on Smart TVs, which puts its sidebar options on the top of the app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q3bLTnrUCPvvkZKHmrEe3U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1063" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The Verge)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another change that&apos;s set to arrive is that users will no longer have to mash their remotes to get back to the top of the Netflix app. Flemming stated that users can hit the "back" button to bounce back up.</p><p>Flemming informed The Verge that this test is set to begin arriving for a "small group of subscribers" who watch Netflix on a smart TV. If the reception is positive, then the service will look to expand the UI redesign to more users in the "coming months and quarters."</p><p>In other news, Netflix announced earlier this year during its 2023 financial report that 2024 will hold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-teases-price-hike-2024-plan">another price hike</a>. It seems the company is looking at the consumer to aid its efforts in bringing new investments to the platform for additional content. The exact details surrounding Netflix&apos;s next price hike are still unknown, so we&apos;re left waiting until it happens.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung gives users confirmation that a boost for the Galaxy S24&apos;s Instant Slow-mo feature is on the way.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theonecid/status/1798809104267534352">TheOneCID</a> on X posted a screenshot of a Samsung community moderator informing users that HDR10 Plus for Instant Slow-Mo will arrive soon (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-instant-slow-mo-soon-get-hdr-upgrade/">Android Police</a>). This will let users record videos in the higher-quality setting and apply Galaxy AI&apos;s slow motion effect to it without sacrificing dynamic range.</p><p>There are several other Slow-mo updates inbound, too, such as .mov file type editing support for such videos. This will reportedly be done through the editing feature found within the Gallery app on supported Galaxy devices.</p><p>Additionally, the publication notes that Samsung will soon let users share their Slow-mo videos.</p><p>Tapping the "Share" button on any video with the Slow-mo effect will let users quickly send it out to other people. This should toss away the current method of doing so, which involves a waiting period as your device exports it for sharing purposes.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-s/%EC%9E%90%EC%84%B8%ED%9E%88-%EB%B3%B4%EA%B3%A0-%EC%8B%B6%EC%9D%80-%EC%88%9C%EA%B0%84%EC%9D%80-%EC%9D%B8%EC%8A%A4%ED%84%B4%ED%8A%B8-%EC%8A%AC%EB%A1%9C%EB%AA%A8%EB%A1%9C/m-p/27431950#M1097631">community moderator&apos;s post</a> states that the HDR 10 Plus support for the Galaxy S24&apos;s Instant Slow-mo will arrive in the "next SW update." Users will most likely see the updates roll in during the One UI 6.1.1 software patch.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING‼️Samsung has finally achieved HDR10+ videos Instant slow-mo capability and are bringing it soon via a SW update 🎉😎😎 pic.twitter.com/desOGhQRgA<a href="https://twitter.com/theonecid/status/1798809104267534352">June 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The tipster responded to some user concerns, stating the updates to Instant Slow-mo, specifically HDR10 Plus, should arrive for all devices that support it.</p><p>In February, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-confirms-galaxy-ai-slow-mo-feature-past-gen">started rolling out</a> its S24 Instant Slow-mo to older devices like the Galaxy S23 series, the Flip 5, Fold 5, and the Tab S9. The feature piggybacks off Galaxy AI to "naturally" slow down a video frame by frame. Its capabilities are activated by long-pressing a section of a recorded video while watching it. Users can then take it into the editor to spruce things up.</p><p>The Galaxy S23 supports varying ranges of HDR, including its plus variant, so users rocking that device should (ideally) pick it up without a problem.</p><p>One UI 6.1.1 is shaping up to hold quite a few improvements as it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-set-to-bring-vertical-scrolling-back-to-the-app-drawer-in-one-ui-611">recently confirmed</a> in March that Samsung is changing the app drawer. When One UI 6 launched, the vertically scrolling app drawer on Galaxy devices disappeared. A Samsung moderator confirmed that the function will return during One UI 6.1.1 for its Good Lock modules.</p><p>We&apos;re also expecting quite a large <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/next-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-upgrade-might-be-on-hold-for-a-bit">camera update</a> for the Galaxy S24 series. The patch should solve some disappointing HDR and telephoto issues users have encountered. After a delay, it&apos;s been rumored that Samsung could roll out the update in June. It&apos;s unclear if this will be tied to the camera additions in One UI 6.1.1 or not.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-prime-day-faq"><span>Prime Day FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="when-is-prime-day-2">When is Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Although official dates haven&apos;t been announced quite yet, Amazon has confirmed that Prime Day 2024 will occur sometime in July. </p><p>Last year&apos;s event happened on July 11th and 12th, while the 2022 sale occurred on the 12th and 13th. If those past events are any indication, we can safely assume that Prime Day 2024 will happen sometime in the middle of next month. </p><p>I&apos;ll update this guide as soon as the dates are revealed, so check back later for news. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-prime-day-xa0-2">What is Prime Day? </h2>
<p>Prime Day is Amazon&apos;s biggest sale of the year, offering Prime members some of the most epic discounts this side of Black Friday. It started back in 2015 and runs for 48 hours each summer (usually in July). In addition to regular discounts, Prime Day is chock full of flash deals, invite-only opportunities, and much more. </p>
<h2 id="is-prime-day-only-for-members-xa0-2">Is Prime Day only for members? </h2>
<p>Pretty much. Prime Day was specifically designed to benefit Prime members, so the vast majority of deals on the site will only be available to those who sign up for the subscription service.</p><p>If you aren&apos;t a Prime member yet and you aren&apos;t interested in paying the $14.99 monthly fee, it&apos;s worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon offers a 30-day free trial</strong></a> that you can cancel at any time. In other words, you could sign up on July 1st, enjoy all of the money-saving benefits of Prime Day 2024, and cancel your account before the month ends. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-find-the-best-prime-day-deals-2">How do I find the best Prime Day deals?</h2>
<p>In addition to simply monitoring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/deals">Amazon&apos;s deal home page</a>, Prime members can also stay on top of the best Prime Day deals by signing up for the Prime Insider newsletter and creating alert notifications on their favorite product categories. </p><p>I also recommend using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">Camelcamelcamel.com</a> for price tracking and, of course, watching this guide (and Android Central in general) for up-to-date deal coverage and shopping advice.</p>
<h2 id="is-prime-day-only-at-amazon-2">Is Prime Day only at Amazon?</h2>
<p>Prime Day is technically exclusive to Amazon shoppers, but you&apos;ll likely find that all of the retailer&apos;s biggest competitors — including Best Buy, Walmart, and Target — will be launching sales of their own around the same time. Just like past years, we&apos;ll be covering all of the best rival sales that are relevant to Android users, so check back later for news.</p>

<p>If there&apos;s one complaint I have when it comes to being able to do this for a living, it&apos;s the constant neck and shoulder pain. Looking down at my phone, tablet, or laptop for years has done a number on me. While I have a home office with plenty of monitors, that doesn&apos;t really help me if I&apos;m away from home or just want to sit in another room.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I became a dad for the first time, so needless to say, I haven&apos;t left the house much. However, I recently had to take a sporadic, last-minute trip out of town. While I was trying to figure out what to bring with me, I opened a drawer and saw the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-air-2-series-launch">Xreal Air 2s</a> staring at me. So I tossed the case in the bag, not really thinking that I would actually use them, but they would be there if I wanted to.</p><p>Being that this was a last-minute trip, I didn&apos;t really have the best seats in the house. I sat in the middle seat of the last row, so needless to say, there wasn&apos;t much room for spreading out. After a bit of turbulence, I grabbed my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/steam-deck-oled-vs-steam-deck-lcd-what-are-the-differences">Steam Deck</a> and the Xreal Air 2s. In no time, I was entrenched in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hades-2-faq-main-character-early-access-and-other-questions-answered">Hades 2</a>, and before I knew it, we were landing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="jy3EFAxcd53zakb7vPXe6R" name="hades-2-steam-deck-xreal-air-2.jpg" alt="Playing Hades 2 on Steam Deck looking through Xreal Air 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jy3EFAxcd53zakb7vPXe6R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5105" height="2872" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After grabbing some grub and getting to the hotel, I tried to settle in but realized I had left my trusty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">Chromecast</a> behind. Some hotels have smart TVs so it just stays in the bag, but this one in particular didn&apos;t have any "smart amenities." I&apos;m not much of a channel surfer these days, so I lamented in my disappointment and decided to sit down and get some work done.</p><p>One of the neat things about the Xreal Air 2s and other smart glasses is that they are essentially just "plug-and-play." This means you don&apos;t need to install anything if you plan on using them as a monitor. However, if you have a phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> or MacBook, Xreal&apos;s Nebula app can be installed to add even more versatility. That said, I didn&apos;t even bother, as I just needed to not be crouched over my laptop screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Aza6qgdpLnrxGtknahqhFD" name="xreal-nebula-app-on-mac.jpg" alt="Xreal Air 2 settings in Nebula app on Mac" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Aza6qgdpLnrxGtknahqhFD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead, I just plugged the glasses into my MacBook and started working. All of the audio came through the built-in speakers on the glasses, so I didn&apos;t need to worry about my music being too loud to disturb those staying in adjacent rooms. A little while later, I closed up my laptop, grabbed my Steam Deck, and plugged in the Air 2s.</p><p>The one problem, if you want to use these kinds of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-all-different-types-smart-glasses-and-ones-are-best">smart glasses</a> with many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a>, is that you&apos;ll eventually need to charge. Unless you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a>, which sports two USB-C ports, you&apos;ll either need to stop using the glasses or rely on some type of adapter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="vZk5ZTB8ET4sqHhHgQbPD9" name="xreal-hub-with-xreal-air-2.jpg" alt="Xreal Hub with Xreal Air 2 smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vZk5ZTB8ET4sqHhHgQbPD9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, I thought about this when packing, so I made sure to toss the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XREAL-Adapter-Glasses-Charging-Android/dp/B0CZ6PX17L/" target="_blank">Xreal Hub</a> into my tech pouch. This was only recently released, and it allows you to charge your device and use your glasses at the same time. It supports up to 45W charging speeds, but more importantly, you don&apos;t need to worry about video degradation, as the Hub supports 120Hz pass-through.</p><p>Another realization that I&apos;ve come to is that I really could have left almost all of my tech gear at home. Instead, I could have just taken the Xreal Glasses, my Galaxy Z Fold 5, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">Bluetooth controller</a>, and a Bluetooth keyboard. Then, I&apos;d be able to enjoy a larger screen, get work done with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a>, and still be able to play some games, all from a single device. I mean, that&apos;s kind of the dream, and it is something that I plan on trying the next time I take a trip.</p><p>There is one glaring trade-off that I continue to find when using different AR/XR glasses. I have yet to find a set that stays on the bridge of my nose without needing to constantly be pushed back up. It&apos;s really more of an annoyance than anything else, but I figured it was worth pointing out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NomupyCFFTnWVm9BjX7PSH" name="xreal-air-2-galaxy-z-fold-5-desk-setup-2.jpg" alt="Desk setup with Xreal Air 2, Galaxy Z Fold 5, and Mokibo keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NomupyCFFTnWVm9BjX7PSH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Along those same lines, I always feel like the glasses aren&apos;t close enough to my face. I don&apos;t mean in the sense that the virtual screens aren&apos;t large enough, but that there&apos;s just too much of a "gap" between the glasses and what I can see out of my peripherals. Obviously, this isn&apos;t a problem with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a>, but that&apos;s much more bulk to bring onto a plane that I didn&apos;t want to deal with.</p><p>I have yet to try out the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/smart-glasses-mwc-2024">Viture Pro Glasses</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-challenges-apple-vision-pro-with-air-2-ultra-ar-glasses">Xreal&apos;s Air 2 Ultra</a> glasses won&apos;t be shipping until sometime in July. I&apos;m not convinced that either of those would solve my peripheral light bleed "problem." Maybe I&apos;ll just 3D print some blinders or see if the community has come up with any solutions.</p><p>In the meantime, this trip taught me that I need to add the Xreal Air 2s to my everyday carry backpack. And, that I need to get my hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> to see what else I can prune from my everyday carry.</p>

Fortunately, the Big Three carrier is running a promo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s24/"><strong>that&apos;ll get you the flagship phone for 100% free</strong></a>, and all you need to do is add a line with an eligible data plan. No trade-in required!</p>

<p>Are you a Verizon customer in search of a sweet new phone? Add a line with an eligible data plan and the wireless carrier will give you $799.99 over 36 months, enough to make the 128GB Samsung Galaxy S24 totally free. No trade-in is required and both the Unlimited Ultimate AND Unlimited Plus plans are eligible for the deal, so pick the plan that works for you. </p>
<p>As of writing, nearly 400 people have the Galaxy S24 in their Verizon cart, so if you're interested, I wouldn't wait too long to make your move on this deal. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s24/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ed4cac43-541b-42b5-9e60-0e1d96013c71" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a compact flagship phone with a powerful processor and useful AI features; you&apos;re a Verizon customer or looking to switch. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you have an old phone that you&apos;d like to trade in; you prefer to buy your phones unlocked. </p><p>Unlike some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a>, this offer is also nice because of its versatility: you can sign up for either the Unlimited Ultimate OR the Unlimited Plus plan to receive the savings. These two data plans start at $80/month and $90/month for a single line, respectively, but the discounts stack up considerably when you add additional lines. For example, four lines on the Unlimited Plus plan drops the price to $45/month per line, rivalling some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-are-cheapest-data-plans-you-can-buy-us">best cheap data plans</a> on the market.</p><p>If you weren&apos;t familiar, the Samsung Galaxy S24 is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> on the market, coming packed with the latest AI-powered software features, a gorgeous 120Hz AMOLED display, and seven years of Android OS updates guaranteed. </p><p>There are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s24-deals-of-the-month">Samsung Galaxy S24 deals</a> that&apos;ll get you the flagship phone for less than the retail price, but it&apos;s not often that you see a device like this go for free — <em>especially</em> when you aren&apos;t doing a trade-in. In other words, if you were hoping to upgrade your wireless service <em>and</em> get a 2024 smartphone out of the deal, this offer from Verizon has you covered. </p>

<hr>
<p>Another alleged batch of Samsung Unpacked promotional renderings has leaked, further cementing what&apos;s already expected.</p><p>Evan Blass <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Dienotmedia/status/1799094656481087657/photo/1">posted the latest round</a> of renders, which have been given the mosaic treatment to avoid Samsung&apos;s stern gaze (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/07/samsung-galaxy-foldables-watches-ring-leak/">9to5Google</a>). The first set of images seems to tease the upcoming Galaxy Ring in silver, black, and gold finishes. Next, there&apos;s an image of the Galaxy Watch 7 with an orange color scheme across its band and second hand.</p><p>The image seems to show the Watch 7 splashed in water, and as the publication notes, Samsung could look to promote its water resistance capabilities.</p><p>There&apos;s another image, a top-down view, that seemingly shows off every device ranging from the Galaxy Z Flip 6 to the Fold 6 and the Watch 7. That photo is a little harder to unpack (no pun intended) regarding the wearables.</p><p>However, it <em>looks </em>like the Galaxy Watch 7 will pick up a gray or maybe black color option for consumers.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hmm... pic.twitter.com/wJgJe45J9b<a href="https://twitter.com/Dienotmedia/status/1799094656481087657">June 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Blass <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MoisesElPro2/status/1799033786451329208">also shared</a> a much closer but pixelated look at the Flip 6 and Fold 6. We won&apos;t have to squint our eyes at this one, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-spotted-in-an-ad">Samsung leaked those images</a> a few days ago. The company&apos;s Asian-based website accidentally posted promotional imagery for the upcoming foldables early.</p><p>It seems confirmed that the Fold 6 is in line for a slight redesign as it boasts sharp edges and flat sides. Its cameras will also be stacked vertically in a single camera visor. Compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">the Flip 5</a>, the new Flip 6 seems to feature the same design theme, which isn&apos;t <em>too </em>surprising.</p><p>While it&apos;s hard to tell which Galaxy Watch 7 we&apos;re looking at in those leaked materials, there have been rumors about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">Watch 7 Ultra</a>. Speculation states Samsung could throw out an all-new design for the device, providing it with a squarish body beneath the classic circular watch face.</p><p>With these leaks continuing, it&apos;s worth remembering that Samsung is rumored to host its summer Unpacked event on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

<ul><li>Max's Ad-Free tier pricing now starts at $16.99, and the 4K plan at $20.99 per month.</li><li>The yearly plans of the same tier have also been increased, now costing $169.99 and $209.99 per year, respectively.</li><li>New plans will apply to Max's subscribers starting July 4.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Max, formerly known as HBO Max, has released updated rates for its current ad-free plans. The rates show a $1 bump in the cost of the tier plans overall and the ad-free ones in particular.</p><p>According to Max&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.max.com/US/Answer/Detail/000002547">support page</a>, the Ad-Free plan starts at $16.99 per month and $169.99 per year, a significant bump from the previous $15.99 per month and $149.99 per year, respectively. Similarly, the Ultimate plan, also known as the 4K plan, will now cost $20.99 per month, and the annual plan will see a $10 rise, making it $209.99 per year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:550px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.18%;"><img id="Zvtyk5GizdywnZVBcvr3HV" name="westinghouse-roku-tv.jpg" alt="Smart TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zvtyk5GizdywnZVBcvr3HV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="550" height="364" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Westinghouse)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Users must bear in mind that these prices don&apos;t include applicable taxes. The plans with ads will remain the same, costing $9.99 per month and $99.99 per year. For people who opt for the streaming subscription directly through Max or from the app store, the new rates are applicable after July 4. </p><p>However, some carriers like Verizon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/verizon-rumored-to-combine-max-and-netflix-cheaper-plans">also offer</a> Max streaming subscriptions — they individually will let users know about the change in subscription prices whenever applicable.</p>
<p>To make up for its losses in 2022 and 2023, Max, like most other streaming providers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/max-prepares-password-sharing-crackdown">announced</a> intentions to restrict password sharing for its users early this year. </p><p>Max believes that Netflix&apos;s password crackdown strategy has been successfully adopted, and Max also ought to make plans to crack password sharing later this year with a larger rollout scheduled for next year. Shoppable advertising will be among the "ad format enhancements" that users may see, as Max is also considering introducing them.</p><p>The hike in pricing has been a common trend across the streaming giants over the past year. More recently, Peacock has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/peacock-raises-monthly-subscription-price-two-dollars">announced</a> a rise in subscription plans just in time for the Olympics, as users would have to shell out more starting from July 18 (for new consumers), which is applicable for existing consumers on August 17.</p>
