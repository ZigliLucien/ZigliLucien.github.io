The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Amazon-Kindle-Kids-glare-free/dp/B0CNVBS5JN"><strong>6-inch Kindle Kids is $94 ($35 off)</strong></a>, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids/dp/B0CFPNV5KM"><strong>7-inch Kindle Paperwhite Kids is $139.99 ($40 off)</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Out of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">best Kindle e-readers</a> today, the Kids Paperwhite Edition (12th Gen) is high up on our list. So far, we've only reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-kids-11th-gen-review">11th-Gen Kindle Paperwhite Kids</a> — it's hard to keep up with every release — but our parent reviewer loved it for its two-month battery life and distraction-free software. The 12th-Gen tablet lasts <em>three</em> months per charge, has the upgraded display tech for better contrast, and adds another 0.2 inches of display space. Basically, what was already great got even better!</p>

It also comes with a fun case in the box to help protect it from rough treatment.</p>

<p>The best part of buying either Kindle is that it's limited. Sure, you can buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Kids-Pro-Tablet-Hello-Teal-32GB/dp/B0D1DMSV9G"><strong>Kindle Fire HD 8 Kids Pro for 50% off</strong></a> so they can stream content as well as read, but I think it's pretty obvious what'll be more appealing to a kid if both options are presented! Giving them tablet time with an e-reader ensures their brain gets a break from YouTube endorphins, so they can focus on learning and imagination instead!</p><p>That being said, if you want to give your kid the most possible content, from shows to books, the Kindle Fire deals are more affordable at the moment! The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10_Kids_Pro/dp/B0BL5C43SL"><strong>Fire HD 10 Kids Pro is $80 off ($109)</strong></a>, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-Kids-tablet-Top-selling/dp/B0BL8WSCH3"><strong>Fire 7 Kids is only $54 (50% off)</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you're looking for an easy-to-use smart display that's compatible with the Alexa ecosystem and a wide range of smart home devices; you're looking for something that works with popular streaming channels like Amazon or Apple Music, Prime Video, Netflix, and more;  you want a smart display that's easy to use for video calling.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a smart display that can be rotated, like the Echo Show 10; you're looking for something even more affordable than this deal can offer.</p><p>The 2023 Amazon Echo 8 is our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-echo-show">best Amazon Echo Show</a>, featuring everything most users want in a home-integrated smart display. We like this Echo's mid-sized display, its auto-framing camera and noise reduction features for video calling, and the 1,280x800 resolution, which is the same as the 10 but offers a higher pixel ratio per inch. Amazon's Echo Show products also come with a physical camera shutter, as well as a physical off button for the microphone and camera, making it a decent privacy pick compared to some competitors.</p><p>There are a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/amazon-echo-show-8-3rd-gen-vs-echo-show-8-2nd-gen">differences between the second and third-gen Echo Show 8 </a>beyond the size, including a slightly faster chipset, a front-facing camera that's built into the center, and spatial audio processing that wasn't included on previous releases. It also features a slightly higher price tag, though that won't be a problem for those taking advantage of this deal.</p><p>The new version also includes support for a wider range of other smart home devices, including those from Zigbee, Matter, and Thread.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>As a tech reviewer, it's rare that I use <em>any</em> product for that long. In just the past few months, I've gone through about 20 laptops and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a> combined. But there's one thing that has been a staple of my tech EDC (everyday carry) for more than a year, and it's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/review-ugreen-145w-25000mah-power-bank-review">UGREEN 145W power bank</a>. No matter how lightly I'm packing, this 25,000mAh portable charger comes with me. To that end, I've stuck this thing in my back pocket before going into sporting events at Madison Square Garden — that's how much I can't live without it.</p><p>If you're in the market for a power bank, I've got great news: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-25000mAh-Portable-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0BJQ7F16T/"><strong>the UGREEN 145 power bank is down to just $66 at Amazon. That's thanks to a 25% off Black Friday deal and a $10 coupon.</strong></a> Considering that this same power bank retailed for $150 when I reviewed it, this makes for one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/samsung-black-friday-2024-deals">Black Friday and Cyber Monday's</a> most underrated deals. It's so good, I'm not even sure you need to be in the market for a power bank — no one should pass this up.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need a high-capacity portable charger; you want a power bank that can charge everything from your earbuds to your phone, tablet, and laptop; you want a versatile and feature-rich charger with multiple ports, port types, and an LED display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a compact and easily-pocketable solution (the UGREEN power bank does fit in some large pant or coat pockets, though it's a tight fit); you want a power bank with wireless charging.</p>
<p>There are a few things that I love about this charger, starting with its size and capacity. It's a 25,000mAh power bank, and when you consider that most phones have a capacity of mAh of around 5,000, that's a ton of power. I can charge most phones at least a few times, and charge tablets and laptops from 0% to 100% with no problems. That means I don't have to stress about charging anymore; I simply make sure the UGREEN 145W power bank is always charged, and it'll take care of all my devices with one USB-A port and two USB-C ports.</p><p>The UGREEN 145W power bank is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">best portable chargers</a> out there because it has <em>both </em>capacity and speed. It supports 145W total power delivery, so even power-hungry devices can stay powered up by this charger. Additionally, I think this power bank has the perfect display. It shows the power bank's state-of-charge in simple LED form, which is better than the unnecessary and wasteful LCD screens on some portable chargers.</p><p>Throw it all together, and it's shocking that you get this much power and features in a power bank that can still fit in my back pocket. At $66, I'd recommend anyone who has an Android smartphone or a tablet buy the UGREEN 145W power bank for Black Friday.</p>

<p>Many of the biggest AAA Quest games aren't eligible for the 40% discount, but I've noticed that if you click on a link for full-price games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/batman-arkham-shadow/3551691271620960">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/assassins-creed-nexus-vr/5812519008825194/">Assassin's Creed Nexus</a>, you may see a 20% "Holiday promotion" pop-up (see the screenshot) for any game if you click on a third-party link. Hopefully these links will work, and you can save a little extra!</p><p>Otherwise, if you're a new or current Quest 3 / Quest 3S owner, check out our guide on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Quest 3 accessories</a>!

I just left my post to explore Verizon&apos;s Black Friday sale and found a bounty of deals that shouldn&apos;t be missed, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe/"><strong>this offer that gives you a FREE Samsung Galaxy S24 FE when you add a line</strong></a> to your wireless service. </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><em><strong>Verizon's Black Friday sale ends soon — check out the full list of deals before it's too late</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>The Unlimited Welcome, Unlimited Plus, AND Unlimited Ultimate plans will all earn you enough promo credit to get the phone for free, and you don&apos;t even need to worry about going through the hassle of a trade-in. Some carrier deals have so much fine print that the offer doesn&apos;t even seem worth it. This is <em>not </em>one of those deals.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you love <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> but want something cheaper than the S24 series; you value big AMOLED displays and great battery life; you&apos;re comfortable making a change to your wireless service. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer buying unlocked phones; you&apos;re looking for a trade-in opportunity; you can spend a little bit more on a better phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> or standard Galaxy S24. </p><p>The closest thing Samsung produced to a "flagship killer" in 2024, the Galaxy S24 FE boasts a gorgeous 6.7-inch AMOLED display, an ultra-efficient Exynos chipset, and seven years of OS and security updates. You also get all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features that Samsung has been promoting so much lately. </p><p>Indeed, this is a great phone, and this offer from Verizon is a great deal, so why do I feel the need to include an asterisk here? Well, the Galaxy S24 FE suffers from a bit of a pricing problem. At $649.99 retail, it&apos;s too expensive to be considered a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a>, but it&apos;s not quite impressive enough, spec-wise, to earn a spot among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> of the year. Instead, the Fan Edition phone sits in an awkward smartphone purgatory, especially when Black Friday sales are currently dropping flagship phones to around the same price (or lower).</p><p>So, what&apos;s the right call here? Well, if you&apos;re a Verizon customer like me (or willing to switch) and the Unlimited Welcome plan works with your budget, this deal on the Galaxy S24 FE is one of the best no-trade-in deals around. </p><p>If that doesn&apos;t work for you, there are plenty of other outstanding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday-2024">Black Friday deals</a> to consider — just don&apos;t wait too long to make your move. </p>

<ul><li>Casio unveiled an odd product for the 50th anniversary of the Casio Watch, and it's a ring.</li><li>The "ring-sized version" of a Casio watch costs $120 and is coming in December 2024.</li><li>Initially thought to be a Japan exclusive, the ring watch was recently spotted on Casio's US store, confirming a stateside release.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>When we first heard about Casio's upcoming ring watch, we thought it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/casio-smart-ring-gimmicky-design-may-show-future-smart-rings-sort-of">akin to an April Fool's joke</a>. However, it turns out that the Casio CRW-001-1JR isn't entirely a Japan exclusive. The Casio CRW001-1 is the exact same as the CRW-001-1JR, except it'll be available in the US starting next month at a retail price of $120 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/28/24308313/casios-ring-watch-is-coming-to-the-us-for-120" target="_blank">The Verge</a>).</p><p>It's an interesting concept, to say the least, and this "ring watch" is exactly what it sounds like. It's a ring-sized version of Casio's classic watches designed to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Casio Watch. And although it's a strange product — it has none of the modern smart watch features you're probably familiar with — it took a lot of clever engineering to get here.</p><p>The Casio CRW001-1 is made entirely out of metal, and Casio says it had to use special processes to use injection-molding to create a unified case, case back, and ring. At the same time, it's still a traditional watch, so the battery still needs to be replaced. That's why Casio used a unique glass adhesive method to create a water-resistant seal that still makes it possible to replace the battery.</p><p>Speaking of battery life, it's claimed to last two years and simply uses a SR621SW button battery, and can be replaced. In a way, that makes the Casio CRW001-1 more repairable than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> — and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a> — you can buy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WpFQxZzWZ4sPi8pmBrniRm" name="Casio-smart-ring-press-photo-1" alt="A press photo showing a person wearing the Casio CRW-001-1JR smart ring on their index finger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WpFQxZzWZ4sPi8pmBrniRm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Casio)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the end of the day, you have to wonder if Casio saw the weirdly-positive reception to the Casio CRW-001-1JR and decided to bring it to the US — or if this was always part of the plan. With a $120 price, it's expensive for what it is, but isn't actually that overpriced when you consider the going rates for rings, watches, and collectibles.</p><p>This is clearly a novelty item, but with a December 2024 release, it could make for a great gift for a gadget-lover. I know it's something that I'd want in my personal collection, even if I probably wouldn't replace my smartwatch or smart ring for it.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>A while ago, I saw a video on TikTok from an influencer that absolutely sent my brain into a spiral.</p><p>SamDoll, who is the influencer, went on a rant about how she bought the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> and absolutely hated it. Her rant was infuriating and actually really upset me because not only was she speaking without much knowledge about the actual ring, but she also has the capability of influencing her nearly one million followers.</p><p>While she did make some accurate points <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sam_d0ll/video/7401947251007933702">in her video</a>, I genuinely did not agree with what she was saying for the most part. It made me realize how important it is that I reiterate to you, our valued readers, how important it is to not get sucked into what regular, everyday influencers say about tech products.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Black Friday Deals</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/early-black-friday-garmin-deals-2024-ditch-your-old-smartwatch-and-save-big-on-forerunner-venu-and-more">Black Friday Garmin deals</a><br>-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/black-friday-fitbit-deals-2024-charge-sense-pixel-watch-more">Black Friday Fitbit deals</a><br>-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024-early-deals-and-how-to-prepare-for-the-big-sales">Black Friday Samsung deals</a><br>-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2024-early-discounts-and-how-to-prepare">Black Friday Google Pixel deals</a></p></div></div>
<p>More importantly, as you spend your hard-earned money on products this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/black-friday-smartwatch-deal-hunters-should-look-at-smart-rings-instead">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday weekend, then you should be looking to read reviews from trusted sites like Android Central. If you are keen on listening to what influencers say, then you should follow tech influencers who take particular interest in providing the best information that is relevant to help you understand products. <br><br>On that note, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-gen-3-black-friday-cyber-monday-2024-deal">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> is the wearable that pretty much kicked off the smart ring craze, and its best style is currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">up to $100 off</a> depending on the color you want, making it a good alternative if you want a great smart ring without breaking the bank.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="ZeL4osJY3BrAb3RHRpgZ9X" name="Oura-app-v6.jpg" alt="Oura app tabs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZeL4osJY3BrAb3RHRpgZ9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the main points that SamDoll makes in her video is how the ring keeps telling her a lot of information that she doesn’t understand, and she also claims that the ring isn’t doing the job right.</p><p>In one example, she complains about how she felt like she had a horrible night’s sleep, but when she woke up, the ring indicated her Readiness Score (but she inaccurately calls it recovery) was at 80 percent. <br><br>What SamDoll didn’t include in this portion of the video is what the Oura Ring Readiness score is and what it is based on:<br><br>“Your Readiness Score reflects how balanced your recovery and activity are. It looks at your sleep quality, body signals, and activity levels to show how prepared you are to take on the day,” according to the Oura website. It is not just based on how well you sleep. Even if you had poor sleep, your body throughout the day could have recovered well.</p><p>When you do not express to your nearly one million followers what the ring actually is collecting and how it contributes to the overall score, you’re providing inaccurate information because they’re not getting the whole picture.</p><p>It deters a user from wanting to buy something because they trust what you are saying. That is why it is important to ensure you, our valuable reader, are going to trusted sources who take a lot of time to test products to give you the information you need.</p><p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's worldwide device trackers, reiterated the importance of experience.</p><p>“Advice from experts is simply more valuable and enlightening and consumers should focus on that. However, the reality is that anyone with a loud enough voice can make or break a product, so it’s in companies’ best interest to also collaborate with influencers outside of tech,” he said.</p>
<h2 id="the-oura-ring-is-not-for-fitness-it-is-for-your-health-2">The Oura Ring is not for fitness, it is for your health </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="Yp7TetoRuQK8dJCY5XRDbM" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-colors.jpg" alt="Four Oura Rings in different finishes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yp7TetoRuQK8dJCY5XRDbM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1192" height="671" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>SamDoll, later in her video, expresses her distaste for how the ring doesn’t automatically detect her workout, and when she plugged her workout into the ring app, it didn’t provide her with accurate information on how many calories she burned.</p><p>In the initial stages of the Oura Ring, which, in my experience, is the gold standard of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a>, it took a while for the ring to actually detect and accurately provide workout information.</p><p>That since has changed and is incredibly accurate. Android Central’s managing editor, Derrek Lee, has noted how the ring is great at detecting common activities like walking and running. He had expressed to me about a time when he went out with friends dancing, and the ring, later on, indicated that he had some activity and labeled it as dancing, something it has accurately deduced on more than one occasion.</p><p>While he often manually tracks workouts with the ring, it will sometimes automatically detect more ambiguous activities like high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and yoga.</p><p>But that being said, I don’t actually think the Oura Ring is for fitness; rather, it’s meant to be an overall health tracker and monitor. I think the purpose of the ring is to help you understand your body, and as such, I actually think it would be better paired with another wearable like an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> if your desire is to monitor fitness.</p><p>Ubrani agrees, adding that a smart ring is a “replacement for the health-related aspects of smartwatches.”</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3683px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="EJAQEkw7PQTwtTtvCLbMyh" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-Fossil-Gen-6-Wellness-Edition.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring (Gen 3) next to the Fossil Gen 6 Wellness Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EJAQEkw7PQTwtTtvCLbMyh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3683" height="2072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While SamDoll made a lot of claims in her video that I did not agree with—and there were more than what I detail in this article—I did agree with her on one major point.</p><p>She expressed how the Oura Ring is already an expensive device (starting at US$299), which it is. But to top it off, if you really want the best experience with the ring, you need to pay an additional $5.99 before tax per month for the subscription service. Granted, the subscription service does come with a lot of features like the following:</p>
<ul><li>Detailed sleep analysis</li><li>24/7 heart rate tracking (Daytime, Nighttime, Activity)</li><li>Integration with third-party health and wellness apps like Strava</li><li>Advanced temperature monitoring</li><li>Blood Oxygen Sensing (SpO2)</li><li>Cardiovascular Age</li><li>Cardio Capacity (VO2 Max)</li><li>Cycle Insights</li><li>Daytime Stress</li><li>Dynamic activity goals with Automatic Activity Detection</li><li>Oura Labs</li><li>Pregnancy Insights</li><li>Resilience</li><li>Weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, and anniversary reports</li></ul>
<p>But that’s a lot of money, especially when no other company that produces a smart ring requires an additional paid subscription to enjoy the ring (even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-gets-permanent-price-drop-and-free-subscriptions">Amazfit got rid of its subscription</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Helio Ring</a>). Basically, all the most useful Oura Ring features are hidden behind a paywall.</p><p>I strongly urge Oura to rethink this idea, as it can also be a deterrent for users who may consider buying a smart ring. That said, Oura explains that it does this because it uses the money to invest in its features and its technology. This is why we see the ring constantly getting new features, even years after the Gen 3 launched.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1519px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="ioTNWH58SuWBGMQyRhkU2P" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-Horizon-hero.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring Gen 3 Horizon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ioTNWH58SuWBGMQyRhkU2P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1519" height="855" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oura has been around for many years, and we do know that the company strives to do more to help people with their health, which it has proven with the newer and excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a>.</p><p>Like me, Ubrani also agrees that the ring is the gold standard for smart rings only because the company has done a “great job in offering a very polished and well-rounded experience for users, which in turn has set a high bar for competition.”</p><p>Oura has been able to do this only because they had a massive lead up in the market, also providing them much more time to refine the experience of the ring.</p><p>But more importantly, I think, in general, if you’re going to buy something during Black Friday or Cyber Monday, try to do more homework than just relying on one creator.</p>

<hr>
<p>In the past, Samsung has been forced to choose between making foldables thinner or including stylus support. That's because phones that work with the S Pen require a digitizer, which makes the entire display assembly thicker. However, the company is looking to develop a display technology that can register S Pen input without having a digitizer, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=31433">The Elec</a>.</p><p>The company recently released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-6-might-be-flopping-in-the-us-but-its-special-edition-is-winning-in-korea">Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition</a>, which, among other things, featured a slimmer form factor. While the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> measured 12.1mm when folded, the Special Edition — exclusive to Korea — measured 10.6mm when folded. The Elec reports that the display digitizer accounted for 0.3mm thickness, and when  removed, helped Samsung shave off 0.6mm total.</p><p>But the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition didn't support the S Pen as a result, creating a clear trade-off.</p><p>"Samsung Display is also developing a technology that can recognize stylus (S-pen) without a digitizer with its partners," wrote Lee Jong of the Elec, translated to English. "A digitizer is a flexible circuit board used to grasp the position of the S pen in the form of a grid."</p>

<p>"The time of mass production application of technology that recognizes the function of S pen without a digitizer has not yet been decided," Jong continued.</p><p>Separately, Samsung is experimenting with using glass back plates within folding phones, commonly referred to as "internal hinges." According to The Elec, this would be a first of Samsung, which uses steel use stainless, carbon fiber reinforced plastic, and titanium across its various foldable offerings currently. Glass is viewed as an alternative by Samsung due to the material's lightweight characteristics and lower cost. Additionally, the move could be part of an effort by Samsung to limit the amount of materials that need to be imported from China.</p><p>The Elec reports that an industry official predicted that "it is difficult to apply mass production next year right now, and we can only expect it to be in 2026 at the earliest."</p><p>These two developments may be crucial as Samsung tries to compete in a grueling foldable market, but it appears that neither will be ready for the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p>

The Snapdragon chip is snappy, the cameras are pretty good, and the large cover screen is a joy to use. Not to mention, battery life is surprisingly great, and I don't find myself struggling to keep a charge like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">2023 Razr Plus</a>.

The phone is also slated to get Android 15 at some point, so it already feels like the phone is adding more value the more I use it. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> may be the more powerful phone, but the Razr Plus 2024 feels like the true kind of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> this year.</p><p>And if you want to know <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-motorola-razr-plus-2024-should-you-buy">what color Razr Plus 2024 you should buy</a>, I'm partial to the green model, which has a nice grassy feeling to it.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus is pushing a second Android 15 update to its 12 series phone, which brings in the company's promised AI features.</li><li>The OnePlus 12 is picking up several features under the "AI Retouch" and "AI Writing Suite" monikers for photo reworks and writing assistance, respectively.</li><li>The first Android 15 update was pushed early in November; however, OnePlus highlighted that its AI features were still in testing.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Another update is starting to roll out for a past-gen OnePlus device that makes good on the company's promise.</p><p>The Chinese OEM <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1738602115003056133">posted its changelog</a> for its second Android 15 update for the OnePlus 12 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/11/oneplus-12-second-android-15-update.html">Android Headlines</a>). OnePlus notes that the update that's rolling out (vCPH2573_15.0.0.305) is getting its start in India <em>before </em>arriving in North America, Europe, and other Global areas next week. Additionally, the update concerns OxygenOS 15 users, leaving those with OxygenOS 14 to wait as the company is "working to provide the update for you soon!"</p><p>More importantly, this update is bringing a couple of AI-based features to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>.</p><p>Thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, users will soon have access to AI Retouch. OnePlus states this will let users enhance the clarity of a "cropped, distant, or low-quality" picture. AI Retouch also includes "Unblur," which is said to assist in restoring colors, lighting in blurry photos, and other important details.</p><p>Lastly, "Remove Reflections" uses AI to remove unsightly mirroring effects found on glass for a "clearer more authentic" photo.</p><p>Additionally, the second Android 15 update brings AI Notes to the OnePlus 12. Kicking that off is the "AI Writing Suite" with tools to help you polish your drafts and "optimize" the AI's writing style to get the heavy work done for you. "Format" is said to bring your scattered notes into a more cohesive form while "Clean Up" removes "filler words" to facilitate more structured sentences.</p><p>OnePlus threw in support to instantly share live photos with iOS devices and the dependability of Bluetooth. The remainder of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Contacts can now be switched to a floating window.</li><li>Photos can now recognize boarding passes and add them to Google Wallet.</li><li>Apps in large folders can now be displayed in 3 × 3 grids.</li><li>Fixes an issue that might cause some apps to crash.</li><li>Fixes a display issue where some app icons might overlap with other elements when pulling down the Quick Settings in the Photos app after restarting the phone.</li><li>Integrates the November 2024 Android security patch to enhance system security.</li></ul>

<p>OnePlus initially pushed its major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-12-is-now-getting-the-stable-android-15-update">Android 15 upgrade</a> for its 2023 flagship early in November. The update started rolling out to many of the same regions as this second "incremental" patch. However, the original rollout only offered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">the new features</a> that OnePlus worked on for OxygenOS 15. Specifically, the software' icons were improved with a softer, rounded visual appeal on the Home screen and within its Systems area.</p><p>The animations of OxygenOS 15 have been revamped to be more fluid in every aspect of the device. Several new gesture controls aid users who're multitasking with more intuitive controls.</p><p>What's more, OnePlus highlighted its lack of AI features for the device during that first update. The company stated that those tools were still in "testing" and would begin rolling out in November. We're nearly at the end, meaning those in the U.S. and other places will begin seeing them early in December.</p>
