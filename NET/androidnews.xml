The budget MVNO carrier Tello might have you covered. Sign up for one of Tello&apos;s pre-built plans before May 31st and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tello.com/promo/budget-friendly-phones"><strong>the carrier will hook you up with $50 off</strong></a> the Moto G 5G (2023) or Samsung Galaxy A14 5G. Sure, neither of those phones are going to win awards for innovation or specs, but they&apos;re cheap and reliable, which makes this discount all the more meaningful. </p>

<p>One of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300">best Android phones under $300</a>, the Moto G 5G (2023) boasts a vibrant and smooth 120Hz 6.5-inch display, a large 5,000mAh battery, and a Snapdragon processor that should handle most daily tasks with ease. You even get a headphone jack and expandable storage, two useful features that aren't very common nowadays. Grab the affordable phone with an eligible data plan at Tello and you'll get a straight $50 off. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://tello.com/promo/budget-friendly-phones" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="12b07a6f-5b35-4e62-bb2a-7eae07c2440d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249" data-dimension48="$249">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>The super-affordable Galaxy A14 features a surprisingly decent 50MP camera with a huge 5,000mAh battery, NFC support, and some extensive software support from Samsung.

<p>Tello is a T-Mobile-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carrier</a> that&apos;s known for offering custom-built data plans that give you exactly what you need (and nothing else) for as little as $5 per month. They&apos;re also home to four pre-built data plans for the folks who don&apos;t want to customize their phone bill. </p><p>Three of Tello&apos;s plans are eligible for the $50 off deal: the Value plan ($14 per month), the Smart plan ($19 per month), and the Unlimited plan ($25 per month). The Value and Smart plan come with unlimited talk and text plus 5GB and 10GB of data, respectively. The Unlimited plan probably offers the best bang for the buck here, though, with 35GB of high-speed monthly data from T-Mobile before speeds start to slow. </p><p>This offer from Tello Mobile may not be for everyone, but if you want great T-Mobile coverage and a reliable, no-frills smartphone, it&apos;s a solid way to save some cash. </p>

<hr>
<p>Google is launching a new program today (May 16) that will partner more closely with the disability community across the United States.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/gaad-2024-community-partnerships/">blog post</a>, the company is introducing the "Google&apos;s Rising Influencers with Disabilities Fellowship," or GRID, for short. This six-month fellowship program will help Google create a "sense of belonging" online for creators and influencers with disabilities.</p><p>The GRID program will cover "key skills" for digital creators, industry leader-provided lessons, and a direct line to Google&apos;s product teams. Google is also giving new creators/influencers who are getting into GRID a chance to work with pre-established creators with disabilities in a mentorship capacity.</p><p>Across the country, the program is said to include fifteen fellowships.</p><p>Among those Google partners with for GRID is the USABA (U.S. Association of Blind Athletes). Through this, the company states it will provide Pixel phones, leveraging <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi Wireless</a>, and other company-made tools to those who are blind or with low vision. This pertains to those enrolled in the USABA Sport Ambassador program.</p>

<p>Google highlights the expansion of support for product accessibility by announcing the opening of a discovery center in Zurich, Switzerland.  The company hopes to bring more attention to how it implements accessibility features into its products through this center. Zurich is the third and joins the likes of the London Discovery Center and Dublin.</p><p>Supporting companies and programs investing in computer science education leads Google to reveal its $5 million fund toward those places. The post states that the fund will deliver grants to programs utilizing Google&apos;s Blocky open-source library to create teaching material. Blocky features accessibility tools like keyboard navigation plugins alongside other "themes" to help the visually impaired, such as color blindness or low vision. These programs are said to support the education of students with disabilities who are interested in coding and computer science.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today is Global Accessibility Awareness Day, and Google is announcing a few new features that aim to make its products and services more accessible to all. There are eight in total, and these new accessibility features come on the heels of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-io-2024">Google I/O 2024</a>, the company&apos;s annual developer conference. At that event, Google shared that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Gemini AI will be used to improve TalkBack on Android</a>. Now, we know more about how Google is going to improve the accessibility of some of its other services, like Google Maps and Lookout. </p><p>The first is something called "Find mode," and it is a new functionality added to Lookout. For those unfamiliar, Lookout is an Android feature that helps people with low vision or blindness use their phone&apos;s camera to learn more about the world around them. Starting today in beta, Find mode will make it possible for users to search for specific objects or places via Lookout. Users can pick one of seven categories of places, like restrooms, and be informed of their direction and distance to the place. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5443px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UTDRqSpkHrVFHYvdNucjkR" name="Find-Mode-Beta-Lookout.jpg" alt="Find Mode in Lookout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTDRqSpkHrVFHYvdNucjkR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5443" height="3061" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is also adding a new option to Look to Speak, a feature that lets users trigger pre-written phrases to be spoken aloud with their eyes. Now, there&apos;s an alternative to text, as you can select emojis to communicate. The company says it&apos;s intended to make Look to Speak more accessible to people across languages, literacy challenges, and cognitive differences. </p><p>Project Gameface, an experimental software that lets users control their cursors with head motions and facial expressions, is rolling out to Android this week in another move. </p><p>Some of the bigger changes come to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a>, which will become more accessible for people with low vision or blindness. For starters, Lens in Google Maps now has a screen reader, so the app can tell you the name and details of locations around you. It&apos;s rolling out this month to both iOS and Android users of the Google Maps app. </p>

<p>Google Maps also has more information about the accessibility of business and places you might want to visit. The company says it has info for 50 million places, and users can view accessibility details in the About tab for a place, like whether it has an accessible ramp or restroom. For theaters and showrooms, there is now an Auracast support option that can be displayed to show compatibility with Bluetooth hearing aids.</p><p>There are a few more accessibility features coming to Android, too. Project Relate allows users to create a custom speech recognition model that will help people with non-standard speech be better understood. Sound Notifications will inform you that an important household sound is happening, like a fire alarm, through push notifications, flashing lights, and vibrations. </p><p>These changes are all rolling out now or soon, and they should help make Android and other Google services more accessible. For Global Accessibility Awareness Day, other tech companies are also debuting new accessibility features, like Apple&apos;s Eye Tracking for iPhone and iPad. </p>

Ultimately, I would just go back to using foobar2000 or MediaMonkey and manually play back whatever album I want to listen to. Over the years, I used a variety of media players and organizers, but most of them ended up either being buggy or too convoluted that I often spent most of the time tinkering with the settings instead of listening to music.</p>

<p>So when I heard about Roon, I figured it might just be the solution I was looking for. I was skeptical of the service initially; it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://account.roon.app/en/create">costs $15 a month</a>, $129 annually, or you can get a lifetime license by shelling out $829 — I thought that was an absurd amount of cash for what is basically a glorified music player.</p><p>Roon isn&apos;t a music streaming service; it is instead designed to work with the music you already have, so if you don&apos;t have a sizeable offline music collection, you won&apos;t get much use out of the software. As a high-level overview, Roon is a music management service that organizes your media library, and it easily lets you stream content to connected devices, including Cast-enabled products.</p><p>As the pricing suggests, the service is clearly aimed at enthusiasts, and it has a lot of prerequisites. You need to set it up on a NAS server, and an SSD is mandatory — it isn&apos;t designed to be run on mechanical HDDs. You don&apos;t need to store your music library on an SSD; that can still be on a regular HDD, but Roon&apos;s database needs to be installed on an SSD. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5oT8ANp3vRSkXBPtuSjrqA" name="moondrop-miad01-5.jpg" alt="Moondrop MIAD01 next to Venus headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5oT8ANp3vRSkXBPtuSjrqA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After you configure the software and point it to your music library, it does the rest: cataloging your music library, sorting albums and bands into categories, adding metadata, classifying music into genres, and so much more. What I like about Roon is the detailed information you get on each artist; it&apos;s how I found out that Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk made an orchestral score called Mythologies (which is brilliant).</p><p>Another nifty trick is that Roon doesn&apos;t change any of the file metadata itself — it just creates an overlay based on the albums in your library, and that again is markedly different to how other media players work. But the best part about the service is that it removes a lot of the friction involved in maintaining a music library, and that alone justifies the asking price.</p><p>There are plenty of other niceties: if you use Tidal, Qobuz, or KKBox, you can link these services via Roon, and it creates a seamless blend of online and local streaming that just makes a lot of sense. Roon uses a custom signal path to deliver bit-perfect audio, and the sound engine has a ton of useful additions, including a DSP engine, EQ, presets, and unique filters.</p>

<p>I use Roon with my Windows machine that&apos;s connected to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">Fiio K19 DAC</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">Audeze&apos;s MM-500 headset</a>, and it is a terrific combination. The service is great at discovering new music, but what I like best is that it makes playing music across various devices extremely easy; I have a lot of eclectic audio gear that&apos;s connected via Chromecast Audio and WiiM streamers, and Roon lets me select the device I want to cast to in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Roon Arc is a relatively recent addition that enables these features on the go, unlocking the ability to stream your local music library over the internet. What makes a greater difference in my use case is Roon Ready; this feature allows Roon to be integrated into network streamers and digital audio players, and I use it extensively with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m11s-review">Fiio M11S</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-r7-review">R7</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, the ease of use combined with the interface and detailed notes make Roon stand out from other media players. There is a high barrier to entry, but having used the service for just over 15 months, I can&apos;t see myself switching to anything else.</p>

Announced at Google I/O 2024, the update will focus on three key areas: Battery life improvements, new watch faces, and a horde of new fitness features. </p><p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a> added functionality like easier watch transfers, new apps, and a new Watch Face Format, Wear OS 5 seems to focus more on optimization, making your current Android watch last longer and plugging the gaps where the last OS fell short. </p><p>We&apos;ll explain every Wear OS 5 feature Google has revealed thus far, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> we expect to update to Wear OS 5, and everything else you need to know. </p>

<p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces">Wear OS 5 announcement</a> described a long list of upcoming features. We may discover more feature updates when it launches, but this news gave us plenty to start with. </p><p>For starters, Wear OS 5 will have "performance improvements," such that "running a marathon consumes up to 20% less power." This may or may not be due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Hybrid Wear OS interface</a> relegating health sampling to the co-processor, or else other behind-the-scenes changes. </p><p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/watch-face-format-for-future-wear-os-releases">Watch Face Format</a> introduced in Wear OS 4 will also add new "Flavors." Users choosing a watch face will also be able to pick between different colors and complications for each watch face, including some new complications like "Goal progress" that show your percentage completion towards a goal like 10,000 steps. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YvBWR53dEmxCTSjK6KNGxf" name="wear-os-5-watch-face-flavors.jpeg" alt="New Wear OS 5 watch face Flavors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YvBWR53dEmxCTSjK6KNGxf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1488" height="837" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google will make this new XML WFF the default option for Wear OS 5, restricting uploads of other formats like AndroidX starting in early 2025. Your old watch faces will still work and receive updates, but won&apos;t get access to new complications. </p><p>Wear OS developers will find other backend changes that will hopefully make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-apps">Wear OS apps</a> more user-friendly and dynamic. In particular, Google says these apps will "ensure your app works optimally across the range of device sizes and font scales." Now that you can find Android watch displays anywhere from 1 to 1.5 inches, devs need to make their apps look good across the board. </p>

At the moment, Wear OS 4 watches buzz your watch the moment you&apos;re out of range, leading to false positives and annoyed runners. </p>

A Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wear-os-5-software-testing-spotted">Wear OS 5 test build</a> was spotted in early May, but we don&apos;t know any specifics except that it&apos;ll be based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and arrive alongside the Galaxy Watch 7 this summer. </p><p>We do know Samsung, like Google, will focus on fitness updates. This January, Samsung revealed its "My Vitality Score" update arriving to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> this summer. It&apos;ll combine your sleep, activity, heart rate, and HRV data to determine your energy level and readiness to work out. </p><p>Plus, Samsung will generate "Booster cards" that "provide insight into the &apos;why&apos; behind your health readings,"</p><p>This data doesn&apos;t <em>only</em> apply to Wear OS 5 since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> will create this data too, and you can see it all on your smartphone. But we assume One UI 6 Watch will make your Vitality Score or Booster Cards visible on the watch as Tiles or watch face complications.</p>

<p>Google promises that Wear OS 5 will launch "later this year," meaning sometime in 2024. It has yet to promise a specific release date. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/versions/5" target="_blank"><strong>Wear OS 5 developer preview</strong></a> went live on May 15. </p><p>Samsung typically launches its One UI Watch spinoff of Wear OS in the summer alongside the latest Galaxy Watch. Wear OS 3 and 4 arrived in August 2021 and 2023, respectively, though only on Samsung watches. We suspect Wear OS 5 will roll out alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> in <strong>August 2024</strong>.</p><p>However, the "stock" version of Wear OS 5 won&apos;t arrive until <strong>October 2024</strong>, when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> launches. </p><p>Last-gen models will likely receive the update soon after the newer models; last year, the first Pixel Watch received Wear OS 4 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-4-update">five days after</a> the Pixel Watch 2 launch, while the Galaxy Watch 5 got it a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-receives-one-ui-5-watch-wear-os-4">couple of weeks</a> after the Watch 6. </p><p>Outside of Google and Samsung, the other Wear OS brands don&apos;t have a public update schedule. Some companies take months, if not years, before updating their watches to new versions. Mobvoi, for example, is still working on jumping its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">Ticwatch Pro 5</a> series to Wear OS 4, so Wear OS 5 could be a ways off for some, if it arrives at all.</p>

<p>These are the current Wear OS watches confirmed to receive the update, plus our best guess of the release month:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 4</strong> (August)</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 5</strong> (August)</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 6</strong> (August)</li><li><strong>Google Pixel Watch</strong> (October)</li><li><strong>Google Pixel Watch 2</strong> (October)</li><li><strong>OnePlus Watch 2</strong> (Unknown)</li></ul>
<p>In addition, the upcoming Galaxy Watch 7 and Pixel Watch 3 should launch with Wear OS 5.</p><p>Samsung watches will get four major Wear OS updates, so the Galaxy Watch 4 should get one more update in 2025 after Wear OS 5. Google promises three years of OS updates, so Wear OS 5 could be the Pixel Watch 1&apos;s last feature update.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 2 has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-how-many-updates">two guaranteed OS updates</a>; we can hope for a speedy Wear OS 5 update this fall, but have no precedent to compare against. </p><p>As for watches currently running Wear OS 3.5 like the Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-announced">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>, we believe they&apos;ll receive Wear OS 4 but have no guarantees about Wear OS 5. </p>

Even if you didn&apos;t make it to Mountain View or missed the live stream, here are the biggest announcements from Google I/O this year. As you may have already heard, this year&apos;s event was bolstered with all things AI. Let&apos;s dive in!</p>
<h2 id="did-they-just-say-gemini-1-5-flash-2">Did they just say Gemini 1.5 Flash?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LwFdVCSgvNKXfwW7Co5qa5" name="Gemini-1.5-flash.jpg" alt="Gemini 1.5 Flash announced at Google I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LwFdVCSgvNKXfwW7Co5qa5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google I/O started with Sundar Pichai introducing a new and improved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Gemini 1.5 Flash</a>. As the name suggests, they&apos;ve worked on bringing in a model that executes tasks more efficiently—rather in a "flash." Google states that Flash can handle "high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale." Testing this model showed that this AI thrives on summarization, chat applications, image/video captioning, data extraction, tables, and more. Google demonstrated 1.5 Pro&apos;s multimodal capability in its AI-powered note-taking app, helping users break down complex information on the go. </p><p>Along with Flash, Gemini Nano also got some updates. The model is taking it a step further from just text prompts. Users will soon be able to interact with Gemini using images where it will "understand the world the way people do—through image, video, and spoken language."</p><p>Google plans to implement the 1.5 Pro model into the Gemini Advanced and Workspace apps. An upgraded model will arrive for Gmail and NotebookLM in the near future and will be made available in 30 different languages.</p><p>Google also gave us a look at "Gemini Live" for Gemini Advanced subscribers. Much like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">ChatGPT-4o</a>, Gemini Live will allow users to have conversations with the AI model, speak at their own pace, or interrupt mid-response with clarifying questions in real-time. </p>

<p>We then got a glimpse of this when Google revealed Project Astra, a real-time multimodal AI from the Google DeepMind team that looks at your surroundings through a camera and answers questions on the go. You can see how it functions in the video above.</p><p>"We would have this universal assistant. It&apos;s multimodal; it&apos;s with you all the time." "It&apos;s that helper," said Demis Hassabis, the head of Google DeepMind, while talking about Project Astra during I/O.</p>

<p>With multimodality comes a new wave of image and video generations. According to Google, their new Imagen 3 generates high-quality images and understands the prompt&apos;s content and intent. This means that however long the prompt may be, Imagen 3 will generate "photorealistic, lifelike images" with little to no visual noise. This can help users generate more personalized messages, presentations, slides, or fun memes.</p><p>Next up is Veo, Google&apos;s new AI-powered video generation model that is said to produce 1080p resolution videos in a wide range of cinematic and visual styles that are more than a minute long. Like Imagen 3, this model understands natural language by accurately capturing a prompt&apos;s tone and producing videos that closely match the user&apos;s needs.</p><p>The model is said to understand terms like "timelapse" or "aerial shots of a landscape." Veo creates footage with minimal glitches, with animals and objects moving realistically throughout shots.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-generative-ai-veo-imagen-3/#Imagen-3">Imagen 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-generative-ai-veo-imagen-3/#veo">Veo</a> are only available to select creators via ImageFX and VideoFX. In the future, Google says it will also bring some of Veo&apos;s capabilities to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts">YouTube Shorts</a> and other products for customers to test out. But it remains a mystery when we will be able to access this one.</p>

<p>At this year&apos;s I/O, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/">announced</a> that Search will be getting a number of updates with AI Overviews, which the company first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">introduced</a> in January.</p><p>AI Overviews can provide summaries of complex topics right at the top of search results based on the prompt. It will help the users quickly grasp concepts and main points of a specific topic with all the information they find online. With the summary, Overviews will link to its sources so the user can manually crosscheck information if needed.</p><p>Additionally, Google says that if you don&apos;t find the answers simple enough, an option to "adjust" Overview will pop up, that will simplify information further. This is particularly useful when trying to explain tough school concepts to kids, AI will help with generating examples that they can relate to and grasp those concepts easily.Not just that, Search will use generative AI to help users brainstorm creative ideas and organize the search page better based on the prompt provided.</p>

<p>While much of this is text-based, Google says that with the help of Google Lens, users can start recording a video and vocally ask questions about why something is broken and how to fix it. After that, a search will give you step-by-step instructions on fixing the said object—all in real time.</p><p>AI Overviews has rolled out to everyone in the U.S. and will soon be made available to other countries, Google adds.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xXcSGaTjqMvDpsW6kKeDhR" name="Google-IO-2024.jpg" alt="Google I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xXcSGaTjqMvDpsW6kKeDhR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It looks like Android and AI go hand in hand, and what&apos;s Google I/O without several perks directed toward Android users? Since AI is now at the core of most Android devices and operating systems, here are some new updates discussed at this year&apos;s event—specifically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-ai-upgrades-coming-soon">catering to Android users</a>. Here are a few of them we can expect to see rolling out in the near future. </p><p>To start off, Google is introducing software that enables users to detect unknown phishing/spam calls in real time, alerting users to hang up the call before they give out personal details. This feature could come in handy specifically for older users or children, who might be unaware and get looped into multiple scams doing the rounds. </p><p>Android users will soon be able to bring up Gemini on top of any app. With AI integrated into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, users can get creative by generating fun AI images and dropping them into various apps like Gmail and Google messages or creating memes to add to their chats. With "Ask this video" and "Ask this PDF," users can get more information about a YouTube video they&apos;re watching or get answers about a PDF without needing to scroll through information pages.</p><p>Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> will now be able to solve complex math and physics problems by providing a step-by-step process and examples that help the user better understand concepts. </p><p>Finally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">Gemini Nano</a> with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-1-5-next-gen-ai-model">multimodality</a> will give the already existing TalkBack option more "powers." This means that Android phones can process text with a better understanding of sounds, sights, and even spoken language. For instance, when an image of a dress is shared, the TalkBack option will describe the dress&apos;s exact color, the length of the sleeves, and other accessories that go with it, helping the user visualize the dress effectively without looking at it.</p><p>Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be coming to Pixel phones later this year. However, it remains unclear which models will receive this. We&apos;ll have to watch for those monthly updates to see when new features start rolling out.</p>
<h2 id="welcome-to-the-world-of-wear-os-5-2">Welcome to the world of Wear OS 5</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1124px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.14%;"><img id="UgB9dWgac7gUKCiuwEBhZg" name="wear-os-5-new-watch-faces.jpeg" alt="A selection of upcoming Wear OS 5 watch faces" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UgB9dWgac7gUKCiuwEBhZg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1124" height="631" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google I/O&apos;s day two was more about developer previews, and it gave us a glimpse of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces">Wear OS 5</a>. This version of Wear OS will arrive "later this year" and will be based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. It is said to come with an enhanced battery life, and watch faces will get "Flavors" and exclusive Complications. </p><p>Firstly, the new OS will add four advanced running form measurements: Ground Contact Time, Stride Length, Vertical Oscillation, and Vertical Ratio. Wear OS 5 will also have a concept called "debounced goals" for fitness workouts, which lets users start a workout where they must stay within a certain heart rate range or run faster than 10:00/mile pace. </p><p>For users who wait for new watch faces to drop, Wear OS 5 will add "Flavors" to watch faces so users can choose between different colors, fonts, complications, and configurations in one menu. Two new WFF complications for Wear OS 5 are "Goal progress" and "Weighted elements." Users can check your percentage towards a fitness target, like step count, or see specific colored portions that add up to 100% (like a pie chart), which sounds similar to the activity rings on an Apple watch.</p><p>According to Google, the long-requested weather widget could be in the works. That is said to check current conditions, low and high temps, UV index, chance of rain, and other data set by hour or day. </p><p>You can check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/versions/5" target="_blank">Wear OS 5 Developer Preview</a> at the link. </p>
<h2 id="android-15-beta-2-just-landed-2">Android 15 Beta 2 just landed</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="a7NZY6fiEXh9Dfx4A7Xwkg" name="android-15-logo-wide.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo on Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a7NZY6fiEXh9Dfx4A7Xwkg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google just dropped Android 15 Beta 2, which offers major improvements in productivity, privacy, security, app performance, and battery health.</p><p>The newest addition to this Beta is "Private Space," which lets you hide apps in fingerprint-protected space, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-secure-folders-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">Samsung&apos;s Secure Folder</a>. Private space uses a separate profile, so apps you hide there can&apos;t be seen by others or run in the background when locked.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:210.00%;"><img id="sLNByZ6HXuwJnNYHoNdHVA" name="private-space.gif" alt="Android 15 private space" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sLNByZ6HXuwJnNYHoNdHVA.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="320" height="672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another update comes for photos, where apps prompt you to give access just to the recent photos and not the entire library, protecting your privacy. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> is expanding its support to include new data types, such as skin temperature and training plans. Skin temperature tracking lets users store and share precise temperature readings from wearables or other devices. Meanwhile, training plans provide structured workout routines to help users meet their fitness goals.</p><p>Google is beefing up security in Android 15 by giving users control to prevent malicious apps from operating in the background and bringing other apps to the foreground. This update aims to block malicious apps from gaining privileges and exploiting user interactions.</p><p>The latest build is available on select Google Pixel and now on many of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">favorite Android phones</a> from brands like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-6-pro-and-magic-v2-are-joining-the-android-15-beta-program">Honor</a>, iQOO, Lenovo, Nothing, OnePlus, OPPO, Realme, Sharp, Tecno, Vivo, and Xiaomi.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lastly, this year&apos;s I/O was not as exciting as we expected it to be, as there were virtually no major hardware announcements. We were expecting to see a glimpse of one of the Pixel devices—the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-fold-2-tensor-ram-rumors">Pixel Fold 2</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/entire-pixel-9-series-live-photos-specs-leak">Pixel 9</a>. Instead, Google dropped the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-solo-launch-announcement">Pixel Tablet</a> without a dock right before I/O. </p><p>We did get some major Pixel 9 leaks ahead of I/O, suggesting that we could see the devices soon. That said, perhaps Google is saving the hardware for the Made by Google event, which is expected to take place later this year in the fall.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google just rolled out the second public build of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15 beta</a>, bringing a slate of new features. The second beta is usually when the build becomes available on devices outside Google&apos;s ecosystem, and that is the case this time as well. You can now install the Android 15 beta on select devices from Xiaomi, Nothing, Honor, OnePlus, OPPO, Vivo, iQOO, and other manufacturers.</p><p>Similar to previous years, this is a vanilla Android 15 build, so if you&apos;re installing it on a OnePlus phone, it won&apos;t have any of the ColorOS accouterments. As is the case with the beta builds on Pixel devices, I wouldn&apos;t suggest installing Android 15 on a daily driver just yet; the latest build is usable, but it still has plenty of bugs.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, here&apos;s the list of devices that are getting the Android 15 beta:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://developer.honor.com/en/docs/11100/guides/android_15_beta_guide">Honor</a>: Honor Magic 6 Pro, Honor Magic V2</li><li><a href="https://www.mi.com/global/support/guidance/androidtbeta">Xiaomi</a>: Xiaomi 14, Xiaomi 13T Pro, Xiaomi Pad 6S Pro 12.4</li><li><a href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1595803862105587712">OnePlus</a>: OnePlus 12, OnePlus Open</li><li>OPPO: Find X7</li><li><a href="https://developer.vivo.com/promotion/android15">Vivo</a>: Vivo X100</li><li><a href="https://developer.vivo.com/promotion/android15">iQOO</a>: iQOO 12</li><li><a href="https://nothing.community/d/10106-android-15-developer-preview-program-beta-1">Nothing</a>: Nothing Phone 2a</li><li><a href="https://c.realme.com/in/post-details/1790269629646561280">Realme</a>: Realme 12 Pro+ 5G</li><li><a href="https://dev.lenovo.com/android15">Lenovo</a>: Lenovo Tab Extreme</li><li><a href="https://k-tai.sharp.co.jp/support/developers/android15_betaprogram/">Sharp</a>: Sharp Aquos sense8</li><li><a href="https://tspot.tecno.com/#/detail?tid=411927">Tecno</a>: Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G</li></ul>
<p>To reiterate, I wouldn&apos;t suggest installing the Android 15 beta on a daily driver at the moment. If you are interested in trying out all the latest features in Android 15 and have a secondary device, then it makes sense to go ahead with the installation. Just note that there are a lot of connectivity and camera-related bugs. If you&apos;re interested in installing the Android 15 beta, just head to the links shared above for each manufacturer, and you&apos;ll be able to download the build and flash it onto your device. </p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re in the middle of Google I/O 2024 week, and OnePlus is celebrating the occasion by bringing the Android 15 beta to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>. The company announced the release of Android 15 Beta 1 in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1595803862105587712" target="_blank">post</a> on its community forums on Tuesday, May 14. It&apos;s available on the OnePlus 12 and the OnePlus Open, the latter of which only got the update to Android 14 in March. </p><p>OnePlus only recommends the Android 15 Beta 1 update for "developers and advanced users." The beta isn&apos;t available as a cloud OTA update, and must be manually flashed or upgraded locally. Additionally, the company says you shouldn&apos;t install the update if you "have limited software development experience, intend to use the device as your primary driver, or lack experience with custom ROM installations."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> phones need to be running OxygenOS version 14.0.0.610 or older to upgrade to Android 15 Beta 1. For the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, the maximum OxygenOS version is 14.0.0.702.

<p>There are a handful of known issues with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> on OnePlus devices so far. Both phones may suffer from Bluetooth incompatibility issues while running Android 15 Beta 1, and the OnePlus 12 specifically might have trouble connecting to printers over Wi-Fi. OnePlus adds that "some camera functions display abnormally in certain scenarios," and this applies to both the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus Open. Plus, like with any pre-release software, OnePlus says the two phones will have overall stability problems in certain situations. </p><p>The availability of the Android 15 Beta 1 for the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus open came a day before Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-2-just-landed-for-google-pixels-and-non-pixel-devices-too">Android 15 Beta 2</a> with new features. Google also shared that third-party phones are now supported from partners, including OnePlus.  However, the exact models aren&apos;t listed, so we&apos;re not sure what support for Android 15 Beta 2 looks like on the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus Open yet. </p><p>For users that encounter issues with Android 15 Beta 1, OnePlus has a guide for rolling back Android 14 and includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1595803862105587712" target="_blank">rollback packages</a> on its community forums. It also accepts feedback in the comments of the original post. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">Google I/O 2024</a> keynote is over, and if you&apos;re interested in new ways Google can inject AI into its products, you probably think you want to see it if you missed it. Really, you don&apos;t.</p><p>The cool new features and products are there. The problem is they are buried under the most boring and technical I/O keynote presentation ever. Unless you&apos;re a developer who uses Google products and the Google ecosystem, it just wasn&apos;t for you.</p>
<p>Normally, I would be the first to point out that Google I/O is a developer conference that is meant for developers to learn about development. This is true, and if you fit this description, you should find a way to experience it at least once. On that front, Google I/O is amazing.</p><p>But this was the keynote presentation. The part of the week that is supposed to get the "average Joe and Jane" excited about the future so that they <em>want</em> to use the cool new products developers can make using all the new stuff.</p><p>Combine that with the fact that a large number of people attending are there as press or influencers, and it makes the whole thing look really weird this time. Members of the tech press are there to tell you about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">cool new phones</a> and how Google is making things better, not explain the differences between Gemini 7b and Gemini 2b.</p>
<p>If you slogged through it, you did see some cool, even futuristic stuff. Privacy concerns aside, Google can now integrate into your life in ways it couldn&apos;t before and even be useful. An example is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/nXVvvRhiGjI?si=Ih8P4yUJOYXSgPHA">Google&apos;s Project Astra</a> remembering where a pair of glasses were sitting. The days of a lost remote control are over once this goes live.</p><p>For every good example, though, we heard a word salad of things that "normal" people just don&apos;t care about. Telling developers about multimodal inputs or that they have access to two million tokens is fine. Telling everyone about it is silly because almost nobody cares, or most might not even understand what it means.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LTtQJqtxv6zyMCLuip8MHD" name="Google-IO-2024-Sundar-Pichai.jpeg" alt="Sundar Pichai on stage at Google I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LTtQJqtxv6zyMCLuip8MHD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regular people, and probably shareholders, too, aren&apos;t interested in how the fudge is made. We only care about the results, whether they are useful enhancements, new products, or new revenue streams for Google itself. In my past life, I spent way too much time trying to get computers and cameras to recognize the things they were seeing, and having this level of tech would have been amazing. But even I stopped being interested about 20 minutes into the program.</p>
<p>The show started right, with Pichai telling people how Google has spent billions of dollars and over 10 years <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">working on AI</a> and its infrastructure. Google is competing with companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">OpenAI</a> and should remind us that Google has a huge advantage when it comes to experience and scale. It&apos;s how Google will "win" the AI race once all the dust settles.</p><p>It also ended right. Knowing about how Google is managing the risks that come with AI and what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-works-hard-to-make-sure-ai-isnt-evil">its principles are</a>. That&apos;s more important than the products themselves and Google has to lead by example because it is about to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overviews-test-expansion">dump AI on everyone</a> who uses Google Search.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bfrvFTcdoqM8oi9GxXUidB" name="Google-IO-2024-ai-count.jpeg" alt="AI count of 121 at Google I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bfrvFTcdoqM8oi9GxXUidB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everything in between was developer-focused. I know I know, developer conference, but the keynote is also supposed to get everyone excited about what&apos;s coming. Google helped create this situation where a developer conference has morphed into a press event. Abandoning the idea seems short-sighted.</p><p>That isn&apos;t going to happen, and you&apos;re going to have to wait to see how any of this stuff matters when it comes to you.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (May 15), Sony is debuting its 2024 flagship phone, the Xperia 1 VI, which strongly focuses on gaming, audio, and display functionality.</p><p>Sony detailed the latest Xperia 1 VI in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.co.uk/presscentre/sony-announces-latest-premium-smartphone-xperia-1-vi">press release</a>, and we&apos;re kicking things off with its "smarter" display. According to the company, the Xperia 1 VI boasts a 6.5-inch BRAVIA-powered screen that is reportedly 1.5 times brighter than its predecessor. Sony has also worked on "Sunlight Vision," designed to give users more screen visibility when outside.</p><p>Powering the device&apos;s capabilities is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, however, Sony&apos;s in-house Exmor T sensor with AI processing helps its cameras. The company states that the flagship phone features a 52MP (48MP effective) primary lens, a 12MP telephoto lens, and a 12MP ultrawide lens.</p><p>The telephoto lens uses an x7.1 zoom with an 85mm to 170mm focal length alongside macro technology. Thanks to these advancements, users can go from a 2x zoom to a close 4cm zoom.</p><p>Additionally, the Xperia 1 VI offers AF tracking with "human pose estimation." Sony states this is done via an AI feature created by Alpha series cameras. The feature reportedly "recognizes" a human frame (skeleton) to provide the Xperia 1 VI with "precise" tracking even through objects that could cover a person&apos;s body.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Md6Mhe8ZxU4KjvwyMnkQoU" name="sony-xperia-1-vi-camera-app-ui.jpg" alt="The Sony Xperia 1 VI and the camera app's updated UI." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Md6Mhe8ZxU4KjvwyMnkQoU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A new camera app joins the improved camera functionality. Sony states it has pushed an update for the Xperia 1 VI&apos;s camera app that includes a "friendly" UI for seamless navigation. The update is designed to prioritize convenience for the user without tucking away any of its options for more creativity behind walls. Photographers will find color presets like "Creative Look" and shooting modes like PSM.</p><p>Touch tracking lets users customize their brightness and adjust colors, and the new Pro mode provides an array of detailed settings for video capture.</p><p>For gaming, Sony highlights the Xperia 1 VI&apos;s "FPS Optimizer." When used, the optimizer bolsters the device&apos;s CPU usage and frame rate based on the game. Inputs matter in gaming, so Sony has refined it by offering three tracking speeds and two levels of "tap accuracy."</p><p>Sony&apos;s latest flagship features improved sound, courtesy of the Premium Audio Circuit, crafted with 3.5mm headphones in mind. The company adds that the speaker unit&apos;s upgrades help reduce sound distortion at high volumes, and low-frequency output has received a tune-up.</p><p>Select wireless headphones are said to benefit from AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) for enhanced sound quality when outside in the city.</p>

<p>What will get your Xperia 1 VI through the day is a 5,000mAh battery. A new heat-dissipating component and low-power display consumption will aid the device in reaching nearly 36 hours of "continuous" video playback. Sony estimates the Xperia 1 VI can reach a 50% charge (30W) in just thirty minutes. Features like Battery Care and Xperia Adaptive Charging aid the device&apos;s battery to ensure its health.</p><p>Android 14 will await users out of the box, alongside three years of OS upgrades, and four years of security updates.</p><p>The Xperia 1 VI is on the way with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. The device is available today (May 15) for pre-order on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.co.uk/smartphones/products/xperia-1m6">Sony&apos;s U.K. website</a> for £1,299 (roughly $1,646).
