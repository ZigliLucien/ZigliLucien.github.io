                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>What&apos;s more exciting than a phone that can fold <em>in half</em>? How about getting a folding phone for more than <strong>half off</strong> this Prime Day? The Motorola Razr (2023) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGWF3F64">is just $332</a> brand-new at Amazon for Prime Day this year, making it $120 less than the previous best price for the phone. Better yet, there&apos;s no need to trade in your old phone or jump through any hoops!</p><p>As Derrek said in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Motorola Razr (2023) review</a> is "one of the most surprising phones" of 2023 because it brought the price of folding phones down several hundred dollars. In a year when Samsung is raising the price of all of its foldables by $100, the Motorola Razr (2023) is even more remarkable than it was last year.</p>

<p>This deal seems too good to be true, but Prime Day is making your dreams come true by delivering one of Motorola's best folding phones at an unreal price of $332. That makes it <strong>$367 off</strong>, or more money off than you'll spend on the phone! You won't be getting that deal any other day of the week, and it doesn't even require a trade-in for the deal.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>You&apos;re looking to get a phone that folds in half, making it easier to fit into any pocket you have. It&apos;s also a brilliant way to take selfies, use it in partially folded form like a tripod to record video or take group pictures, and just enjoy Motorola&apos;s excellent software in a new way.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You want a foldable with the best camera or the best performance. The Motorola Razr (2023) is a mid-range phone and while you&apos;ll be getting it for a ridiculously low price, there are notable concessions made to hit that price.</p>
<p>The Motorola Razr (2023) is a mid-range phone with premium looks thanks to its folding form factor and gorgeous 144Hz OLED display. The back is clad in lovely vegan leather that looks as good as it feels, helping to further add to the luxurious appearance of this brilliant flip phone. Plus, it folds in half, so it fits in any pocket!</p><p>As you probably know by know, Motorola has legendary build quality and guarantees the phone for hundreds of thousands of folds. That&apos;s years of use without worrying about seeing any problems, which is perfect since Motorola offers three more years of software updates through its update program.</p><p>Unlike some other foldables, the Motorola Razr (2023) can actually make it through a full day of use on a single charge. Plus, unlike Samsung&apos;s foldables, the Razr supports 30W charging so you can top-up the battery quickly and get out the door without worry.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 inside won&apos;t blow you away with its gaming performance but everyday use is plenty solid. It helps that the phone has 8GB of RAM, too, meaning it&apos;ll feel faster and multitask better than most $300 phones.</p><p>Looking to get into the folding phone game? Now&apos;s the best time <em>ever</em> to do it.</p>

While the e-reader slash E Ink tablet is a good product for reading and writing, the launch price was too high. Thanks to this Prime Day deal though, the Kindle Scribe is finally worth buying. Amazon knocked a neat 31% off the price tag, bringing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/dp/B09BS26B8B/"><strong>Kindle Scribe down to a lowly $234.99</strong></a>. That saves you a whole $100 and some change to spare!</p><p>The Kindle Scribe is a large, eye-friendly 10.3-inch tablet that runs Amazon&apos;s proprietary Kindle software based on Android. You can read books and comics, listen to audiobooks, take notes, sketch, and even annotate documents on the Scribe. It&apos;s undeniably the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">best Kindle</a> for academics and the only one to come with a stylus.</p>

<p>There's nothing like a Kindle when it comes to reading, so one that comes with a stylus for handwriting input is twice as awesome as a regular one. Amazon priced the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">Kindle Scribe</a> out of contention, but this deal brings it back to the top of the best e-readers and E Ink tablets that money can buy.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/dp/B09BS26B8B/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ae2235f7-89e8-482d-b761-1f84d106a354" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Kindle Scribe: $339.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Kindle Scribe: $339.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want stylus support, weeks upon weeks of battery life, and a large B&W e-paper display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want access to Android apps on the Play Store and prefer color e-paper devices.</p><p>Just like any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">great E Ink tablet</a>, the Amazon Kindle Scribe has a gorgeous e-paper display that looks just like real books and consumes very little power. The display is what makes a Kindle so stunning, because Amazon&apos;s e-paper screens are extremely crisp and lovely to look at. The 10.2-inch display is just the right size, neither too big nor too small. You can choose from 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB storage options.</p><p>On top of that, the Kindle Scribe lasts for weeks on a single charge and comes with a USB Type-C port. You can choose to get the Basic Pen or the Premium Pen with your Kindle Scribe, but keep in mind that the latter drives up the tablet&apos;s price. Unlike some of the other recently released Kindle models, the Amazon Kindle Scribe does not have water resistance.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for an E Ink tablet with unrestricted access to the Google Play Store and maybe a color e-paper display, try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/EA802706-DFB1-4B56-8561-059B6BAFC95A">Onyx Boox</a> instead.</p>

<p>Prime Day is now live, and like previous years, there are decent savings to be had if you&apos;re looking to pick up a new NAS server or want storage drives. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">best NAS servers</a> allow you to seamlessly stream media, back up photos and videos, and so much more. Having a centralized storage hub makes things highly convenient, and honestly, my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/i-set-up-the-ultimate-home-nas-with-over-100tb-of-storage">DiskStation DS1823xs+</a> is the storehouse for all the data that I value — photos, videos, documents, and my extensive media collection.</p><p>Synology&apos;s NAS servers aren&apos;t discounted just yet, but TerraMaster has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/D225AB29-1BE1-484C-A60B-5C596C0C3092">enticing 20% discount</a> across its home portfolio, and there are other brands joining the action. These are my recommendations for Prime Day. </p>

<p>The F4-423 is a terrific 4-bay choice if you want to set up a Plex server. It has hardware transcoding, dual 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports, 4GB of RAM, and you can slot in four 20TB drives, taking total addressable storage to 80TB. I used it extensively over the course of the last year, and it is an easy recommendation if you need a powerful 4-bay NAS. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VLFYWFY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="50d00ba8-3424-4923-a4f9-285fef4b4397" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$459" data-dimension48="$459">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>The F2-423 is nearly identical to the F4-423, with the biggest difference being two drive bays instead of four. If you don't see yourself using the additional drive bays, the F2-423 is a phenomenal value at just $239. The rest of the hardware is identical, and you get the same dual 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, 4GB of RAM, and same software. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-Performance-Quad-core-Network-Diskless/dp/B09VLDQFVJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="dfa37a81-d372-479d-bdca-94acb1159b33" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="TerraMaster F2-423: $299" data-dimension48="TerraMaster F2-423: $299">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>If you want a NAS that's great at the essentials while still packing powerful innards, the AS5304T is a decent pick. It's not a major discount, but Amazon is currently selling the unit for $40 less than its usual going price. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY2KTRW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="289c0c9c-fb32-4977-b7b9-65d7cee19da1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$459" data-dimension48="$459">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Want a 6-bay NAS that's designed for Plex media streaming? You should take a look at the T6-423. It is powered by the quad-core Celeron N5095, has 4GB of RAM, dual 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports at the back, and M.2 SSD slots. Combine that with modern software, and you're getting quite a lot here. </p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="which-nas-should-i-buy-xa0-2">Which NAS should I buy? </h2>
<p>The first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you&apos;re going to need. That sets the basis for whether you should get a two-bay, four-bay, or a larger NAS server.</p><p>Synology is the largest manufacturer of NAS servers, and it sells dozens of products across various categories. Synology is known for its high-quality offerings, and its products are built to last. But the defining feature of Synology&apos;s NAS models is the software, with the web-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/synology-diskstation-manager-70">DiskStation Manager</a> setting the standard for this category.</p><p>If this is the first NAS you&apos;re buying and you don&apos;t want to invest a lot of money into a server, TerraMaster&apos;s F2-423 is the default choice. It has great hardware, good software, and plenty of configurability. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-choose-a-hard-drive-for-my-nas-xa0-2">How do I choose a hard drive for my NAS? </h2>
<p>Choosing the right hard drive for your NAS is just as vital as selecting the right enclosure. As NAS enclosures are designed to run 24/7, there are NAS-focused hard drives available in the market. These models feature vibration resistance and are designed to handle the stresses of a 24/7 environment, and differ from your regular hard drives.</p><p>Another factor to consider when choosing a NAS hard drive is the speed. HDDs are usually available in either 5400rpm or 7200rpm, and the latter delivers better performance because the spindle moves at 7,200 rounds per minute. I&apos;ve used 5400rpm drives in NAS enclosures tailored for media streaming for years without any issues, but if you&apos;re building a more enthusiast-focused NAS and are looking for better performance, pick a model with a 7200rpm. </p><p>There are several NAS-focused hard drive product lines, with WD Red Plus and Seagate IronWolf dominating the sales charts. With drives starting out at 1TB and going all the way to 20TB, there&apos;s no shortage of options available across either product line. </p>
<h2 id="when-is-prime-day-2">When is Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Amazon&apos;s biggest sale of the year, the 10th Prime Day event is scheduled to start on July 16th and run through the 17th. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-prime-member-to-buy-products-during-prime-day-2">Do I have to be a Prime member to buy products during Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Yes, the vast majority of Prime Day deals will only be available to Prime subscribers. If you&apos;re interested in buying products during the sale and you aren&apos;t a member just yet, we recommend taking advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon&apos;s 30-day free trial</strong></a> so you can get the benefits of Prime Day without paying a cent. Alternatively, you could just wait and see if Amazon&apos;s biggest rivals will launch rival sales that don&apos;t require a membership. </p>

You would be a fool to skip this Dolby Atmos speaker for 15% off with this Prime Day deal.

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for an Alexa speaker from Amazon and have a really tight budget; the Echo Studio won&apos;t disappoint with its feature set or build quality.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;ve got the ears and soul of an audiophile, are very nitpicky about sound quality, and have more money to spend; there are more upscale Bluetooth speakers from high-end brands like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Roam-Portable-Waterproof-Bluetooth/dp/B0CY6S748H/">Sonos</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Revolve-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B08VL5S148/">Bose</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Flip-Bluetooth-Waterproof-PartyBoost/dp/B09GJVTRNZ/">JBL</a> on sale as well.</p><p>The Amazon Echo Studio is an affordable Bluetooth speaker to begin with, but this Prime Day deal makes it even more tantalizingly inexpensive. Our reviewer described the Echo Studio as having better audio quality than a lot more expensive speakers.</p><p>The Amazon speaker sounds punchy, bright, and can fill a room without cracking or or breaking. You don&apos;t even have to worry about the mics with the volume turned all the way up because there are seven microphones that work incredibly well. Speakers with Alexa are readily available, but none that perform this well and fit into this price bracket.</p>

Maybe you&apos;re upgrading from the aging Meta Quest 2 (Oculus Quest 2)? Either way, Prime Day is the best time ever to consider picking up a Meta Quest 3, now on sale for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH/"><strong>$429 at Amazon</strong></a>!</p><p>This is the first time we&apos;ve ever seen a major discount on Quest 3 hardware since it launched last October. I called it the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">best VR headset of all time</a> then and it&apos;s only gotten better since thanks to Meta&apos;s incredible update schedule. Plus, with a library of thousands of games already and tons of amazing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> — plus Quest 3 exclusives like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-gameplay-story-interview">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>, Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded, and more — there&apos;s never been a better time to consider a Quest 3.</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3 is the best VR headset you can buy today. Not only does it have the best graphics and clearest lenses of any standalone VR headset, but it also has exclusive games like the upcoming Batman Arkham Shadow that you can't play anywhere else. Plus, this is its first major discount <em>ever</em>, so take advantage of it before it's gone!</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>You want the best VR headset ever made. It&apos;s drop-dead easy to use — it&apos;s a gaming console that fits your face — and it provides the best graphics and best lenses ever seen on a standalone VR headset. Plus, lots of exclusive games like Batman Arkham Shadow and Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You are looking to spend under $300 and are willing to wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3s</a>, instead.</p>
<p>At this point, the Meta Quest 3 is the only VR headset you should consider if you&apos;re looking to get into VR gaming. Not only does it work like a console — just put it on your head and start playing — but it can also be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/virtual-desktop-adreno-motion-engine-update">wirelessly hooked up to a PC</a> for powerful PCVR games like Half-Life: Alyx.</p><p>Every month, Meta updates the Quest 3 with bug fixes and brand new features. Recently, we&apos;ve seen a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/an-update-just-fixed-the-biggest-quest-3-mixed-reality-problem">massive improvement to mixed reality quality</a>, an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-july-v67-update-new-ui">overhaul for multitasking</a>, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/asgards-wrath-2-meta-quest-3-update">huge graphics updates</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>.</p><p>While you&apos;re saving $70 on one, I&apos;d also recommend picking up the BoboVR M3 Pro headstrap, which is pictured on my headset above. It&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOBOVR-M3-Pro-Accessories-Compatible/dp/B0CJLG9SBR/">on sale for $40</a> for Prime Day and <strong>substantially</strong> enhances headset comfort so you can play VR games for a lot longer than with the cloth strap that ships with the Quest 3. Plus, it includes a handy rechargeable battery that magnetically detaches from the headstrap, making it easy to charge while you play.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking to spend less, the Meta Quest 3s is rumored to make its debut at Meta Connect this September, but while that headset is rumored to sell for under $300 it&apos;s also likely to come with big trade-offs. While it&apos;ll likely have the same powerful processor as the Quest 3, it won&apos;t have the Quest 3&apos;s crystal clear lenses, is reported to be a thicker headset, and may have other concessions to match the price, as well.</p>

With this tempting Prime Day deal, you can get your hands on the Galaxy S24 deal this year with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDRCZBJ?th=1"><strong>25% discount</strong></a>. The price drop gives you the latest S24 and all the Galaxy AI fun that goes with it. Don&apos;t think about it too much, or you&apos;ll miss out!</p>

<p>If you need an excuse to upgrade or switch to the Samsung Galaxy S24 ecosystem, this is the perfect time. Amazon's Prime Day will sweeten the deal for the latest unlocked flagship phone from Samsung with a 25% discount. I'm a long-time Galaxy user, and even though the Android version differs from other models, I always keep coming back for more.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> features a 6.2-inch Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2x display with a 1080 x 2340 resolution. You can also count on Gorilla Glass Victus 2, Android with One UI 6.1, and a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor for your Galaxy AI needs. You don't get expandable storage, but the fantastic cameras make up for it.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDRCZBJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7c9141ec-4430-40ba-b342-2febe6512284" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S24 128GB: $799.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S24 128GB: $799.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You have the S21 or older and want a noticeable upgrade in specifications, such as a better camera. If you also need the latest Android version, this could be a good time to upgrade since the S24 series gives you seven years of updates compared to the S23&apos;s four-year promise.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You have an S23 since there is no huge gap in terms of specifications. The displays are almost identical and share other specifications, such as the same IP68, Wi-Fi 6e, Samsung Dex, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB or 256GB of storage. The cameras are also identical, with a 50MP wide-angle, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto. Both selfie cameras can also record 4K video and sport a 12MP wide-angle.</p><p>Some may be disappointed by the 8GB starting point, and they would instead go for a 12GB starting point, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-vs-s23">Galaxy S24 vs. S23</a> reveals. If buying a Samsung phone feels like a highway robbery, waiting for Samsung&apos;s next flagship might be a good idea. The deal might not seem tempting if you don&apos;t care much about all the AI gimmicks surrounding the Galaxy S24 and usually use your phone for everyday tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended if: </strong>You don’t mind paying a subscription to get the most out of it and you want easy installation for a home or a rented apartment or condo. </p><p><strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>You want something without a subscription and/or you want a professional hardwired solution.</p><p>What do you get with the Ring Battery Doorbell Plus? It offers Head-to-Toe HD+ video so you can see everyone from the Uber Eats driver to your child’s short friend, even the package on the ground the delivery driver dropped. There’s motion detection, privacy zones, and Color Night Vision. </p><p>The best part? It’s powered by a quick release battery pack, so you don’t need to fidget with doorbell wiring. Mount it using the included tools, connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network, download the Ring app, and you’re good to go. </p><p>With select Alexa-enabled devices, you can view a live feed (think an Echo Show or Fire TV), save pre-recorded announcements, and enjoy two-way talk. Let the delivery driver know to leave the package at the door or tell a solicitor you’re not interested. The only thing it’s missing is Pre-Roll video, which other models offer to capture a few seconds before the doorbell is pressed to provide additional context.</p>

<p>With a Ring Protect subscription (starts at $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year), you can go back in time and view events (videos up to 180 days and photos for seven days) and share videos, as well as receive package alerts. I have used a Ring video doorbell both with a subscription and without and you’ll miss it when it’s gone. Knowing there’s motion is great if you happen to tap into the app at that very moment. But without a subscription, it’s virtually useless beyond a live view. </p><p>With a Ring Protection subscription, you can see details of events, scrubbing back and forth before and after motion alerts were triggered. The clear view from the camera means you can even see facial features. We recently upgraded to a model with color night vision and the difference is literally night and day. I can look at the app at midnight and it seems like it’s 8 a.m.</p><p>As we mentioned in our round-up of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa">the best smart doorbells that support Alexa</a>, in which we named this model the best overall, the 1,536p HD resolution combined with the head-to-toe video and night vision, long-lasting battery, make it one of the best video doorbells you can buy. I have been using Ring doorbells for years and checking the alerts and live view is one of the first things I do every morning. Take advantage of this Amazon Prime Day deal and join the Ring club with the rest of your neighbors, family members, and friends.</p>

<ul><li>Ultrahuman announced a new app platform for the Ultrahuman Ring AIR called "PowerPlugs."</li><li>Ring AIR owners can add personalized insights to the app like AFib detection, weight loss, Vitamin D, Jet Lag, and Pregnancy Mode.</li><li>The Ring AIR will be the first smart ring with AFib detection, though it's only available in "select geographies."</li><li>Ultrahuman also announced a new "sleep debt" feature last week.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Ultrahuman is personalizing its smart ring software with PowerPlugs, downloadable plug-ins that track specific data like atrial fibrillation (AFib) based on your lifestyle and needs. This, along with its new "sleep debt" feature, is an exciting reminder that Samsung and Oura aren&apos;t the only two players making waves in the smart ring market.</p><p>I spoke with Ultrahuman CEO Mohit Kumar about the new PowerPlugs, which he described as an app store for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>. </p><p>"If you buy a smartphone, you don&apos;t need to download every app in the store," Kumar said. With a smart ring, he argues, the principle is the same: different users have different "use cases," and a frequent traveler or a homebody focused on weight loss will need different info highlighted in their smart ring app.</p><p>"Over the next few years, you could expect thousands of applications to be built on top of Ultrahuman&apos;s comprehensive health data platform," Kumar claims. </p><p>He told me that Ultrahuman has gotten several requests from developers to use its SDK for clinical trials, and specifically is working with one team to find "mental health biomarkers" to better quantify the physical affects of mental health and anxiety. </p><p>Now, devs will be able to use "UltraSignal," its developer platform, to work on their own smart ring programs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RUfrZmsbaB2RyHP6etwFL5" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-on-finger-on-top-of-pillow.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air on the author's index finger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RUfrZmsbaB2RyHP6etwFL5.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AFib detection is the headline PowerPlug feature, though Ultrahuman is still working with regulatory bodies to get it approved in some countries. If activated, it&apos;ll trigger spurts of continuous PPG readings at night to catch approximately "91%" of irregular heart rhythm events.</p><p>I asked Kumar why other smart rings hadn&apos;t tracked AFib before. He explained the many challenges: the sensor must be "sensitive" enough to catch AFib but specific enough to avoid false positives. Unlike some smartwatches with continuous passive AFib detection, the Ultrahuman Ring Air will only check at night to reduce the odds of false readings from "noise" like caffeine.</p><p>He also noted that aside from needing clinical validation, they need to validate the smart ring form factor itself. He said that they "want to build trust by working with regulators and the FDA" since data like AFib is "extremely powerful." And he argued that the team&apos;s work on other medical devices (like their glucose monitor) made them well-suited to launch this feature before other smart ring brands like Oura.</p><p>Ultrahuman&apos;s PowerPlug for AFib will draw slightly more power — "maybe 5% extra battery life" — but most other add-ons will use already available data and interpret it using the cloud. In theory, you can add as many PowerPlugs as you want, Kumar says, but most people won&apos;t <em>need</em> every tracked metric.</p>

<p>Other early Ultrahuman PowerPlugs include Caffeine Window, Circadian Rhythm, Cycle Tracking, Jet Lag, Ovulation, Pregnancy Mode, and Vitamin D. You can already find some of this data in the Ultrahuman app, like when to avoid too much caffeine or light, but it appears this new system will partition that info so you don&apos;t have to see it if it&apos;s irrelevant to you.</p><p>The Vitamin D plug-in sounds intriguing. It&apos;ll calculate "optimal times for you to step outside, based on your skin type, location, and current UV index" before "estimating how much Vitamin D (in IU) your skin will absorb during your session.</p><p>Regarding future smart ring applications, Kumar explained that they look at specific use cases and feedback from Ultrahuman Ring Air users to plan out what data to add next. They then need to prove that they can accurately produce that information before rolling it out to the public.</p><p>Kumar says that his ideal future PowerPlug will focus on in-depth stress data. Although the Ring Air has a stress rhythm score, he believes that the way most wearables track stress using heart rate or electrodermal response (EDA) is "primitive" and that he wants to go a layer deeper than heart rate variability (HRV) in the future.</p><p>He also mentioned sleep deficiency, hearkening to Ultrahuman&apos;s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/ultrahumanhq/p/C9P2fhnSMao/?img_index=1">Sleep Debt</a> feature that shows the impact of long-term bad sleep habits, and that one long night of catch-up sleep won&apos;t erase the deficit.</p>

<p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> launching later this month, the smart ring category will get more public recognition and advertising. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring</a> is its natural rival as the top-selling smart ring and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-sues-oura-to-prevent-galaxy-ring-patent-challenge">legal foe</a>, but other smart ring brands will take advantage of this window as well.</p><p>What I find exciting about Ultrahuman&apos;s PowerPlug launch is its ambition and customization. People new to smart rings see them as mini-smartwatches with fewer features and limited room to grow. But smart rings released years ago keep adding new data points using the same data, crowding the apps with a ton of information.</p><p>Most wearables claim to track "stress" in some way, but oftentimes users find that the biomarkers companies use don&apos;t match their real-life experience. Whether Ultrahuman or another smart ring brand can dive deeper into mental health data, that&apos;s a positive development.</p><p>Whether or not we actually see "thousands" of PowerPlugs, I love the vision of third-party developers creating smart ring "apps" based on common data and allowing consumers to tailor their smart ring app experience to something useful for their specific lifestyle. </p><p>Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI has a few personalized Wellness Tips for Galaxy Ring owners related to specific data like resting heart rate and sleep quality. My hope is that Samsung continues to expand on these customized efforts and that other smart rings focus on personalization as well.</p>

You get the same great cameras, software, and hardware, and even the battery life is much better than previous years.</p><p>But the introduction of the Pixel 8a made the Pixel 8 obsolete; the 8a has most of the same features, and while it uses older cameras, it also takes great photos and videos. Usually, I&apos;d just recommend getting the Pixel 8a over the standard model, but with Prime Day, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Unlocked-Smartphone-Advanced/dp/B0CGTD5KVT">Pixel 8 is down to just $499</a> — the launch price of the 8a — making it a no-brainer. The Pixel 8a is also getting a discount and is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-8a-Unlocked-Advanced/dp/B0CYQ916ZY">down to $449</a>, but given the $50 difference between the two, I&apos;d recommend the Pixel 8.</p>

<p>A big part of what makes the Pixel 8 great is the software; Google is the only manufacturer to provide a clean interface without any bloatware and plenty of useful AI-assisted features. At A Glance, Now Playing, Magic Eraser, Recorder, and Audio Magic Eraser make a huge difference in daily use, and these are the sort of utilities that actually benefit from machine learning.</p><p>Another major reason is the cameras; the Pixel 8 takes outstanding photos and videos in just about any scenario, and although it doesn&apos;t have a 5x zoom lens, it does a great job up to 3x. The hardware isn&apos;t on par with Qualcomm — with Google prioritizing AI instead — but it is great in daily use, and there are no slowdowns. </p>
<p>✅Recommended if: You&apos;re in the market for a small phone that&apos;s great to hold and use. The Pixel 8 has the same caliber of cameras as the Pixel 8 Pro, and the same great software features infused with AI. The battery life is better than previous generations, the software is a delight to use, and the screen is noticeably brighter.</p><p>❌Skip this deal if: You want a larger phone, need 5x optical zoom, or want to use Video Boost.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t a fan of the battery life of smaller Pixels, but Google addressed this issue this time around, and I routinely got a day&apos;s worth of use out of the Pixel 8. Similarly, the 120Hz OLED panel is significantly brighter than previous generations, and is on the same level as the best Android phones.</p>
