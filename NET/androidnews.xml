<hr>
<p>OnePlus isn&apos;t expected to debut its next flagship phone for a while, but that&apos;s not stopping these rumors from speculating on what we might see.</p><p>Rumors stem from notable Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OgG18rs6V?pagetype=profilefeed">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) on Weibo, which states the OnePlus 13 could miss out on wireless charging (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/06/oneplus-13-may-not-include-wireless-charging-details-tipped.html">Android Headlines</a>). The device may sport a 6,000mAh battery, backed by 100W wired charging. Additionally, as previously rumored, the OnePlus 13 will likely gain strength from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4-power-hungry-rumor">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>.</p><p>The leaks continue as DCS posted another set of rumors about the device&apos;s supposed camera and display specification, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/06/03/oneplus-13-display-battery-leak/">Gizmochina</a>.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 will supposedly feature an "upgraded" 50MP periscope triple camera setup. The tipster didn&apos;t suggest what the other two lenses would be. Additionally, the phone is rumored to offer a 6.8-inch 2K 8T LTPO "customized" display.</p><p>The post explains that the display will be almost entirely flat as OnePlus could place a "micro-curved" glass on top of it. Such changes might add to its "conventionally" large display size.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is a device that launched without any noticeable drawbacks. For context, the device offers a 6.8-inch LTPO AMOLED. However, one of its notable features, which the OnePlus 11 didn&apos;t have, was wireless charging. The 2024 flagship offered 100W wired charging alongside 50W wireless charging capabilities. It was one of the phone&apos;s highest talking points as OnePlus continued to hone its flagship craft.</p><p>Additionally, this year&apos;s launch only offers a 5,400mAh battery, so that&apos;s another improvement aside from its display and camera changes.</p><p>In March, the OnePlus 13 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-oneplus-13-leaks-point-to-redesign-and-upgraded-fingerprint-sensor">was rumored</a> to feature a design change and an upgraded fingerprint sensor. Those whispers suggested there could be a change to its "hinge," which was a reference to the phone&apos;s camera visor as it flows off to the side of its frame. Doubling down on that rumor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-oneplus-13r-likely-to-look-different-in-design">was a leak in May</a> that supposedly contained a mock-up of its supposed design changes.</p><p>Speculation states the OnePlus 13 could have its circular camera array moved to the center of its back panel instead of on its side. Moreover, the OnePlus 13R could separate from the pack and offer a side-mounted squarish array.</p><p>Recent rumors have suggested that OnePlus could launch its next flagship phone late this year.</p>

<ul><li>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the Meta Connect 2024 dates — September 25–26 — on Instagram Stories. </li><li>Meta unveiled the Quest 3, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses, and AI features at Connect 2023.</li><li>We expect the leaked Meta Quest 3s and "Orion" AR glasses prototype to appear at Meta Connect 2024. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta Connect 2024 will take place on September 25–26, Mark Zuckerberg revealed in a brief <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/zuck/3382402766048980457?utm_source=ig_story_item_share&igsh=NnRtMmZ4YWQxN2U3" target="_blank">Instagram story</a> on Monday. Meta&apos;s social media accounts promise that Connect 2024 will "explore the future of AI and mixed reality and share progress on our long-term vision to help build the metaverse."</p><p>We won&apos;t know more about the Connect 2024 itinerary for months. That being said, Meta&apos;s PR team prioritizing AI before XR feels like an intentional choice. After Google covered two straight hours of AI at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">I/O 2024</a>, Meta might take a similar approach this fall, showing off how its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Meta AI</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Llama 3</a> models have evolved.</p><p>If <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">you&apos;re sick of AI</a>, that won&apos;t sound appealing. But unlike Google, Meta should counterbalance its AI push with plenty of hardware announcements to keep consumers invested.</p><p>Months of leaks have us confident that Zuckerberg will unveil the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3s (or Quest Lite)</a> on stage at Meta Connect 2024, just as he revealed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> at Connect 2023. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🗓️ Mark your calendars 🗓️ Meta Connect 2024 will be September 25 + 26 where we'll explore the future of AI and mixed reality and share progress on our long-term vision to help build the metaverse.<a href="https://twitter.com/MetaNewsroom/status/1797709393989140935">June 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The Meta Quest 3s is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/leaked-meta-quest-3s-looks-like-quest-2-with-new-brain-and-eyeballs">rumored</a> to have the Quest 3&apos;s Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip and RGB cameras for full-color XR passthrough, but the thicker Quest 2 lenses with lower display resolution — all to target an alleged $299 price tag that&apos;ll appeal to budget buyers. </p><p>Meta announced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">open-source Horizon OS</a> earlier this year, with partners like ASUS ROG and Lenovo promising to make their own VR headsets. So it&apos;s <em>possible</em> they could join the stage at Connect to exhibit their new hardware — though we suspect Meta wouldn&apos;t want these companies to steal the Quest 3s&apos; thunder. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5E8BKUEYYRzqjuJSS9hi9m" name="Meta-Connect-2023-logo.jpeg" alt="Meta Connect 2023 logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5E8BKUEYYRzqjuJSS9hi9m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition, we&apos;ve heard credible reports that Meta intends to show off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-will-reportedly-showcase-prototype-ar-glasses-at-connect-2024">Orion AR glasses prototype at Connect 2024</a>. Allegedly, there is "internal pressure to ensure a high level of performance" with this prototype when it&apos;s first shown off to the public. </p><p>Caitlin Kalinowski, Meta&apos;s Head of AR Glasses Hardware, told us in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">exclusive interview</a> that they&apos;re working on AR glasses with "high field-of-view immersion" that will, in her words, trigger the same "Oh my God, WOW! I can&apos;t believe this" reactions as the original Oculus Rift when it first introduced a ton of people to VR. </p>
<p>While Meta&apos;s AR glasses won&apos;t be consumer-ready for years, Meta Connect 2024 attendees might have the chance to try the first-ever public prototype. In the meantime, Meta will probably spend time focusing on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses</a>, which recently got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">major multimodal AI upgrade</a>.</p><p>Last year&apos;s event took place on Meta&apos;s campus in Menlo Park, California, while pre-pandemic Connects took place at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center. We&apos;ll find out later this year where to expect this next event, but non-Californians should be able to stream the keynote via Facebook or YouTube. </p>

<p>Slowly but surely, more information about the Pixel 9 series is coming to light, and the latest leaks involve Google&apos;s 2024 chipset.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rozetked.me/news/33532-eksklyuziv-rezul-taty-testov-pixel-9-9-pro-i-9-pro-xl">Rozetked </a>(Russian) spotted the Pixel 9 trio undergoing the hurdles of the AnTuTu benchmark test (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-9-tensor-g4-benchmark-scores/">Android Police</a>). Running the Tensor G4, the base Pixel 9 scored 1.07 million points. The middle Pixel 9 Pro achieved 1.14 million points, while the Pixel 9 Pro XL reached 1.17 million points.</p><p>As the publication notes, these numbers ma]\y seem high, but they&apos;re only slightly higher than the base Pixel 8 at 900,000. This is likely due to Google&apos;s minimal changes, as the Tensor G4 features an ARMv9-A core architecture.</p><p>Simply put, the chip offers one Cortex-A4 at 3.1GHz, three Cortex-A720 cores at 2.6GHz, and four Cortex-A520 cores at 1.95GHz.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t seem like we&apos;re in for a <em>major </em>power boost for the Pixel series with the Tensor G4. However, it&apos;s worth noting that these early test numbers aren&apos;t indicative of the Pixel 9&apos;s final release strength.</p><p>Things could get better (or stay the same), so we&apos;ll have to wait until after the summer.</p>

<p>For context, last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Tensor G3</a> features one Cortex-X3 core clocked at 2.91 GHz, four Cortex-A715 performance cores (2.37 GHz), and four Cortex-A510 cores (1.7 GHz). Google&apos;s chip features one more core dedicated to efficiency, however, it fell short of Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in terms of speed for its performance and prime cores. Moreover, the chip still gets warm pretty quickly and it&apos;s bad news for gamers as their FPS will continuously drop during long play sessions.</p><p>AI was what Google banked on — and there&apos;s no reason why that wouldn&apos;t continue to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">be the case this year</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s been rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-might-not-surprise">since last year</a> that the Tensor G4 might not be a major powerhouse over the G3. The chip is supposedly using the codename "Zuma Pro," which builds upon the G3&apos;s "Zuma" name. Speculation pointed toward a more minimal upgrade as Google reportedly scrapped its entirely new processor, codename "Redondo," due to sharp delays.</p><p>Other reports stated the chip <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-samsung-upgraded-tensor-g4-process">will lean on Samsung&apos;s</a> third-generation SF4P 4nm process. This, again, is only <em>slightly </em>better than the Tensor G3&apos;s SF4 process. Elsewhere, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/entire-pixel-9-series-live-photos-specs-leak">entire Pixel 9 series</a> leaked in live photos just hours before Google&apos;s I/O 2024 keynote event in May.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new OnePlus tablet seems to be on the way, and a recent benchmark listing suggests it could be a high-end device, likely named the OnePlus Pad 2, featuring a flagship processor from Qualcomm.</p><p>According to a Geekbench listing, the OnePlus Pad 2 will be powered by Qualcomm’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> chipset, the same processor that will likely power the OPPO Pad 3 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-pad-2-geekbench-snapdragon-8-gen-3/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a>). This aligns with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-rumored-chipset">earlier leaks from Max Jambor</a>, which indicated the new tablet would sport Qualcomm’s latest and greatest chipset.</p><p>Given that OPPO and OnePlus are owned by the same parent company, they often share technology, making it reasonable to expect the OPPO Pad 3 and OnePlus Pad 2 to have identical specs.</p><p>The upcoming OnePlus tablet appeared on Geekbench with the model number OPD2404, while the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a> had the OPD2203 model number. The new device scored 2,079 points in the single-core test and 6,077 points in the multi-core test, presumably thanks to the upgraded processor.</p><p>The original OnePlus Pad, launched last year, featured a MediaTek Dimensity 9000 chipset. While decent, using 2021 hardware for a 2023 tablet was unusual. The OnePlus Pad 2 could rectify this with a more modern and powerful chipset.</p><p>In addition to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, the benchmark listing reveals the tablet will have at least 8GB of RAM and will run Android 14 out of the box. This tablet is also expected to have a huge 9,510mAh battery, likely with fast charging support.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 marks a significant improvement over MediaTek&apos;s  Dimensity 9000, potentially leading to other exciting upgrades like switching from an LCD to an AMOLED panel—a staple of today&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">premium tablets</a>.</p><p>Although these enhancements might increase the OnePlus Pad 2’s price, the company could still offer strong value compared to Samsung’s tablets.</p>

Sometimes you may need to view an ad before you can keep browsing," the feature&apos;s prompt reads.</p><p>The platform is only testing this feature for a handful of people, as none of Android Central&apos;s staff has experienced these disruptions on the app. </p><p>Until now, Instagram has shown ads in between posts or stories that users can simply scroll past. However, according to this Reddit thread, this unskippable ad situation has only been getting on users&apos; nerves. </p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1d52psw/ad_break_ie_unskippable_ads_now_on_instagram">“Ad Break” ie. unskippable ads now on Instagram</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram">r/Instagram</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>One user stated that these ads are definitely a business decision and that they would leave the platform if this continued. </p><p>"I hate this new "feature" so much - it is so in your face and to me, feels like a terrible business decision. The whole platform is already basically "soft ads" that generate revenue based on people being on there for ages, consuming content without thinking too much about it all and now they&apos;re forcing users to stop scrolling and drawing attention to the fact they&apos;re on an app designed to sell them things."</p><p>As a workaround, the user said they "simply close the app as soon as an ad break pops up, and if this continues, I&apos;ll be unsubscribing." </p><p>While other users on the same thread stated that they would "100% be quitting/uninstalling the app."</p><p>One good thing that could come out of this "Ad-break" is that it would give users a break from going down the Instagram rabbit hole for hours, leading to unwanted procrastination. </p>

<p>Instagram first introduced ads on its feed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-tests-notes-profile-ads">back in 2022</a>, but it remains unclear when the social media company will roll out these ad breaks to more users.

<p>A lot of times when a new smartphone comes out, it&apos;s not a huge leap over its predecessor. This is especially true with midrange phones, as companies try to keep costs down by using cheaper parts and opting for older chipsets. With the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024, Motorola may have borrowed the same chipset from its predecessor, but nearly everything else has changed to the point that you wouldn&apos;t know these phones are only a year apart.</p><p>So what does this mean for the Moto G Stylus 5G 2023? While its successor makes quite a leap, is the phone still worth buying for someone looking to save money on their next phone purchase? Lets take a look.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-vs-stylus-5g-2023-design-and-display-2">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 vs. Stylus 5G 2023: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4220px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dyr7qwifi4RZtZvSi5CP6a" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-vs-Stylus-5G-2023-09.jpg" alt="The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 next to the Stylus 5G 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dyr7qwifi4RZtZvSi5CP6a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4220" height="2374" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to design, these two phones could not be any more different. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a> features Motorola&apos;s new design language, moving away from typical plastic found on many cheap Android phones and instead going with vegan leather. It&apos;s really just a fancier, textured plastic, but it feels soft in the hand and keeps the phone from getting too warm or too cool. The phone also has a plastic frame, but you won&apos;t know that at first; it looks and feels like brushed aluminum, which adds to the rather premium look of the phone.</p><p>By comparison, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2023</a> looks a lot more conventional. The back is constructed with plastic but made to look like frosted glass, so the color sort of shifts a bit when light hits it. The back panel curves into the frame, which is also plastic.</p><p>However, the differences also extend to the front of these phones. The display on the 2024 model is a hair larger at 6.7 inches, but you wouldn&apos;t know it just from holding the phones side-by-side, as they&apos;re nearly the same size. That&apos;s because the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 has much smaller bezels around its display, giving the phone more than a 93% screen-to-body ratio. With bezels this small, you&apos;d think this was a flagship phone, especially when compared to the 2023 model, which has much larger bezels and a more prominent chin.</p>

<p>The display technology has also been upgraded between the phones. The 2024 model has moved to an OLED panel while retaining the 120Hz refresh rate and Motorola&apos;s flicker prevention feature—a staple for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive users</a>. Compared to the Moto G Stylus 5G 2023, this new display is punchier and much more vibrant. Contrast seems to be dialed up a bit, so you can lose some of the details in darker parts of content, but overall the screen quality is pretty good.</p><p>The 2023 model has a good display for an LCD panel, and while it doesn&apos;t get as punchy as the 2024 model, it still has decent color reproduction. That said, you may want to set the display to Saturated in the settings to give content a bit of a boost.</p><p>Meanwhile, both displays have 120Hz panels, so the navigation of content is as smooth as you can imagine. The Stylus 5G 2024 does have the benefit of an in-display fingerprint sensor which is impressive for an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">Android phone under $400</a>. It works surprisingly well and about as quickly as the side-mounted sensor on the 2023 model. The only downside is that it&apos;s oddly placed on the display, quite close to the bottom.</p>

<p>Despite quite a few upgrades on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024, the phone weights a little bit less than its predecessor at 190g. Still, at 202g, the 2023 model doesn&apos;t feel particularly heavy, but you may have to get used to how light the 2024 model feels in hand. I imagine this is due to the type of plastic used on the back, which feels more like a light fabric than anything.</p><p>For protection, the Moto G Stylus 5G 2023 misses out on an IP rating, but the 2024 model comes with IP52, which is fine for light splashes and the like. Just don&apos;t go swimming with either phone.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Motorola opted to keep the same chipset on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024. Normally, I would question this decision, but after using the phone, my concerns were quickly allayed. The performance of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-6-gen-1-snapdragon-4-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 6 Gen 1</a> is spectacular and much better than I remember after using the 2023 model, which also performed quite well. The biggest difference here is likely the 8GB of RAM on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024, two more than its predecessor, and likely giving the phone a nice boost when running apps.</p><p>That said, you won&apos;t really run into any issues with either phone, even when playing graphics-intensive games. Honkai Star: Rail runs quite well, even on the highest settings, although you may experience a little wonkiness on the 2023 model. Still, you&apos;ll be able to get through plenty of tasks without issue on these phones, but the extra RAM on the 2024 model is helpful.</p>

<p>Both phones come with Bluetooth 5.1, NFC, and 3.5mm headphone jacks. They also have dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support, and audio sounds great from both devices.</p><p>On the software side, the 2023 model was recently updated to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> at the time of writing, which is the only major OS upgrade the phone will receive. That said, the phone will continue to receive security updates roughly every other month for another two years, so there&apos;s that.</p><p>It&apos;s a similar story for the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024, although the phone runs Android 14 out of the box and will eventually get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. Motorola has added a number of new software tweaks with this version of Android 14, as the UI is somewhat different from that of the 2023 model. The differences on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 include a new (optional) layout for the quick settings panel, AI-generated wallpapers, lock screen widgets, a new look for the Settings menu, and more. It&apos;s not a massive overhaul, but it&apos;s a much cleaner look and gives Motorola a bit more individuality.</p><p>The newer model also has features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-razr-plus-update-brings-moto-unplugged">Moto Unplugged</a> and Smart Connect, which is the rebranded version of Ready For. This allows the phone to connect to computers, TVs, and monitors for easily moving files, streaming apps on a larger display, browsing via a mobile desktop UI, and much more. Unfortunately, this is still not available on the 2023 model, and it&apos;s unsure why the UIs are so different between the phones.</p>

<p>Of course, both phones come with styli, but the 2024 model gets a redesign with a thicker body, making it look more like an S Pen. Motorola says it should have more contact area and improved software for better responsiveness, but overall, the experience between the two phones is roughly the same and nothing like you&apos;d find on an actual S Pen.</p><p>Keeping the lights on is a 5,000mAh battery, an attribute shared by both devices. You should be able to get through a day of use and perhaps even more, depending on your habits. Motorola improved the charging speed for the 2024 model, giving it 30W wired instead of 20W, making it faster than some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a>, although not as fast as some other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a>. The phone even has wireless charging at 15W, something you don&apos;t often see at this price point (even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a> only has 5W wireless charging).</p>

<p>Both phones feature fairly similar camera setups, aside from the added resolution in the ultrawide sensor on the 2024 model. Still, image quality gets a huge boost thanks to OIS and PDAF on the primary sensor. As you can see from the images below, the 2024 model produces bright and detailed images, which have a level of crispness that images from the 2023 model lack.</p><p>Last year&apos;s Stylus tends to process images with more warmth, and the phone seems incapable of pulling in as much light, so details are lost a bit in darker areas, which the 2024 model is able to brighten up and highlight thanks to better dynamic range. I&apos;ve also noticed that images from the Stylus 5G 2024 are a bit truer to life, which I often prefer in images.</p>

<p>Neither phone has a telephoto lens, but you can see how the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is able to retain more detail in the statue and the building behind it at 2x zoom. Interestingly, this is where the Stylus 5G 2023 model produces a cooler image than the 2024 model; all the while, the Stylus 5G 2024 continues to have a more accurate representation of the scene.</p>

<p>The difference in detail becomes more apparent with low-light and nighttime images. In the photo of the boat on a river, you can better make out the ripples in the water and even some of the details of the trees in the background. On the 2023 model, the water looks quite muddy and there&apos;s virtually zero detail in anything on the other side of the river. White balance also seems slightly off and there&apos;s an unappealing green-ish tint on the boat.</p>

<p>In this final image, the Eiffel Tower is slightly blown out on the 2023 model, while the Stylus 5G 2024 manages to retain a good amount of detail. The image is also much more brighter on the newer phone without overdoing it and reigning in noise as much as possible. The clouds appear much more dramatic on the Stylus 5G 2023, but the rest of the image is rather dark.</p>

<p>The 2024 model also has a few extra features not found on its predecessor. One of these features is the Auto Enhance, which attempts to improve images by adding extra processing via Google Photos. This might have been useful on the Stylus 5G 2023 to help punch up image quality a bit, but I find that you can go without it on the newer model.</p>

<p>Motorola&apos;s Stylus models are some of the best value phones money can buy, short of the Pixel A-series. In 2023, I was pretty impressed with the Stylus 5G, but I never found myself particularly attached to it. That has changed with this newer model, as the phone feels like Motorola is teetering on the cusp of midrange and flagship.</p><p>Despite having the same chipset, the Moto G Stylus 5G brings more RAM, better cameras, a vibrant OLED display, wireless charging, and a better-designed stylus, making this phone a clear winner between it and its predecessor, especially when you can get it for the same launch price.</p><p>That said, if you&apos;re looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a>, you can get the 2023 model for even less now that its successor is available. But if you&apos;re stuck choosing between these two phones, I would suggest grabbing the newer and much better Stylus 5G 2024.</p>

<p>Caleb asks:</p><p><em><strong>I just bought a Pixel 8 and am a little confused at the location settings screen. What is Google Location Accuracy? Do i need to enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning? I just want to make sure my phone can tell a 911 operator where it is if i ever need to call.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>It&apos;s been a while since i had a new phone so I want to make sure I get everything right. Thanks!</strong></em></p>
<p>I&apos;ll be honest, this is something that I haven&apos;t looked at in a while and I can see why you might have questions — it&apos;s a mess! I&apos;m going to assume an Android update made the changes and put all the options out there, and in typical Google fashion, there isn&apos;t much to explain them.</p><p>The good news first: making sure emergency services can locate you is now easier than ever because there&apos;s a single dedicated option for it.</p><p>The bad news is that some of this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-show-all-android-location-sharing-settings-in-one-place">may be changing again</a> as part of the changes expected to come with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">Google&apos;s Find My Device network</a>. In the meantime, let&apos;s take a look at how it works today.</p>
<p>On your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro-deals-of-the-month">Pixel phone</a>, it&apos;s called <strong>Emergency Location Service for your Android device. </strong>It should be labeled as something similar on another brand and every phone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a> or higher and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it">Google Services</a> support should have a setting for it.</p><p>If you tap to open the settings choice, you can toggle it on or off. When it&apos;s on, any time you call or text an emergency number, anything that helps get a more precise location for you can be turned on. That location data is forwarded to an "authorized emergency partner" who will tell emergency services where you are located.</p><p>Note that this means a trusted (by Google) third party gets the data, uses it to get your actual location, and then sends it to emergency services. The operator you&apos;re calling isn&apos;t (and probably can&apos;t) interpret the data themselves.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:112.18%;"><img id="ZSE7Wgm5jSJm6cVfL4vGCc" name="Google-emergency-location.png" alt="Google Location settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZSE7Wgm5jSJm6cVfL4vGCc.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2160" height="2423" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like me, you sound curious about how this works with Google Location Accuracy, Wi-Fi scanning, and Bluetooth scanning. ELS will turn these things on, then turn Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth on to use them if needed. The documentation doesn&apos;t say it will turn them off afterward, though, and I can&apos;t test that without actually trying it; I can&apos;t just call 911 and say "I wanna test something." I assume it <em>doesn&apos;t</em> turn them off and you should do that manually if you don&apos;t want them enabled. Either way, it&apos;s the last thing you should worry about if there is an emergency.</p><p>But what are those services? There <em>is</em> documentation about that and I climbed into that rabbit hole because this is the sort of thing l love learning about!</p>
<p><strong>Google Location Accuracy:</strong> When Google Location Accuracy is off, your phone uses GPS radios and local sensors like the accelerometer or barometer to determine your location. When turned on, Wi-Fi and your mobile data network are used in tandem with GPS and sensor data.</p><p>This can be set on a per-app basis, too. If you use an app that requests location, choose <strong>precise</strong> to use Google Location Accuracy, or <strong>approximate</strong> to disable it.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning: </strong>When these settings are enabled, your phone will periodically scan for existing Wi-Fi access points or Bluetooth devices. Many APs and Bluetooth beacons are in known locations so scanning for them could tell an app you&apos;re 50 feet away from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, for example.</p><p>You don&apos;t need to connect to anything because your distance away from a known access point or Bluetooth beacon can be determined by signal strength alone.</p>
<p>When your phone uses all these methods to determine its location, it can be done much faster and more accurately than with GPS alone. GPS and sensors are still helpful, but knowing you&apos;re close to something like a known Wi-Fi AP narrows things down quickly.</p>

<p>I can&apos;t tell you what you might want to do when it comes to your location, how it&apos;s tracked, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-app-live-location-sharing">who you share it with</a>. You should do what feels most comfortable to you and not listen to anyone on the internet who says you <em><strong>have</strong></em> to do something. I can tell you what I do, and why though.</p><p>I value my privacy and do not want my location shared with just any person or company. Having said that, I leave everything enabled. </p><p>This is because of Android granular Location permission. When an apps wants to use your location you have a few choices — you can tell it no, never. You can tell it only when I want to use this app, and you can tell it to only use an approximate location.</p>
<p>I think this is where someone can be more choosy about sharing their data. Leaving everything enabled means I can get a fast and precise location if and when I need it, but only if and when I need it. the Lowe&apos;s app can pound sand and I&apos;ll enter my location manually.</p><p>You&apos;ll find people who think differently, and you should listen to what they are saying, too. The most important thing is that you know almost every app or website out there wants to try and track your location and you have ways to limit who can do it and how.</p><p>In any case, we should all leave <strong>Emergency Location Service</strong> turned on in case we need it.

<ul><li>Last week, Google News and Verizon joined a growing list of critical services that have faced widespread outages in 2024.</li><li>Both services are back up and running, but the Verizon outage specifically left users unable to communicate for hours. </li><li>These issues call the reliability of websites and messaging services into question, but satellite connectivity might be able to help.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It doesn’t feel like it, but we’re almost halfway through 2024. So far, it hasn’t been a great year for critical digital infrastructure services. Carriers like AT&T and Verizon suffered major outages, Google News went down briefly, and iMessage became unavailable too at various points this year. Service outages are inevitable, but we’ve seen some big ones that could have had massive consequences. </p><p>Most recently, Google News/Discover and Verizon had service outages late last week in unrelated incidents. In the grand scheme of things, Google News becoming unavailable for a few hours probably isn’t that big of a deal. The same can’t be said for the other service outages we’ve seen so far this year. Verizon’s problem caused thousands of users across multiple states to lose connectivity from the evening of Thursday, May 30, through midday on Friday, May 31.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good day, Megan!

<p>In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2024/05/30/verizon-network-outage/73915050007/" target="_blank">USA Today</a>, the company explained the situation. ”Some customers, primarily in Midwestern and Western states, experienced a service interruption for several hours yesterday,” a Verizon spokesperson said on May 31. “Our engineers worked quickly to solve the issue, and service was restored at 3 a.m. CT. Any customers still experiencing issues should power cycle their phones.”</p><p>Verizon’s support team replied to multiple user complaints on social media and said that most outages are resolved within 48 hours. The company took far less time to fix the problem this time, but it shouldn’t downplay the scariness of the situation. Simply being unable to connect with others for a few minutes, let alone hours, could have disastrous consequences. This is especially true in Midwestern and Western states, where the Verizon outage occurred since people are more likely to live in rural areas where a cell phone could be their only way to get help in an emergency.</p><p>Verizon was the carrier affected last week, but something like this could happen to any of the cellular carriers. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/att-outage-follows-massive-solar-flares">AT&T suffered from a worse incident in February</a>, when over 73,000 users lost service. Throw the iMessage outage into the mix—although it is less severe because SMS and MMS messaging can be used as a fallback—and you have a scary pattern developing. </p>

<p>It’s a reminder that the messaging services and cellular networks we rely on daily, and the ones that are used in life-or-death situations, are far from invincible. Still, there may be a light at the end of the tunnel. Android 15 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15s-satellite-messaging-is-already-showing-up-for-some-t-mobile-users">all but confirmed to support satellite messaging</a>, and it could be the solution to 2024’s outage problem.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-so-many-services-facing-outages-2">Why are so many services facing outages?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj" name="Google-Messages-iMessage-green-bubble.jpg" alt="Google Messages on an Android phone and iMessage on an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First, it’s important to note that we don’t know all the details behind the major outages that have occurred this year. AT&T said its February service issue stemmed from the “application and execution of an incorrect process used as we were expanding our network, not a cyber attack.” While Verizon acknowledged last week’s outage, it only referred to it as a “service interruption” and did not provide further information.</p><p>Apple’s iMessage service went down on May 16 between 5:39 PM ET and 6:35 PM ET, according to the company’s services status page. Apple didn’t give up much either, only saying that “some users were affected” and that “users were unable to use this service.” </p><p>Similarly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-services-outage-is-affecting-everyone-worldwide">the Google News outage last week</a> was fixed rather quickly, but Google didn’t say what went wrong. </p><p>This string of outages likely happened over the span of a few months by mere coincidence. They are all independent incidents, and outages do happen on occasion. However, given the importance of these services, it’s more alarming that they have all suffered major problems at various points throughout 2024. </p>
<h2 id="how-satellite-messaging-in-android-15-can-help-2">How satellite messaging in Android 15 can help</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g9Bi4RbHqqdWBpSRdhqiWg" name="android-15-logo-devices.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g9Bi4RbHqqdWBpSRdhqiWg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s quite frightening to think that, if you were in need of assistance during a Verizon or AT&T outage, your means of connecting to first responders or family members could be restricted. That’s where satellite messaging might come in. Android 15 will add the feature, letting users on supported plans message anyone over satellite. This functionality won’t do anything to stop outages from occurring, but it could give users another way to reach people in the event a cellular network or messaging service suffers an outage. </p><p>We don’t know all the details of how Android 15 will integrate satellite messaging, but based on what we do know about how other phones and devices use satellite connectivity, it’s likely that satellite messaging will help in the event a service goes down. Satellite services use direct-to-cell connections, meaning that they work outside a carrier’s typical network of towers. T-Mobile, for example, is said to be partnering with Starlink to provide satellite messaging. So, if the T-Mobile network has an outage, it’s possible that users could still communicate using Starlink satellites. </p><p>Apple’s implementation of Emergency SOS via Satellite is further evidence of how satellite messaging could come in handy in an emergency. This iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 feature lets these phones connect to Globalstar’s satellite network, completely bypassing your carrier’s network. If an iPhone 14 or 15 user loses their cellular connectivity due to an outage, they can still use Emergency SOS via Satellite to contact help.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>’s version of the feature could be even more useful. By all accounts, Android users will be able to use satellite messaging anytime Wi-Fi or cellular is unavailable, not just in an emergency. That would make it <em>more</em> helpful in the case of a network outage.</p>
<h2 id="satellite-could-be-the-future-of-connectivity-beyond-just-messaging-2">Satellite could be the future of connectivity, beyond just messaging</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="jdiY2cygboKoZHoG8cghEN" name="starlink-lifestyle-06.jpg" alt="Starlink Lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jdiY2cygboKoZHoG8cghEN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If anything, these service outages should emphasize satellite as the future of connectivity. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/starlink-home-internet-review">Starlink</a> is doing some amazing things, and it extends far beyond satellite messaging on Android 15. It has brought high-speed internet virtually anywhere on earth — and in the sky, by way of planes, as well as the sea, via ships. It’ll only get better from here, and it could make massive outages a thing of the past. </p>

<hr>
<p>Honor was recently speculated to launch its first clamshell-style <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> in China this June. Now, the company has confirmed on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/3206603957/OhfjmAvd5" target="_blank">Weibo</a> the debut of the Honor Magic V Flip on June 13.</p><p>You can already reserve the phone on Honor&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/cn/shop/product/10086290160281.html" target="_blank">Chinese website</a>, where its configurations and color options are displayed (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/honor-magic-v-flip-china-launch-date-announced/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a>). The listing confirms the phone will be available in Camellia White, Champagne Pink, and Iris Black.</p><p>The reservation page also reveals that the Magic V Flip will come in three RAM and storage configurations: 12+256GB, 12+512GB, and 12GB+1TB. It will be sold through JD.com, Tmall, and Honor Mall.</p><p>However, details about its global availability remain undisclosed. Given Honor&apos;s presence in various international markets, a global release of the Honor Magic V Flip may be announced later.</p>

<p>The full specs of the phone are still a mystery. Rumors suggest that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-v-flip-cover-display-battery-case-rumors">external display might be the largest among its competitors</a>. Official images of the Honor Magic V Flip support this claim.</p><p>Other sources familiar with Honor’s products claim the Magic V Flip will be the thinnest and lightest foldable clamshell on the market.</p><p>The rear camera setup is rumored to feature a 50MP main camera with an f/1.9 aperture and OIS support, accompanied by a smaller secondary camera below it. Interestingly, the LED flash is positioned in the lower half of the device.</p><p>Earlier rumors also hinted at a large 4,500mAh battery with 66W fast charging support.</p><p>Honor has previously released three book-style foldables, the latest being the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-hands-onhttps://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Honor Magic V2</a>. This new device, though, promises a different look and, hopefully, a different price point.</p><p>Currently, there&apos;s no official information on the price of the device. As this is Honor&apos;s first device of this kind, we can&apos;t predict its price based on previous models.</p><p>However, considering the Honor Magic V2 is priced lower than its competitors, we expect the upcoming flip phone from Honor to cost below or at least the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> (starting at $1000).</p>

Headphones are an obvious foray for Sonos after building a coveted multiroom home audio system for the last two decades. It was time to spread that sound out and personalize it further.</p><p>Only the Ace take it personal in different ways, and that’s where things get divisive depending on who asks. Rather than introducing the Ace as a unique extension of the broader system, Sonos’ speakers sit this one out, leaving only its select soundbars to make these headphones part of the team.</p>

<p>The Sonos Ace launched in June 2024 and are available at a number of retailers, both brick-and-mortar and online. They start at $449 and are unlikely to see a price drop for a while as the company looks to sell them in greater numbers. Replaceable ear cups are available at Sonos.com for $49 a pair. Both the headphones and ear cups come in black and soft white. More colors may follow but Sonos hasn’t confirmed any such plans at this time.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9TC36AzN2H7HvKSDU7mUrP" name="Sonos-Ace-wearing.jpg" alt="Wearing Sonos Ace headphones outside with sunglasses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9TC36AzN2H7HvKSDU7mUrP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/sonos-launch-ace-headphones">hands-on time with the Ace</a> prior to receiving my review unit, so I went into testing these with notes in hand. It’s a relief they continue to fit and feel as comfortable as they did when I first tried them on. I know fit and comfort for over-ear headphones are subjective, but Sonos found a good mix of spacious cups to envelop the ears while using padding that’s soft enough to recess and contort with your ears. In my case, they fully cover mine, sitting nicely in place with a headband that never feels constraining.</p><p>Maybe I’m lucky because I haven’t noticed any itching, heat, or pinching while wearing them for longer stretches, especially while working. I would wear them barbecuing, walking, traveling, commuting, and haven’t seen any issues come up that way.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The design consequently plays a major role in how the active noise cancelation (ANC) works.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Not that it matters for size, but replaceable ear cups also act like an insurance policy of sorts. Sonos may play up the vegan leather it&apos;s using for the cups but if they fall apart or wear down, at least they don’t have to affect the rest of the product. Magnets make them easy to pry out and set in yet secure enough not to wiggle at all when handling the headphones.</p><p>The design consequently plays a major role in how active noise cancelation (ANC) works. First, passive isolation is excellent, cocooning your ears from background noise. Second, the onboard microphones do a superb job blocking out a range of frequencies to deliver excellent ANC in a variety of conditions. Whether on a plane, train, bus, car, street, or busy environment, the Ace cut down a whole lot of that noise, keeping you from raising the volume or bearing the brunt of sounds that seep through.</p>

<p>These are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a>, after all, and as such, require a slightly different setup to get everything going. Pair them with your phone like any other Bluetooth device, then open the Sonos app (which will recognize the Ace) and run through the few steps to access the features and settings associated with it. Once ready to play, the Ace deliver a punchy and resonant sound, striking a nice balance. There’s definitely a healthy bass response to go with warm highs and decent mids, all easy to discern, no matter what genre you’re listening to. I’d be cautious to say they’re right on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">Sony WH-1000XM5</a>, but the Ace sound great right out of the box.</p><p>They can also shine with some of the variety involved. Want <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res tunes</a>? No problem—the Ace can do that either through the aptX Adaptive and Lossless Bluetooth codecs or wired playback. Want spatial audio? There’s plenty of that, too, including Dolby Atmos support with head tracking.</p><p>Hi-res tracks from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">best music streaming services</a> like Amazon Music, Tidal, and Qobuz sound clear and (to my ears) detailed compared to more compressed bitrates, though you may have to raise the volume more with wired playback. Spatial audio is entirely elective, so you can turn it on or off at will without the Sonos app when you go to the Ace in the Bluetooth menu on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> or tablet. For head tracking, you’ll have to go to the Sonos app to toggle that on or off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zX7NLohYdhCNapzeoVaFqU" name="Sonos-Ace-app-home-theater.jpg" alt="Sonos app showing Ace headphones swap with Sonos Arc." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zX7NLohYdhCNapzeoVaFqU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the Ace from a broader perspective, there’s a key distinction in that they’re not an equal part of your Sonos system because they don&apos;t link up with its speakers. The only exception, as of this review, is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/sonos-arc-review">Sonos Arc</a> and Arc SL, with the company’s other soundbars—<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-beam-gen-2-review">Beam 2</a>, Beam, and Ray—all coming aboard the compatibility train later.</p><p>The Arc can transfer TV audio over to the Ace when you connect them together. The catch is you need to do it with an iOS device because Android support for the feature isn’t ready at launch. A pretty easy process in the Sonos app that should establish the connection within minutes, so long as both devices are updated to the latest software. This “TV Audio Swap” is a seamless transition, where you only need to hold the Content Key slider button on the right ear cup to switch between them. Once available on the Android app, you’ll also be able to toggle them there as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CmJ4XKJQMLi3xNof4tvjCR" name="Sonos-Ace-wearing-side-view.jpg" alt="Wearing Sonos Ace headphones from side view." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CmJ4XKJQMLi3xNof4tvjCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s impressive in both execution and audio quality, really giving you the feeling of a private cinema experience between your ears. Even better, it works regardless of what the Arc is playing, so whether you’re watching a game, streaming a show, or playing video games, all the audio patches through to the Ace. I can see it saving couples and families from arguments, especially in late-night situations or keeping a child asleep. </p><p>This is the only circumstance in which the Ace are on Wi-Fi, so you lose the Bluetooth connection with your phone or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablet</a>. If a call or notification comes in, you won’t hear it, forcing you to swap back to the TV first and then pick up the call once the phone re-establishes contact. It’s not the smoothest transition, and the time it takes could lead to a missed call unless you pick up first and ask the caller to wait until the audio runs through the Ace.</p><p>Sonos wants to expand on this home theater setup with what it’s calling TrueCinema, technology that calibrates the Ace to emulate the acoustic response you get from the Arc. It’s also not ready yet but is coming soon, and when it does, Sonos says it will be similar to Trueplay, the current calibration for all Sonos speakers and soundbars emitting audio pulses to measure a room’s dimensions while the listener wears the headphones in the “sweet spot” dead center in front of the soundbar.</p><p>The result should be a more expansive spatial audio sound. As is, the Wi-Fi connection and Dolby Atmos can up-convert stereo sound into a virtual 5.1 or 7.1.4 surround equivalent. The Arc does the heavy lifting because it’s transferring that capability to the Ace, after all.</p><p>Plus, while the Ace can connect to multiple compatible Sonos soundbars in a home, you can’t use two Ace pairs on the same soundbar simultaneously. Moreover, it&apos;s an either-or situation, meaning either the Arc or Ace are playing audio, not both at the same time. This negates the possibility of two people watching the same content on the same TV hooked up to an Arc and Ace.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4HPXaqe2zigfyuohNX62pQ" name="Sonos-Ace-earcups.jpg" alt="Sonos Ace headphones with exposed ear cups." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4HPXaqe2zigfyuohNX62pQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sonos was smart to go with physical buttons for the onboard controls. All respond well and haven&apos;t caused me any problems. Slide the Content Key up or down for volume, press once to play/pause/answer calls, or hold to decline a call or activate TV Audio Swap. Double-click to skip a track, triple-click to go back. The Noise Control button below switches between ANC and Aware mode. Press and hold to access your device’s voice assistant. Wear sensors within the cups also automatically pause playback when you remove the headphones, resuming again when you put them back on.</p><p>With everything going on wearing the Ace, battery life comes with some trade-offs. Sonos rates it at 30 hours per charge based on default volume levels using Bluetooth. That largely holds up, though the Wi-Fi connection in the TV Audio Swap saps it at a faster rate. It’s hard for me to quantify exact numbers, but if you’re routinely watching TV with these on, you’ll go nowhere near 30 hours. Mix it up with Bluetooth music and phone calls, and I’d say you can expect north of 20 hours per charge, give or take, based on volume levels. A quick three-minute charge boosts the Ace to give you up to three hours of playback, which is huge when you need some juice before a commute.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9rJ5XtJqEU8Npj99gR5JUQ" name="Sonos-Ace-with-case.jpg" alt="Sonos Ace headphones sitting inside their protective case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9rJ5XtJqEU8Npj99gR5JUQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sonos purists may feel robbed by the mere fact the Ace don’t integrate with the company’s speakers. On the one hand, I understand the decision because Wi-Fi demands more from a battery when you factor in all the other elements involved, like noise cancelation and volume. Bluetooth continues to improve in both range and power efficiency, which is why we’re seeing better battery figures in headphones and earbuds nowadays. Wi-Fi complicates that.</p><p>On the other hand, leaving the speakers out feels like the Ace are acquainted with the family rather than being part of it. Sonos is mum on what it has in mind going forward, and my own sense is the company is waiting to see what the mood is before figuring out how to approach this. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It’s more of a one-way connection that pushes audio sourced from the TV to the headphones, not audio playback from the headphones the other way around.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The very idea of listening to tunes through the Ace and then switching them over to an Era 100 or 300 upon arriving home sounds so enticing. Indeed, the current integration with the Arc only applies to audio coming through the HDMI port, which is why it’s focused on TV. Stream audio to it from your phone, tablet, or computer, and the swap isn’t available. Thus, it’s more of a one-way connection that pushes audio sourced from the TV to the headphones, not audio playback from the headphones the other way around.</p><p>Technically, the Ace <em>should</em> be able to connect with Sonos speakers, especially the newer Era lineup, so it’s a question of whether Sonos sees it as an impractical solution right now. Could the company decide to flip the switch and enable that integration later through a software update? It&apos;s certainly possible, but we’ll have to see.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gbEAWBdLUuQBCHyMwk7nPK" name="Sonos-Ace-cups-face-up.jpg" alt="Sonos Ace headphones folded flat and ear cups facing up." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbEAWBdLUuQBCHyMwk7nPK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of speakers and soundbars, Sonos can get away with evading a multiband EQ for those units, but it’s a stark omission on the Ace. Forget expensive headphones, manufacturers making mid-range and affordable pairs routinely have EQs through their dedicated apps. Instead, you’re left with the usual sliders for bass, treble, and loudness, the latter of which chips away at clarity and detail the higher you go. Nothing specific to mids nor the tuning nuances of playing around with a 5- or 10-band EQ.</p><p>I get that Sonos wants to keep its own tuning close to the vest, but headphones differ from speakers and soundbars. The Ace feel considerably more personal because the sound isn’t bouncing off walls measured by room dimensions. These cans are up against stiff competitors who not only sound great but also offer loads of custom choices to make their headphones feel inherently personal.  </p><p>I should note that a nasty bug also crept up for me during testing that turned the Ace into a ghost on the Sonos app. For some reason, the headphones showed as “Not Connected” in the app even though I was listening to music from the same phone. TV Audio Swap worked perfectly fine—including after un-pairing the Ace from my phone. When I asked Sonos about this bizarre situation, company reps said a new update in time for launch would squash the bug. I’ll revise this review once I can confirm that’s indeed the case.</p>

<p>The Sonos Ace are good enough to compete against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> out there and stand out for the home theater integration others in the category have either neglected or can’t deliver. Even so, high-end headphones come in hot when it comes to quality. The Sony WH-1000XM5 have been a gold standard since they launched, continuing Sony’s pedigree for delivering top-class sound, noise cancelation, battery life, app support, and comfort. Equally hard to beat are the Bose QuietComfort Ultra for the same reasons. These headphones impress on so many levels, delivering ANC on par with the best in the business. </p><p>Audio purists might lean more toward the likes of the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H95 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-momentum-sport-review">Sennheiser Momentum 4</a>, both of which also crush the Ace on battery life. All of these options don’t come cheap, so if your budget allows for something this premium, consider all your options.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You&apos;re already familiar with Sonos products.</li>
  <li>You want very good sound and noise cancelation.</li>
  <li>You want home theater privacy with Sonos soundbars.</li>
  <li>You want a comfortable fit.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want them to work with Sonos speakers.</li>
  <li>You want more personalized audio customization.</li>
  <li>You prefer to spend less.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Despite their drawbacks, the Sonos Ace are a solid pair of headphones that open doors other brands simply haven’t gone through well enough, if at all. How often do you hear Sony, Bose, or Sennheiser talking about their headphones integrating with their soundbars or speakers? They may have technical solutions available to make it happen, but they usually involve Bluetooth and other prerequisites that are fraught with challenges. Limited as it may be right now, the Ace show what’s possible, and I can tell you from my experience they’re super convenient to use with the Arc to watch anything in peace.</p><p>Still, Sonos will upset some seeking a more invested integration with its products unless it charts a different path later on. As standalone headphones, however, the Ace are an impressive mix of audio quality and noise control, with reliable buttons and a comfortable fit. </p>
