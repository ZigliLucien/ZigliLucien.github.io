<ul><li>Amazon's 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite allegedly leaked as images of its retail box surfaced online.</li><li>The box shows the tablet could grab a slightly larger 7-inch display and 16GB of internal storage with "weeks" of battery life.</li><li>The supposed upgrades are minimalistic at best as other options like Kobo's new color e-readers and the Onyx Boox turn heads.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amazon might have a next-gen Paperwhite tablet on the way as it seemingly leaks unceremoniously.</p><p>The rumor stems from a retail worker who supposedly got their hands on the retail box for Amazon&apos;s 12th-Gen Kindle Paperwhite. As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/new-amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2024-got-leaked">Good E Reader</a>, the images don&apos;t excite as the most notable change is its alleged 7-inch display. The back of the box adds the device could feature an "adjustable warm light," an IPX8 2M waterproof rating, and "weeks" of battery life.</p><p>The front of the box suggests the 12th-Gen Paperwhite will offer 16GB of internal storage.</p><p>The design of this alleged next-gen reading tablet mirrors the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-review">11th-gen Paperwhite</a> from 2021. The device still features quite thick bezels around its entirety, not to mention the rather pronounced chin with the Kindle name. Small differences in its form factor are expected as the display increases (slightly) from 6.8 inches to the rumored seven.</p><p>What&apos;s not clear is whether this is the only 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite we&apos;re getting or if there&apos;s a Signature Edition on the way. The publication stated that a next-gen Signature Edition model could add features like page-turn buttons and an e-paper display. However, it&apos;s too early to tell as it&apos;s unclear when this leaked model will arrive.</p><p>But the existence of its retail box could indicate we&apos;re approaching such a launch date.</p>

<p>When Amazon launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-unveils-new-kindle-paperwhite-e-readers-signature-and-kids-editions">its trio of Paperwhites</a> in 2021, the company noted its 10% brighter display. More importantly, the battery life of those older tablets sat at around 10 weeks. This meant users would have to charge their Paperwhites (roughly) once every two and a half months. This was paired with a 9W charger that took around 2.5 hours to complete a full charging cycle.</p><p>If these images are to be believed, perhaps we should look elsewhere for more changes. It would be nice if Amazon could improve the tablet&apos;s charging capabilities with more strength to quicken its cycle.</p><p>But, the kicker is that Amazon could risk falling behind other, more popular e-readers that are doing more. Earlier this year, Kobo launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/kobo-libra-colour-and-kobo-clara-colour-ereaders-announced">first color e-readers</a>: the Libra Colour and the Clara Colour. Those devices offer a 7-inch display with 32GB of storage and richer saturation with a palette of 4,096 colors.</p><p>There&apos;s also the Onyx Boox, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/buy-a-boox-on-black-friday">is turning heads</a> over Amazon&apos;s options.</p>

I&apos;ve even mentioned it to Google because I thought it was so important!</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure it didn&apos;t happen because I asked for it, but you can now lock down your phone by entering its phone number on a simple web page. Visit Android.com/lock and everything you need is right there, without fiddling with passkeys, two-factor codes, or anything else.</p>
<p>Getting those codes or having access to a passkey can be difficult if your phone isn&apos;t in your hand, and you will probably need one or the other if you want to sign in to something else so you can try and lockdown or find a lost phone. Now you won&apos;t need to.</p><p>You unlock it the same way you unlock your phone any other time using the normal lock screen; this isn&apos;t some super hardened device lock or anything. Think of it the same as using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-lockdown-mode-and-why-would-you-need-it">Lockdown Mode</a>. It will make it a lot more difficult for someone to get on your phone and open up your Bank app or CashApp, though.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="D3XUws3Evcq8v9DY9ejQFe" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-Ultra-1.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (left, silver) and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (right, black) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D3XUws3Evcq8v9DY9ejQFe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We really shouldn&apos;t need this. Everyone should have a secure lock screen using either <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-does-android-save-your-fingerprints">biometrics</a> or a PIN/password along with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">two-factor authentication</a> because your phone holds many important things. Set it so your phone locks after 15 or 30 seconds of not being used and you&apos;re almost always good.</p><p>But many people spend time finding ways to keep their phones from locking itself. There are apps and tools—even tools from Google—that can keep your phone unlocked if it&apos;s close to a Bluetooth device, in range of a certain place, or comes in contact with the right NFC tag.</p>
<p>That&apos;s great as long as you don&apos;t lose your phone and it can still do one of those things. It&apos;s not so great if someone steals your phone and your smartwatch or you lose your phone in the apartment building you live in.</p><p>Don&apos;t think it can&apos;t happen, because it does. Maybe you&apos;re at a party in the common area of your building and lose your phone. Maybe you get robbed and the crook also takes your watch. Or maybe you&apos;re using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-use-wear-os-watch-unlock">Trusted Devices</a> feature and lose your phone at an Android event with a few thousand people and hope it&apos;s not close enough to work, which happened to me in Texas a while back.</p>

<p>No matter why you might need to quickly lock your phone down, you finally can. You could do it from any public computer, from a friend&apos;s laptop, or even from someone else&apos;s phone. All you need is to know your phone number and be able to visit a web page.</p><p>Finding it may be a little harder because you&apos;ll need to sign into your Google account, but at least you know that nobody is getting into your stuff until you do. Simple tools that make it easy to protect your information are the best tools. It&apos;s nice to see one like this from Google.</p>

<p>The Find X8 and the Find X8 Pro share similar design aesthetics as well as color variants that include shades of silver, rose gold, blue, and regular black/gray. While the vanilla variant has more rounded corners, the Pro model appears taller with slightly fewer rounded corners. Regardless, both Oppo phones carry narrow bezels from the front compared to the predecessor models.</p><p>Further, both upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> share a giant circular module at the back, which incorporates at least four lenses, including a periscopic lens on the Pro model.</p>

<p>The anticipation around the Find X8 series has been quite significant in the past few weeks, as the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-series-to-sport-narrow-bezels">has teased</a> the handsets as its direct take on Apple&apos;s iPhone 16 series. So much so that both phones not only feature narrower bezels than the iPhone 16/16 Pro models, but they even carry the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16s-camera-control-button-is-actually-cool-i-want-it-on-android-phones">Camera Control</a> button for the first time.</p><p>OPPO&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/OB4SEtVA2">Zhou Yibao on Weibo</a> has even shared the button in action with the phone submerged under water. Alongside the design, this unique feature might be one of the standout features for the Find X8 series when it launches next week. The latest renders also corroborate the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-magnetic-charging-leaked-camera-module">leaked hands-on images</a> of the Find X8, which surfaced early this month.</p>

<p>Returning to the renders, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1845933160866988246">Oppo Pad 3 Pro</a> follows in the lot, which looks identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a>. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/001RJIkpgy1hulxwuqnpjj60u01hcqv502.jpg">has already teased</a> that it would be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC—the processor powers some of the best Android phones. </p><p>The renders show that it again has a sole rear camera. At the same time, the front has sizable bezels like the company&apos;s previous tablets. The upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> is also expected to come in at least two color shades this year.</p>

<p>Lastly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1845934788454023421">Oppo Enco X3 renders</a> look precisely like the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds 3 Pro</a>, which turned out to be excellent wireless earbuds from the company.

<h2 id="some-information-about-the-oura-ring-4-apos-s-battery-life-and-how-you-can-make-it-even-better-2">Some information about the Oura Ring 4&apos;s battery life, and how you can make it even better</h2>
<p>Smart rings seem to be the next big thing in the world of wearable technology, with several new players making their presence felt in the segment. That being said, Oura continues to be the most well-known brand in this space, and the Finnish company&apos;s newest product — the Oura Ring 4 — looks poised to strengthen that position further.</p><p>Made fully from titanium, the Oura Ring 4 features a refreshed design with recessed sensors, which should allow for increased comfort and better accuracy. Speaking of which, the wearable comes with &apos;Smart Sensing&apos; technology that works alongside an improved algorithm to continuously record a plethora of health & wellness metrics.</p><p>Of course, all these advanced sensors require power, and the Oura Ring 4 has that in abundance. According to Oura&apos;s claims, the smart ring can go up to eight days with a fully charged battery. This is something we&apos;ll only be able to test out when we review this thing, but given that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review" target="_blank">Oura Ring (Gen 3)</a> impressed Android Central&apos;s Derrek Lee with its solid battery life, we have high hopes for the latest-generation wearable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3937px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="hTDCxTGrhGjKyGT9VSSgwi" name="Oura-Ring-4-charger.jpg" alt="Oura Ring 4 on a charging puck" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hTDCxTGrhGjKyGT9VSSgwi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3937" height="2215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As is the case with any modern gadget, the actual battery endurance of Oura Ring 4 is going to depend on individual use and other factors like ring size, activities logged, and more. Oura recommends following a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046218953-Ring-Battery-Tips" target="_blank">tips and tricks</a> to get the most out of the smart ring&apos;s battery life, and some of them are mentioned below:</p>
<ul><li>Keep the wearable's firmware updated to the latest version. This can be done via the companion app, and the smart ring must have over 30 percent juice left in the tank.</li><li>Charge the battery to at least 30 percent before going to bed.</li><li>Enable Airplane Mode and low battery notifications.</li></ul>
<p>With its premium build quality, industry-leading activity tracking hardware, and great battery life, the Oura Ring 4 is all but certain to take over the crown of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings" target="_blank">best smart ring</a> from its predecessor. It&apos;s comfortable enough to be worn at all times, features a laundry list of sensors, and is available in a wide range of sizes and finishes. Having a starting price of $349, it doesn&apos;t come cheap, but if you want a stylish and feature-packed activity tracker for your finger, this one is definitely worth checking out.</p>

<hr>
<p>A small but mighty change may be coming to the Google Play Store: the "Install" button could soon stay at the top of app pages, so you can grab an app without scrolling back up to find it.</p><p>For Android users, the Google Play Store is like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">treasure trove of apps and games</a>. But sometimes, those long app descriptions can hide the Install button, forcing you to scroll back up. It can be a real hassle when you&apos;re just trying to grab something quickly.</p><p>As per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-play-store-fixed-header-install-button-apk-teardown-3490075/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the Google Play Store version 43.1.19 has some code that hints at a new feature where the Install button will stick at the top of the page while you scroll through app details. If this pans out, this update means you won’t have to go back to the top to start installing, even for apps with super long descriptions.</p><p>Reverse engineering expert AssembleDebug managed to activate this feature for Android Authority and even shared a video showing how it works.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZ_sl7vxfvk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>A quick look at the video highlights the benefits of having the Install button always visible. With it, users can dive into app details before hitting install, making sure they make informed choices.</p><p>The fixed header will feature essential details about an app, including its icon, name, developer, average Play Store rating, and whether it has ads. There&apos;ll also be a dropdown menu for installing the app on other devices.</p><p>While this change might seem small, it could give app developers a big boost. This feature makes things a lot easier and is likely to lead to more app downloads.</p><p>Detailed app store listings are great for informing users, but they can unintentionally hurt developers trying to provide all that info. With the Install button stuck at the top, the chances of users leaving the page without scrolling back up to install increase every time they scroll down.</p><p>Keep in mind that this feature isn’t live on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play</a> yet, but it’s expected to be available to users soon—though there’s no guarantee on when that will happen.</p>

<ul><li>AYN has announced its next Android-powered handheld, the Odin 2 Portal. </li><li>The Odin 2 Portal features a 7-inch OLED display, with a 1080p resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.</li><li>It will be made available for pre-order through Indiegogo, with the campaign expected to begin in the coming weeks. </li></ul>
<p>While the temperatures outside continue to drop, the Android gaming handheld scene is starting to heat up. AYN surprised many by announcing its next handheld in the Odin 2 Portal. </p><p>There are a few key differences between the Odin 2 and the upcoming Odin 2 Portal, starting with the display. The Odin 2 sports a 6-inch LCD display paired with a 60Hz refresh rate, while the Odin 2 Portal features a 7-inch AMOLED screen, with a 120Hz refresh rate. </p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6sWkxihJek" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Something that remains unchanged is that AYN will continue to lean on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 with the Odin 2 Portal. This might come as a bit of a surprise given that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-pre-orders">Ayaneo Pocket S</a> and upcoming Pocket EVO are powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2. </p><p>We aren&apos;t really sure if this is due to an exclusive deal between Ayaneo and Qualcomm, or if AYN would rather just stick with what it knows. In reality, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 still provides more than enough <em>oomph </em>for a dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android gaming handheld</a>. </p><p>Not much else is known about the Odin 2 Portal just yet, as we&apos;ll likely have to wait until the Indiegogo campaign is live. We&apos;re curious to see what storage and RAM configurations there are, and of course, how much it will cost. </p>

<p>AYN has been fairly quiet in 2024, with the only major release coming in the form of the PS Vita-like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ayntec.com/products/odin2-mini">Odin 2 Mini</a> back in June. Besides that, the Android gaming handheld space has been dominated by the likes of Ayaneo, and more recently, Retroid with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld?srsltid=AfmBOory-4-vkcUfgXH2K5XtdooiZX3FYa4uQWpNZ8ta7jIiHNeuda1E">Pocket 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goretroid.com/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-mini-handheld">Pocket Mini</a>. </p><p>Speaking of which, the Odin 2 Portal appears to be a direct competitor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-evo-pre-orders">Ayaneo Pocket EVO</a>. The EVO was announced in early August but has yet to actually be released, although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-evo-7-1080p-165hz-oled-android-handheld#/">Indiegogo page</a> says it&apos;s expected to arrive sometime in November. It too features a 7-inch OLED display but with a higher 165Hz refresh rate, and a starting price of $499.</p>

<p>Although we don't yet have all of the Odin 2 Portal details, it's clear that this is going to be one of the best gaming handhelds of the year. We just have to hope it won't be made available at an exorbitant price. </p></p>

I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xgimi-horizon-pro-4k-projector-review">reviewed the Horizon Pro</a> when it debuted back in 2021, and that was followed by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/xgimi-horizon-ultra-4k-projector-review">Horizon Ultra</a> last year, which had a brighter projection and much better design.</p><p>XGIMI is building on that with the introduction of the Horizon S Max. The projector shares the same design aesthetic as the Horizon Ultra, but it has a new rotating stand design that makes it significantly easier to set up and use. This was one of my favorite features on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/jmgo-n1-ultra-4k-laser-projector-review">JMGO N1 Ultra</a>, and I&apos;m glad to see other brands utilizing a similar design.</p><p>With a dual light laser source, the Horizon S Max is able to go up to 3,100 lumens, and there is a noticeable difference over the Horizon Ultra in this regard. In fact, the Horizon S Max is one of the brightest projectors I&apos;ve used, and I tested nearly two dozen models in the last four years.</p><p>It has a slate of other upgrades as well, with XGIMI making additional tweaks to its auto keystone and autofocus system. The feature is now able to change color balance dynamically to account for wall colors, and that is also a noticeable differentiator. But for all the upgrades, the one area where the Horizon S Max still lags behind its rivals is the software; while there&apos;s Android TV 11 out of the box, you don&apos;t get Netflix pre-installed, and that&apos;s just as annoying here as every other Horizon projector I used.</p><p>So should you get the Horizon S Max, or pick up one of its rivals instead? I used the projector for just over two weeks, and this is what you need to know.</p>

<p>XGIMI unveiled the Horizon S Max at IFA 2024, and the projector went on sale starting October 15. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-HORIZON-Max-Projector-Intelligent/dp/B0DDQ66B6L">available on Amazon for $1,899</a>, and while that&apos;s costlier than what the Horizon Ultra cost last year — that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-HORIZON-Ultra-Projector-Bluetooth/dp/B0CB36K662">model is now down to $1,499</a> — you get a brighter projection and other features.</p><p>The Horizon S Max is joined by the Horizon S Pro, which shares a similar design but has a light source that goes up to 1,800 lumens (the S Max hits 3,100 lumens). While the S Pro isn&apos;t available on Amazon just yet, it can be bought via the brand&apos;s website, where it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.xgimi.com/products/horizon-s-pro">costs $1,559 as of writing</a>.</p>

<p>XGIMI made huge changes to the design last year with the Horizon Ultra, and the Horizon S Max sees a continuation of those efforts. It has the same design at the front with the sliding cover, and this makes a big difference in ensuring the projector lens doesn&apos;t attract dust while it&apos;s in use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YZLQ6v3pvBCFLKDLr9j496" name="xgimi-horizon-s-max-review-8.jpg" alt="XGIMI Horizon S Max side view highlighting integrated stand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YZLQ6v3pvBCFLKDLr9j496.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the biggest change this time around is the introduction of an integrated stand. The projector is mounted on a stand that swivels, and the base has a turntable that allows you to easily rotate the projector. The gimbal-like mounting system makes it extremely convenient to change the orientation of the projector, and it solves the biggest pain point I have when setting one of these up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PrVKvcUB2vqkfTSi8FACH5" name="xgimi-horizon-s-max-review-4.jpg" alt="XGIMI Horizon S Max side view showcasing gimbal stand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PrVKvcUB2vqkfTSi8FACH5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, the design isn&apos;t unique to XGIMI; its rival brand JMGO rolled out the system last year on its models — notably the N1 Ultra — and it&apos;s now making its way to other brands. The stand allows you to project onto the ceiling as well, and it&apos;s pretty cool. It has a full 360-degree swivel, and 135-degre tilt, and takes the hassle out of configuring the projector against a wall.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="y7YKfiA3aC53FZLp5okQLA" name="xgimi-horizon-s-max-review-13.jpg" alt="XGIMI Horizon S Max on Horizon Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y7YKfiA3aC53FZLp5okQLA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another differentiation is the size; while the Horizon S Max looks the same as the Horizon Ultra, it isn&apos;t anywhere as wide. As the stand also houses some of the hardware, it doesn&apos;t take up anywhere as much room, and that&apos;s good to see. The one issue I have with this mounting system is that it doesn&apos;t lock into place; if you plug in an HDMI cable at the back, the projector inevitably pulls upward after some time because of the weight of the cable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="t7JRyzbGVJ6QkpUxvNJGsD" name="xgimi-horizon-s-max-review-10.jpg" alt="XGIMI Horizon S Max front view showcasing design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7JRyzbGVJ6QkpUxvNJGsD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than that, there are no problems with the design. The chassis has a textured finish that&apos;s meant to mimic leather, but it is made out of plastic, and the build quality is predictably great. The fabric cover at the front distinguishes the design, and the gold accented grille underneath adds a nice bit of visual contrast.</p><p>I would have liked media control buttons on the projector, but that isn&apos;t a major omission — you still get a power button at the back. The power cord plugs into the base of the unit, and there&apos;s a fan at the back inside the grille. It is quiet enough that it isn&apos;t an issue when using the projector.</p>

<p>XGIMI does a great job with the basics, and that&apos;s no different on the Horizon S Max. The projector uses the brand&apos;s latest algorithm for auto keystone correction, and it works incredibly well. It centers the projection on any surface in a matter of seconds, and autofocus is just as effective.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VvwHodnqb9eeT57wgDjpFG" name="xgimi-horizon-s-max-review-21.jpg" alt="XGIMI Horizon S Max settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VvwHodnqb9eeT57wgDjpFG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get intelligent object avoidance and eye protection, and a new feature that&apos;s debuting this year is the ability to account for the color of the wall. The Horizon S Max automatically adjusts the color balance of the image based on the wall color, delivering a much more vibrant picture quality. Using it next to the Horizon Ultra immediately highlighted just how much of a difference this feature makes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8tEbbkJrNbt6fePiXpXCa6" name="xgimi-horizon-s-max-review-6.jpg" alt="XGIMI Horizon S Max back view with HDMI connector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8tEbbkJrNbt6fePiXpXCa6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The projector is powered by quad Cortex A55 cores, and you get 2GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. There&apos;s DLNA and Chromecast integration, and dual 12W audio drivers with DTS-HD Dolby Digital sound. There&apos;s no Wi-Fi 6, but connectivity wasn&apos;t an issue in the two weeks I tested the projector, and you get Bluetooth 5.1.</p><p>There isn&apos;t much in the way of ports; other than the HDMI port (which has eARC), you get dual USB 2.0 ports. I wanted to see at least another HDMI port — that&apos;s a must-have in this category — and Ethernet connectivity, but that&apos;s missing.</p>

<p>Coming to the projection, the Horizon S Max is able to go up to 3,100 lumens, a sizeable upgrade over the 2,300 lumens achieved by the Horizon Ultra and 1,500 lumens of the Horizon Pro. The projector has a throw ratio of 1.2:1, and goes up to a maximum projection of 200 inches.</p>

<p>The Horizon S Max is one of the brightest projectors I tested. It is noticeably brighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xgimi-aura-4k-ultra-short-throw-laser-projector-review">Aura UST projector</a> that I still use regularly, and it outshines its immediate rivals — Dangbei&apos;s Mars Pro 2 and the JMGO N1S Ultra 4K projectors. The dual light source makes a difference in this area, delivering increased brightness that makes the Horizon S Max usable even in daylight with plenty of ambient light coming through.</p>

<p>It isn&apos;t just the brightness either; the Horizon S Max has much better color vibrancy than any other XGIMI projector I used — and I tested all of the brand&apos;s products over the last four years. You get vibrant colors with good contrast levels, and the ability to adjust the colors based on the background wall color makes a sizeable difference in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gw7dtptCgW7uj7r4w2MFrA" name="xgimi-horizon-s-max-review-23.jpg" alt="XGIMI Horizon S Max running a YouTube video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gw7dtptCgW7uj7r4w2MFrA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The projector has Dolby Vision integration, and it does a great job rendering scenes with varying lighting effects. As with most projectors these days, there&apos;s MEMC, and a dedicated game mode that reduces latency — you miss out on keystone correction if you switch to this mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iBPvs4zCB6PVhmWthJov77" name="xgimi-horizon-s-max-review-3.jpg" alt="XGIMI Horizon S Max front view with branding" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iBPvs4zCB6PVhmWthJov77.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The built-in sound is great as well, and the dual 12W drivers cover a small room with relative ease. While I usually advocate a dedicated sound system — ideally a pair of powered bookshelf speakers — the built-in sound is good enough that you don&apos;t need it if you&apos;re going to use the projector in a small room.</p><p>Overall, XGIMI did all the right things in this area, and the Horizon S Max rivals the best projectors in this regard.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-xgimi-horizon-s-max-software"><span>XGIMI Horizon S Max: Software</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cYCBNyVUUEaiz45vXc42cF" name="xgimi-horizon-s-max-review-15.jpg" alt="XGIMI Horizon S Max home interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cYCBNyVUUEaiz45vXc42cF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I reviewed the MoGo 3 Pro earlier in the year, and I was excited to see that the projector had Netflix pre-installed. The biggest issue with XGIMI projectors over the last four years was the lack of Netflix integration — it failed to secure a license — and given that the MoGo 3 Pro had the streaming service, I thought it would be the case with all of the brand&apos;s projectors going forward.</p><p>I was wrong. The Horizon S Max runs Android TV 11 out of the box, but there&apos;s no pre-installed Netflix. This continues to be a big limitation for the brand, and with its rivals bundling the streaming service on their projectors, XGIMI needs to address this issue soon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bE6QtRxFDR5jNHzYYFHhZ7" name="xgimi-horizon-s-max-review-24.jpg" alt="XGIMI Horizon S Max interface with Netflix search in Play Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bE6QtRxFDR5jNHzYYFHhZ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than that, the interface is similar to every other Android TV box. You get a wall of ads, and the Play Store allows you to download streaming services of your choice — as long as it isn&apos;t Netflix. There is a noticeable lag when browsing the interface, and that&apos;s down to the limited RAM; Android TV needs 3GB of memory to be fluid, but most brands still limit their devices to 2GB, and that hobbles usability.</p><p>The bundled remote is identical to what XGIMI provided in the past. It has all the buttons you need, and the brushed metal design feels great. The only issue with the remote is that it doesn&apos;t have backlit buttons.</p>

<p>Dangbei&apos;s Mars Pro 2 is the closest alternative to the Horizon S Max. The Mars Pro 2 doesn&apos;t get as bright, but it is still usable with ambient light, and while the projector doesn&apos;t have the same great design, there are no problems with the build quality. What I like the most about the Mars Pro 2 is that it has Google TV built-in, and you get Netflix pre-installed. That necessitates the need for another dongle, and the best part is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Dangbei-DBOX02-Projector-Officially-Bluetooth/dp/B0D17LQ4PR">it costs $1,399</a>, undercutting the Horizon S Max.</p><p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/jmgo-n1-ultra-4k-laser-projector-review">tested JMGO&apos;s N1 Ultra</a> last year, and while the projector has a similar design, it also misses out on Netflix, and it doesn&apos;t get as bright — nor is the image quality anywhere as good.

<p>XGIMI is offering considerable upgrades with the Horizon S Max. The projector gets noticeably brighter than its immediate rivals, the design is easily the best in this segment, and the new flexible stand makes setting up the projector a breeze. XGIMI does a great job with basics like auto keystone correction and autofocus, and while these are standard on all home projectors these days, the brand has a unique extras — like wall color matching — that allow it to stand out.</p><p>The picture quality is outstanding, and that alone makes it easy to look past the projector&apos;s foibles. The lack of Netflix continues to be a major issue, and the interface is laggy in daily use. But if you&apos;re willing to connect a dedicated streaming device and are instead looking for a projector with the best image quality in the sub-$2,000 category, the Horizon S Max gets my recommendation.</p>

Along with the myriad of changes and new features is a taskbar update that transforms Android tablets in a way that’s been sorely needed for a long time. In short, the taskbar can finally be pinned like it can on a desktop OS, and app pairs can be easily made and pinned for quicker productivity.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to check out these changes on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> first, but they’ll be headed to plenty of other Android foldable phones and tablets soon. Of course, just because it’s now finally part of Android doesn’t mean you weren’t able to use these features on some other devices on the market, including foldables like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and tablets like the Honor MagicPad 2.</p><p>In fact, the Honor MagicPad 2 is the very device I’m writing this article on and has been my go-to productivity device for over the past two weeks since Hurricane Helene devastated my hometown. It, along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Honor Magic V3</a>, has been the device combination I never knew I needed until I had no power, no home internet connectivity, and no real way to do my at-home job.</p><p>The combo is made possible by what the company calls Honor Magic Ring which enables instant screen, connection, and control sharing between Honor devices in a way that’s been utterly clutch during this difficult time.</p>
<h2 id="a-surprising-combination-2">A surprising combination</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bfSY57HkiqTNAFdTbmeXZk" name="honor-magicpad-2-and-honor-magic-v3.jpg" alt="The Honor MagicPad 2 and Honor Magic V3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bfSY57HkiqTNAFdTbmeXZk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let’s say you had a work-from-home job like me but had no internet connection or power at your house, and no cafes or other places with reliable internet were open because your entire town didn’t have running water. That’s the exact scenario I found myself in over these past two weeks, and it left me with an interesting problem to solve: how do I continue to do my job?</p><p>At first, I figured I’d just use the hotspot on my phone to tether the Honor MagicPad 2 and carry on as usual. Problem is that I’m on a grandfathered T-Mobile plan with limited hotspot data and no way to increase this limit without changing my plan. I’ve kept this cheaper plan for well over a decade and this isn’t going to be the thing that changes that, so that option was out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.00%;"><img id="LcjcsvhVRfK9L9mLfsMPun" name="honor-magicpad-2-magic-ring-writing-music.jpg" alt="Using Honor Magic Ring to mirror the display of an Honor Magic V3 onto an Honor MagicPad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LcjcsvhVRfK9L9mLfsMPun.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So I decided to dive a little deeper into the Honor Magic Ring, a technology that pairs Honor devices together in a way that others would be envious of. Two swipes and two quick taps mirrored my Honor Magic V3’s large foldable display onto the tablet, letting me run it split-screen alongside Honor’s note-taking app on the tablet. I was even able to stream music from my phone to the Honor MagicPad 2’s unbelievably good speakers, helping to closely recreate the feeling of working in my (now dark) basement office.</p><p>Since the Honor MagicPad 2 can easily make and save app pairs, it was easy to quickly launch into my mirrored workspace with notes on one side of the screen and my phone’s screen on the other. Once I had this set up, I was golden. I wrote from the comfort of the large tablet display, then used the mirrored phone display to upload things to Google Drive or Android Central’s CMS.</p><p>Because I was using my phone and not tethering off the data connection, I was able to use my unlimited phone data plan like it was natively running on the tablet. At one point, I accidentally figured out how to change the mirrored phone screen into a full screen tablet display ON the tablet, taking things one step further.</p>
<h2 id="what-android-15-will-make-better-2">What Android 15 will make better</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.69%;"><img id="r3gXxGK8ytD9Acd2xyKLt5" name="android-15-taskbar-pinning.jpg" alt="A look at the new pinnable taskbar in Android 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r3gXxGK8ytD9Acd2xyKLt5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1243" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So while I’ve really been enjoying how deeply Honor ties its products together, a few small changes will take things to the next level. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>’s new pinnable taskbar will complete the “laptop experience.” By that, I mean a dedicated taskbar at the bottom that can be used to launch and swap between running apps quickly.</p><p>Some tablets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> let you temporarily pin the taskbar, but on Android 15, you&apos;ll be able to pin it permanently like a laptop. I fully expect this feature to come to all Android tablets that get the Android 15 update, too.</p><p>Next, I’d love to see more enhanced content sharing between devices. Honor launched it’s revamped Magic OS 8 interface with the Honor Magic 6 series earlier in 2024 — including a clever new side-mounted share UI — but there’s no easy way to drag-and-drop content between devices using split-screen windows. Copying and pasting text between devices works very well, but moving images or other media is still clunkier than I would like, requiring you to use Quick Share or Honor Share to get them there instead of just dragging and dropping between windows.</p><p>Lastly, Honor’s Magic OS doesn’t let you force all apps into a split screen view. This doesn’t make much sense to me since it lets you float any app and then adjust its aspect ratio freely, so I’m not sure what the hold up is here.</p><p>What I ultimately drew from this forced experiment was that tablets are truly ready to replace laptops for a large number of tasks — even if they are a bit clunky at time — making it possible to do a large majority of my job from a device that’s got a lot better battery life than a laptop.</p><p>Now, if we could just get Adobe to put the FULL Creative Cloud suite on Android, or at least essentials like the full version of Photoshop, so I can ditch the Windows or Mac laptop forever.</p>

<hr>
<p>YouTube has announced several new features coming to the streaming platform alongside YouTube Music. Google notes that users can expect over two dozen improvements in updates that include the platform on the web, mobile, and TVs as well.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-features-and-updates-2024/">announcement blog post</a>, these updates comprise some "highly requested features"—like fine-tunable playback speed (with 0.05 increments), improved landscape browsing experience, updates to thumbnails, and some visual improvements.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="svjsRbZNt29rgfBXijXien" name="youtube-new-mini-player.gif" alt="YouTube's updated mini player" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/svjsRbZNt29rgfBXijXien.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>YouTube&apos;s mobile app now has a new mini-player. Browsing for other videos while already watching a video should be a lot smoother now, as users can now even resize and play with it by moving it around across all sides of the screen.</p><p>YouTube playlists are also improved with the latest release. People can invite others to their playlists using a "special link" or a QR code for easy additions. The capability is said to be coming soon to TV as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.00%;"><img id="qytDZvfVRvPwaVrmcKNbCR" name="YouTube-QR-code-invite.jpg" alt="YouTube QR Code invite system for playlists" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qytDZvfVRvPwaVrmcKNbCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="496" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>YouTube and YouTube Music already allow users to create custom thumbnails for their playlists with the help of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-generative-ai-art-experiment">generative AI</a>. This ability is now expanding as users can even add their preferred photos by picking from their camera roll to give it a personal touch. Personalization can include adding text to the image, filters, or stickers.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWFS03p3W0M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Furthermore, friends in the playlists can also vote on videos to curate the best ones from the playlist. It is also believed to be beneficial for creators as they can have their viewers rank their content. YouTube states this feature will roll out later this year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:146.34%;"><img id="N6yiSXHZTTjC396zkqQRmi" name="youtube-badges.gif" alt="New YouTube Badges" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N6yiSXHZTTjC396zkqQRmi.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="410" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Besides, YouTube is also introducing badges for the first time on its mobile and YouTube Music apps. They can badge their favorite creators for the content they love. Similarly, users can also earn badges "for being a top listener of their favorite artist or having a creator heart your comment."</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FtaSfHwwjoo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>YouTube is also gaining Sleep Timer, which allows users to set a timer to "automatically pause videos after a certain duration of time." The feature was initially tested for Premium subscribers; however, it is said to be available for all users starting Tuesday (Oct 12).</p>
<p>YouTube&apos;s TV experience will also receive some improvements with the new update, and visual changes can be seen on the web and mobile. For instance, watching Shorts on TV should be more seamless, as a new UI offers "continued interaction with the content."</p><p>YouTube also states that all these new updates are the result of consumers&apos; feedback and highly requested features, as mentioned above. Users across <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a>, iOS, the web, and TV should be seeing these new changes starting this week.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is reportedly preparing a Good Lock module update that&apos;ll make your phone one of a kind.</p><p>The major changes in question regard Samsung&apos;s "Home Up" Good Lock module. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/renz_pzaway/status/1845129251387052292">A user on X</a> posted screenshots of the potential additions for One UI 7 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/one-ui-7-could-supercharge-good-lock-modules/">Android Police</a>). The module&apos;s update focuses on bringing more customization options to users for "animation tuning." The tipster purports Samsung will show users "Pixel by Pixel" and "The scent of a certain fruit" options.</p><p>The former is said to deliver "pure animation." It&apos;s not clear what the latter could be; however, the publication suspects it could be Apple-esque, in a way. We know that Samsung has been moving into a more Apple-like world <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">with its designs</a>, though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">not everyone is happy</a> about that.</p><p>The "Home Up" module was also spotted with an "advanced tuning" option, which blows open its possibilities. Users may find sliders for things like damping, stiffness, friction, blur, and duration. These sliders directly impact how your device&apos;s animations are played and stylized.</p><p>The final option is labeled "Simple tuning." As suspected, this option is the most basic as the module gives a singular slider to adjust an animation&apos;s speed. The tipster then located an option to alter the "bottom gesture sensitivity."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Home gesture animation tuning pic.twitter.com/BYBWoNAmWG<a href="https://twitter.com/renz_pzaway/status/1845129251387052292">October 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The "Home Up" module continues with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/renz_pzaway/status/1845266909887070283">update for folders</a>. The screenshots show that Samsung plans to display size customizations (medium and large) for folders. Moreover, a "detail settings" option will let users change the grid and the size of the icons within it.</p><p>The changes continue to suggest a shift toward Apple&apos;s iOS design aside from what&apos;s been seen for One UI&apos;s elemental adjustments.</p><p>With these changes seemingly primed for One UI 7 (Android 15), users have more time in the waiting room. Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-wont-hit-beta-until-end-of-this-year">confirmed</a> that its next major OS will roll out in 2025 alongside the Galaxy S25 series. More importantly, a community moderator confirmed that the company is still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-plans-one-ui-7-public-beta">preparing a Public Beta program</a> for One UI 7.</p><p>Users can "preview" the software alongside developers and deliver feedback and test results before launch. The moderator adds that users should look out for a notification of the program&apos;s start via Samsung Members. The company states users can likely expect the beta to begin "by the end of the year."</p><p>Other than the visual refresh, Samsung&apos;s Sally Hyesoon Jeong highlighted the update&apos;s fine-tuned motion dynamics and a new blur system.</p>
