                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Xiaomi is reportedly interested in developing a tri-fold phone following Huawei as a patent was spotted in China.</li><li>The patent listing delivers basic, early renderings of the device with a camera bar that feels reminiscent of the Mix Fold 3.</li><li>Whether the development will continue is still questionable as Samsung followed a recent trend by dropping its tri-fold to pursue a rollable device.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Another smartphone OEM might join the tri-fold trend as a set of images was spotted in a Chinese database.</p><p>The discovery made by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-tri-fold-patent-design-cnipa/">91Mobiles</a> suggests that the Chinese OEM Xiaomi is (potentially) working on a tri-fold phone (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/09/xiaomi-developing-tri-fold-smartphone-design.html">Android Headlines</a>). The device&apos;s early rendering was listed within the China National Intellectual Property (CNIP) database. The initial impression of the device is lackluster; however, this is simply for patent purposes to show proof of concept.</p><p>The publication suspects the device could launch under the "Mix" if Xiaomi continues with its development. This makes sense considering the rear panel offers a slimmer, rectangular camera bar.</p><p>It&apos;s similar to what the company provided its recent book-style foldable with, minus the fourth lens as this tri-fold only offers three (supposedly).</p><p>Other external factors that could make this Xiaomi tri-fold more exciting are absent from the images. It&apos;s likely that if the company is trying to take on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">Huawei&apos;s Mate XT</a>, the phone could see a display that pushes 10 inches when all three screens are in use. We&apos;ll have to wait for when/if this device sees the light of day.</p><p>The renders suggest Xiaomi <em>could </em>chase flat sides with rounded corners to make its handheld experience easy on the palms.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve heard rumors of Xiaomi <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-tri-fold-phone-development-rumor">developing a tri-fold</a> before as a tipster claimed one was coming to take on Huawei in August. There was little information at the time, though the renderings today might give us an idea. Moreover, the company might show off the device in more detail during MWC 2025, so we&apos;ll have to wait and see.</p><p>While a potential showcase is good, that doesn&apos;t mean the tri-fold will progress. Huawei launched its Mate XT, the world&apos;s first tri-fold, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-rollable-phone-pursuit-alleged-report">reportedly stunned Samsung</a>. The Korean OEM was originally chasing a tri-fold; however, development of the device stalled, thus prompting the company to look elsewhere. Now, with Huawei taking the idea and running, Samsung is allegedly thinking of dropping the world&apos;s first rollable device.</p><p>The company showed off a prototype of the device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-display-foldable-rollable-tech-concepts-ces-2024">during CES 2024</a> dubbed as the "Rollable Flex."</p><p>Huawei&apos;s Mate XT delivers a 10.2-inch display when fully expanded with a textured leather back panel, gold accents, and a newly developed hinge structure. As the publication notes, Xiaomi could have an opportunity here to do something different: offer its tri-fold globally. Huawei currently doesn&apos;t offer the Mate XT to global consumers, but Xiaomi could if things proceed.</p>

<ul><li>The Made by YouTube update showed the platform's plan to incorporate Google's DeepMind video generation AI, Veo, into Shorts creation.</li><li>The company detailed plans for "Communities," a place that's all about a channel's creator for fan interactions, fan art, and video discussions.</li><li>YouTube is prepares content organization updates for smart TVs and "Gifts" (digital items) for streamers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube gives us a detailed look at everything that&apos;s coming for the platform, which will affect creators and viewers alike.</p><p>The platform held a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/made-on-youtube-2024/">Made by YouTube</a> event today (Sept 18), highlighting how it will inspire more creators. Set to launch "later this year," YouTube states it&apos;s bringing Google&apos;s DeepMind AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights#:~:text=video%20and%20image%20generation">Veo</a>, to the short-form video platform. Google explained Veo&apos;s "advanced understanding of natural language and visual semantics" as it prepared to arrive for Gemini during I/O 2024.</p><p>YouTube creators can lean on the video generation AI tool to help create backgrounds for Shorts and produce "concepts that were once impossible to visualize." Once it arrives, the post states creators can use Veo for six-second clips for your Short.</p><p>Additionally, Veo can make a shorter, singular clip to fill in any gaps you may have. Shorts made using Veo will have a "generated with AI" content label attached.</p><p>The AI features continue through the "Inspiration" tab in YouTube Studio. Specifically, YouTube is fueling it with Gen AI for title suggestions, thumbnails, outlines, and more. YouTube teases a new shortcut will arrive for the Inspiration tab next year.</p>

<p>Opposite of these AI updates are better interactions between the creator and the viewer with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/a-new-youtube-communities-experience-for-fans-by-fans/">Communities</a> and Community Hub. The former is said to be nestled on a YouTuber&apos;s channel and will act as a centralized spot for video discussion, fan art, and connection building. YouTube is already testing Communities with a "handful" of channels, but it plans to extend access to more in "early 2025."</p><p>The Community Hub is the next iteration of YouTube Studio&apos;s comments tab. This feature will offer "AI-enhanced" assistance as the platform gives creators tailored-made quick responses based on their speaking behavior.</p><p>Giving a rising YouTuber some "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-hype/">Hype</a>" is the platform&apos;s next support method. Hyping up a video is as simple as clicking a button to raise that creator&apos;s points. YouTube states that those with the highest points will be placed on a leaderboard, thus increasing their presence. A limited test has started in Brazil, Turkey, and Taiwan.</p><p>More regions should see it "in the coming months."</p><p>The next set of interactable are dubbed "Jewels" and "Gifts." YouTube says these are digital items that viewers can send to their favorite YouTube streamers. It reminds us of the same variant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/live-gifts-wallet/gifts/gifts">TikTok has for streamers</a>. Vertical livestreams on YouTube will receive Gifts first, though the company has not given a timeframe.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1075px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.81%;"><img id="9U9aymCXnXKoZveHyfn92j" name="youtube-organized-smart-tv-content.jpg" alt="YouTube gives creators better content organization for smart TVs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9U9aymCXnXKoZveHyfn92j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1075" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The big screen, otherwise known as smart TVs, will receive an update to organized content. The post states creators can place their videos into categories like "seasons" and "episodes." YouTube also detailed that updates will arrive for videos from a channel directly, easier subscription options, and easier links in the description box.</p><p>YouTube already rolled out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-dual-column-tv-redesign-detailed">dual-column UI redesign</a> for smart TVs earlier this year. The changes made it easier for viewers to check out additional video information and not miss any action.</p><p>The Made by YouTube updates close by detailing a couple of housecleaning features like "Auto Dubbing." The feature lets creators generate translated tracks for their videos in multiple languages. Initial tests have seemingly gone well as YouTube now plans to extend its coverage to Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, and more.</p><p>Lastly, YouTube Shopping is opening its doors to Indonesia today (Sept 18) in partnership with Shopee. "In the coming weeks," the program will extend to Thailand and Vietnam.</p>

After rolling out to other Galaxy and Pixel models, it&apos;s now tipped to arrive on more Android phones, including Xiaomi&apos;s 14T series.</p><p>In his recent review of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-fold-2-review">TECNO Phantom V Fold 2</a>, our own Nicholas Sutrich mentioned that Circle to Search is expected to arrive on the foldable phone in October.</p><p>According to a fresh leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://spillsomebeans.com/circle-to-search-coming-to-xiaomi-14t-series/" target="_blank">SpillSomeBeans</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/18/google-circle-to-search-android-xiaomi-tecno/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>), promotional materials for the upcoming Xiaomi 14T series reveal that Circle to Search will be integrated into the device too. This means the Xiaomi 14T might be one of the first to get this AI feature.</p><p>Xiaomi is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-and-14t-pro-specs-leak">expected to hold a big European event set for September 26</a> to unveil the 14T and 14 Pro. These new devices are likely to include Gemini-powered features like AI Notes, AI Interpreter, AI subtitles, and AI Voice Recorder.</p><p>It&apos;s not entirely surprising to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> expand to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone models</a>. It fits perfectly with Google’s plan to get this feature on over 200 million Android devices by the end of the year, and ditching the Samsung and Pixel exclusivity is a key step to making that happen.</p><p>After the Xiaomi 14T reveal, it’s likely we’ll see Circle to Search and other Gemini-powered AI features make their way to more of Xiaomi’s flagship phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>.</p>

<p>The leaked promo materials also reveal some juicy details about the Xiaomi 14T’s hardware. The phone is expected to run on the MediaTek Dimensity 8300 Ultra chipset. It’ll likely pack a 5,000mAh battery with 67W wired fast charging to keep you going all day.</p><p>Plus, it’s expected to follow Xiaomi’s trend of partnerships with Leica, featuring a triple rear camera setup: a 50MP IMX906 sensor, a 50MP telephoto lens, and a 12MP ultrawide lens.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Xiaomi 14T Pro is rumored to come with a faster Dimensity 9300+ SoC and a boost in camera tech with a 50MP Sony Light Fusion 900 sensor.</p><p>By packing in features like Circle to Search, the Xiaomi 14T series is shaping up to be a serious player in the crowded smartphone market.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>For several years <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-get-the-message-campaign">Google has been very vocal</a> about Apple supporting RCS in its iMessage platform. Now that it&apos;s happened, it seems like Google got what it was asking for. Spoiler: it didn&apos;t, but it did stop the barrage of messaging about why it was needed.</p><p>Two very important things come into play here. First, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-ios-18-adds-rcs-support-android">RCS on the iPhone</a> is not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-encryption">end-to-end encrypted</a> because that type of encryption is not part of the RCS standards. Second, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-will-now-directly-offer-rcs-features-instead-waiting-carriers">chose to add the encryption layer itself</a>, but Apple did not, nor did it choose to work with Google to enable it.</p><p>Oh, there is one more important thing: Apple didn&apos;t add RCS support to appease Google or as a show of good faith for its customers. It was more likely because China demanded it happen.</p>
<p>I know plenty of people simply don&apos;t care about RCS at all. You may use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> or never text with someone on a different smartphone platform, so it makes no difference to you that Apple supports it. That&apos;s great, but it affects a lot of other people, which is why so much virtual ink has been used to talk about it.</p><p>If you&apos;re not sure about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">what RCS is</a>, think of it as WhatsApp-style text messaging. You can send higher resolution photos and videos, see when the other person has read your message or when they are typing, and include media like stickers without converting it to an older style MMS message.</p><p>If you were texting between two iPhones or two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, it&apos;s what you&apos;re used to. If one person has an Android phone and the other has an iPhone, none of this could happen, and you probably noticed that, too. Now it can, thanks to iOS 18&apos;s support for RCS in iMessage. </p>
<p>One of the big reasons so many people are talking about this is because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-eu-companies-letter-to-regulators">Google made a big deal about Apple not supporting it</a>. Besides the richer user experience, RCS (the way Google does it) supports end-to-end encryption, making sure only you can read a message meant for you. Google said Apple was making messaging unsafe because it would not support this feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pc9fCBA5cinnUpL5cLFkNG" name="iphone-15-pro-max-accessories-10.jpg" alt="Best iPhone 15 Pro Max cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pc9fCBA5cinnUpL5cLFkNG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the RCS announcement from Apple, Google stopped telling us all why Apple was "bad" for not supporting it. However, Apple&apos;s current implementation of RCS does not support end-to-end encryption. A message between an Android phone and an iPhone is encrypted while it&apos;s flying across the internet (like almost all other internet traffic) but it isn&apos;t as secure as Google claimed it must be.</p>
<p>Encryption of this sort isn&apos;t part of RCS. It&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/article/rcs-nowin-ios-a-new-chapter-for-mobile-messaging/">likely to be added in the future,</a> but even then, Apple won&apos;t support it without updating its implementation. The only reason it&apos;s supported on Android is that Google added it to the standards-based RCS profile itself.</p><p>Apple could have done the same, or it could have worked with Google to add it to iMessage, but it didn&apos;t. There is no incentive to add it and even less to work with Google because proprietary messaging is an important feature that is used to lock users into a platform by both Apple and Google. </p>
<p>In fact, Apple didn&apos;t add RCS support because of Google&apos;s efforts. As a company, it would be better if you had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-seniors" target="_blank">grandma buy an iPhone</a> versus supporting something it doesn&apos;t think adds value to iOS. I&apos;m not going to buy into the conspiracy theory that Apple purposefully chose to support an outdated version of RCS to thwart Google, but I do think Apple simply didn&apos;t care what Google had to say.</p><p>Apple added RCS support because 20% of its sales are in China, and China will soon require <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/the-chinese-connection-in-apples-support-for-googles-messaging-platform/articleshow/107784364.cms#:~:text=China%20has%20been%20pushing%20device,a%20condition%20of%20regulatory%20certification.">all phones with 5G capability to support the RCS standard</a> if they are to gain regulatory approval. Apple can not afford to lose 20% of its market and will always do what China demands. </p>
<p>This leaves me with one question: why has Google stopped demanding secure cross-platform messaging from Apple? It&apos;s not here, and Apple has made no effort to provide it.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying Apple should have or that you should worry about it. There are plenty of end-to-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">encrypted messaging platforms</a> out there if that&apos;s something you care about. Most people already use one of them, especially outside of North America.</p><p>Google and Apple will always find ways to dig at each other and try to convince you that it is the best. Maybe one is better than the other, and maybe one day, something even better will come along. In the meantime, don&apos;t fall into the trap of believing everything one of them has to say.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If you put most book-style foldable phones next to each other, you&apos;ll notice a trend. Most of them are tall and narrow when closed, which allows them to be a bit more square when unfolded. To me, this has always felt like the wrong design decision, as it was one that tried to stick as close to a "regular" smartphone design rather than playing to the strengths of a book-style foldable.</p><p>That is until the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold</a> came along in 2023. Oft-rumored and substantially delayed past its original release, the Pixel Fold opted for a squat, wide design that unfolded into a landscape almost 16:9 aspect ratio, much more closely mimicking a tablet than other book-style foldables.</p><p>But its sequel, the awkwardly named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, decided to act more like other foldables I&apos;ve used and forget the unique identity of its predecessor. While Google may have improved many other aspects of its latest foldable, the wrong choice was to go for a more "traditional" foldable phone design. Here&apos;s why I want to see Google go back to a wider design for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>.</p>

<h2 id="it-apos-s-better-for-apps-2">It&apos;s better for apps</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3fnzv3Xc9w6C7E7fKgW3qN" name="Google-Pixel-Fold-display-unfolded-reading-google-books.jpg" alt="Reading a book on the Google Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fnzv3Xc9w6C7E7fKgW3qN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the key takeaways from my original Pixel Fold review was that the wide aspect ratio wasn&apos;t just great for apps on the outer screen but better on the inner display, as well. But this wasn&apos;t inherently because the screen was <em>wider</em>. Rather, it was because opening the Pixel Fold made apps think you were suddenly using a tablet in landscape mode.</p><p>In fact, the only other foldable that was like this was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n2-review">Oppo Find N2</a>, and that device was never released outside of China.</p><p>That last part is the most important part of the Pixel Fold&apos;s design, as it ensures that the giant screen is used correctly. Every other foldable on the market still acts like a giant smartphone when opened up. It&apos;s essentially a "wide portrait" screen, and it makes many apps feel awkward and useless when opening them on the big screen.</p><p>Take Gmail, for example. While Google worked to ensure that many of its apps <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-apps-redesigned-for-foldable-phones">started behaving more like tablet apps</a> when opened on big foldable displays, Gmail still thinks it&apos;s being opened on a normal tall, narrow smartphone screen even though it&apos;s being displayed on a big, wide foldable display. That is unless you&apos;re opening it on the original Pixel Fold.</p>

<p>On the Pixel Fold, Gmail opens up in the proper landscape tablet dual-pane view, giving you the list of folders and tags on the left, while the open email or list of emails resides on the right side. Sure, you could get this same view if you rotated your open foldable 90 degrees sideways, but I&apos;d rather it just open the right way <em>the first time.</em></p><p>When I&apos;ve got a big foldable screen, I expect to have a more efficient workflow than when on a smaller phone screen. In other words, I shouldn&apos;t need to pull out the slide-out menu on the left. It should just be there. This also keeps me from having to constantly navigate forward and backward when reading emails, as emails open next to my inbox instead of on top of it.</p><p>Another example is the YouTube app, which actually opens in tablet view no matter which way you rotate a foldable, but videos themselves work better on the Pixel Fold&apos;s aspect ratio when using them in "flex" mode. That&apos;s when you fold the display at an angle and use the bottom half like a kickstand to watch a video or play a game.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aXRKfspxkSNQCs8FcK9ggk" name="google-pixel-fold-honor-magic-v3-youtube-video.jpg" alt="Comparing a YouTube video's aspect ratio on the Google Pixel Fold and the Honor Magic V3 when in flex mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aXRKfspxkSNQCs8FcK9ggk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The original Google Pixel Fold displays the video on the entire half of the screen, while every other foldable I&apos;ve used has black bars on the side because the display doesn&apos;t have the right aspect ratio for this purpose. The example above is the Pixel Fold next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Honor Magic V3</a>, but this particular problem occurs on all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a>.</p><p>One more example is Discord, which is generally a terrible app to use on book-style folding phones because it&apos;s so darn buggy. But using it on the Pixel Fold is less problematic on the big screen because it actually fits the entire chat, plus the navigation pane and server list on that beautiful, wide inner display.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b3ywRgNKzH8gj5SZQt4jvk" name="google-pixel-fold-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-discord.jpg" alt="Comparing Discord on the Google Pixel Fold and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b3ywRgNKzH8gj5SZQt4jvk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Comparing Discord on the Google Pixel Fold (left) and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the chat gets cut off because of the narrower aspect ratio. To see the entire chat, you actually need to slide the side panel back of the screen to the left, leaving a giant chat window to take over your screen and waste a lot of space.</p><p>While a notable number of apps have worked to fix these issues over the past year since the original Pixel Fold launched, there are still plenty that don&apos;t behave as expected on large foldable phones.</p><p>Developers can, of course, opt into showing tablet UIs when large screens are present but it doesn&apos;t fix the inherent problem of displays that are too tall and not wide enough. The original Pixel Fold fixed this, but I&apos;m afraid no other company will have the courage—Google included—to attempt the same move again, and that&apos;s a real shame.</p>

You can also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sarahandersencomics.aninfinitestory.io/#/"><strong>check out the comic for yourself</strong></a> at that link, and start exploring.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/aninfinitestory/">An Infinite Story</a>, the team behind the infinite storytelling platform, has shown off demos with Disney art and real-life sports superstars like LeBron James and Tom Brady, but it&apos;s looking to partner closely with artists like Andersen to create interactive worlds that go beyond the usual comic-panel format you see with webcomics.</p><p>Essentially, any tiny dot or line on the canvas may hold entire art pieces and worlds, so you&apos;re encouraged to pinch-and-zoom onto every area to catch all the Easter eggs. For this demo, you must count every single hidden cat, and those that score closest to the correct number are entered into a contest to win prizes like signed books or original art drawn by Andersen.</p>

<p>I had the chance to sit down with Andersen and Infinite Story co-founder Bobby Chiu, an Emmy-winning artist who designed characters for Tim Burton&apos;s Alice In Wonderland and works on other Hollywood animated movies like Super Mario Bros.</p><p>I confirmed that "After Owning a Cat" had no generative AI elements; instead, it takes preexisting art from Sarah&apos;s Scribbles with its "original aesthetic and style," then places them in the wider canvas, while adding new art with the same aesthetic style made in collaboration by Andersen, Chiu, and other team members. It&apos;s an "expansion on a creative process" that "feels new and innovative,” says Andersen.</p><p>Long-time Sarah&apos;s Scribbles fans will recognize strips and "characters" like her pets and various body parts, as this experience pays homage to them. But it has an Inception-like theme where the deeper you go, the more the world of Sarah&apos;s Scribbles takes on a bizarre feline spin you&apos;ve never seen before in the comic. </p><p>The "cat takeover" theme offers a unique twist to the usual hidden-art-game formula, and it allowed Andersen to try a different kind of storytelling with a "unifying narrative" than she can normally accomplish with a few comic panels.</p><p>Andersen is excited to use this same format for future comic tie-ins. I asked if she might bring in other Sarah&apos;s Scribbles themes like cryptids or uterus woes for a hidden-art comic; she laughed at the idea of a whole anatomy-themed experience, but mentioned that she&apos;s working on other new comics — including one with a fantasy theme — that could use this format to build backstory and character ideas that&apos;ll make their way into the comic.</p>

<p>As for how the Infinite Story platform works, Chiu and fellow engineer Josh Tyler didn&apos;t share too many details, except that it&apos;s WebGL platform agnostic and is best suited for mobile pinch-and-zoom (though you can experience it with a computer trackpad too).</p><p>This Sarah&apos;s Scribbles demo is essentially a trial run for them, and they designed it to be "easy" for users to find every hidden nook and cranny, with shining icons that appear if you&apos;re stuck. Eventually, they intend to add "new game modes" like "puzzlers, time trials, web comics, and cooperative treasure hunts" that provide more challenge and encourage more free exploration.</p>

<p>Hidden object game companies and webcomic apps like Webtoons would probably jump at the chance to incorporate this tech, so I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if An Infinite Story tech ends up in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">best Android games</a> of the future, if not hosted on their own app for unique experiences.</p><p>Either way, it&apos;s an intriguing new gaming/ storytelling format that puts more emphasis on lovingly recreating art instead of "borrowing" it via genAI, and I think that&apos;s pretty neat. I&apos;m excited to see what other artists end up using this format.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Garmin InReach Messenger Plus is Garmin's "first satellite communicator with photo and voice messaging in addition to global two-way texting, location sharing, and SOS."</li><li>You can now provide more context during an SOS, such as describing the problem or taking a photo of your location.</li><li>Garmin promises IPX7 water resistance and 600 hours of battery life with 10-minute check-ins or a year in standby mode.</li><li>The InReach Messenger Plus costs $499, plus $14.99/month or more for satellite.</li></ul>
<p>The Garmin InReach Messenger Plus is a portable satellite communications device that lets you message family, share your location, or call 24/7 emergency services through your phone over satellite. It&apos;s quite similar to the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/is-garmin-inreach-messenger-worth-buying">InReach Messenger</a>, except that it now supports multimedia instead of text characters alone.</p><p>Through the Garmin Messenger app on your smartphone, you&apos;ll be able to send full photos, 30-second voice clips, or 1,600-character messages to friends and family so they&apos;re kept in the loop on your no-signal excursion. The InReach Messenger Plus acts as a satellite relay — assuming you pay for the subscription. </p><p>Like the original InReach Messenger, the Messenger Plus has a covered SOS button you can open up and trigger to signal for help, as well as a tiny MIP LCD for showing information like weather or incoming messages. You can technically send messages on the device itself with the left/ right/ OK buttons, but you&apos;ll need your phone for the new messaging features.</p><p>During SOS calls, you&apos;ll now be able to send voice messages and photos to Garmin Response, which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-2023-sos-report-shows-how-satellite-saves-lives">responded to 14,500 SOS activations thus far</a>. This could provide useful context that text alone couldn&apos;t, which might make the Plus worth the extra cost.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hyYp7H4WQYy4KvpwKK7xrA" name="garmin-inreach-messenger-hero-photo.jpg" alt="Photo of the Garmin InReach Messenger Plus and someone using it to send messages on their smartphone over satellite." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hyYp7H4WQYy4KvpwKK7xrA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8021" height="4512" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both InReach Messenger models have IPX7 water resistance for a decent amount of ruggedness on the trail. They both weigh about 4oz, with 1.08" diagonal (160 x 68) displays.</p><p>The Messenger Plus lasts 600 hours (25 days) with 10-minute check-ins or 120 hours with 2-minute check-ins; the original Messenger lasted 28 days or 144 hours in the same conditions, so the new model must use more battery in exchange for smarter messages.</p><p>You can use either for "Safety Charging," topping off your dead smartphone via the included cable. You can also check weather forecasts over the InReach network.</p><p>Unlike the original InReach Messenger, the Messenger Plus has an actual compass instead of a GPS compass while moving, as well as Garmin Explore app support. This enables features like turn-by-turn routing, searchable POIs, courses, and satellite imagery of your surroundings.</p><p>Overall, the Garmin InReach Messenger Plus has the same primary purposes as its predecessor, only with better smartphone connectivity. Aside from messaging, it tracks your GPS location and sends it to the Garmin Explore app on your smartphone, where you can download and follow offline maps or broadcast your real-time location to loved ones. </p><p>While this device costs much more than the original InReach Messenger, it&apos;s slightly less costly than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-gpsmap-67i-review">Garmin GPSMAP 67i</a> handheld with satellite that&apos;s designed as an all-in-one, standalone device without needing your smartphone. The Messenger Plus lets you use a touchscreen device you&apos;re more familiar with.</p><p>We recently learned that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-pixel-9s-satellite-sos-runs-on-tech-from-skylo-and-garmin">Pixel 9&apos;s satellite tech uses Garmin Response</a>, but with Skylo&apos;s satellite data. Since increasingly more smartphones use satellite tech, this device feels like a direct response, adding support for multimedia that a smartphone could handle easily.</p><p>The biggest knock against the InReach Messenger Plus will be its price: $499, plus the need to pay at least $15/month for satellite connectivity. I&apos;d say it&apos;s primarily designed for those who spend long stretches off the cellular grid, but want to stay better connected with family during those stretches. For those people, it&apos;ll be worth the high cost.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google, Masimo, and Qualcomm are working together to boost health tracking on Wear OS with new, premium features.</li><li>Google’s new partnership means it has licensed Masimo’s blood oxygen tech, plus other health features.</li><li>Masimo’s new platform will work well with Wear OS, providing accurate health tracking and smooth Android syncing.</li><li>Manufacturers can design their smartwatch exteriors and interfaces, but Masimo handles the internal tech design and testing.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google and Masimo have teamed up to create a reference framework that helps manufacturers speed up the development of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS</a> smartwatches.</p><p>You might remember Masimo as the company that sued Apple, pushing for an import ban on the Apple Watch. The medical tech company claimed Apple used its blood oxygen tracking technology without permission.</p><p>Sales of the Apple Watch were briefly halted, but instead of agreeing to a licensing deal, Apple disabled the blood oxygen feature across all Watch models to ease the legal tensions.</p><p>Recently, Google enlisted Masimo and Qualcomm to create health-focused reference platforms for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatches</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/16/wear-os-health-reference-platform-google-masimo/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). This partnership aims to boost Google’s vision for advanced health tracking and bringing premium features to its wearable platform.</p><p>While Google takes charge of the Wear OS experience, the smartwatch makers are still responsible for building and integrating fitness tracking from scratch.</p><p>The variety of health tracking options across different price ranges benefits consumers but also leaves room for cost-cutting by manufacturers. The challenge is that it’s tough for users to determine how effective or reliable these features are before buying.</p><p>Thanks to the new partnership, Google has secured a license for Masimo&apos;s blood oxygen tracking tech that Apple sidestepped, along with a range of other health features.</p><p>As per Masimo’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240913710494/en/" target="_blank">press release</a>, the new reference platform is designed to fit right in with the Wear OS ecosystem. It offers a bunch of health tracking tools, such as Masimo’s biosensing tech, that aim for accurate data and easy syncing with Android phones.</p><p>According to the announcement, manufacturers using the new reference platforms and Masimo’s tech can still design and build their smartwatch exteriors and user interfaces as they like. But for the internal parts, like Snapdragon chips and Masimo’s biosensors, Masimo will take care of all the design, production, and testing.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Smart rings are on the rise, and while the likes of Oura and Ultrahuman have an early-mover advantage, the arrival of Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> has catalyzed this category. I used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman&apos;s Ring Air</a> for most of the year now, and it is genuinely one of the best wearables I tested.</p><p>Noise is looking to get in on the action with the introduction of the Luna Ring. The brand is a leading wearable manufacturer in India, and it predominantly caters to the entry-level and budget categories. It is looking to undercut Ultrahuman by a sizeable amount, with the Luna Ring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gonoise.com/products/luna-smart-ring">available in the country for ₹19,999 ($238)</a>. By contrast, the Ultrahuman Ring Air <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/ULTRAHUMAN-Ring-AIR-Sleep-Tracking-Subscription/dp/B0CHF4P1G9">retails for ₹28,499 ($340)</a>.</p><p>The affordability makes the Luna Ring enticing, and after using the smart ring for a month, I can admit that the hardware is just as polished as the Ring Air. The Luna Ring is available in five color options — silver, gold, gold, black, and matte black — and weighs just three to four grams.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bnN3njVVjCY7FEfHppzccG" name="noise-luna-ring-2.jpg" alt="Noise Luna Ring in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bnN3njVVjCY7FEfHppzccG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The chassis is made out of titanium, and the inner casing has a plastic finish and includes a heart rate sensor, blood oxygen sensor, skin temperature sensor, and an accelerometer. The sensor suite is standard stuff, and like the Ring Air, the Luna Ring doesn&apos;t look or feel like a smart ring.</p><p>It is a little wider than regular rings, but other than that, it isn&apos;t immediately evident that you&apos;re wearing a smart ring. The PVD coating is decent, but like other smart rings, it picks up scratches in daily use. Other than that, I don&apos;t have any issues with the design itself; Noise did a good job in this area, and the Luna Ring looks just as elegant as its rivals.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bPaZonPZTXwnmZg7ERr8uH" name="noise-luna-ring-8.jpg" alt="Noise Luna Ring on the charging dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bPaZonPZTXwnmZg7ERr8uH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A big allure of smart rings is the ability to measure activity and health metrics without using a bulky smartwatch or a fitness band, and the Luna Ring gets the basics right. It measures heart rate continually, and you get to see skin temperature readings, SpO2 levels, and activity throughout the course of a day.</p><p>There is some variability to heart rate measurements when seen against the Ring Air, but the margin of error isn&apos;t high. The bigger issue is that activity monitoring is inconsistent, particularly with cardio workouts; I use an exercise bike indoors, and the Luna Ring&apos;s data was in line with that of basic fitness bands.</p><p>It is still usable if you just need a broad overview of your workouts, but if you want accurate heart rate measurements and training load, you have to get a smartwatch. The Ring Air had similar issues with activity monitoring, but a slew of software updates made a real difference, and while it still isn&apos;t anywhere as good as a smartwatch, it has a definite lead over the Luna Ring in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qvzJfxBiY6G5Pg2YxZ4LoG" name="noise-luna-ring-3.jpg" alt="Noise Luna Ring next to device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qvzJfxBiY6G5Pg2YxZ4LoG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the Luna Ring comes into its own is sleep tracking; it is much less annoying than wearing a smartwatch to bed, and Noise&apos;s sleep metrics are decent. You get good insights into your sleep cycle, and you get a score along with suggestions on how to get better rest. On that note, the brand collates activity and health data to provide a readiness score, and it is pretty good too.</p><p>Because there isn&apos;t any panel on the smart ring, you don&apos;t get any notifications or alerts on your finger, and you&apos;ll need to use the app to track activity data. The interface itself is clean, and it connects to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sync-your-fitness-band-google-fit">Google Fit</a>, but there isn&apos;t much in the way of customizability. What&apos;s particularly annoying is that the app inundates you with notifications about connecting to the Luna Ring, and I had to disable the notification channel an hour after I started using the smart ring.</p><p>Also, you will need to give the app access to the alarm permission, and that isn&apos;t something I had to do with most other wearables. I don&apos;t see why Noise needs this as you can&apos;t set alarms on the ring itself, and it is irksome. I didn&apos;t see many issues with connectivity, but there were occasions when data wouldn&apos;t sync with the app automatically.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AyJmMRj44HsjxkYeR9YXcJ" name="noise-luna-ring-4.jpg" alt="Noise Luna Ring next to device showing activity metrics" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyJmMRj44HsjxkYeR9YXcJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery life is another area where the Luna Ring doesn&apos;t quite measure up. Noise touts five-day battery life between charges, but in my usage, the Luna Ring barely made it past two days before it needed to be plugged in. That&apos;s a day less than what I get out of the Ring Air, and while it&apos;s still better than smartwatches, battery longevity isn&apos;t as good as its rivals.</p><p>And then there&apos;s the charging situation. You&apos;ll need to line up the sensors with the ridges on the charging stand, and even after doing that, the ring wouldn&apos;t charge. I had to fiddle with the positioning before I could get the ring to charge, and that was the case with every charge cycle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Pg57BnKf6uXwgHis9wqnSG" name="noise-luna-ring-1.jpg" alt="Noise Luna Ring next to charging station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pg57BnKf6uXwgHis9wqnSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It would have been easier to recommend the Luna Ring if it were a smidgen more affordable — ideally around ₹16,000 ($191). Because as it stands, I don&apos;t see the smart ring nailing the brief. It has a lightweight design and is comfortable to wear throughout the day, and I like what Noise did with the sleep metrics and readiness score. That said, activity monitoring is unreliable at best, and the battery doesn&apos;t last as long as I imagined.</p><p>The biggest issue is the notification spam; yes, I know this can be addressed by muting notifications, but I shouldn&apos;t have to do that. If you&apos;re in India and are mulling a smart ring, Ultrahuman&apos;s Ring Air is still the better choice — it is costlier, but you&apos;re getting a much better product overall. If you need something on a budget, I&apos;d suggest waiting until the Luna Ring gets a decent discount. </p>

<hr>
<p>Google was spotted rolling out an audio feature addition to Android 15 to prepare for its official launch.</p><p>Android 15 is beginning to receive an update containing the return of the "Noise Control" option for connected audio devices. As detailed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1835432242858152229">Mishaal Rahman</a> on X, this button should give users easier control over the ANC and transparency modes of earbuds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a>.</p><p>In the volume panel, users will find the Noise Control option in line with Spatial Audio and Live Captions. Tapping the new button will show the previously mentioned earbud modes alongside an "off" option.</p><p>Android 15 originally missed this option due to a redesign. Its return to the volume panel should make it easier for users to swap between listening modes when necessary.</p>

<p>Google was spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-volume-panel-redesign-collapsible">rolling out a redesign</a> for Android 15&apos;s volume panel in April during Developer Preview 2. The new panel offers a much larger, clearer look at your pill-shaped volume sliders. Muting a stream is now done by tapping the sound&apos;s source icon. With the choice to expand or shrink the redesigned panel, switching to a set of Pixel Buds Pro saw the exclusion of Noise Control.</p><p>Rahman adds that the button, or "Slice," is brought about thanks to the Pixel Buds app to bring control of the earbuds to the volume panel. Google&apos;s return of the option brings some much-needed convenience back to the volume panel.</p><p>In other news, Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-2-bluetooth-fixes-features-rollout">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2</a> for enrolled testers last week. The patch had many Pixel fixes for Bluetooth and other system bugs. However, the update included glimpses into some upcoming features like a Quick Panel redesign. Users were also surprised by the arrival of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1834294677157101611">desktop windowing</a>" during that update.</p><p>Like the volume panel, it seems Google wants to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notifications-quick-settings-panel-android-16-rumor">rework the Quick Settings menu</a>. While the company has advanced its development, rumors claim we likely won&apos;t see this until Android 16 — but there&apos;s always hope.</p><p>We&apos;re still waiting for Android 15 to hit devices, though rumors claim it could happen in October.</p>
