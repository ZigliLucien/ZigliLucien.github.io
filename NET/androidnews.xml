                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>You've come to the right place if you need to know how to set the IPD on Meta Quest 3S. Setting the correct inter-pupillary distance, or IPD, is one of the key pillars of having a good VR experience. When your IPD is set incorrectly, it can cause nausea, headaches, and dizziness. It can also make it difficult to slice blocks accurately in Beat Saber because your brain can't deduce the proper distance between objects.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>'s IPD adjustment method is quite different from other VR headsets on the market, so we've put together this guide to help you find your ideal IPD preset as well as some hidden tricks to enable additional IPD settings. If you have a Meta Quest 2 (formerly known as the Oculus Quest 2), these steps will also work for that headset.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-measure-your-ipd-2">How to measure your IPD</h2>
<p>In order to measure your IPD, you'll need two things: a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Westcott-Non-Shatter-Ruler-Inches-13862/dp/B00309RVJ6/">ruler with millimeter markings</a>, and a mirror. Any ruler will work so long as it has millimeter markings, but you will want a hard ruler instead of a flimsy tape measure to ensure accuracy.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>While looking in the mirror, <strong>close your left eye</strong>.</li><li>Look straight into the mirror at your right eye <strong>with your right eye</strong>.</li><li>Hold the ruler just below your eye and center the <strong>zero marker</strong> on your right pupil.</li><li><strong>Close your right eye</strong> and <strong>open your left eye</strong>, making sure to not move the ruler.</li><li>Look into the mirror at your left eye <strong>with your left eye</strong>.</li><li>Look straight and <strong>note the millimeter distance</strong> that matches up to the center of your left pupil.</li></ol>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ycnsgzER8Le3Q8T4xprv2H" name="measure-ipd.jpg" alt="How to measure your IPD by using a ruler" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ycnsgzER8Le3Q8T4xprv2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For example, my IPD is 66mm. The average IPD sits around 63mm, but can range between 55mm and 72mm (or higher) depending on the person.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-adjust-the-ipd-on-meta-quest-3s-2">How to adjust the IPD on Meta Quest 3S</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="M9yDchVsbRfkFHcNUpXpMB" name="Meta-Quest-3S-lenses-close" alt="Looking at the lenses inside a Meta Quest 3S headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M9yDchVsbRfkFHcNUpXpMB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that you have your IPD measured, you can accurately set the IPD on your Meta Quest 3S. You'll do this by physically sliding the lenses closer or further apart from one another. The Meta Quest 3S features three presets for IPD adjustment: preset 1 is 58mm, preset 2 is 63mm, and preset 3 is 68mm. By default, the Meta Quest 3S ships at IPD preset 2, which covers the average IPD.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Determine which preset works best for you using the measurements you wrote down earlier.</li><li>The closest preset is <strong>58mm.</strong> The middle preset is <strong>63mm.</strong> The furthest apart preset is <strong>68mm</strong>.</li><li>While holding the Meta Quest 3S, <strong>grab ahold of the gray cover </strong>on the outside of one lens.</li><li>Gently push the lens in toward the other to <strong>lower IPD</strong>, or push them apart to <strong>raise IPD</strong>.</li></ol>

<h2 id="what-if-my-ipd-doesn-t-match-the-presets-on-meta-quest-3s-2">What if my IPD doesn't match the presets on Meta Quest 3S?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="B5TbKFZYw8FCZsRWoQQGNB" name="Meta-Quest-3S-lenses-angle" alt="Looking at the lenses inside a Meta Quest 3S headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5TbKFZYw8FCZsRWoQQGNB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If your IPD isn't exactly 58mm, 63mm, or 68mm, don't worry. Meta has designed the lenses on the Meta Quest 3S to help fit a range of IPD, but while one of those presets will fit nicely for most people, some folks will find they need a setting in between.</p><p>The trick is to gently move the lenses between presets and stop somewhere between the preset point.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>While holding the Meta Quest 3S, <strong>grab ahold of the gray plastic</strong> on the outside of one lens.</li><li>Gently push the lens in toward the other to <strong>lower IPD</strong> or push them apart to <strong>raise IPD</strong>.</li><li>Try to <strong>push just past</strong> preset 1 or preset 2 to get a more accurate IPD.</li><li>If you're having trouble pushing past, try pushing the lenses inward <strong>from a higher IPD preset</strong> instead.</li></ol>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S still only supports a maximum IPD range of 58-68mm, but using the spaces between presets can help folks who have IPD between the numbers. For instance, someone with an IPD of 60 or 61 might try the space between preset 1 and preset 2. Someone like me who has an IPD of 66 can try the space between preset 2 and preset 3 for a more comfortable experience.</p>

<hr>
<p>Whispers about Samsung&apos;s next A-series budget phone entry surface with a change that&apos;ll give you flashbacks.</p><p>In conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1847222100697698340">X tipster OnLeaks</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.giznext.com/news/giznext-exclusive-samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-full-design-out-via-5k-renders-360-video/">Giznext</a> posted some alleged information regarding the upcoming Galaxy A36 5G. The device&apos;s leaked renderings show it could continue to feature smooth, flat sides with rounded corners and a "relatively thin" body. However, the most significant change concerns its rear panel. According to the rumors, the Galaxy A36 5G could see the return of an old-school camera array.</p><p>The renderings show the device could sport a triple vertical camera array inside a raised, bordered housing. It seemed familiar to us <em>and </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/hendrawaskitha/status/1847226423960060147">users on X</a>, who stated the design is reminiscent of the 2019 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review">Galaxy Note 10</a>.</p><p>While the images suggest three cameras, the details of the sensors are unknown.</p>

<p>The front of the device seems relatively similar to its soon-to-be predecessor. The publication claims the Galaxy A36 5G will feature a flat 6.6-inch, 120Hz fresh rate display with "thin bezels." However, while the display&apos;s chin isn&apos;t <em>too large</em>, it does catch your attention. A centered punch-hole selfie camera rounds out its relatively tame front appearance.</p><p>Other specifications are still speculative; however, the post states the A36 5G could feature an Adreno 610 GPU. Moreover, Samsung could power the phone with the Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 7s Gen 2</a>. The latter debuted late in 2023, built on a 4nm process with the promise of "significant" camera performance boosts for midrange phones.</p><p>A potential launch date is still in the air — at least for overseas markets. The publication purports that a launch in India is "imminent," but fails to mention the U.S.</p><p>The rumored design of the Galaxy A36 5G sticks close to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-a35-just-landed-in-the-us-with-a-sweet-deal-on-the-galaxy-buds-fe">the A35 5G</a>. That device offers a 6.6-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display with thin bezels and that same (slightly) noticeable chin. This phone also features 6GB of RAM with 128GB of storage. The current rumors suggest a similar trend, at least RAM-wise for the A36 5G.</p><p>On the other hand, rumors about its potential launch echo what Samsung did with the A35. After its debut overseas, U.S. consumers had to wait for the device to launch. Samsung ended up dropping the product in the States a month later. With the A36 5G rumored to launch in India "soon," perhaps the Korean OEM will give U.S. folks a later pick-up date again.</p><p>The features of a device are always a talking point, but the recent rumors don&apos;t touch on that for the Galaxy A36 5G. However, it makes sense to expect some level of Galaxy AI, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discusses-the-ai-phone-future">Samsung&apos;s newfound R&D focus on it</a>.</p>

I wouldn't buy it at full price, but with a $200 Black Friday discount, the Edge (2024) is a steal. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-edge-2024-256gb-unlocked-midnight-blue/6580484.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="87041979-bc8f-4cef-9b0a-0740167815ef" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$549.99" data-dimension48="$549.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Motorola has always produced great <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phones</a>, and the Moto G Power 5G (2024) is no exception. Currently priced at a mere $199.99 (or $99.99 with activation), the G Power 5G features outstanding battery life with wireless charging support and 8GB of RAM, plus I'm kind of obsessed with this Pale Lilac color variant. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-moto-g-power-2024-5g-128gb-unlocked-pale-lilac/6572572.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7725fee1-f70b-4fc5-bffb-05bafbbc4432" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299.99" data-dimension48="$299.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

None of them cost over $20. In fact, most of these sets cost below $10, so money isn&apos;t much of an issue when buying a good screen protector. You need to decide whether you want something made of glass or plastic. Both are protective, but glass is more durable while plastic is thinner and offers a higher touch response.

<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-screen-protector-for-your-galaxy-s24-fe-2">How to choose the best screen protector for your Galaxy S24 FE</h2>
<p>There are plenty of different screen protectors available for the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE. Most of them are made of tempered glass, which is an excellent shatter-proof material. The industry standard is 9H tempered glass, which is what you should seek out when buying screen guards. However, if you don&apos;t like the thickness that glass adds, you can always get a TPU or PET plastic film. TPU plastic is more durable than PET and can repair itself as long as the scratch is small.</p><p>With that being said, I always recommend tempered glass screen protectors over plastic films. In some cases, a plastic screen guard is actually a better choice. For example, the Pixel 6 had a finicky fingerprint sensor so I advised against glass screen protectors. Fortunately, the Galaxy S24 FE doesn&apos;t have this issue as far as I know.</p><p>The best screen protector for the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE comes from amFilm, a brand that&apos;s famous for selling good quality screen guards at really great prices. The amFilm Auto-Alignment OneTouch for Samsung Galaxy S24 FE comes with everything you could ever need, from two camera lens protectors and two tempered glass screen guards to a cleaning and installation kit. It&apos;s priced below $10, making this the best overall choice without a doubt.</p><p>If you don&apos;t like the bulk of glass, IQShield offers a reliable alternative to consider. The IQShield Samsung Galaxy S24 FE Clear Film (2-Pack) includes a duo of durable TPU films. There&apos;s no lens protector in the box, but the film is really thin so it delivers a fantastic touch response and self-repairs small scratches and abrasions. This set will set you back $10 too, which is also filthy cheap albeit not as value-packed as the amFilm kit.</p><p>After getting a solid screen protector, be sure to check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-cases-for-the-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe">best cases for the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE</a> as well. You don&apos;t want to damage the body of your $650 phone either. A good case keeps your phone fresh for years, increasing its resale or trade-in value.</p>

<hr>
<p>More layoffs strike Meta employees late in 2024.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24272195/meta-layoffs-whatsapp-instagram-reality-labs">The Verge</a> was tipped off about the layoffs thanks to a post on Threads by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@wongmjane/post/DBMuvFvTw8H?xmt=AQGzhz1IKFrde8FeEKMQ8tNplRUM9yJ4dwSk_3fXs--4pQ">Jane Manchun Wong</a> and other former Meta employees. In their post, Wong states, "I’m still trying to process this but I’m informed that my role at Meta has been impacted." </p><p>The publication&apos;s report states the company has issued layoff notices to employees working on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Reality Labs. Unfortunately, the exact number of impacted personnel at Meta is unknown.</p><p>Meta spokesperson Dave Arnold informed The Verge that the company is "making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy." Moreover, there&apos;s a chance that not everyone will be let go entirely.</p><p>Arnold adds the latest wave includes "moving some teams to different locations and moving some employees to different roles." Additionally, Meta is supposedly "working hard" to find "other opportunities" for those caught in the layoffs.</p><p>It seems Meta is still regressing to its 2021-era employment levels. In March 2023, the company hit its Comms team and project and policy managers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-may-2023-layoffs">from Reality Labs with a wave of layoffs</a>. It&apos;s worth noting that the company&apos;s Reality Labs Division was hit the hardest that time as former staff members took to LinkedIn to tell the news. That wave arrived just before Meta&apos;s major VR Gaming Showcase in 2023.</p><p>The blow to the Reality Labs team (again) is strange considering Meta has been pushing its VR hardware more as it recently launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-launch">entry-level Meta Quest 3S</a>.</p><p>The layoff trend continues as you may remember Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-q4-2022-earnings">laid off roughly 11,000 employees</a> toward the end of Q4 2022. This was part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg&apos;s &apos;Year of Efficiency" for the company. Zuckerberg added Meta is "focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization." The company turned around and let go of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-announces-more-layoffs-year-efficiency">additional ~10,000 employees</a> a month later in March 2023.</p>

<ul><li>Google previously offered a lesser tier of YouTube Premium, called Premium Lite, available at a lower price.</li><li>YouTube Premium Lite offered an ad-free experience to subscribers until the pilot program was canceled in 2023.</li><li>Now, Google is testing a new version of Premium Lite with some ads in three countries.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you want an ad-free experience on YouTube, Google wants you to pay for YouTube Premium. There's only one tier, with individual plans costing $13.99 per month. You can get family or student plans, too, but people looking for a cheaper version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> have been left wanting more. Although Google tested a "YouTube Premium Lite" plan for two years, the pilot program was shut down in 2023.</p><p>Now, there's a chance YouTube Premium Lite could be making a comeback — albeit in a different form. Over the last few days, users in select countries have spotted a Premium Lite subscription tier in the YouTube app. One user, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@jonahmanzano/post/DBLncDhzYk5" target="_blank">Jonah Manzano, on Threads</a>, shared a screenshot of the offering:</p>

<p>Later, a Google spokesperson confirmed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-premium-lite-return-3491130/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> that the company was testing "a different version of Premium Lite." The company added that the test was region-limited, and users in "Australia, Germany and Thailand may see the option to sign up," per the report. For now, it's too early to tell whether the YouTube Premium Lite plan will stick around at all, let alone come to other regions.</p><p>Since the original Premium Lite experiment was limited to select countries in Europe, North American users haven't yet had the option to pay for a cheaper YouTube Premium subscription. The original pilot program gave subscribers an ad-free experience while cutting out some of the extras that were included with the full Premium subscription — like background video playback, video downloads, and YouTube Music Premium access. It was priced at roughly €6.99, or around $7.50 in U.S. dollars.</p><p>However, the Premium Lite that Google is testing today is far from the bargain the original pilot program was. In exchange for about half the price of a full Premium subscription, users who sign up for the new Premium Lite plan will get a "limited ad experience." It doesn't completely remove ads anymore, and all the extras are still missing.</p><p>That's despite the Premium Lite test costing around double the price of the original, which has drawn criticism from users on social media, such as under the Reddit thread below.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1d0d1sg/premium_lite_coming_back">Premium Lite coming back?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube">r/youtube</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>It's no secret that there are plenty of ads on YouTube. For users watching on a smart TV, there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-longer-fewer-ad-breaks">fewer — but much longer — ad breaks</a>. That's why many YouTube watchers want a way to experience the platform ad-free, and they have fewer options now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-blocks-third-party-ad-blockers">Google is amidst an ad-blocker crackdown</a>.</p><p>YouTube seems to be following in the footsteps of other streaming services, like Netflix, which have ad-supported subscription tiers. However, YouTube is a free-to-access platform, so it's fundamentally different. It remains to be seen whether users are ready and willing to pay for a "limited ad experience" on YouTube with the Premium Lite test.</p>

<hr>
<p>The third quarter&apos;s smartphone sales analysis has arrived and a few OEMs record positive growth.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/global-smartphone-market-q3-2024">Counterpoint Research</a> reported the global sales report for the smartphone industry in Q3 2024 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/17/google-pixel-q3-2024-quarterly-sales-record/">9to5Google</a>). The publication states the "sell-through" for phones this past quarter grew 2% YoY (year-over-year). While this is reportedly the "fourth consecutive" quarter to see industry growth, the post adds LATAM, Western Europe, and Japan spearheaded sales.</p><p>Strong quarterly momentum struck "other brands" as research highlights Google as a notable company. Research Director Tarun Pathak commented, saying Google "recorded their highest-ever smartphone volumes in a quarter in Q3." Unfortunately, the director didn&apos;t provide a specific number behind this new record.</p><p>Motorola also hit a "highest-ever" record in phone volume this past quarter. Moreover, Moto and Huawei saw sales grow 30% YoY.</p><p>As usual, the report detailed the performance of the "Top 5" OEMs, beginning with Samsung&apos;s first-place spot in Q3. The company leads the quarter, making up 19% of the market share, followed by Apple with 16%. Chinese brand Xiaomi slides in at third place with 14%.</p><p>Google&apos;s been on an uphill trend lately <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-market-share-grows-in-us-despite-a-decline-in-phone-sales-overall">as a report from March</a> detailed its growth despite an overall smartphone decline in 2023. Sales figures showed the company&apos;s totals were approaching 5% in the U.S. by the end of last year. Additionally, Google was the only OEM that reported a growth in market share in the U.S. in 2023. The brand is still a way out from touching Samsung and Apple, but any growth is positive in the grand scheme.</p><p>More importantly, with Q3 running from July to September, it seems Google can thank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">its Pixel 9 series</a>. The series arrived with three slab phones: the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL. These devices finally gave more meaning behind the once-thought buzzword: AI. With Gemini leading the charge, the Pixel 9 series offers several on-device AI tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, and more powered by its Tensor G4 SoC.</p><p>We&apos;re now wondering how well Google can keep the train rolling. The Tensor G4 was a minimalistic upgrade over the G3; however, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g5-chip-testing-preparations">Tensor G5</a> is expected to be its first fully customized SoC out of TSMC&apos;s kitchen.</p>

It's the seemingly smallest update we've seen from the Android team yet, sporting a handful of new features with only a few that could be categorized as "headliners."</p><p>Many of the biggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> features are found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">October Feature Drop</a> for Pixel phones. While some of that has to do with Pixels catching up to other phones for feature parity, some of this signals a shift in Google's strategy.</p><p>Funny enough, our favorite new security features, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-new-remote-lock-tool-does-more-for-security-than-any-other-feature-from-google">new remote lock tool</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">theft prevention features</a> aren't even part of Android 15  —  those just so happen to coincide with the Android 15 release and are already available on all Android phones via Google Play Services. That's fine by me because it ensures more people get it <em>right now</em>, but it certainly doesn't help "sell" the Android 15 update.</p><p>So, what's different between Android 14 and Android 15? Not much, but that's probably OK.</p>
<h2 id="os-updates-are-becoming-less-important-2">OS updates are becoming less important</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NMKzfoCA9KYCgfxHqqEUJn" name="android-14-pixel-9-pro-xl-android-15-pixel-9-pro-fold-2.jpg" alt="Android 14 on Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and Android 15 on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NMKzfoCA9KYCgfxHqqEUJn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If there's any over-arching theme with Android 15, it's that base operating system updates are becoming less and less important. After years of being made fun of on stage during Apple's annual WWDC conference, Google modularized Android to put the onus for feature delivery on individual phone manufacturers instead of Google itself.</p><p>In other words, many of Android 15's new features might make you think, "Hey, that isn't new," if you aren't a Pixel user. It's a lot like how we poke fun at Apple for "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everything-the-iphone-16-and-apple-watch-series-10-stole-from-android">stealing features</a>" from Android phones each year.</p><p>Case in point, new Android 15 features like Private Space, the upgraded Bluetooth quick tile, a high-quality webcam for computers, multitasking enhancements for foldables, and true full-screen mode are all things found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> from Samsung, OnePlus, Motorola, and others.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Most new Android 15 features are probably already on your phone if you don't use a Pixel.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>OnePlus is unveiling its Android 15-based update, Oxygen OS 15, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-based-oxygenos-15-is-launching-sooner-than-you-think">on October 24</a>, while Motorola is already testing the update out for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-edge-50-fusion-gets-android-15-beta">a few lucky owners</a>. Samsung owners, meanwhile, will have to wait <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-wont-hit-beta-until-end-of-this-year">until the Galaxy S25 launches</a> to get the Android 15 update.</p><p>While news of having to wait months used to be a huge problem, users of all of these phones can feel content in the knowledge that most of the best Android 15 features are already on their phones thanks to feature-rich skins like Samsung's One UI, OnePlus's Oxygen OS, and Motorola's Hello UI.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rXSUQdURZW9sgRmzMZ2jjT" name="oxygenos-15.jpg" alt="OxygenOS 15 launch invite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rXSUQdURZW9sgRmzMZ2jjT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If I'm excited about any one category of new Android 15 features, it's the ones for foldables, but those, too, are already present on a number of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable devices</a>. A new continuity feature lets you use an app on the big screen, then close the phone and immediately continue using that app on the cover screen.</p><p>Another new feature allows you to save split-screen app combos and pin them to the taskbar so you can quickly launch them when you need them. There's also a new persistent taskbar option that makes foldables and tablets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/android-15s-new-tablet-features-get-me-one-step-closer-to-ditching-my-laptop-forever">a lot more like a laptop</a>.</p><p>Again, all of these features were already on many tablets and foldables, but their introduction into base Android 15 means that <em>all</em> foldables and tablets going forward should have these features.</p>
<h2 id="the-pixel-is-the-real-winner-2">The Pixel is the real winner</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sCjLTjsmraBP7RKK4F4x7N" name="continue-using-apps-settings-pixel-9-pro-fold-1.jpg" alt="Continue apps on cover screen settings panel on Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sCjLTjsmraBP7RKK4F4x7N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Being a Pixel owner has always meant that you get the latest version of Android first, and this time it means you get the <em>most</em> features from the Android 15 update. That's because Google launched Android 15 alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">October Feature Drop</a>.</p><p>Aside from the aforementioned Android 15 features, Pixel owners will get a new vibration intensity slider and adaptive haptics options to adjust vibration dynamically, haptic feedback on the brightness slider, a Gemini extension for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots app</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> on more Pixel devices, a new underwater photography mode in the camera, a new temperature sensor mode in the camera, upgrades to casting and media control sharing across Pixel devices, a new volume adjustment UI, and Instagram Night Sight mode for more Pixel devices.</p>
<p>Even the new partial screen recorder app might be Pixel exclusive for a while if your specific manufacturer of choice opts to use their own screen recording tool. We'll just have to wait and see what gets added to those individual phone updates.</p><p>In particular, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> is the biggest recipient of new features since it gets all the Android 15 features, everything from the October Pixel Feature Drop, and all the new foldable features. The lone exception is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> which got some new screensaver options in the form of Photo Frame, Clock Screensaver, and Smart Home Panel Screensaver.</p><p>Android 15 is easily the most boring update for the OS yet, but it also shows the heightened importance of individual manufacturer updates. What Google debuted on its Pixel phones will look significantly different from anything on a Motorola, Samsung, OnePlus, Vivo, or Oppo phone, but that's largely OK since Google is delivering the most important security features via Google Play Services to all existing Android phones, anyway.</p>

Setting the correct inter-pupillary distance, or IPD, is one of the key pillars of having a good VR experience. When your IPD is set incorrectly, it can cause nausea, headaches, and dizziness. It can also make it difficult to slice blocks accurately in Beat Saber because your brain can't deduce the proper distance between objects.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>'s IPD adjustment method is quite different from other VR headsets on the market, so we've put together this guide to help you find your ideal IPD preset as well as some hidden tricks to enable additional IPD settings. If you have a Meta Quest 2 (formerly known as the Oculus Quest 2), these steps will also work for that headset.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-measure-your-ipd-7">How to measure your IPD</h2>
<p>In order to measure your IPD, you'll need two things: a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Westcott-Non-Shatter-Ruler-Inches-13862/dp/B00309RVJ6/">ruler with millimeter markings</a>, and a mirror. Any ruler will work so long as it has millimeter markings, but you will want a hard ruler instead of a flimsy tape measure to ensure accuracy.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>While looking in the mirror, <strong>close your left eye</strong>.</li><li>Look straight into the mirror at your right eye <strong>with your right eye</strong>.</li><li>Hold the ruler just below your eye and center the <strong>zero marker</strong> on your right pupil.</li><li><strong>Close your right eye</strong> and <strong>open your left eye</strong>, making sure to not move the ruler.</li><li>Look into the mirror at your left eye <strong>with your left eye</strong>.</li><li>Look straight and <strong>note the millimeter distance</strong> that matches up to the center of your left pupil.</li></ol>

<p>Now that you have your IPD measured, you can accurately set the IPD on your Meta Quest 3S. You'll do this by physically sliding the lenses closer or further apart from one another. The Meta Quest 3S features three presets for IPD adjustment: preset 1 is 58mm, preset 2 is 63mm, and preset 3 is 68mm. By default, the Meta Quest 3S ships at IPD preset 2, which covers the average IPD.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="B5TbKFZYw8FCZsRWoQQGNB" name="Meta-Quest-3S-lenses-angle" alt="Looking at the lenses inside a Meta Quest 3S headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5TbKFZYw8FCZsRWoQQGNB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If your IPD isn't exactly 58mm, 63mm, or 68mm, don't worry. Meta has designed the lenses on the Meta Quest 3S to help fit a range of IPD, but while one of those presets will fit nicely for most people, some folks will find they need a setting in between.</p><p>The trick is to gently move the lenses between presets and stop somewhere between the preset point.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>While holding the Meta Quest 3S, <strong>grab ahold of the gray plastic</strong> on the outside of one lens.</li><li>Gently push the lens in toward the other to <strong>lower IPD</strong> or push them apart to <strong>raise IPD</strong>.</li><li>Try to <strong>push just past</strong> preset 1 or preset 2 to get a more accurate IPD.</li><li>If you're having trouble pushing past, try pushing the lenses inward <strong>from a higher IPD preset</strong> instead.</li></ol>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S still only supports a maximum IPD range of 58-68mm, but using the spaces between presets can help folks who have IPD between the numbers. For instance, someone with an IPD of 60 or 61 might try the space between preset 1 and preset 2. Someone like me who has an IPD of 66 can try the space between preset 2 and preset 3 for a more comfortable experience.</p>

<p>FNTCASE is a lesser-known brand but I have tried and tested its rugged cases and found them satisfactory. The brand's Samsung Galaxy S24 FE Case with Kickstand & Holster comes in some really cool hues. I especially love the purple variant. You get a built-in screen guard, tough layers for hardcore impact absorption, grippy scored sides, a kickstand, and even a holster!</p></p>

<h2 id="you-don-apos-t-need-a-bulky-case-to-protect-your-galaxy-s24-fe-2">You don&apos;t need a bulky case to protect your Galaxy S24 FE</h2>
<p>I&apos;m really glad that the best cases for the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE are from reliable brands. Every option in this roundup comes from tried and tested case makers, so you can choose anything from this list and feel confident in your choice.</p><p>Picking the right case depends on a lot of factors. Most people want good drop protection without bulking up their phones. Of course, price plays a vital role as well. All things considered, the Caseology Parallax is the best case for the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE. It&apos;s one heck of a good-looking case and comes in attractive colors. More importantly, it is budget-friendly, drop-proof, and thin enough to be used with a wireless charger. The textured sides add grip, preventing accidental slips and drops.</p><p>Functionality is something else that you might prioritize. If you want your Galaxy S24 FE case to add more functionality to your device, you should consider something that adds MagSafe support. MagSafe is a gateway. Even if the case doesn&apos;t have a stand, you can slap on a stand, grip, or any other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe accessory</a> whenever you like.</p><p>Depending on how you use your phone, both the Spigen Tough Armor MagFit and TOCOL Magnetic Samsung Galaxy S24 FE Case are solid choices that add MagSafe support to your phone. TOCOL&apos;s offering is rather slim and comes in a couple of translucent hues, so you might like it more if you prefer a lightweight or stylish case. On the other hand, Spigen&apos;s build quality is top-notch and adds heavy-duty drop protection. If you&apos;re a clumsy individual, the Spigen Tough Armor MagFit is better suited for your S24 FE.
