If you felt it was a bit pricey before given the performance and features on offer, this Prime Day deal might make you reconsider. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4FYBKHH"><strong>Pad can be yours for $369.99 when you use your Prime account,</strong></a><strong> </strong>which is a significant drop from its usual price of $479.99. A 22% discount might not seem too crazy given some of the other deals we&apos;ve seen, but it is the cheapest the tablet has ever been on Amazon. </p>

<p>The OnePlus Pad hits its lowest ever price on Amazon during Prime Day, but you have to be a member to enjoy the savings. Grab it for $369.99, which is a cool 22% off from its original price of $479.99.  </p>
<p>The OnePlus Pad has a gorgeous design, premium aluminum chassis, and a beautiful 144Hz 11.61-inch display with Dolby Vision playback. It's upgradable to Android 14 and features four speakers for a good experience. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4FYBKHH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="87474012-04ec-4a36-867b-1f248db1d349" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$479.99" data-dimension48="$479.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a unqiue design; you need very good speakers; you need a good front camera for video calls; you want good performance. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a tablet for productivity; you want a wider selection of accessories; you want a lightweight tablet.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a> is a crackling first attempt at a tablet, and is OnePlus&apos; way of completing its product ecosystem. Launched in early 2023, the Pad is a breath of fresh air with its unique design placing the rear camera in the center, alluring color, and impressive display. Its sleek rounded edges and aluminum build makes it a joy to hold, but not for long since it&apos;s quite heavy. </p><p>It&apos;s not on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablet</a> list though, and that&apos;s for a reason. When we reviewed it, the software wasn&apos;t up to the mark. We felt the OS simply wasn&apos;t optimized for the Dimensity 9000 SoC, even though it&apos;s a fairly powerful chip. Many software features were also missing to really take advantage of the large screen when multitasking. OnePlus has been rolling out updates for the Pad, though, the most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1560530178914910217">recent one</a> being in March 2024. We&apos;re about to get its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-design-leaked-in-renders">successor</a> soon on July 16, but that&apos;s no doubt going to be way pricier. </p><p>Not convinced about the OnePlus Pad? Not to worry. There are plenty of other great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/prime-day-tablet-deals-2024">Android tablet deals this Prime Day</a>, so take some time and check them all before pulling the trigger. </p>

But, like a phone, it doesn&apos;t ship with a protective case in the box. Thankfully, my favorite Boox Palma case from Tudia is on sale <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TUDIA-Reinforced-Anti-Yellowing-Transparent-Lightweight/dp/B0D2QDN3SX/"><strong>for just $17</strong></a> on Prime Day.</p><p>Onyx makes official cases for the Palma that have a powdery finish but I find that those are a bit too slippery for my liking. These silicone gel cases from Tudia add some necessary grip to the e-reader without adding any substantial weight. Plus, they have padded corners and multiple colors to choose from. What&apos;s not to like?</p>

<p>Keep your Onyx Boox Palma e-reader protected and safe with Tudia's stylish SKN case. It's a flexible silicone gel case that adds almost no weight to your Palma, feels great in your hands, and even features padded corners for extra drop protection. Plus, with this <strong>30% off deal</strong>, you'll save plenty of money while protecting your favorite new e-reader.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/TUDIA-Reinforced-Anti-Yellowing-Transparent-Lightweight/dp/B0D2QDN3SX/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="be1c1a95-e1e9-45a8-af3d-b67ef7eed633" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Tudia SKN case for Onyx Boox Palma: $24.99" data-dimension48="Tudia SKN case for Onyx Boox Palma: $24.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>You love your Palma and don&apos;t want it to take damage if you accidentally drop it. Tudia ships this one in several different colors, too, so you can choose a nice style for your e-reader and keep it protected at the same time.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You prefer to prop up your Palma with a kickstand or something similar. The Palma is a small e-reader, anyway, but some folks might want a kickstand — something this case doesn&apos;t have.</p>
<hr>
<p>So while I&apos;ll note that this doesn&apos;t have a kickstand or some way to prop the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Boox Palma</a> up, I&apos;ve never found a reason to do this with the Palma. That&apos;s because it&apos;s already a small e-reader — the size of most phones — and has never felt burdensome in my hands the way larger e-readers can.</p><p>Tudia&apos;s cases are super protective and add an important layer of grip to the Palma, something that&apos;s sorely needed with the matte plastic sides. While I love the texture of the back of the Palma, I&apos;ve found it doesn&apos;t do too much to add grip while holding it in a reading position.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking to keep the Palma looking the way it came but add a bit of shine, I recommend the Clear Glitter Tudia SKN colorway. It adds a bit of mystique to the already wonderful device and gives it an eye-catching look it otherwise doesn&apos;t have.</p>

<p>Prime Day ends at midnight tonight, so you only have a few more hours to score a whopping 43% off the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-review">Sony WH-1000XM4</a>, an outstanding — albeit slightly dated — pair of wireless headphones that boast customizable noise cancellation and loads of battery life. </p>
<p>Sony's newer flagship headphones, the XM5, are also seeing a nice <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH"><strong>25% discount</strong></a> during Prime Day, but I'd argue that you're getting a lot more bang for the buck with these last-gen cans. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-Phone-Call/dp/B08MVGF24M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2637b889-9aa9-4252-9b72-1e12a31c76fc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$348" data-dimension48="$348">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a pair of comfortable, great-sounding wireless headphones with powerful noise cancellation and customizable audio through the companion app.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re particular about your audio and you can afford the Sony WH-1000XM5; you don&apos;t want headphones from 2020; you&apos;re apparently like me and prefer to buy tech at the worst possible time.</p><p>Audiophiles may come after me and argue that the Sony XM5 are a better purchase this Prime Day, but as someone who is frequently listening to music, I could barely tell the difference when I compared the sound quality of the XM4 to the newer model. If you have a spare $100 to spend, sure, go with the new model before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2024-dates-early-deals-and-what-to-expect-from-the-sale">Prime Day deals</a> end, but everyone else should be more than happy with the Sony XM4. </p>

<p>The noise cancellation on the XM4 works great, with multiple settings that allow you to finetune the exact amount of background noise that you want to let through. You also get up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge (I use mine every day and I haven&apos;t juiced them up in over a week) and the sound quality is warm and bass-heavy, just how I like it.</p><p>I&apos;ve had a few issues with device pairing and over-ear headphones may not be for everyone, but I have no regrets when it comes to buying the Sony WH-1000XM4. My only regret is that I didn&apos;t wait until Prime Day to buy them.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Look, most Android TV boxes suck; they either don&apos;t have the requisite codecs, have issues with rendering HDR, or tend to be laggy. I used products that had all three drawbacks, but that was before the Shield TV Pro; NVIDIA somehow managed to create the ultimate Android TV streaming box, and I liked it so much I ended up buying three.</p><p>Like every year, the Shield TV Pro is down to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM">customary $169 asking price</a> for Prime Day, and if you haven&apos;t made the switch yet, I highly recommend it. But if you don&apos;t want to pay that much and are interested in considering an alternative, you should pick up Mecool&apos;s KM2 Plus Deluxe. It usually retails for $149, but it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D62YKJ2S/">available for $119</a> at the moment — you&apos;ll need to use the 20% coupon on the page.</p><p>The KM2 Plus Deluxe also runs Android TV based on Android 11, and while I was wary of the brand at the beginning — I used way too many shoddy streaming boxes — it turned out to be pretty great. I set it up with the bedroom projector a month ago, and I didn&apos;t run into any issues. </p>

<p>The KM2 Plus Deluxe has the best features of the Shield TV Pro; it's fluid in daily use, has full-fledged Android TV 11.0, and does a great job with HDR content. You get AV1 decode as well, and the best part is the affordability.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D62YKJ2S/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c8802606-57d9-46a9-aeae-dc584946f61f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Mecool KM2 Plus Deluxe: $149" data-dimension48="Mecool KM2 Plus Deluxe: $149">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need a powerful Android TV box that handles HDR and AV1. The KM2 Plus is lag-free in daily use, and there are considerable savings over the Shield TV Pro.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want Dolby Vision, and don&apos;t like the bloated interface of Android TV.</p>
<p>Setting up the KM2 Plus Deluxe is similar to other Android TV boxes, and there are no feature omissions. It comes with 4GB of RAM, and the interface is just about the most fluid out of any Android TV device I used. You get access to the Play Store, it handles HDR content really well, and there&apos;s AV1 decode. However, there&apos;s no Dolby Vision. </p><p>Just like the Shield TV Pro, you get a standard HDMI port alongside USB-A and Ethernet connectors, so you can plug in an external drive to the KM2 Plus Deluxe with relative ease. Given that it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D62YKJ2S/">down to just $119</a>, I suggest giving it a try if you want a powerful Android TV box.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-prime-day-2024-2">When is Prime Day 2024?</h2>
<p>Prime Day 2024 kicked off on July 16th and ends <strong>tonight (3 am EDT/12 am PDT)</strong>. Prices will go back up once everything is done so today is your last day to score big savings. Competing retailers are also hosting rival deals during Prime Day, and we&apos;re sharing that news as it becomes available, too. </p>
<h2 id="what-tv-deals-can-i-expect-during-prime-day-2">What TV deals can I expect during Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Amazon&apos;s Prime Day sale is arguably the best time of the year to buy a new smart TV. Mainstream brands from LG and Samsung to Insignia and others have dropped historic discounts on their most popular models, so now is the time to buy. </p>
<h2 id="do-you-have-to-have-amazon-prime-to-get-prime-day-deals-2">Do you have to have Amazon Prime to get Prime Day deals?</h2>
<p>Prime Day is reserved exclusively for Prime members, so if you want to take part in the sale, you&apos;ll need to sign up. Fortunately, Amazon offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>30-day free trial</strong></a> that you can cancel at any time, so if you don&apos;t want to join for good, you could feasibly sign up on July 1st, enjoy all of the Prime Day festivities, and cancel once the sale ends without paying a dime. </p><p>If you don&apos;t want to join Prime or take advantage of the free trial, the good news is that many of Amazon&apos;s biggest competitors are offering rival sales that run concurrent to Prime Day without requiring a membership. Needless to say, we&apos;re sharing <em>all </em>of the best deals from across the web.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-look-for-in-a-smart-tv-2">What should I look for in a smart TV?</h2>
<p>When you&apos;re shopping for smart TVs, you&apos;ll immediately notice that manufacturers throw a bunch of impressive-sounding jargon in your face to make their models seem more appealing. Some of this information is <em>actually </em>important, while other details are just filling space. To cut through the noise, we&apos;ve gathered a few of the most important things to worry about when making your final decision. </p>
<ul><li><strong>1. Resolution: </strong>Although TVs with 8K resolution are starting to be released, they're quite expensive, and most TV shows and films aren't made to support that resolution anyway. For now, you can save some money and have a nearly-identical experience by going with a 4K TV. If you want all of your favorite shows and films to look as good as possible, look for a set with 4K upscaling.  </li><li><strong>2. Refresh rate:</strong> To put it simply, a TV's refresh rate will affect how smooth and lifelike moving images appear on your display, whether you're watching live sports or playing video games. 60Hz is generally fine for smaller TVs, but 120Hz is even better, especially if your TV is larger than 60 inches. Some TVs may even come with a game optimization mode that boosts the refresh rate up to 240Hz. </li><li><strong>3. OLED vs. LCD: </strong>Despite all of the many proprietary varieties touted by manufacturers (QLED, ULED, etc), all you need to know is that smart TVs are broken down into two categories: LCD and OLED. LCD technology is generally found in more-affordable TVs and looks pretty great most of the time. If you can afford it, however, OLED makes a big difference in larger TVs, with consistently richer colors and better contrast. Technologies such as Samsung's "QLED" and Hisense's "ULED" are basically just marketing terms used to describe the companies' proprietary takes on LCD. Rule of thumb: if you have over $1,000 to spend on a TV, go OLED; otherwise, an LCD with 4K support should be just fine. </li><li><strong>4. Price: </strong>Smart TVs are some of the only pieces of tech that haven't gotten more expensive in recent years. Depending on the size you need, you could probably get away with spending $500 or less on a great 4K TV for your home. Don't be fooled by all of the high-tech jargon: as long as the reviews seem consistent and the TV comes with 4K resolution, a refresh rate over 60Hz, and three or four HDMI ports, you should be all set. </li></ul>
<h2 id="what-size-smart-tv-should-i-get-2">What size smart TV should I get?</h2>
<p>If you&apos;re trying to figure out which size TV you should buy, the first thing to know is that the size of a TV is determined by measuring one corner of the screen to another. Take a tape measure and hold it "corner to corner" in the space you&apos;re hoping to place your new smart TV and consider how far away you&apos;ll be sitting from the screen. For example, if you&apos;re sitting around six feet away from your TV screen, a 50-inch to 70-inch TV should be sufficient.</p>

<p>Not to sound overly dramatic, but I was actually shocked when I saw that Amazon was carving a straight $150 off the unlocked <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus (2024)</a> during Prime Day. After all, this is a cutting-edge foldable phone that won't even hit store shelves until July 24th. </p>
<p>Perhaps Samsung's biggest challenger of 2024, the "perfect" Razr Plus (2024) is cheaper, boasts an arguably better folding hinge, and has a larger, better-looking cover display than the Galaxy Z Flip 6. </p>

<p>The Edge Plus (2023) was arguably the best phone Motorola produced last year, with a gorgeous (and PWM-friendly) 165Hz display, reliable two-day battery, and the efficiency of a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor. Grab the phone unlocked during Prime Day, and you'll instantly enjoy a 38% discount, no strings attached. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2W7YYHM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="73bd410e-8f75-4634-b96c-73fa29da1e9d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>The Moto G Play (2024) isn't going to win any awards for its hardware, but it has all the basics, such as 4GB of RAM, a Snapdragon processor, and a large 5,000mAh battery that should last a full day with ease.

<p>If you don't mind last year's foldable, you can enjoy a lot of bang for your buck by checking out Motorola's Razr Plus (2023), <em>especially</em> when you pair it with a 40% discount during Prime Day. This clamshell device boasts two pOLED displays, a Snapdragon chipset, and a versatile hinge that's been built to withstand up to 400,000 folds.

Thankfully, companies like Spigen make magnetic rings that stick to the back of your phone or phone&apos;s case and add MagSafe capability to Android <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Magnetic-MagSafe-Compatibility-Compatibility-Non-MagSafe/dp/B0BYMJ3M29/"><strong>for just $15.97</strong></a> on Prime Day!</p><p>I&apos;ve got several of these Spigen MagSafe rings on phones around my house and it&apos;s amazing how such a simple little tool can add so much to your phone. The ring sticks to your phone or case with simple adhesive, and Spigen is kind enough to ship it with an alignment tool to help center it on the wireless charging coil inside your phone.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-deal"><span>The deal</span></h3>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="47d36dd4-e48b-4979-9608-88e7aa8dd68c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Spigen MagSafe ring: $29" data-dimension48="Spigen MagSafe ring: $29" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Magnetic-MagSafe-Compatibility-Compatibility-Non-MagSafe/dp/B0BYMJ3M29/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1104px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:103.62%;"><img id="ah4sKYu8ncR3W9DWzxfRAX" name="spigen-magfit-magsafe-pixel-7-pro-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ah4sKYu8ncR3W9DWzxfRAX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1104" height="1144" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Spigen MagSafe ring: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Magnetic-MagSafe-Compatibility-Compatibility-Non-MagSafe/dp/B0BYMJ3M29/" data-dimension112="47d36dd4-e48b-4979-9608-88e7aa8dd68c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Spigen MagSafe ring: $29" data-dimension48="Spigen MagSafe ring: $29"><del>$29</del> <strong>$15 at Amazon</strong></a></p>
<p>Add MagSafe to any Android phone with this little ring and be amazed at how easy it is to use wireless charging or any MagSafe accessory like rings or stands. Plus, <strong>half off </strong>for Prime Day is a slick deal you won't often find!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Magnetic-MagSafe-Compatibility-Compatibility-Non-MagSafe/dp/B0BYMJ3M29/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="47d36dd4-e48b-4979-9608-88e7aa8dd68c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Spigen MagSafe ring: $29" data-dimension48="Spigen MagSafe ring: $29">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>You love wireless charging or have just always wanted to use the plethora of MagSafe accessories available. Installation is easy thanks to Spigen&apos;s included mounting plate, and there&apos;s nothing quite like being able to stick your phone to any compatible MagSafe adapter or ring.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You use a phone without a case. While it does work on some phones without a case, most phones these days feature some kind of matte coating on the back that doesn&apos;t work well with the adhesive. You can get around this by applying a Dbrand skin to the phone first, then put the MagSafe ring on after.</p>

<p>Like many other similar products, Spigen&apos;s MagSafe ring adapter sticks to your phone with adhesive. This means it works perfectly for any case or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dbrand-leather-skin-review">Dbrand skin</a>, but may not stick well to a naked phone. I&apos;ve tried adding the ring to lots of new phones without a case and it seldom works because many phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> sport a matte texture on the back instead of smooth glass.</p><p>But so long as you&apos;ve already got a case on your phone or use a Dbrand skin, the ring works perfectly. In fact, it&apos;s probably the best accessory I&apos;ve ever added to a phone. It allows your phone to work with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">best MagSafe accessories</a> for just a few bucks.</p>

<hr>
<p>After a down period, smartphone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">shipments</a> seem to be steadily on the rise worldwide, according to preliminary results from the second quarter of 2024. The year has seen the smartphone market rebound globally, as firms <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52436724" target="_blank">International Data Corporation (IDC)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-market-q2-2024" target="_blank">Canalys</a> documented. The overall smartphone market grew by 12% year-over-year, hitting 288 million units, Canalys reports.</p><p>The top five companies in terms of global shipments grew 6.5% on their own, according to IDC. Samsung led the pack with a 19.8% market share in Q2 2024, closely followed by Apple at 15.8%. Xiaomi, Vivo, and Oppo rounded out the leaderboard in that order. However, the difference between Vivo and Oppo&apos;s market share was roughly 0.1%, meaning that the two companies were statistically tied for fourth place. </p><p>Though Apple and Samsung were the market leaders once again, the companies didn&apos;t see significant growth last quarter. Samsung grew just 0.7% year-over-year, while Apple grew 1.5% year-over-year. The biggest climber was Xiaomi, which shipped 27.4% more phones in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:592px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.09%;"><img id="BiyPSXT29iNoHYoKJaUWKd" name="IDC Worldwide Smartphone Market Grew 6.5% in the Second Quarter of 2024 as Momentum Continues to Build, According to IDC Tracker - 2024 Jul -F-1.png" alt="The smartphone shipments results for Q2 2024 from IDC." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BiyPSXT29iNoHYoKJaUWKd.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="592" height="486" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: IDC)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung and Apple have been vigorously competing for the top spot, and there&apos;s a bit of separation between those two companies and Xiaomi in third. Another large gap separates Xiaomi from Vivo and Oppo, which round out the top five in global shipments. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="UMnJHVVj3W7M4wubLMgk9V" name="Calaysis-Q22024-Results.png" alt="The Q2 2024 smartphone shipments results from Canalys." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UMnJHVVj3W7M4wubLMgk9V.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="506" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Canalys)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Canalys&apos; report shows that there was significant growth by companies outside the top five. For what it&apos;s worth, Canalys lists Transsion as the fifthmost leader in smartphone shipments. These smaller and growing brands are giving leaders like Samsung a run for its money in emerging markets.</p><p>"Since early 2024, easing inflation in emerging markets across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America has stimulated shipment growth in the mass-market price segment," said Canalys analyst Sheng Win Chow. "Companies, including Xiaomi and Transsion, are actively promoting product upgrades to capitalize on these opportunities. Meanwhile, Honor, Oppo, and Vivo are focusing their expansion outside Mainland China this year as competition in the domestic market is heating up.” </p><p>Regardless, it&apos;s clear that Samsung has had immense success this year so far, on the heels of Galaxy AI software features and new flagship devices. The company moved a total of 54.9 million units last quarter alone.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve talked at length about how Samsung could, and should, be doing more to innovate in the smartphone market. This year&apos;s Galaxy S24 Ultra was an impressive phone with a tiny asterisk since it had aging cameras that are starting to fall behind Apple and Google&apos;s competing sensors. The same story became true just recently when the company announced its new foldables, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6. </p><p>Both of those phones are relatively minor upgrades, save for the Z Flip 6&apos;s new main camera sensor and the Z Fold 6&apos;s wider cover screen. Samsung neglected to improve the Galaxy Z Fold 6&apos;s rear camera system for the second year in a row, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-new-galaxy-z-fold-6">which is why I said I wouldn&apos;t buy it</a>. </p><p>So, how is Samsung the global phone shipments leader despite these common criticisms about its strategy? Well, it&apos;s important to remember that we won&apos;t see the impact of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6 in the above results. These figures are from Q2 2024, meaning they are largely including sales from the Galaxy S24 lineup and Samsung&apos;s A-series budget devices. Those low-end devices are key, because Samsung sells quite a bit of budget and midrange phones in emerging markets around the world. </p><p>However, according to the analysts, it&apos;s artificial intelligence that may be driving the company&apos;s success. Samsung started shipping a full Galaxy AI suite of software features this year, and some of these features run on-device.</p><p>"There is lots of excitement in the smartphone market today thanks to higher average selling prices (ASPs) and the buzz created by Gen AI smartphones," said Nabila Popal, who is a senior research director for IDC, "which are expected to grow faster than any mobile innovation we have seen to date and forecast to capture 19% of the market with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blogs.idc.com/2024/07/05/the-rise-of-gen-ai-smartphones/">234 million</a> shipments this year."</p><p>Google is also selling Pixels with AI features, and Apple will follow up with Apple Intelligence later this year. However, Samsung has had the advantage of being first with a lot of key features and services. For example, Google&apos;s flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search feature</a> debuted on Galaxy devices first before later coming to its own Pixel lineup. </p><p>While many are waiting for the AI bubble to burst, the experts say the hype drives smartphone shipment growth in 2024. The reception and sales figures related to the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> foldables might give us an idea of whether this kind of growth is sustainable. </p>

Back when Amazon launched the Kindle Scribe, I had mixed feelings. While the e-reader slash E Ink tablet is a good product for reading and writing, the launch price was too high. Thanks to this Prime Day deal though, the Kindle Scribe is finally worth buying. Amazon knocked a neat 31% off the price tag, bringing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/dp/B09BS26B8B/"><strong>Kindle Scribe down to a lowly $234.99</strong></a>. That saves you a whole $100 and some change to spare!</p><p>The Kindle Scribe is a large, eye-friendly 10.3-inch tablet that runs Amazon&apos;s proprietary Kindle software based on Android. You can read books and comics, listen to audiobooks, take notes, sketch, and even annotate documents on the Scribe.

<p>There's nothing like a Kindle when it comes to reading, so one that comes with a stylus for handwriting input is twice as awesome as a regular one. Amazon priced the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">Kindle Scribe</a> out of contention, but this deal brings it back to the top of the best e-readers and E Ink tablets that money can buy.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/dp/B09BS26B8B/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ae2235f7-89e8-482d-b761-1f84d106a354" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Kindle Scribe: $339.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Kindle Scribe: $339.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want stylus support, weeks upon weeks of battery life, and a large B&W e-paper display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want access to Android apps on the Play Store and prefer color e-paper devices.</p><p>Just like any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">great E Ink tablet</a>, the Amazon Kindle Scribe has a gorgeous e-paper display that looks just like real books and consumes very little power. The display is what makes a Kindle so stunning, because Amazon&apos;s e-paper screens are extremely crisp and lovely to look at. The 10.2-inch display is just the right size, neither too big nor too small. You can choose from 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB storage options.</p><p>On top of that, the Kindle Scribe lasts for weeks on a single charge and comes with a USB Type-C port. You can choose to get the Basic Pen or the Premium Pen with your Kindle Scribe, but keep in mind that the latter drives up the tablet&apos;s price. Unlike some of the other recently released Kindle models, the Amazon Kindle Scribe does not have water resistance.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for an E Ink tablet with unrestricted access to the Google Play Store and maybe a color e-paper display, try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/EA802706-DFB1-4B56-8561-059B6BAFC95A">Onyx Boox</a> instead.</p>
