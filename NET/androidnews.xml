Things only get better with this awesome Prime Day deal that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J9NQHL"><strong>knocks $100 off the Razr 2024</strong></a>, bringing the price to an all-new low of just $599.99. We praised the Razr 2024 for having a fabulously large outer display, good battery life, and solid app and gaming performance. If you&apos;re waiting to get your first foldable but the high prices have been putting you off, this superb <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-motorola-deals-have-come-early-score-40-off-foldable-phones-epic-flagship-discounts-and-more">Motorola deal</a> on the very capable Razr 2024 is the best entry way.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr (2024) hadn't seen many great discounts until this Prime Day came along. The Razr was priced pretty well to begin with, but this $100 off deal makes it an even more attractive buy. Best to grab it quick before stock runs out!</p>
<p>Unlike the 2023 Razr, the 2024 model gets a massive makeover with the larger outer display, premium vegan-leather finish, great battery life, and a more versatile ultrawide camera. You don't have to pony-up the premium for the Razr Plus anymore as this model should have enough to satisfy the needs of most users.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J9NQHL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6d36819c-7c87-47fc-b8e5-3e4845538e43" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Motorola Razr 2024: $699.99" data-dimension48="Motorola Razr 2024: $699.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>You want an affordable folding phone; you want good gaming performance; you want to use apps on the cover screen.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>Timely software updates are important to you; you need flagship-grade cameras.</p><p>Finding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best folding phone</a> under $1,000 in the U.S. is slim pickings, unless you&apos;re willing to buy something without warranty or support. The Motorola Razr 2023 was one of the few foldables that fit the criteria, but with some severe handicaps. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">2024 Motorola Razr</a> though took us all by surprise as it got many premium features from the previous-gen&apos;s &apos;plus&apos; version, but at the same great price. The massive 3.6-inch outer display lets you apps in fullscreen, making it even more functional than the Galaxy Z Flip 6 which costs nearly double.</p><p>Other than a few software teething issues when we initially tested it, the Razr 2024 has a great in-hand feel thanks to the vegan-leather trim, the processor is more than capable for handling the day-to-day and gaming duties, battery life is good, and the 13MP ultrawide camera now has autofocus so you can capture macro shots of tiny subjects too.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>MediaTek has announced the new Dimensity 9400 SoC, its fourth annual flagship chip built on Arm v9.2 CPU architecture.</li><li>It uses 1x Arm Cortex-X925 (3.62GHz), 3x Cortex-X4 (3.3GHz), and 4x Cortex-A720 (2.4GHz) cores, with 35% and 28% faster single- and multi-core performance.</li><li>The 12-core Immortalis-G925 GPU has 41% boosted performance and 44% improved efficiency.</li><li>The new NPU offers 80% faster LLM prompts and 100% diffusion generation performance.</li></ul>
<p>MediaTek has announced the specs for its fourth-gen flagship SoC, the Dimensity 9400. With Qualcomm set to announce its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4-leak-illuminated-specs-storage-speeds">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> later this month, MediaTek is laying down its own AI-focused challenge now.</p><p>While the last-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-launch">Dimensity 9300</a> topped out at 3.25GHz with its four Cortex-X3 cores, the Dimensity 9400 has one 3.62GHz core and three Cortex-X4s clocked slightly higher at 3.3GHz. The biggest gap is more subtle: MediaTek uses the same Cortex-A720 efficiency chips, but clocked at 2.4GHz instead of 2.0GHz.</p><p>The chip uses TSMC N3E processes technology and is up to 40% more power efficient at hitting last year&apos;s top benchmarks. The new Arm Immortalis-G925 is also 44% more power efficient.</p><p>Aside from the expected CPU gains, the Dimensity 9400 offers a 100% L2 Cache increase and 50% L3 Cache increase, as well as the new LPDDR5X memory interface for up to 10.7 Gbps. This should all help the Dimensity 9400 perform better in areas like loading times without relying as much on RAM.</p><p>MediaTek claims that the CPU hits 3,055 / 9,600 for single- and multi-core benchmark tests in Geekbench 6.2, or 2.8 million for AnTuTu performance.</p>

<p>The most intriguing change comes with a new NPU, which supports its new "Agentic AI engine." According to MediaTek, it&apos;s the "first mobile chipset to offer on-device LoRA training" (Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models) and "high-quality on-device video generation." It offers 50 tokens per second and is 80% faster at LLM prompts than the Dimensity 9300.</p><p>The Dimensity Agentic AI Engine is a bit confusing for laymen, but essentially it&apos;s a framework to standardize how mobile AI applications work, both on-device and in the cloud; in the latter case, MediaTek plans to create an "Agentic Apps Store" in the cloud where mobile OEMs can access certain AI processes. </p><p>"The MediaTek Dimensity 9400 will continue furthering our mission to be the enablers of AI, supporting powerful applications that anticipate users&apos; needs and adapt to their preferences," says MediaTek President Joe Chen. "The Dimensity 9400 continues to build on our momentum of steady growth in market share."</p><p>During a MediaTek presentation, VP of Global Marketing Finbarr Moynihan explained that while the company&apos;s primary sales are in China, customers like Xiaomi and Oppo have expanded into Europe, leading to 30% market share and 50% year-over-year growth. </p><p>Samsung will use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">MediaTek 9300 Plus</a> flagship chip in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 series</a> for the first time, which felt like a major win for MediaTek over Qualcomm and makes us wonder if we&apos;ll see the Dimensity 9400 in more global devices as well.</p><p>Running through the rest of the Dimensity 9400 specs, it has a new 4nm Wi-Fi / Bluetooth chip (as opposed to two separate chips) that&apos;s 50% more power efficient, support for Qi-Fi 7 tri-band MLO, and support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-tri-fold-phone-intrigues-me">tri-fold smartphones</a>; we&apos;ve seen more multi-fold phone concepts in recent months, and MediaTek wants their business.</p>

<p>The 256GB variant offers enough storage for most people, so you don't have to rely on cloud storage alone. The S23 FE is one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> as it has all the essential features like a large AMOLED screen, IP68 rating, wireless charging, a telephoto rear camera, and solid performance. It will even get four years of OS upgrades.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CD8YMKWC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="3f38afa8-60d5-4049-b5f2-904a5323b03d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S23 FE: $659.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S23 FE: $659.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> You want flagship Samsung features at a low price; you&apos;re happy with four years of updates; you need a dedicated telephoto camera.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>You want the latest FE edition phone; you want a larger display; you want longer support for updates.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S23 FE</a> wasn&apos;t the easiest to recommend when it launched as it  came at a time with the Pixel 8 was just around the corner and the S23 was already getting heavy discounts, in the run up to the S24. Nearly a year later, the Galaxy S23 FE is in a great position as its price is lower, which is what it should have been, and this Prime Day Deal on the 256GB variant makes it a deal hard to pass up. You can expect a superb 120Hz AMOLED display, premium build quality, IP68 waterproofing, wireless charging, and the full arsenal of rear cameras which includes a 3x telephoto camera. </p><p>Samsung has just launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> which comes with the usual expected upgrades like a faster processor and bigger battery, but more notably it will now be eligible for seven years of OS and security updates. It&apos;s priced rather terribly though, just like the S23 FE, putting it in close quarters with the Galaxy S24. The S24 FE will eventually be a great buy sometime next year, when the prices drop to what it should have been to begin with. Till then, we feel the Galaxy S23 FE is still a very good option to consider, especially with these amazing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-early-samsung-galaxy-deals-phones-tablets-and-more">Samsung Galaxy Prime Day deals</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Microsoft has issued a final update for the Surface Duo 2 as it nears its end of life on October 21.</li><li>The Surface Duo 2 is wrapping up after receiving just one Android OS update, moving from Android 11 to 12L.</li><li>The discontinuation of the Surface Duo line aligns with Microsoft's strategy to streamline its Surface products, especially following Panos Panay's departure last year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As the Microsoft Surface Duo 2 approaches its end of life, the company has rolled out a final update for the device.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/phones/the-surface-duo-is-dead-microsoft-pulls-plug-on-usd1-500-surface-duo-2-after-just-one-android-os-upgrade" target="_blank">Windows Central</a> reports that Microsoft has released a final security patch for the Surface Duo 2, as it gears up for the device&apos;s end of life on October 21, as per the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/surface-duo/surface-lifecycle-android-devices" target="_blank">website</a>.</p><p>The Surface Duo 2&apos;s last hurrah comes after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/microsoft-ends-support-surface-duo">its predecessor was discontinued last year</a>. As noted by Windows Central, the Duo 2 received only one Android OS update, moving from Android 11 to the larger screen-friendly Android 12L.</p><p>In contrast to the Surface Duo 2, users of the Surface Duo enjoyed a better experience, seeing their devices upgrade from Android 10 to Android 11 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-12l-update-microsoft-surface-duo">and then to Android 12L</a>.</p><p>When stacked against today’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">leading Android phones</a>, the Surface Duo 2’s lifespan falls short. Some Android brands, like Google and Samsung, are currently providing up to seven years of platform updates.</p><p>After launching the Surface Duo 2 in October 2021, Microsoft promised three years of software updates for the device. While the company kept its word with the Android 12 update in October 2022, it hasn&apos;t delivered any significant updates since then for Duo 2 users.</p><p>Microsoft&apos;s entry into the Android foldable market kicked off with the original Surface Duo in 2020 after years of development. Instead of the typical single flexible screen, the company opted for a dual-screen design that didn’t have an external display.</p><p>While the first-gen Surface Duo boasted impressive build quality and some innovative features, it struggled to find commercial success due to issues with camera quality and software.</p><p>Launched at $1,500, the Surface Duo 2 faced many of the same hurdles as its predecessor, such as poor battery life and hit-or-miss camera performance.</p><p>Microsoft&apos;s choice to end support for the second-gen Surface Duo fits into its larger plan to slim down its Surface device lineup. This decision comes almost a year after Panos Panay, the former head of Windows and Surface, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/panos-panay-might-be-joining-amazon">left the company</a>. With the Surface Duo line officially wrapped up, it looks like Microsoft has no plans to bring it back.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Smart rings are all the rage right now, and Oura has pretty much led the pack with its impressive Oura Ring Gen 3. The ring launched in 2021, inspiring tons of other companies to make their own versions. Now, in 2024, the company has launched the Oura Ring 4, which features plenty of upgrades over its predecessor and an improved design. However, if you&apos;re thinking you should just get the latest model, you might wanna consider this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSRBWPKY">Prime Day deal</a> on the best Oura Ring Gen 3 style instead.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> comes in two styles, with the Heritage starting at $299 and Horizon starting at $349. However, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">Prime Day</a> deal brings the newer Horizon model down to $299 for the silver and black colorways, and depending on the size, you can even find the ring for as low as $280. </p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="b3d9b551-64fd-4ea6-be10-062b7d66487a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$349" data-dimension48="$349" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSRBWPKY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1489px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="LCHHzTfZTFjUWnoU8iewPA" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-Horizon-official-render-brushed-titanium.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LCHHzTfZTFjUWnoU8iewPA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1489" height="1489" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Oura Ring Gen 3 (Horizon):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSRBWPKY" data-dimension112="b3d9b551-64fd-4ea6-be10-062b7d66487a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$349" data-dimension48="$349"><del>$349</del> <strong>$299 at Amazon</strong></a></p>
<p>The Oura Ring Gen 3 is the ring that pretty much started it all. It's a discreet health tracker that measures your heart rate, monitors your temperature, tracks your sleep, and much more. The pricier Horizon style normally costs a premium over the Heritage, but with $50 off, you can get it for the same price.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSRBWPKY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b3d9b551-64fd-4ea6-be10-062b7d66487a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$349" data-dimension48="$349">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>After using the Oura Ring Gen 3 for a few years, I can honestly say that it&apos;s one of the best wearables I&apos;ve owned. It comes with plenty of features and has a seven-day battery life despite its small size. And yet, Oura keeps stuffing more and more features into this small ring, making it well worth the cost of ownership.</p><p>Sure, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">Oura Ring 4</a> comes with better battery life, higher accuracy, and better activity tracking, but the Oura Ring Gen 3 is still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> on the market and, in some ways, is better than many Android smartwatches. And the Horizon style is the better-looking option over the Heritage style, especially since it looks nearly identical to the Oura Ring 4. I like my Heritage model, but if I could afford the Horizon style, that would&apos;ve been my choice. Fortunately, Prime Day is making that a little bit easier for shoppers.</p>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a discreet health tracking wearable that you can use to monitor your daily activity, sleep, stress, and more.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want the latest Oura Ring 4 or you prefer a smart ring without a monthly subscription.</p>
<p>There hasn&apos;t been a better time to buy a smart ring, but you&apos;ll want to get in on this deal now, because once the Oura Ring Gen 3 is out of stock, that&apos;ll be it! And some of you may be happy to know that the ring is FSA/HSA eligible, which could make purchasing one even easier.</p><p>Otherwise, you can check out these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-review-smartwatches-across-every-brand-these-are-the-5-prime-day-deals-id-personally-buy">Prime Day deals on smartwatches</a> if you want something a bit more involved and interactive.</p>

I sure do, and it&apos;s a feeling that I&apos;ve been chasing for years. Thanks to the explosion in popularity of gaming handhelds, it&apos;s easier than ever to just sit back and fire up a game from your childhood from practically anywhere. </p><p>Devices like the Retroid Pocket 4 Pro or Logitech G Cloud aren&apos;t a new concept, by any means. What is new is seeing companies like Logitech and Razer enter the fray. And with events like Prime Day, you can save a few bucks such as getting the G Cloud for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09T9FHZLH">$40 off on Amazon</a>. </p>

<p>With Prime Day upon us, the G Cloud isn&apos;t the only gaming handheld deal to be had. The Retroid Pocket 4 Pro is powered by MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 1100 SoC which offers a bit more oomph. Although we were hoping for a steeper discount given the recent Retroid Pocket 5 announcement, you can knock $25 off of the price, as long as you apply the on-page coupon. </p><p>What if you&apos;re in the market for a dedicated gaming handheld, but don&apos;t want to spend a bunch of money? Well, you&apos;re in luck thanks to devices like the Anbernic RG35XXSP and Miyoo Mini Plus. The former retails for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9M9H1RY">about $87</a>, while the latter is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBQ8TVR3/">priced at $76</a>. But you can enjoy a 20% discount on either one (or both) of these, which is pretty darn great. </p>

<p>Despite its cloud gaming focus, the Logitech G Cloud is much more capable than just being used for streaming games. You can load it up with your own retro gaming library, download RetroArch, and enjoy all of your games. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09T9FHZLH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1e0e7e09-afe8-497b-80f5-3bb6b7444a97" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Logitech G Cloud: $299" data-dimension48="Logitech G Cloud: $299">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Retroid has been in the handheld game for a few years, with the Pocket 4 Pro acting as the company's flagship handheld until recently. It's a bit more powerful than the G Cloud thanks to the Dimensity 1100 SoC, and comes in a bunch of awesome colors. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTHGYPMC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a920d071-137e-450a-96c2-bf7424caa86b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Retroid Pocket 4 Pro: $249" data-dimension48="Retroid Pocket 4 Pro: $249">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>When it comes to nostalgia, it's one thing being able to play your favorite retro games. But it's something else entirely when you have a device replicates the same experience. The RG35XXSP is the perfect modern version of the Game Boy Advance SP, but can play so many more games from a variety of systems. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D57TX452" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="27300773-1e33-4d0d-8d8e-6a13122d36ed" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$86.99" data-dimension48="$86.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>If you're looking for something that's reminiscent of the Game Boy Pocket, look no further than the Miyoo Mini Plus. It sports a 3.5-inch HD display, and can slide right in and out of your pocket with ease. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBQ8TVR3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="834d6b7d-6c45-48ed-bc07-e8799798305e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$75.99" data-dimension48="$75.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>While other gaming handhelds have been released, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Edge-WiFi-Gaming-Tablet-Console-Class/dp/B0CKM287V2/">Razer Edge</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Android-Console-2560x1440-Snapdragon/dp/B0DDKMK7L3/">Ayaneo Pocket S</a>, the G Cloud remains a fan favorite. Along with the solid performance, Logitech seemed to have struck gold when designing the ergonomics. It&apos;s something that other handhelds haven&apos;t been able to match up with, giving the G Cloud a distinct advantage. </p><p>The Retroid Pocket 4 Pro is one of those G Cloud competitors, undercutting Logitech&apos;s handheld while being more powerful. The ergonomics are no match, but since you&apos;re <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTHBS9QF">saving a few bucks</a> on the handheld itself, you can use that to pick up a grip! </p><p>Both of those handhelds are great in their own right, but they don&apos;t quite offer the nostalgic feeling you might be looking for. Have no fear, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9M9H1RY">RG35XXSP</a> manages to do just that, and so much more. Grab it, start playing your favorite games, and enjoy the satisfying "click" whenever you close the lid. Then, flip it back open and pick up right where you left off.</p><p>Then, there&apos;s the Miyoo Mini Plus, which is the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Console-Classic-Consoles-Wireless/dp/B0DC6L9TF1/">Miyoo Mini</a>, offering a larger screen and giving you the ultimate Game Boy Pocket experience. It supports more than 20 different emulators and up to eight hours of battery life. Plus, once you get into the world of these kinds of handhelds, you&apos;ll never want to go back.  </p>

Since it had some Quest 3 128GB stock left, it discounted it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1776469-REG/meta_quest_899_00579_01_3_advanced_all_in_one_vr.html"><strong>$429 ($70 off)</strong></a> while supplies last.</p><p>Turns out that the supplies won&apos;t last long! The Quest 3 128GB has already sold out at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target, though you can buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Performance-Oculus/dp/B0D5H6WRPH"><strong>Renewed Quest 3 for $379 at Amazon</strong></a><strong> </strong>— just $79 more than the brand-new Quest 3S with some major downgrades.</p><p>If you don&apos;t like buying used, we&apos;ve found a few retailers still carrying the new Quest 3 128GB — for now. Unlike the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">Prime Day deals</a> guaranteed to last through the 9th, we have no way of knowing when the Quest 3 128GB will run out of stock for good, making <strong>now</strong> the only certain time to get a new headset before you have to pay for storage that most everyday VR users probably don&apos;t need.</p>

<p>We've included four store links to find the Meta Quest 3 128GB because four more popular stores have already sold out and we don't know how many headsets are left. This is the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headset</a> on the market, and while you can save even more on the $300 Quest 3S, we'll recommend you grab one of these while you can.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1776469-REG/meta_quest_899_00579_01_3_advanced_all_in_one_vr.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="fbe16aee-b411-4fa5-8e2b-79add6fa6611" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest 3 128GB: $499" data-dimension48="Meta Quest 3 128GB: $499">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Why buy the Quest 3 when the Quest 3S arrives in a week for $299, offering the same CPU, RAM, controllers, RGB cameras, and game library? It&apos;s a fair question, but my guide on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Meta Quest 3 vs. 3S</a> will answer it.</p><p>Essentially, to save on costs, Meta upgraded the hardware but didn&apos;t upgrade the lenses or display. The Quest 3S uses last-gen Fresnel lenses that have the same "sweet spot" as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest 2</a> did, meaning things look blurry when you glance to the side. Plus, it has 445 fewer pixels per inch (PPI) or 5 pixels per degree (PPD) than the Quest 3.</p><p>If you buy the Quest 3, you not only receive that major resolution boost, but things also look significantly crisper from any eye angle thanks to their pancake lenses, which are more condensed so the headset design is less front heavy. Plus, you get a 3.5mm headphone jack (which the Quest 3S cut) and a more exact lens adjustment system so you&apos;re not looking cross-eyed at VR worlds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37" name="Meta-Quest-3S-vs-Meta-Quest-3-front-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">We tested the Quest 3 (left) and Quest 3S (right) at Meta Connect 2024 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even though the Quest 3S runs the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-exclusives-and-enhanced-games">enhanced Quest games</a> and exclusives as the Quest 3, you won&apos;t feel quite as immersed in the action because it won&apos;t display the enhanced 4K textures and resolution boost as clearly. So spending that extra cash on the Quest 3 will make it truly feel like a next-gen headset instead of a Quest 2.5.</p><p>Your only question is whether to buy New or Renewed. While you may not like buying used, we typically recommend buying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">Quest 3 accessories</a> for better comfort and battery life anyways, so you can use the saved money to swap out the used parts you would have thrown away from the newer headset regardless. </p><p>Either way, I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll regret picking up the Quest 3 instead of the Quest 3S, despite the extra cost! </p>

<p>Qualcomm may have just teased the processor for the highly anticipated OnePlus 13, and while details are still unclear, it seems the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phone</a> may take an unexpected direction.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> was initially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-hits-benchmark-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4">expected to draw its power from the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>, but with Qualcomm working on a new flagship chip, OnePlus might be rethinking its choice.</p><p>In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/2619244577/OAyGuDqPl?pagetype=profilefeed" target="_blank">Weibo post</a>, Qualcomm offered a glimpse into the forthcoming Snapdragon Summit, teasing the arrival of a new chipset called the Snapdragon 8 Elite. The video showcases Oryon cores, a tech already featured in the Snapdragon X Elite laptop SoCs.</p><p>The exact role of the Snapdragon 8 Elite is still unclear. It’s uncertain if Qualcomm plans to launch it as a separate flagship alongside the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 or if it’s just a rebranding of the Gen 4.</p><p>Along with the Snapdragon chipset teaser, the video featured a smartphone with a circular camera island, likely a prototype resembling the OnePlus 13’s design. It keeps the classic OnePlus camera setup in the top-left corner, sticking to the look of the OnePlus 11 and 12.</p><p>Leaker Digital Chat Station also hinted on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OAz2w4u6f?pagetype=profilefeed" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that the OnePlus 13 could be the first smartphone to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/10/08/snapdragon-8-elite-chip-could-launch-first-on-oneplus-13-suggest-official-teaser/" target="_blank">Gizmochina</a>). Additionally, early reports suggest the smartphone will sport a 6.82-inch LTPO OLED display, offering 2K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 is also expected to feature a powerful triple rear camera setup, led by a 50MP LYT-808 primary sensor. It’ll supposedly be joined by a 50MP ultra-wide sensor and a 50MP periscope telephoto lens, offering a 3x optical zoom.</p><p>Although OnePlus hasn’t officially announced the OnePlus 13 yet, Xiaomi has jumped ahead by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/yabhishekhd/status/1839245301732835667" target="_blank">revealing</a> that its Xiaomi 15 series, launching on October 23, will be the first to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.</p><p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon Summit, happening from October 21 to 23, is expected to give us the full scoop on the new chipset.</p>

After all, why wait for the Black Friday deals to go live when Amazon&apos;s offers are this good?</p><p>For example, were you aware that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDLHD3B"><strong>Samsung Galaxy S24 is currently sitting with a 25% discount</strong></a> at Amazon? That&apos;s a record-smashing discount on one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> that money can buy, and it&apos;s pretty unlikely that we&apos;ll see the price drop much further when Black Friday hits. </p>

<p>Don't let its small size fool you — the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> is all power under the hood, from the super-efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset to the innovative Galaxy AI software features. You're even guaranteed to receive seven years of OS and security updates straight out of the box, which means you could be using this phone into the 2030s before it starts to feel obsolete (oof, shouldn't have said that). </p>
<p>Grab the Galaxy S24 128GB during Amazon's October Prime Day event and you'll score a straight 25% discount, which is the biggest price drop that the unlocked phone has EVER received. Need more storage? Pick up the 256GB version instead and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDRFVTL"><strong>you'll still get 23% off</strong></a>. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDLHD3B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="dd9721f7-3029-4726-80dc-2f94b7c0c69b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>The Galaxy S24&apos;s compact design has drawn comparisons to an iPhone, but this is an Android phone through and through. You get all of the fun Galaxy AI features that Samsung has been advertising as of late, plus years of software support and outstanding cameras. The S24 also features a bigger battery than its predecessor, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset is one of the best mobile processors in the game today. </p><p>Sure, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-vs-s23">Galaxy S24 isn&apos;t a vast improvement over the S23</a>, but when a Prime Day discount comes along and knocks the price of the 2024 flagship down to $599.99, I wouldn&apos;t blame you for considering the upgrade. Go ahead and hit that Add to Cart button, we can always do Black Friday next year. </p>
