<p>It&apos;s nice being able to pick and choose what phone I want to use on a daily basis. Usually, whenever I get a new phone, that becomes the "standard" for a while. That was the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> until the Galaxy S24 Ultra arrived, giving me a reason to go back to a "slab" phone.</p><p>Leading up to that point, I had already gotten a little bored of the Open, but not because of the phone itself. That&apos;s just the nature of the beast when it comes to someone who plays around with new phones and technology for a living. Boredom is probably the best way to describe it. So, honestly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> arrived at the perfect time.</p><p>Fast forward to now, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra lasted a little less than two months before I decided that enough was enough and that slab phones no longer interested me.</p><p>For a little bit of context, I have been using the OnePlus Open in tandem with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> ever since it was announced. That&apos;s a little over three months, squeaking past the two-and-a-half months I spent with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-spent-a-week-with-the-z-fold-5-coming-home">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7P2ErZCEHSc73umEzHChMN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-back-titanium-04.jpg" alt="The back of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in the Titanium Grey colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7P2ErZCEHSc73umEzHChMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the past few years, I&apos;ve learned that the majority of the time spent using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> is from the cover screen. So why would I want to go back to a foldable phone when the Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s display is way better than that of the OnePlus Open or Z Fold 5? Well, it&apos;s a simple and obvious answer — it doubles as a pocketable tablet.</p><p>This has been the thing that keeps drawing me back to foldable phones, even as I&apos;ve grown tired of Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-z-fold-5-doesnt-change-much-over-the-z-fold-4">refusing to upgrade</a> anything but the processor on the Z Fold lineup. I can go from scrolling Reddit or logging the latest poopy diaper on the outer screen to trying to get some work done in just moments. </p><p>Not to mention the multitasking capabilities of having multiple app windows open at the same time without feeling overly cramped. This is somewhat of a testament to OnePlus&apos; unique Open Canvas feature, letting you use three apps in full-screen and switching between them. But, it&apos;s also still quite nice being able to just open more than just two apps and actually use them. </p>

<p>While the OnePlus Open kind of saved me, it&apos;s not without flaws of its own. OxygenOS continues to be janky from time to time, such as the taskbar getting in the way of me tapping into the text field within Telegram. Not to mention that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-open-android-14-oxygenos-update-united-states">Android 14 for the Open</a> <em>just</em> arrived here in the U.S. after only being available in India for some time. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S24 Ultra launched with Android 14 out of the box, and the Galaxy Z Fold 5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/galaxy-z-fold-5-flip-5-stable-one-ui-6-android-14-update">received its update</a> in November of last year.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>There's still too much jankiness in OxygenOS on the OnePlus Open.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It doesn&apos;t take a rocket scientist to know that outside of the foldable form factor, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is a better phone in pretty much every way. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review">cameras alone</a> are enough of a reason why this is the case, not to mention the new and improved display that looks so darn impressive.</p><p>I don&apos;t even have a ton of complaints when it comes to One UI, although a few things are missing that I still don&apos;t understand. One such example is that there&apos;s no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-conversation-widgets-android-12">Conversation Widget</a> available on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, despite being made available when Google released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a>. Surprisingly, it&apos;s there on the OnePlus Open, and I&apos;ve been grateful for that.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>But it doesn't fold.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>After coming home from the hospital with a newborn in tow, I quickly realized how cumbersome and awkward it was to play finger gymnastics with only one free hand. Yes, I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">MagSafe case</a> with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-popsockets">PopSocket</a> on the S24 Ultra, but that doesn&apos;t quite solve the problem in most instances. So, I decided to give the OnePlus Open another shake, and while it&apos;s almost the same size, the differences are such that it&apos;s simply more comfortable to use.</p><p>While the Open is definitely a hefty device to use while closed, it&apos;s a half-inch smaller than the Galaxy S24 Ultra. That makes one-handed use much easier, as I don&apos;t have to try and strain my fingers trying to reach one of the corners. Which is quite important when the little one wants to take a nap on your chest. Most of the time, I just have to give up doing what I was trying to do on the S24 Ultra until I can use my other hand.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve even been thinking about giving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> another go, as the narrow cover screen, which I like to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-im-skipping-galaxy-z-fold-5">complain</a> about, is practically perfect. At this point, I might just go back to the Fold 5 to see whether much has changed. I know it really hasn&apos;t, but in my head, there&apos;s a chance that I might fall back in love with the Fold 5.</p><p>I&apos;m also in this weird space of wanting to pay super-close attention to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> rumor mill. This might finally be the year that Samsung revamps the hardware, giving us proper cameras and an inner display crease that doesn&apos;t do its best Grand Canyon impersonation. At this point, I couldn&apos;t even tell you what the rumors are suggesting. It&apos;s been a practice of tempering my expectations, which is quite a difficult task for me.</p>

<p>There&apos;s really nothing wrong with the Galaxy S24 Ultra. It&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> that money can buy, at least if you&apos;re in North America and don&apos;t want a foldable. Even with the camera "side-grades" and the exorbitant price tag, you&apos;d have a tough time finding a more complete package.</p><p>While we might not have as many options as those living abroad, I&apos;m still thankful that there are at least some options to choose from. And before we know it, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 will be here, potentially complicating my decision. For now, I&apos;ll be sticking with the OnePlus Open and maybe giving the Z Fold 5 another chance.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-xa0-2">What you need to know </h2>
<ul><li>Android 15 is expected to introduce a Powered Off Finder API.</li><li>This API will enable compatible devices to be tracked even when switched off.</li><li>The feature is expected to be available on the Google Pixel 9 series, and the Pixel 8 series.</li></ul>
<p>Google has been hard at work on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-version-3-update">Find My Device network</a> but has not yet made the system widely available to users. However, recent reports suggest that a Powered Off Finder API will be a standout feature of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> when it rolls out, most likely in the second half of 2024.</p><p>As reported by Android Police, the feature will allow compatible phones to be located even when they are switched off. The system works by allowing the handset to broadcast Bluetooth beacons to other Android devices that are part of the Find My Device network. The receiving devices will then encrypt and upload the device&apos;s location, transmitting the beacon to Google’s server and allowing the device&apos;s owner to see where it is.</p>
<p>According to the report, this feature will only work on devices with specific hardware support that allows them to power the Bluetooth controller even when the phone is shut down. For that reason, it will not work on all Android devices.</p><p>It’s expected that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> series will be the first compatible handset to benefit from this feature. But interestingly, it also appears that the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro will also be able to support the API, as well as the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>. Older devices, including the Pixel 7 series and the Pixel Fold, don’t appear to have the necessary software support to operate Powered Off Finding.</p>

<p>This would make sense; back in April 2023, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-find-my-device-phone-off-rumor">we reported</a> that Google was working on a Find My Device feature. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unknown-tracker-alerts-roll-out">Google even announced</a> the feature at I/O 2023, stating it would arrive “later this summer.” At that point, it was believed that the feature was being designed to work with the Pixel 8 when it launched later that year.</p><p>The release of Powered Off Finding was subsequently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-version-3-update">pushed back</a> while Google and Apple collaborated to solve the problem of unwanted location tracking. While Google offers unknown tracker alerts that can detect Bluetooth trackers, including AirTags, an equivalent does not currently exist on iOS. At the moment, Apple devices can detect AirTags but cannot detect trackers that aren’t connected to Apple’s Find My network.  </p><p>Google and Apple have been working together since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-apple-partner-tackle-unwanted-location-tracking">May 2023</a> to create a joint specification based on Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers (DULT). The hope is that Android devices will soon start to benefit from this feature. </p>

<p>While the Google Pixel 7a is a (slightly) older-model phone, introduced in May 2023, it’s still a great one worth considering if you love the Google Pixel line. It’s one of the more affordable options that still provides tons of great features and impressive specs. Plus, the cameras are fabulous and the photo editing features are second to none.</p></p>

<p>Shopping around for a new phone? Maybe you’re looking for a budget phone for yourself or as a teen’s first device. Perhaps it’s something simple your elderly parents or grandparents can enjoy. It might even be a secondary phone to use alongside your business phone.</p><p>Whatever the case, you don’t have to spend thousands of dollars for a decent phone. And when it comes to the Nothing Phone (2a) vs. Google Pixel 7a, the battle of the “A” phones proves they both get an A+ for a balance of price and performance. But let’s dive deeper to see how they stack up against one another.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-2a-vs-google-pixel-7a-the-looks-and-basics-2">Nothing Phone (2a) vs. Google Pixel 7a: The looks and basics</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oh8cFrV39EygQspZmGTLsL" name="nothing-phone-2a-back-01.jpg" alt="The back of the Nothing Phone (2a) with the glyph lights illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oh8cFrV39EygQspZmGTLsL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nothing Phone (2a) comes in black or white with a unique Glyph interface that consists of LED lights on the back that light up to advise of notifications, timers, volume adjustments, music playback, and more. It’s a design Nothing has employed since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Nothing Phone (1)</a>, but it’s still delightful to see.</p><p>It’s equipped with a 6.7-inch 2412 x 1080 AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and a polycarbonate chassis with aluminum side rails coated in polycarbonate resin. The always-on screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass 5, so it isn’t quite as rugged as some of the more expensive phones on the market. Given that you’ll want to show off the design without sacrificing protection, finding the perfect transparent Nothing Phone (2a) case is crucial anyway. Peak brightness is 1,300 nits, so don’t expect this phone to be as bright and beautiful as other more premium models either.</p><p>You can customize the look by using things like a monochromatic theme, branded themes and icons, and even removing app labels so the phone looks as you want it to. There are plenty of Nothing OS widgets from which to choose as well, so you can truly make the phone experience personalized to you.</p><p>The phone is only IP54 rated, so you get mild resistance to dust and water. But you’ll want to proceed with caution if you’re using it by the pool or on the beach, and you won’t want to accidentally drop this phone in the toilet. A spray of water, however, will be fine. </p><p>The 5,000mAh battery will purportedly give you up to two days’ worth of use per charge, and the phone also supports 45W fast charging that will give you another day after just 20 minutes. However, it does not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-android-phones-can-handle-wireless-charging">support wireless charging</a>. For those who are constantly on the go, this could be what sways you in favor of this device; while those who rely on wireless charging should note that this phone means you have to forego that luxury.</p><p>There’s no expandable storage but you get either 128GB or 256GB onboard. Other inclusions are USB-C, dual 5G, Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6, NFC, a fingerprint sensor, face unlock, and stereo speakers. Plus, the phone has a 360° antenna which Nothing says can ensure a reliable connection.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kumctseS6a9Jwts5D3o7XF" name="google pixel 7a lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 7a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kumctseS6a9Jwts5D3o7XF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You’ll get a wider selection of colors with the Google Pixel 7a, which comes in Sea, Charcoal, or Snow, along with the Google-exclusive Coral finish. It has a much smaller 6.1-inch always-on OLED screen that boasts an almost identical 2400 x 1080 resolution. While the high brightness mode taps out at about 1,000 nits, <em>Android Central</em>’s Nicholas Sutrich says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">in his review</a> that he had no issues seeing the display outdoors in bright sunlight, or in the dark.</p><p>The screen is reinforced with Corning Gorilla Glass 3, a step down from the Nothing (2a), but it’s still scratch-resistant and has a fingerprint-resistant coating. This is combined with the 3D thermoformed composite back with a tactile alloy frame and visor. Nonetheless, you’re still advised to get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-7a-cases">protective case for the phone</a>. Sutrich reports that the phone itself is slippery and the back tends to attract a lot of dust and fingerprints.</p><p>The refresh rate is a step down as well at just 90Hz, though Sutrich didn’t encounter any issues with responsiveness and productivity while reviewing the phone. It is slightly more rugged with an IP67 rating, however, which means an accidental dunk in the toilet or pool isn’t as big a worry with this phone as it would be with the Nothing Phone (2a).</p><p>The battery is smaller in the Google Pixel 7a as well at just 4,385mAh, rated to last a day and beyond. There is an Extreme Battery Saver mode to extend battery life to up to 72 hours in a pinch, and this phone supports both fast and wireless charging.</p><p>The Google Pixel 7a only comes in a 128GB variant, and without a memory card slot, this means you’re limited in what you can store unless you invest in cloud storage as well. This phone also offers the usuals, like USB-C, Wi-Fi 6e, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, 5G connectivity, stereo speakers, fingerprint unlock, and more.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at how these two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> compare head-to-head when examining specs alone.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are some notable differences when it comes down to specs with these two phones. But let&apos;s dive deeper into processing, power, and cameras.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-2a-vs-google-pixel-7a-power-processing-and-more-2">Nothing Phone (2a) vs. Google Pixel 7a: Power, processing, and more</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s9uog29bNh6SkAxhM6eyJL" name="nothing-phone-2a-home-screen-red-01.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone (2a) with the stock glass red wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9uog29bNh6SkAxhM6eyJL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s what’s inside that counts, as the saying goes, so it’s important to know how these two phones differ on the insides as well. </p><p>The Nothing Phone (2a) runs on the Mediatek Dimensity 7200 Pro octa-core processor, which will work well for everyday activities, including apps and games.</p><p>Speaking of the latter, the phone also has an advanced cooling system and an extra-large vapor chamber that affords more even heat distribution. A large cooling area, meanwhile, has a thick graphite layer for rapid heat dissipation, so bandwidth-intensive tasks like graphic-heavy games should run wonderfully on this phone. Sutrich did an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">early first impressions review</a> of this phone as well and he said he had no problems playing any of the games he tried on the device.</p><p>It has 8GB RAM as a standard for the 128GB version, or you can upgrade to a variant with 256GB storage that increases this to 128GB. There’s also a RAM booster feature that can leverage free storage to be used as more memory, so the phone runs more efficiently.</p><p>Out of the box with Android 14, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-phone-2a-gets-its-first-update">Nothing Phone (2a) supports three years of major Android updates</a> and four years of security updates, so you can be confident that it will last for a long time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rHqTnwm9mbE55iEUKUgEdB" name="Google-Pixel-7a-display-02.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 7a's vibrant, bright display showcasing the home screen with the default coral feathers wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rHqTnwm9mbE55iEUKUgEdB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 7a is powered by the Google Tensor G2 processor, which has since been replaced by the Tensor G3, though it’s still quite powerful. Sutrich tried playing various games during his review period and didn’t run into any issues. While the phone taps out at 8GB RAM, that’s still decent to keep up with most everyday needs.</p><p>Since the phone is over a year old, it runs on Android 13, but you can upgrade to Android 14. Google supports up to three years of Android platform updates, five years of security updates, and various Google Feature Drops. So, while you’ll only get two more updates in the cycle when it comes to the OS, the Feature Drops means the phone will remain current at least through to 2026. By that time, you’ll probably be ripe for an upgrade anyway.</p><p>While the Google Pixel 7a doesn’t have all the cool AI features you’ll get with the step-up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>, you can still access some of the most beloved features like call assist, clear calling, real-time language translations, and more. And, of course, seamless operation with a wealth of Google apps and services.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-2a-vs-google-pixel-7a-taking-pictures-2">Nothing Phone (2a) vs. Google Pixel 7a: Taking pictures</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jtcvrD2k44KFgDydnRfA3N" name="nothing-phone-2a-camera-hump-02.jpg" alt="The camera island on the back of the Nothing Phone (2a) with the glyph lights illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jtcvrD2k44KFgDydnRfA3N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most of us use our smartphones as our primary cameras nowadays, so this is an important factor to consider as well.</p><p>The Nothing Phone (2a) has a 50MP dual main camera, including an ultra-wide lens with a 114° field-of-view. This combines with a 32MP wide-angle front camera, which is a much higher resolution than the selfie camera on the Google Pixel 7a.</p><p>There’s nothing to write home about when it comes to the cameras, but you’ll be able to take decent shots with optical image stabilization, LED flash, and HDR. You can also shoot video at up to 4K resolution at 30 frames per second. Some other notable camera features include a TrueLens engine that powers things like night mode, motion capture, and portrait optimizer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="M7AAXjyzjpLpGQm8m5jD9N" name="Google-Pixel-7a-on-side-camera-bar.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 7a's metal camera bar up close" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M7AAXjyzjpLpGQm8m5jD9N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 7a really shines when it comes to the camera. You get cool photo-taking and editing features like Photo Unblur, Night Sight, Portrait Mode, Super Res Zoom, Frequent Faces, dual exposure control, Magic Eraser, Real Tone, and Face Unblur.</p><p>The main camera is higher resolution at 64MP Quad PD but you only get an 80° FOV, so you won’t be able to get as much in a shot as you would with the Nothing Phone (2a) camera. If you travel and love landscape photos, or tend to take a lot of group selfies, this is something to consider.</p><p>The ultra-wide camera is much lower resolution than the Nothing Phone (2a) at just 13MP, but it has a 120° FOV, so you can get wider pics, but not at as high a resolution. The selfie camera is also 13MP with a 95° FOV, so selfies shouldn’t be an issue, even with multiple people or with a background you want to capture on either side of the shot. But the resolution is much lower here, too.</p><p>Despite the numbers suggesting the Google Pixel 7a has a sub-par camera, however, consider that in his experience, Sutrich says the photos he captured surpassed his expectations, both in terms of quality and how quickly they could be snapped after tapping the shutter. He did have some issues with zoom detail and white balance. Based on my own observations as well, the Google Pixel 7a takes wonderful photos with crisp detail and bright colors. All the post-capture editing features also make it a cut above, and they work beautifully. Overall, the cameras are surprisingly better than the specs might suggest.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-2a-vs-google-pixel-7a-which-should-you-buy-2">Nothing Phone (2a) vs. Google Pixel 7a: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v5JDdQG9KwMfZn2HqcUeRL" name="nothing-phone-2a-side-angle.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone (2a) side rails" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v5JDdQG9KwMfZn2HqcUeRL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now comes the big question: which phone should you buy between the Nothing Phone (2a) vs. Google Pixel 7a? They come in at around the same price, with the Nothing Phone (2a) having the edge. You can get the version with twice the storage and more RAM for less than the price of the 8GB/128GB version of the Pixel 7a.</p><p>The Nothing (2a) is superior to the Google Pixel 7a in many respects, including some of the most important specs. It’s also the newer of the two phones. Since Google hasn’t yet released an “a” version of the popular Google Pixel 8, the 7a is the most affordable current model you can buy in the line.</p><p>Neither are ultra-rugged and durable, so you’ll need a protective case out of the gate (which you should get for even rugged, waterproof phones). The Nothing Phone (2a) has a slightly stronger screen but the Google Pixel 7a offers better water and dust-resistance. The Nothing Phone (2a) offers a bigger battery with better-rated battery life. But it comes down to splitting hairs when most of us charge our phones daily anyway.</p><p>Based on specs alone, the Nothing Phone (2a) has better cameras as well, but there aren’t any fancy photo editing features like you’ll get with the Google Pixel 7a. If you tend to take photos you always need to fix in some fashion, you’ll love having the option to do it right from the camera app on the Pixel 7a, and in ways you never thought possible (think turning a blurry photo crisp or removing distracting elements from the background of a photo).</p><p>You get an arguably better processor with the Google Pixel 7a but less RAM, as noted, and a lower screen refresh rate. Still, Sutrich had nothing negative to say in this department about this phone, so the Google Pixel 7a will likely be able to keep up with your day, and then some.</p><p>Bottom line: as far as budget phones go, you can’t go wrong with either of these devices. If you want the most for your money, however, go with the Nothing Phone (2a). It’s the newer model of the two, boasts impressive specs, and it’ll have all your friends asking you about your funky-looking phone. If you value better water resistance, wireless charging, the Google ecosystem and processor, and want a smaller device, the Google Pixel 7a is a good choice and will be for a few years to come.</p>

For the time being, Best Buy has shaved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-edge-512gb-2023-unlocked-interstellar-black/6540585.p?skuId=6540585"><strong>$200 OFF the 512GB configuration of the 2023 Motorola Edge Plus</strong></a> for an overall savings of about 25%. This phone features a very aesthetically pleasing 6.7-inch pOLED display, a nearly two-day battery life, and ultra-fast 68W charging. Beyond the impressive specs, the Motorola Edge Plus also features a beautiful design with its quad-edge curved glass and the so-called "velvet matte" glass on the back.</p><p>There are a couple of minor downsides to the Edge Plus, including Motorola&apos;s notoriously slow rollout on software updates. In addition, while this phone offers capable cameras and unique photo features, there are a few strange limitations—especially when using 4K or 8K video recording.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The latest WhatsApp beta versions reveal interesting features coming to the messaging service.</li><li>The messaging app could allow users to pin up to five chats instead of one.</li><li>Similarly, users can pin up to three messages in a single conversation — an up from only one.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is found testing new handy features in its latest beta versions on Android phones. These include the new ability to pin more chats and messages within the chat.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-6-13-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>, the latest WhatsApp beta for Android bearing the <strong>2.24.6.13</strong> version, which is available through the Google Play Store, allows users to pin more than three chats on the messaging platform. This comes as a follow-up to pin channels in the updates tab from the previous beta version (<strong>2.24.4.3</strong>), notes WABetaInfo.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:284px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:211.27%;"><img id="iSgWhbNLBQDaDaiN6Ru5Pg" name="WhatsApp-Chat-pinning-feature.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Chat Pinning" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iSgWhbNLBQDaDaiN6Ru5Pg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="284" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Until now, the Meta-owned messaging platform only allowed users to pin up to three chats. However, the shared screenshots of the beta version indicate up to five chats, which are pinned on the Chats tab. The new feature is believed to help users prioritize their chats or groups they frequently interact with. It is still unclear whether the feature allows more than five chats to be pinned, as WABetaInfo shares that they could pin up to five chats.</p><p>On the other hand, WABetaInfo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-6-15-whats-new/">also shared</a> another interesting feature that appeared in another WhatsApp beta for the Android <strong>2.24.6.15</strong> version. It allows users to pin more than one message in an individual chat. </p><p>The new beta update indicates that users can pin up to three messages in a conversation. And, when users try to pin a fourth message, the oldest pinned message is believed to be removed from the pinned list, and the new one gets added, notes WABetaInfo. Previously, WhatsApp users had to unpin the first pinned message to replace it with a new one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:284px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:211.27%;"><img id="Jdjb2BvKSRcoDJepCwP9Zg" name="WhatsApp-message-pinning-feature.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Message Pinning" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jdjb2BvKSRcoDJepCwP9Zg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="284" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Users who wish to save essential messages from individual chats can now pin three messages per chat instead of one, which is a convenient addition. The limit could possibly increase based on user behavior and feedback from the beta testing.</p><p>As mentioned, both features are currently active in the aforementioned beta versions of the WhatsApp app. Users will have to wait for the official rollout, which is likely to commence soon. Meanwhile, users can still test the feature by enrolling in the beta version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging platform</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Apple has apparently acquired Ontario-based startup DarwinAI, indicating its entry into the generative AI race.</li><li>DarwinAI specializes in AI for visual inspection of manufacturing components and has developed technology for making AI systems smaller and faster.</li><li>The purpose behind Apple's acquisition of DarwinAI remains unclear, but it could lead to enhancements in AI features for iOS 18.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Apple has reportedly scooped up another startup, and this time it&apos;s Ontario-based DarwinAI, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-14/apple-aapl-buys-canadian-ai-startup-darwinai-as-part-of-race-to-add-features" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Needless to say, Apple is a bit late to the generative AI race, what with ChatGPT and rivals from Microsoft and Google already dominating the market. But now that Apple is apparently jumping into the scene, it might mean the competition for on-device AI dominance is getting intense, especially with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">Google dropping its Gemini Nano model not too long ago</a>.</p><p>According to Bloomberg, Apple snagged DarwinAI earlier this year. The Canadian startup specializes in AI for visually checking out manufacturing components. Plus, it has built technology to make AI systems smaller and faster.</p><p>There&apos;s still no official word from the tech giant, and Apple did not immediately return Android Central&apos;s request for comment.</p><p>That said, all signs point to it. Apple has already brought on board loads of DarwinAI&apos;s team, including co-founder Alexander Wong. The startup has also shut down its social media accounts and website. And if you check Wong&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-wong-90650216/details/experience/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>, he&apos;s been with Apple since January 2024, leading machine learning research.</p><p>Tim Cook revealed during Apple&apos;s earnings call in February that the company was planning to roll out generative AI-powered features "later this year." This acquisition could be the first big hint that Apple is preparing to inject on-device AI features into its upcoming products.</p><p>As of this time, Apple&apos;s AI use in current products is kind of restricted to the Apple Vision Pro and a bunch of AI-powered functionalities in iOS 17.</p><p>But the million-dollar question is: what will Apple do with DarwinAI? It&apos;s been keeping mum about its AI agenda. Considering DarwinAI&apos;s knack for making AI systems smaller and speedier, a smart bet would be on Apple&apos;s tech beefing up AI features in iOS 18.</p><p>Last year, when Google brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, it seemed like a direct jab at Apple&apos;s core business. But Apple hasn&apos;t really hinted at doing something similar with iOS and Siri this year.</p><p>Apple needs to hustle in the generative AI game, as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft are all charging ahead with their own services.</p>

I review a lot of phones and put all of them through rigorous camera tests, and Honor&apos;s latest feels like a huge breakthrough in so many ways.</p><p>At the forefront of the improvements is the upgraded Falcon Camera System, a fancy name for a triple camera array powered by the smartest software Honor has ever developed. It easily sits among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> and regularly produces excellent quality images.</p><p>While you may think the new 180MP telephoto camera is the centerpiece of the experience, it&apos;s the upgraded AI capabilities of the camera that shine through beyond excellent imaging capabilities. Honor&apos;s upgraded AI Motion Sensing Capture is so smart it&apos;ll <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-photography-oppo-honor-mwc-2024">take photos <em>for </em>you</a>, and it&apos;s downright impressive how great these look, too.</p><p>Considering that flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review">still struggle to capture motion</a>, it&apos;s refreshing to see a company go out of its way to deliver a smartphone camera experience that goes so above and beyond to solve this problem.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-6-pro-camera-motion-capture"><span>Honor Magic 6 Pro camera: Motion capture</span></h2>
<p>The Honor Magic 6 Pro&apos;s ability to capture motion is unmatched among phones I&apos;ve tested over the years. Yes, it even beats a Pixel.</p><p>Not only does the phone excel in capturing crisp photos of moving pets and kids, but the software is intelligent enough to automatically capture photos when certain movement is detected.</p><p>Honor says it trained its AI algorithm with over eight million images containing moving subjects, enabling the camera&apos;s software to understand things like facial expressions, human body movement, jumping, and more.</p>

<p>To specifically test out the automatic movement capture capabilities, I took the phone to the local Celtic Fest and let it capture photos of the Irish dancers on stage. All I did was open the camera app and point it at the stage, the AI algorithm did all the rest of the work.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Automatic image capture might sound like a gimmick until you find yourself in a situation where it's needed.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Automatic image capture may sound like a silly gimmick, but it works incredibly well in my testing. As a parent, sometimes it&apos;s hard to have <strong>two </strong>free hands, much less one. Having a phone that can capture the moment by just using one hand is a stroke of genius.</p>

<p>But even if you&apos;d rather capture your images by tapping the shutter, the Honor Magic 6 Pro will get it right basically every time. I ran my usual motion test involving my son jumping off our couch onto a pile of stuffed animals. Against four other phones, the Magic 6 Pro captured a great image every single time.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> was the only other phone that performed this consistently, and even then, the photos from the Honor Magic 6 Pro all looked better than what Google&apos;s best could capture.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-6-pro-camera-main-camera"><span>Honor Magic 6 Pro camera: Main camera</span></h2>
<p>I have very few critiques of the Magic 6 Pro camera experience, but one is certainly the way to quick launch the camera. Most modern Android phones allow you to double-tap the power button at any time — no matter if the screen is on or off — to quickly launch the camera.</p><p>The Honor Magic 6 Pro still uses the weird old method of double-tapping the volume down key, which only works when the screen is off. If the screen is on at all — even if it&apos;s not unlocked — you&apos;ll either have to find the camera shortcut or turn the screen off in order to activate the quick launch feature. It&apos;s silly.</p><p>Other than that minor annoyance, the point-and-shoot capabilities of the Honor Magic 6 Pro are seldom matched by any modern smartphone. From launching the camera to taking a picture takes roughly 2 seconds. Autofocus works stupendously well, and picture quality is exceptional.</p>

<p>It&apos;s difficult to pick a winner between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, Google Pixel 8 Pro, and Honor Magic 6 Pro&apos;s main cameras. All three phones deliver excellent dynamic range and fine detail.</p><p>The three examples above show how each phone can trade off with having the best photo, depending on the situation. In the first example, the Honor Magic 6 Pro has better color accuracy, contrast, and fine detail. The second two examples favor the Galaxy S24 Ultra for fine detail and the Pixel 8 Pro for color accuracy.</p><p>Overall, though, I found the Honor Magic 6 Pro&apos;s photos to look incredibly pleasing. Most complaints were situational, and I didn&apos;t notice any particular pattern of weakness in the hundreds of photos I&apos;ve captured over the past few weeks.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-6-pro-camera-telephoto-camera"><span>Honor Magic 6 Pro camera: Telephoto camera</span></h2>
<p>When I began this review, I had a hard time imagining that the Honor Magic 6 Pro camera could produce a quality telephoto experience beyond 5x, at best. That&apos;s because the telephoto camera is behind a measly 2.5x optical zoom lens, half of what&apos;s on a Pixel 8 Pro or Galaxy S24 Ultra and a quarter of what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> provides.</p><p>But the phone tries to make up for this deficit by using a massive 180-megapixel sensor behind the lens, complete with AI processing. That 180MP sensor is also physically the largest telephoto sensor on any phone to date. That means it takes in more light <em>and</em> more detail than other telephoto sensors.</p><p>However, the results tend to be a mixed bag at 5x and beyond. At times, the camera will blow you away when the subject is right. These two examples at 10x and 20x help illustrate that perfectly:</p>

<p>For note, zooming in with each phone produces a slightly different crop level due to lens differences. All camera viewfinders were set to the same zoom number for these examples.</p><p>The difference in detail alone is astounding. The Honor Magic 6 Pro decimates the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Google Pixel 8 Pro in telephoto quality in the first example. Even the color science is better on the Magic 6 Pro, offering up a substantially better 10x photo in every way.</p><p>The second example of a House Finch at 20x isn&apos;t nearly as cut and dry, and I think the result will be down to personal preference. The Honor Magic 6 Pro&apos;s photo is significantly sharper, with crisp edges around the feathers and even some impressive fine detail without noise.</p><p>But the Magic 6 Pro achieves this with AI-based approximation, as is most evident around the bird&apos;s eyes and beak. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s photo looks more like a photo taken from a camera rather than a mix of photography and AI.</p>

<p>The examples above represent the telephoto image quality produced most often, proving that telephoto performance at 5x and beyond is worse on the Honor Magic 6 Pro than on the Google Pixel 8 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>Everything looks like an obvious digital crop since the camera is physically limited to a 2.5x optical zoom lens. Anything beyond that is a mix of digital crops from the main sensor and a large telephoto sensor.</p><p>Overall, telephoto performance was fairly disappointing unless you stick close to the 2.5x zoom preset on the viewfinder.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-6-pro-camera-low-light"><span>Honor Magic 6 Pro camera: Low light</span></h2>
<p>Since the Magic 6 Pro uses AI so heavily for its processing, low-light photography on the phone tends to be brilliant. Captures from all three rear sensors are incredibly clean, often using heavy denoise algorithms paired with AI detail reconstruction. This produces pictures that look "watercolored" when zooming in, yet, most often the fine details are preserved thanks to the AI on the phone.</p><p>Honor also seems to crank up the saturation in lower light, making this neon-lit arcade an immediate wow factor. This means colors aren&apos;t accurately represented but certainly "look good" to the human eye.</p>

<p>Overall, I prefer the look of photos from the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in most of the shots. The colors are both more natural, and the fine details look more realistic, even though more noise is apparent in the shots.</p><p>The only shot where I think the Honor Magic 6 Pro wins is the main camera image, where it pulled out more fine detail throughout the photo. Bricks in the background have clear delineation and the text on the boards in the arcade are more readable.</p><p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro continues to fall behind the other two, often producing softer, less attractive photos from each lens.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-6-pro-camera-front-facing-camera"><span>Honor Magic 6 Pro camera: Front-facing camera</span></h2>
<p>The Honor Magic 6 Pro&apos;s 50MP front-facing sensor sounds great on paper, but I found it tends to take semi-blurry photos in all lighting conditions. This is bizarre given the phone&apos;s penchant for taking crisp photos of objects in motion, but it seems the phone uses different processing methods on the front-facing camera.</p><p>Not only that, but portrait mode didn&apos;t seem to work at all until I realized that "bokeh" is disabled by default. I have no idea who at Honor thought it made sense to disable bokeh — a sort of catch-all term for a highly blurred background and crisp foreground in the smartphone world — by default, but it was a terrible decision that&apos;s going to confuse a lot of customers.</p>

<p>Compared to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, the Honor Magic 6&apos;s front-facing shots are a bit underwhelming. They&apos;re not bad but the odd motion blur when I was holding the camera still is very strange.</p><p>It&apos;s also a shame that bokeh isn&apos;t enabled by default on the Magic 6 Pro. The phone takes rather exemplary portrait mode shots with this feature properly enabled, and I simply cannot understand why Honor would default to it being off when the expectation of <strong>portrait mode</strong> is to have it enabled.</p>

<p>The Honor Magic 6 Pro camera experience is one that&apos;ll regularly impress, from excellent low light photography to crisp capture of moving subjects. The camera UI isn&apos;t anything revolutionary but it doesn&apos;t really need to be. I still prefer the Google Pixel camera UI over other phones but there&apos;s nothing offensive here.</p><p>The phone truly shines is in its AI processing abilities, which comes in handy when you take a picture or you want to let the phone take a picture for you. It sounds like a gimmick at first, but parents who often find one hand is occupied while the other is trying to take pictures will quickly understand how beneficial such a feature can be.</p><p>While the Pixel 8 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra often took better photos from their respective telephoto cameras, the Magic 6 Pro still did a superb job and often delivered excellent photos up to 10x zoom. Beyond that, most shots were obviously digital crops and not particularly good looking.</p><p>Overall, Honor has delivered a fantastic camera and one I feel confident using no matter what situation I find myself in.</p>

<ul><li>The upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 6 will reportedly have two versions: a high-end model and a "budget" model. </li><li>The "budget" model is rumored to be ditching pen input functionality, per ET News.</li><li>It could also be a lot thinner, according to another report. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is preparing the first “budget” version of its Galaxy Z Fold series, according to ET News. To lower the price, the tech company is rumored to be ditching a key feature.</p><p>As it stands, Samsung is presently developing two models in the flagship Galaxy Z Fold series. The first model will be a traditional handset in the vein of the currently available Galaxy Z Fold 5, albeit with new features. Where things get interesting is that, according to the report, the “budget” model will not have pen input functionality. The high-end model will retain that functionality, but the “budget” model will ditch the feature in an effort to bring down the price for consumers. </p><p>It’s important to note that the lack of parity between the two models may not stop with pen input functionality. Ross Young of Display Supply Chain Consultants <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1768321430792634433">added on X (formerly known as Twitter)</a> that the phone could be thinner because “the digitizer is thick.” </p><p>What remains to be seen is how the price of the “budget” model is handled. Currently, the base Galaxy Z Fold 5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold5/buy/galaxy-z-fold5-256gb-unlocked-sm-f946uzuaxaa/">retails at a suggested MSRP of $1799.99</a> for the 256GB model. The price stretches all the way to $2159.99 for the 1TB storage version – the largest amount of storage available. In that vein, the lower-end model would cost considerably less, though just how much cheaper remains to be seen. </p><p>Still, this development continues a recent trend on the part of the tech giant in introducing lower-end models of its flagship devices dubbed FE or Fan Edition that are much more appealing to consumers due to their lower cost. In exchange for a lower cost, some features are dropped. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-specs-leak">as Android Central’s Jay Bonggolto reported earlier this month</a>, the Galaxy S24 FE could come strikingly close to the flagship model’s performance. </p><p>Among the features rumored to be in the S24 FE are a much larger battery (4,500mAh) compared to the Galaxy S24&apos;s 4,000mAh battery, as well as a 6.1-inch AMOLED that is powered by either Exynos 2400 or Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset. The end result is a device that is extremely comparable to the flagship model without the high price tag. </p><p>That should give consumers some relief in that should the Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE not have pen input functionality and potentially a thinner display, it still will retain as many landmark elements in a much more consumer-friendly price tag. </p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s sales of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> are already proving to be better than those of the Galaxy S23 series, and the latest numbers show us why. According to the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">data from Counterpoint Research</a>, sales of the Galaxy S24 series rose by 8% in the first three weeks when compared to last year&apos;s early sales numbers, and the S24 Plus is driving up these numbers.</p><p>When comparing Samsung&apos;s flagship sales, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy 24 Plus</a> still trails the base S24 and the Ultra, which have 21% and 52% share, respectively. However, the Galaxy S24 Plus has seen a massive 54% growth when compared to the Galaxy S23 Plus and grabbed 21% of S24 sales.</p><p>Notably, the base S24 only saw a meager 4% growth, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> actually lost share compared to the Galaxy S23 Ultra.</p>

<p>Counterpoint also points out that preorder volumes were up across the S24 series in the U.S., Europe, and China, proving how popular these devices are.</p><p>Jeff Fieldhack, Counterpoint Research&apos;s research director for North America, highlights that while S24 growth is still under 10%, it&apos;s still within the high single digits, which is encouraging. "And in Samsung&apos;s biggest market – the US – we&apos;re seeing YoY growth in the mid-teens – solid numbers especially considering the tough February. And considering we&apos;re still really at the beginning stages of the coming GenAI smartphone boom, there is plenty of runway for more growth."</p>

<p>Over the years, Samsung&apos;s Plus model has been seen as nothing more than a larger version of the base model, complete with a larger battery and faster charging. The device did not offer much difference beyond that when compared to the base, especially once Samsung reduced the display resolution to FHD+, meaning the choice between the two phones solely came down to size. That said, the popularity of the newest Plus model underscores some of the changes Samsung made to the device to set it apart from the base model further.</p><p>As I highlighted in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus review</a>, the move back to a QHD+ resolution offers a refreshingly crisp picture that&apos;s much more appropriate for a large display. Of course, sometimes size is all that matters for some, which is why the smaller Galaxy S24 remains popular for users who prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">small Android phones</a>. That said, larger devices appeal to those who enjoy viewing content on their smartphones, which is further enhanced by the improved brightness and higher resolution.</p><p>However, the real improvement comes with the bump in RAM to 12GB, which does wonders for app management. It does a much better job of keeping apps running in the background than phones I&apos;ve reviewed with 8GB of RAM. Counterpoint Research also highlights the benefits it brings to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features, noting that 12GB is the "minimum spec for a large language model to run well" and highlighting the importance of higher-spec phones in the push for on-device AI.</p>

<p>"The big driver this year for Samsung&apos;s key flagship has been the S24 Plus model," states<strong> </strong>Minsoo Kang, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. "It&apos;s hitting the sweet spot on pricing, nudging upgraders as well as specs to support new users wanting optimized on-device AI."</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Plus retails for $999 before any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s24-deals-of-the-month">deals and offers</a> are taken into account, and there are plenty of those to help bring the price down. That&apos;s already $300 less than the S24 Ultra, which saw a price bump at launch and likely contributed to its slight sales decline. And while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra camera system</a> is still impressive, not everyone may find the extra sensor or built-in S Pen worth the extra cost.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Plus finally makes a case for its existence, being more than just a larger S24 by offering more Ultra-like specs at a cheaper price and saving the "extra" features for those willing to pay for them. Of course, these are early sales numbers, so we&apos;ll have to see how the Plus model fares in the long run, but this should give Samsung some reason to keep it around after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-launch-rumors">early rumors</a> suggested the company would omit the middle phone from its lineup.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google DeepMind announces its newest project, a "generalist AI agent" that aims to assist users in carrying out tasks while playing a game.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/">DeepMind</a>, the latest AI is called the Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent, or "SIMA" for short. Google&apos;s AI-focused division states SIMA can "perceive and understand a variety of environments, then take actions to achieve an instructed goal."</p><p>To work, DeepMind adds that SIMA needs what the user sees and "natural-language" instructions provided by the user. The AI is said to use a user&apos;s standard keyboard and mouse inputs to move a user&apos;s character within the game world. By extension, the post adds that SIMA can "interact with any virtual environment."</p><p>SIMA has been tested on 600 basic skills, such as turning left, climbing ladders, opening a game&apos;s pause menu for settings, and more. Google states that SIMA can also perform "simple tasks" in 10 seconds. A few of these tasks involve driving a car in Goat Simulator 3 and telling SIMA to walk to your spaceship in No Man&apos;s Sky.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.58%;"><img id="2rSejMgM7btxP9mKqR3xsJ" name="google-deepmind-sima-gaming-assistant.jpg" alt="The various models and tools Google used to train SIMA." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2rSejMgM7btxP9mKqR3xsJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="433" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To get SIMA to where it is now, Google states it partnered with game developers like Hello Games, the makers of No Man&apos;s Sky, and Tuxedo Labs, who made Teardown. SIMA was also taught using an environment built in the Unity engine called "Construction Lab." Through this, SIMA learned how to manipulate objects and better understood the physical world inside a video game.</p><p>Google also leaned on real-life gamers as an initial approach to understanding how SIMA could work. They monitored them as a pair, with one player playing the game while the other fed them instructions on how to complete a task.</p><p>In total, Google&apos;s DeepMind trained SIMA using nine different games, all within their respective genre. During their study, the division discovered that an AI agent trained across multiple games delivered better results than a system trained on one. More research showed that SIMA&apos;s reliance on language is paramount to its performance.</p><p>Without user input, SIMA is said to behave "in an appropriate but aimless manner." DeepMind observed SIMA exploring and gathering resources but wouldn&apos;t follow the game&apos;s objective unless strictly told to do so.</p><p>SIMA is still in its infancy, but Google is seemingly confident in its "language-driven" capabilities to assist gamers. More importantly, more research is reportedly necessary as Google wants SIMA to understand "higher-level language instructions to achieve more complex goals."</p>
