It also includes 128GB of storage, a microSD port for expandable storage, five years of software updates, and 25W fast charging.</p><p>If you want ingress protection with your phone, you&apos;ll at least have to upgrade from the A25 to the A35. The higher-end Galaxy A models also have better camera quality, though the A25 gets the job done for most casual users.</p>

<ul><li>The upcoming edit button for Google Messages has appeared properly in the app's latest beta.</li><li>Long-pressing a recently sent text will produce a pencil icon in the conversation, which users can tap to begin correcting any mistakes in the writing field.</li><li>The button's latest appearance comes with a change as users have a shorter 15 minutes to return to edit instead of 30.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A useful new feature for Google Messages has started appearing for a few of the app&apos;s beta testers.</p><p>According to a tip received by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1788902138267193657">AssembleDebug</a> on X from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jhowkira2000/status/1788896324282094003">Jhow_Kira</a>, the latest Google Messages beta bears signs of its upcoming edit button (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-text-editing-live-for-beta-users-3441824/">Android Authority</a>). The appearance of the edit button seems scattered in the beta, as Kira states it has surfaced on an "older device" but not their current one.</p><p>Long-pressing your message will produce a pencil icon at the top of a conversation beside the "copy" button. Tapping it will prompt Messages to re-display your previous message in the writing area at the bottom. Above it, a banner that says "edit message" appears.</p><p>Testing showed that Google has lowered the editing time limit to 15 minutes, and the unedited (original) message now appears in its "message details." More importantly, the user stated that the editing feature needs two people to function in the beta.</p><p>Our internal test showed that the editing feature still functioned despite the other party not having it. However, it wasn&apos;t perfect. We noticed that when a message is edited, the old one disappears, and a new one is quickly added to the conversation with the corrections. Another test between a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> (which both have the feature) showed that editing a message will simply replace the old text with the new one within the same bubble.</p>

<p>Tapping the three-dot menu and selecting "view details" shows the editor the original message alongside their new choice. If the opposite party does not have access to the edit button in the beta, the details page will now offer any extra information.</p><p>AssembleDebug highlighted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/02/Google-Messages-Editing-RCS.html?m=1">previous discovery</a> of the edit feature in February, which mentioned a longer timeframe to return and correct mistakes. It seems Google is cutting back, dropping its time limit from 30 minutes to 15 minutes in the current beta.</p><p>While development seems nearly done, there&apos;s no telling when Google plans to roll out its edit button for Messages. Jhow_Kira added that the option has started appearing within the past week. For now, we&apos;ll have to wait and see where the company goes from here.</p><p>One thing is for sure: such a feature will bring Messages into closer competition with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">alternatives</a> like WhatsApp and Telegram.</p><p>We heard about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-text-editing-feature-spotted">text editing in Messages</a> in December during a much older app beta version. The APK teardown contained various strings that mentioned "enable edit UI," "load edit history," and more. Additional information in that old beta elaborated on Google&apos;s plans to process edited text messages for both users.</p>

<hr>
<p>It looks like Google&apos;s new Find My Device is starting to appear for folks outside of the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>As spotted by Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/find-my-device-network-slow-global-rollout-3441630/">Android Authority</a>), a few users have taken to X (formerly Twitter), and they&apos;ve reported receiving access to Google&apos;s new network for lost devices. A Japanese user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Nrnsasa5gmmwsub/status/1787430245035114727">posted a screenshot</a> of their Android picking up Find My Device, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/willza3/status/1788664718715916305">another user</a> from the U.K. posted similar examples.</p><p>However, with more users outside of North America picking it up, it seems Google is continuing to extend its network&apos;s reach <em>in </em>the U.S.</p><p>Android Central started noticing it on a base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> model while also receiving the notification for its arrival on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Moto Razr Plus</a>. Google began rolling out its new network on its l<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">atest Pixels in April</a>, and it seems this low rollout is starting to reach even more people.</p>

<p>Google explains that users can utilize its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My Device</a> network to rediscover their lost devices (e.g., phones) and accessories (e.g., earbuds). The company adds that a user&apos;s device location is encrypted using their screen lock and can only be seen by the owner. Similarly, if you share a device&apos;s location with another user, they will see it, too. Google states that users have the option to change this setting at any time.</p><p>Users will also have a few options for finding offline devices. In its settings, users will see "off," "without network," "high-traffic areas only," and "network in all areas." By default, the high-traffic area option is selected.</p><p>This choice works in places like airports or "busy footpaths."</p><p>It&apos;s also worth mentioning that the Pixel 8 features extra text that mentions finding a powered-off device or out of battery. Despite the Razr Plus receiving access, it cannot be found in either state on the new network.</p>

<p>A recent Google support document <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-pixel-8-find-my-device-powered-off">detailed how</a> the offline tracking of the Pixel 8 series works. Essentially, users should ensure Bluetooth and Location services are toggled on <em>before </em>their Pixel 8 loses power and shuts down. The company added that that the devices can still transmit their location to a user for "several hours" after turning off.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear if the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> will receive such offline support. However, Google&apos;s wording doesn&apos;t explicitly say it won&apos;t.</p><p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024">I/O 2024</a> event is coming up on May 14.  While we&apos;re expecting to hear things about Android 15 and the next Pixels, there&apos;s a chance its new Find My Device network could make another appearance.</p>

<p>When the rumors began mounting about Google&apos;s return to the tablet market, I was beyond excited. I immediately thought back to the glory days of the Nexus 7 and hoped that it would spark some innovation. One could argue that Google delivered, as the Pixel Tablet doubles as a smart home hub. However, Google just proved that it doesn&apos;t really care, and neither should you. </p><p>Instead of waiting until I/O 2024, Google decided to announce the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> and a price reduction (of sorts) for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>. It&apos;s not actually lowering the price, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-solo-launch-announcement">you can finally just buy the tablet</a>, saving $100 and opting against having the Charging Speaker Dock at your disposal. Groundbreaking.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HUQDqvwpkTbGmKFm6Ld3hg" name="google-pixel-tablet-launch-io-2023-5.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Tablet specs launch at Google I/O 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HUQDqvwpkTbGmKFm6Ld3hg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This kind of solves one of the biggest gripes that I had with the Pixel Tablet with its value proposition for the $499 price tag. For the most part, it&apos;s just a Pixel 5 that&apos;s been stretched to accommodate an 11-inch screen. Sure, it&apos;s great to have a 2560 x 1600 resolution, but Google skimped out by going with an LCD panel. </p><p>The 16:10 aspect ratio is great for using apps in split view and multitasking, but Google still doesn&apos;t sell a first-party <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/best-bluetooth-keyboards-google-pixel-tablet">keyboard case</a> or even a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/best-stylus-pixel-tablet">stylus</a>. Not to mention that the Pixel Tablet isn&apos;t great for gaming, as the LCD panel is locked to a 60Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Admittedly, I don&apos;t often use the Pixel Tablet as a tablet. It remains docked 99% of the time, only to be removed when I need to update the software or the installed apps. I have to imagine that I&apos;m not the only one who opts for this use case and wouldn&apos;t be surprised if this is the case for a lot of people. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google could have made a smart decision, but instead, it decided to remain greedy.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>However, I&apos;m only being further convinced that Google doesn&apos;t have much of a sense of direction with this product. Re-releasing the Pixel Tablet sans the Dock or any relevant first-party accessories roughly a year after the initial release has me wondering what in the world is happening. On top of that, the $399 price tag is still too damn high for what you&apos;re getting.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s a Pixel Tablet running Google&apos;s version of Android. But thanks to Google&apos;s own gate-keeping of features, it&apos;s running into the same problem as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. All of those cool AI features? Yeah, they have only recently started to become available on the Pixel Tablet. Hell, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> was announced at the start of 2024 and still won&apos;t be arriving for Pixel Tablet owners until "later this month."</p><p>I&apos;m not going to re-hash all of my feelings on that here, as I&apos;ve already done so a couple of times. But that doesn&apos;t negate the point that Google is lost, as it&apos;s pretty obvious that it&apos;s stretching itself in too many directions.</p>

<p>It&apos;s all about AI and where Google can throw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> while blaming the hardware for those features not being available on a Google-released device. "Oh, it&apos;ll get there....eventually." Well, at least when Samsung or Apple says a new feature is coming, most of the time, those companies follow through.</p><p>This revelation about re-releasing the Pixel Tablet without the dock should&apos;ve happened already. By no means am I an analyst, but I have to assume that the dockless Pixel Tablet would&apos;ve been a hot-ticket item over the 2023 holidays. But instead, Google opted to throw it in as an afterthought when announcing a brand-new product.</p><p>I probably wouldn&apos;t feel the way I do if Google either held off on this tomfoolery until the G3 (or G4) Pixel Tablet was ready or lowered the price to around $299. To put this into perspective, take a look at what Amazon did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Fire Max 11</a> tablet. For about $285, you can get the Fire Max 11, bundled with the Amazon Stylus Pen <em>and</em> the Keyboard Case. Oh, and that&apos;s with paying extra for the "Without Lockscreen Ads" version. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qsfXCP5nQtQHYWa6zksVCX" name="amazon-fire-max-11-review-12.jpg" alt="Close-up on Amazon Stylus Pen and Keyboard Cover - 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qsfXCP5nQtQHYWa6zksVCX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the Pixel Tablet, you&apos;ll pay $399 and get a charging cable, along with some regulatory paperwork. Not to mention that despite being rumored since last year, there aren&apos;t any new first-party accessories. It&apos;s beyond frustrating to see these decisions being made, especially when it&apos;s so obvious that they&apos;re wearing blinders and can&apos;t see the forest for the trees.</p><p>I&apos;ve just about lost hope in Google&apos;s product strategy, and maybe I should just give it up. It&apos;s apparent that Google has, and I won&apos;t be surprised if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-2">Pixel Tablet 2</a> never sees the light of day. </p>

<ul><li>Alleged designs of the upcoming OnePlus 13 and 13R surface ahead of release.</li><li>They indicate a circular camera visor for the OnePlus 13 and a squarish camera module for the OnePlus 13R.</li><li>Meanwhile, the predecessors and the models before them shared the same design language.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The OnePlus 12 and the OnePlus 12R were released not less than six months ago, and we already have details on what to expect from their successors — thanks to a new sketch. </p><p>The tip comes from a reliable leaker, Yogesh Brar on X, who has shared the expected design of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> and the OnePlus 13R. The image shared is quite barebones. However, it does indicate what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phone</a> next to its toned version looks like.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If there are no big changes, the OnePlus 13 and 13R could end up looking like this..Thoughts? pic.twitter.com/S2njBpecJ5<a href="https://twitter.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1788802171204772126">May 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Per the sketch, the OnePlus 13 will likely opt for a circular camera visor moved to the center instead of being placed at an end on the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>. </p><p>On the other hand, the OnePlus 13R is likely to opt for a squarish camera visor akin to older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-10-pro-review">OnePlus 10 Pro</a>, for example. Besides, it is also slightly moved from the previous visor positioning as opposed to the previous OnePlus handsets.</p>

<p>The intended OnePlus 13&apos;s design is similar to what we are accustomed to with Oppo phones&apos; designs like the OnePlus Find N3, which isn&apos;t surprising since both companies share the same R&D team. The first foldable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> also equips a circular camera visor on the rear. </p><p>Meanwhile, a recent leak indicated the design of the OnePlus 13 from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/OcQPmxvih?pagetype=profilefeed">tipster on Weibo</a>, showcasing the device&apos;s rear panel. Interestingly, it matches the sketch shared by Brar — not for the OnePlus 13 but for the OnePlus 13R instead. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1201px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.78%;"><img id="e8EafuVjzmvSN8zBmrZgFc" name="op13.jpg" alt="OnePlus 13 design leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8EafuVjzmvSN8zBmrZgFc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1201" height="790" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The approach from OnePlus happens to be different this year because the earlier releases OnePlus 11 and 11R, and the 12 and 12R, shared identical design language.</p><p>Though it&apos;s too soon to predict the OnePlus 13 and 13R&apos;s design, leaks should appear anytime in the next few weeks, so nothing is ever too early. For instance, the OnePlus 12 first renders came way ahead (in July 2023) of the device&apos;s launch, which commenced first in China in December 2023, followed by a global launch early this year. </p><p>The OnePlus 13 is also expected to be unveiled this year, and it will presumably equip the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>, which is confirmed to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">coming</a> in October with the new Oryon CPU.</p>

<ul><li>Mishaal Rahman's new findings indicate that Pixel 8a also supports display output.</li><li>While the mid-range phone's hardware supports the feature, it is locked with a software flag.</li><li>The upcoming June update will likely open up the functionality on the Pixel 8a alongside the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro models.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We just witnessed the launch of Google&apos;s new mid-range handset, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a,</a> a few days ago. Mishaal Rahman&apos;s latest finding now hints at a possible new feature buried somewhere in the Pixel 8a handset.</p><p>Just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series from last year, the Pixel 8a can support display output through a USB Type-C port, notes Rahman via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-8a-display-output-3441590/">Android Authority</a>. While the hardware is definitely capable, Google needs to enable it software-wise, which is likely to happen with an update sometime in June.</p><p>Google previously took a similar approach with its flagship Pixel 8 series, which is built on a Tensor G3 chip and features a USB controller that supports the DisplayPort Alternate Mode signal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:797px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.28%;"><img id="HZFaLdPWpbXvgM4XjrXuP" name="Google-Pixel-8-DisplayPort.jpg" alt="Pixel 8 seen supporting DisplayPort" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HZFaLdPWpbXvgM4XjrXuP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="797" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mishaal Rahman)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The search giant disabled it during the launch, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-8-series-apparently-supports-display-output">some workarounds</a>, such as rooting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, helped the device connect to an external monitor. However, with the release of Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2, Google enabled DP Alt mode that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-2-pixel-8-display-out">allowed</a> Pixel 8 devices to connect to external displays.</p><p>And since the latest Pixel 8a is also built on the likes of its flagship siblings, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3</a> and several other internal components, including the USB controller, the mid-range handset also supports the external display via its USB Type-C port.</p><p>Rahman further notes that there is a system property dubbed <em>persist.vendor.usb.displayport.enabled</em>, which is set for 0, meaning the DisplayPort Alternate Mode is disabled. However, the Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2 release set it to 1, enabling the DP Alt mode.</p>

<p>While the current builds are Android 14 QPR2-based (with May security patches), the mode is still disabled even for the Pixel 8 series running the current stable builds. The upcoming June update, which is underway, will be based on Android 14 QPR3; thus, we could see the DisplayPort Alternate Mode in action on the Pixel 8 series and the latest Pixel 8a.</p><p>On the other hand, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is on its way, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-15-desktop-mode-revamp-spotted">recent reports</a> have indicated that Google is already working on a desktop mode overhaul. This will likely better handle multiple windows when devices are connected to external displays. We could also see apps in full-screen mode with a navigation bar-style tab at the top—tapping it further would give people full-screen, split-screen, and freeform mode.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024">Google I/O 2024</a> just around the corner, we expect to see more details about the feature at the Android 15 announcement. It is encouraging to see Google attempting to take on Samsung&apos;s Dex by introducing new features and support to Pixel phones for the desktop mode.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors are intensifying about OpenAI potentially launching a competitor to Google Search. </li><li>A new report now says OpenAI plans to debut a Google Search rival early next week.</li><li>The timing of OpenAI's rumored launch would edge out Google's own developer conference, Google I/O 2024, which starts Tuesday. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The markets for search and artificial intelligence are colliding, with the major players in both markets trying to enhance AI with web results and vice versa. Google has the Search Generative Experience (SGE), which uses AI to summarize web results in digestible blocks. Now, it looks like OpenAI is ready to launch a Google Search competitor, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-plans-announce-google-search-competitor-monday-sources-say-2024-05-09/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> report. The company will reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-search-engine-rumored">debut a search engine rival</a> on Monday, May 13 — exactly one day before Google I/O 2024.</p><p>OpenAI has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-one-year-later">ChatGPT</a>, a leading AI chatbot that uses the company&apos;s GPT-3.5 and GPT -4 models. However, ChatGPT seems to be falling behind in providing web results. Alternative chatbots, like Google&apos;s Gemini and Microsoft&apos;s Copilot, are better at sourcing information with real-time web results. This is likely an area where OpenAI hopes to improve with its to-be-announced Google Search competitor. </p><p>According to the report, this search engine alternative is still largely based on ChatGPT. When it is released, the OpenAI search product will be able to find and source timely web results in response to user queries. Sources and citations are important for any chatbot that uses LLMs because they tend to "hallucinate" or essentially makeup information. With this new search product, OpenAI will make it easier for ChatGPT users to check the accuracy of its responses.</p><p>Right now, it&apos;s unclear whether this offering will be available for free, be ad-supported, or be locked behind OpenAI&apos;s ChatGPT Plus subscription. ChatGPT Plus costs $20 per month and includes some exclusive features, like expanded rate limits and priority access to OpenAI&apos;s best LLMs. </p>

<p>Based on this report, OpenAI&apos;s search competitor sounds very similar to Google&apos;s own Search Generative Experience. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overviews-test-expansion">SGE is rolling out more widely of late</a>, and it summarizes web results into a quick AI-generated summary. Like OpenAI&apos;s rumored search product, SGE also provides sources for its responses.</p><p>OpenAI&apos;s announcement of its Google Search competitor, if it indeed comes Monday, would not be scheduled by accident. That&apos;s exactly one day before Google kicks off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024">Google I/O 2024</a> developer conference, and AI will surely be a focus at the company&apos;s event. OpenAI appears to be trying to beat Google to the punch in developing the next AI-based search features. </p>

<hr>
<p>This month, Google has included a new feature on its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500?hl=en">Play Services v24.18 update</a> aimed at Wear OS devices. According to the changelog, the company is preparing to bring a &apos;School Time&apos; feature to WearOS smartwatches for children. </p><p>According to the update, parents will be able to set School-Time limits for apps that their child can use and also silence their device during school hours to limit unnecessary distractions. </p><p>As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/09/google-wear-os-school-time/">9to5Google</a>, this new update will block apps and watch face complications but still allow temporary access to things such as Activity Rings with a set number of “unlocks.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3604px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Pa9Yb3QdekTSraoYkXGuw" name="google-pixel-watch-bracelets-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch worn on a wrist with beaded bracelets." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pa9Yb3QdekTSraoYkXGuw.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3604" height="2027" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you feel like you&apos;ve heard about a similar concept elsewhere, you&apos;re not wrong. This update sounds a lot like the Schooltime mode on Apple watches, which allows you to set up multiple schedules during a day—like from 8:00 a.m. to noon and then 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.—and customize the days of the week this schedule repeats.</p><p>It is unclear whether all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatches</a> will sport this new feature or only the latest models will offer it, but for now, it seems the feature hasn&apos;t been rolled out to watches yet.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google about when and who will get the new Wear OS feature; however, they did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article once we have more information.</p><p>While smartwatches and other wearables are becoming increasingly popular among school children, tech companies like Google, Fitbit, and Apple are doing their part to ensure that technology doesn&apos;t interfere with learning.</p><p>Additionally, rumor has it that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-kids-smartwatch-leaked-images">Fitbit is also working on a kids&apos; smartwatch</a> with cellular and GPS connectivity to allow parents to monitor and contact their kids. This device is said to be part of a project code-named Project Eleven, after the main character in Netflix&apos;s Stranger Things.</p><p>Two Fitbit employees familiar with the plan told Business Insider that the goal is to "help older kids form healthy relationships with their phones and social media."</p>

<ul><li>Google Search app for iPhones brings a new shortcut to trigger a Google Lens shortcut not too unlike Circle to Search.</li><li>iPhone users with the Action button can trigger the Google Lens feature by assigning the shortcut.</li><li>Other iPhones can use the feature by assigning it to double/triple-tap shortcuts in accessibility settings.</li><li>A Chrome version of Circle to Search (or something similar) is also being tested on the web browser.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s Circle to Search is built upon the search giant’s already popular Google Lens feature. While it is designed to be convenient to access on Android devices, it hasn&apos;t been made available for iPhones, which will likely change with the new workaround.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/07/google-lens-circle-to-search-iphone/">9to5Google</a>, the latest iPhones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, users can now assign a shortcut to the Action Button to take a screenshot of the current screen and open it in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens</a> app for analysis. While it&apos;s not exactly the same methodology as Circule to Search, it effectively gets the same job done.</p><p>You can check out the video of the shortcut in action posted by 9to5:</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qZ03BB9UKmY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>This also works for older iPhones that don&apos;t have the Action Button. Using the Back Tap gesture in the accessibility settings on the iPhones, the same functionality can be assigned as a shortcut. To trigger the shortcut, users can either double or triple-tap on the back of their iPhones.</p><p>After capturing the screenshot and is opened via Google Lens, users will be able to copy text, translate it, or do a visual search just like they do <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> on Android phones. However, it is limited to that, and users still can&apos;t perform Circle to Search&apos;s iconic ability to circle or squiggle the stuff they want to find on the screenshot. </p><p>Yet, having the ability to access Circle to Search functionality with a simple shortcut is still a convenient addition for iPhone users, especially since not everyone is taken with the method to activate the feature on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p><p>But the iPhone isn&apos;t the only place that&apos;s adding quick access to Google Lens magic. Another variation was also spotted in Google Chrome as an experimental feature, with Lens gaining a new animation, per X user Leopeva 64. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/3) The new Lens UI in Chrome now has an animation that is similar to what you see when you activate Android's "Circle to Search" (in case there was any doubt that this feature will be Chrome's version of "Circle to Search"):https://t.co/XQGSzmicpt pic.twitter.com/NSXoILdoRT<a href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64/status/1787938494905467100">May 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>As seen in the shared video, when the Lens UI icon is clicked, the page turns blurry, aided by a Google Lens icon attached to the mouse pointer where users can squiggle on the page to perform a Google Lens search. It appears to be some Chrome version of Circle to Search, which should be handy when the rollout happens to be official.</p><p>It&apos;s not clear when that will rollout, but perhaps we&apos;ll hear something soon at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024">Google I/O 2024</a>, which is less than a week away.</p>
