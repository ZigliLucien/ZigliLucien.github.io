If they weren&apos;t made by aliens, then they must have been made by AI. Movies like The Matrix or shows and books like "3 Body Problem" all use this crux as a way to explain how a human with finite resources could somehow make something that feels so infinite.</p><p>Look at any of the biggest games, and you&apos;ll quickly understand what I&apos;m talking about. GTA V, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Starfield all feature massive virtual worlds that eventually end and largely have some sort of odd restrictions within them. It all comes down to a real-life three-body problem: human time, skill, and money.</p>

<p>But something like No Man&apos;s Sky, which is procedurally generated and therefore quite literally <em>infinite</em>, gives us a look at what a fully generative AI-based game could look like and how this tool could solve the problem in one fell swoop. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nomanssky.com/orbital-update/">latest update</a> is a masterclass in development, showing how you can add new systems and items to never-ending worlds to make them deeper and even more complex. No Man&apos;s Sky doesn&apos;t use generative AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-gen-ai-model-video-recommendations">like Meta</a> or Google do, but it uses an algorithm that can feel similar to building the worlds you explore in the game.</p><p>And it doesn&apos;t stop with open-world titles. Generative AI plays a huge part in making metaverse-style games like VR Chat and Rec Room accessible to more people. It makes it far easier to build your own worlds and places, removing the cost and tools that professional developers use to craft exquisite games. A few games are giving us a glimpse of this future, and as we&apos;ve seen plenty of times before, science fiction is driving our vision of what future VR games will look like.</p>
<h2 id="the-3-body-problem-2">The 3 Body Problem</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hDFhoF8FeQvnSQPEpUMvWP" name="3-body-problem-vr-headset.jpg" alt="A man wearing the unique headset from 3 Body Problem on Netflix" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hDFhoF8FeQvnSQPEpUMvWP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While sites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/24108802/3-body-problem-vr-headset-review">The Verge</a> have been focused on the VR headset in the new Netflix show "3 Body Problem," I&apos;m far more interested in the virtual worlds experienced by the show&apos;s characters. These worlds are realistic and convincing. They feature dynamic content unlike anything we&apos;ve seen in modern games, and they represent a leap I think can only occur once we fully embrace generative AI in gaming.</p><p>Many gamers love their AAA games — titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Spider-Man 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and The Last of Us: Part II — but they all have a huge problem in common. They require hundreds of millions of dollars, teams of hundreds of people, years of development, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/if-working-overtime-on-aaa-games-with-giant-budgets-is-the-only-way-to-succeed-then-maybe-the-industry-deserves-to-die-says-rpg-veteran-david-gaider-there-is-another-way-to-be/">bookoo overtime hours</a>. None of this is sustainable, and it&apos;s absolutely out of reach for the vast majority of development studios.</p><p>The problem compounds itself when you think about a game like Rec Room, VR Chat, or Roblox, titles that rely almost entirely on user-created content to keep players interested and coming back regularly. While all three of those examples feature tools that help players and would-be creators make their own worlds, these tools may require more time and effort than you have as an individual. That&apos;s where generative AI comes in.</p>

<p>Late in 2023, the popular social game Rec Room posted about how its new generative AI tools could help creators make even better worlds. Most player-made Rec Room worlds are visually simple and typically rely on placing pre-made assets in different ways to mimic the look of more complex objects, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.recroom.com/posts/fractura">Fractura</a> is different.</p><p>The team at Rec Room used a series of generative AI tools to make a world substantially more complex than anything I&apos;ve ever seen in Rec Room, and the performance of the game on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a> certainly proved that. Part of the problem is that the assets in-game aren&apos;t performance optimized, but that and many other explanations are offered when you walk around the virtual world.</p>

<p>Apart from some impressive visuals made by generative AI tools and placed by human hands is a fire sprite that poses questions using ChatGPT. The idea is that players would hang around the sprite and use it as a conversation starter to break the ice in what could otherwise be an awkward social situation.</p><p>I&apos;m an introvert at heart and don&apos;t typically start up conversations with strangers, but a tool like this would certainly make that easier! Not only that, but being able to come up with a world concept and spend just a few hours making it with these new tools is a lot more attractive than needing to put hundreds (or thousands) of hours into more traditional methods. Ironically, Google is already pushing developers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gcd-2024-google-pushes-devs-toward-genai-living-games">to do exactly this</a>.</p><p>Because of this, player-made content is about to see a massive boost in quality and quantity, and it follows on the heels of more accessible development environments from engines like Unity and Unreal.</p><p>But what if you&apos;re not interested in making your own games? Generative AI can still play a part in enhancing your gaming experience in surprising ways. Last year, Golf Plus, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>, teased an update that uses a ChatGPT-powered virtual caddy to create courses specifically tailored to help you conquer a problem.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🤯AI caddy is 🔥Totally convinced that this is the future of interaction in #VR!Huge shoutout to @batwood011 and @SindarinTech for getting the API ready in record time.

<p>Golf Plus creator Ryan Engle told me the update still "isn&apos;t ready for prime time" but that the team uses "it for inspiration and our in-game medals." Engle has been extremely positive about the concept of an AI-driven caddy to help players and has openly stated that he feels this is the future of interaction in games.</p><p>Similarly, Nvidia&apos;s virtual characters have already seen massive improvements in just a few months, graduating from what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/24031687/nvidia-ai-npcs-convai-ces-2023">The Verge called</a> "a fairly unconvincing canned demo" to something that "exceeds what I expect from the average denizen in &apos;The Elder Scrolls&apos; or &apos;Assassins Creed&apos;."</p><p>That&apos;s not to say that AI needs to entirely replace what human hands and voices have been creating for decades. I think there&apos;s still a very real place for human developers and voice actors in video games, particularly if we&apos;re talking about main characters. But, as I said before, humans have finite resources and, often, things like in-game NPCs are the first things to showcase that limitation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Vr2tx9rYtJ2t4R4FjsfAKS" name="Assassins-Creed-Nexus-screenshot-greece-party.jpg" alt="Disguising myself in a party in Ancient Greece in Assassin's Creed Nexus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vr2tx9rYtJ2t4R4FjsfAKS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That brings me back full circle to the virtual worlds in "3 Body Problem." It&apos;s clear that the aliens in the story can&apos;t stop time or alter it in any meaningful way, so that means they probably had the help of some super intelligent AI when creating the realistic world the story&apos;s scientists encounter when putting on that iconic shiny headset.</p><p>But this isn&apos;t a game full of just AI-controlled NPCs or procedurally-generated worlds. It&apos;s also filled with human players — much like No Man&apos;s Sky — who can explore and solve problems on their own without impacting the experience of others. If anything, their presence enhances the impact by creating an even more believable game to play.</p><p>We&apos;re at the very beginning of our journey with generative AI, and while it can be scary to some folks — myself included as a journalist — this technology has the potential to substantially positively impact the lives of so many people who will inevitably use it in the future.</p><p>Some game developers have worried about their own jobs when these tools evolve, but I don&apos;t think these will be tools to completely replace humans. These tools will be the building blocks of bigger and even better things, allowing us to expand the possibilities of gaming beyond the scope of human time, effort, and money. If nothing, that&apos;s how you solve a real-life three-body problem.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's April 2024 update is starting to reach some Galaxy S24 devices with security fixes and other improvements.</li><li>While the update brings support for 480p resolution Instant Slow-Mo videos, other camera improvements are unclear. </li><li>The monthly security patch is arriving ahead of schedule and comes in at a size of 818MB. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s monthly security update is reaching some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> devices already in the U.S., following early rollouts in other regions. The April 2024 update became available on a few of Android Central&apos;s devices starting Wednesday, March 27, bringing security patches and bug fixes. While not explicitly stated in Samsung&apos;s changelog, the April 2024 update could fix some of the Galaxy S24 series&apos; persistent camera issues. </p><p>The update comes in at 818MB, but not much is revealed by the official changelog. Samsung only provides vague references to improved stability, reliability, and security coming with the April 2024 patch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:235px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.02%;"><img id="YRU4hSrjLvkKSq39tPn3aT" name="April-Update-S24-Screenshot.jpg" alt="The update page for Samsung's April 2024 security update." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRU4hSrjLvkKSq39tPn3aT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="235" height="510" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This differs from other regions, like South Korea, where Samsung specifically outlined camera improvements that were included in the April 2024 update. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/갤럭시-s/소식공유-갤럭시s24울트라-업데이트-있습니다/td-p/26170917" target="_blank">post</a> on Samsung&apos;s community forums, a user shared the changelog for the April 2024 update in South Korea on a Galaxy S24 ultra smartphone. These fixes include better white balance and exposure, low-light photography, color accuracy, text clarity, and support for 480p resolution in Instant Slow-Mo video. </p><p>Some of these improvements, such as color accuracy and text clarity, specifically apply to the ExpertRAW camera app. </p><p>Android Central confirmed that the U.S. version of the April 2024 update does indeed bring Instant Slow-Mo support to videos with a 480x480 resolution. This does not necessarily confirm that all the other camera improvements are also available in the April 2024 update in the States. However, it means at least one of them was included in the update but not the changelog.</p><p>To check if your Samsung Galaxy S24 smartphone has received the over-the-air April 2024 security patch, open the settings app and navigate to the software update page. If it appears, start downloading the update — which can range from about 600MB to 900MB, depending on your region. After the update downloads, follow the on-screen prompts to install it on your device. </p>

<ul><li>Google's decision to bring Gemini Nano to Pixel 8 users comes as a surprise, considering its initial stance against it for regular Pixel 8 devices.</li><li>The update introduces two useful features: Summarize in Recorder and Smart Reply in Gboard.</li><li>The additions will be included in the next Pixel Feature Drop, offering Pixel 8 and 8 Pro users an enhanced experience without requiring an internet connection.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google just announced that Gemini Nano is coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> users as a developer preview in the next Pixel Feature Drop. This new update brings two handy features: Summarize in Recorder and Smart Reply in Gboard.</p><p>Google&apos;s change of heart is quite a surprise. The search giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-not-getting-gemini-nano">initially stated that Gemini Nano wouldn&apos;t be available for the regular Pixel 8</a>. This decision understandably disappoints those who opted for the cheaper Pixel instead of the Pro.</p><p>The Mountain View-based company notes that it has noticed a ton of enthusiasm from users and developers ever since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> became the pioneer smartphone to receive Gemini Nano last year.</p><p>Google explains that running large language models on phones with varying memory specifications can result in different user experiences. That&apos;s why the company has been rigorously testing this on Pixel 8.</p><p>The goal is to offer more enthusiasts and developers the chance to experiment with Gemini Nano in hopes of gathering more feedback.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> might be Google&apos;s largest and most powerful large language model (LLM) yet, but it&apos;s more suited for data centers than your phone. However, with Gemini Nano, Google is aiming to strike a balance. It created a scaled-down version of the LLM that can run directly on your device, even offline.</p><p>If you own a Pixel 8 or 8 Pro, you&apos;re in for a treat with two new features powered by Gemini Nano: the auto-summarization feature in the Recorder app and the <em>Smart Reply</em> feature in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/top-gboard-tips-and-tricks">Gboard</a>. These additions will be included in the upcoming Pixel Feature Drop. Since the model runs directly on the device, both features work offline, ensuring they feel speedy and intuitive.</p><p>On-device AI models like Gemini Nano have a dual purpose: they keep sensitive user data on the phone and provide AI features even offline. Google emphasized Gemini and its different versions during the Pixel 8 series launch, so it&apos;s great to see the company now implementing this AI technology in its latest flagship devices instead of limiting it to just one model.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>UGREEN is launching more products than Xiaomi these days, and the Chinese accessory maker is aggressively branching out into new categories. It debuted a 13-in-1 docking station at the start of 2023, and it had plenty to offer — dual HDMI ports, 100W PD charging, and all the USB ports you need.</p><p>UGREEN is building on that with the introduction of the Revodok Max 213. The key addition here is the introduction of Thunderbolt 4, and that makes the docking station much more versatile. It also has a metallic chassis that looks much better, and you get even more ports. Thunderbolt 4 connectivity gives you a usable bandwidth of 40Gbps, and the dock is able to drive dual 4K monitors at 60Hz or a single 8K monitor.</p><p>Retailing for $399, the Revodok Max 213 is one of the costlier options in this category, but it isn&apos;t short on features.</p>

<p>UGREEN launched the Revodok Max 213 back in December 2023, and the docking station is now available globally. It retails <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Revodok-Thunderbolt-Docking-Charging/dp/B0CM2X8ZNS">for $399 on Amazon</a> as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ugreen.com/products/ugreen-revodok-max-213-docking-station">UGREEN&apos;s website</a>, and the brand is offering a 20% discount when you use the code <strong>dl25054</strong>, bringing the price down to a much more reasonable $319.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ugreen-revodok-max-213-design"><span>UGREEN Revodok Max 213: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dbASy4p5pgvCVCoFYn9q7L" name="ugreen-revodok-max-213-1.jpg" alt="UGREEN Revodok Max 213 Thunderbolt 4 dock review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbASy4p5pgvCVCoFYn9q7L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Revodok Max 213 has the same design as other UGREEN products, so you get a matte grey chassis that doesn&apos;t grab too much attention. The design is understated, and the clean lines make it look much more elegant than the plastic-clad <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-13-in-1-docking-station-review">Revodok Pro 13-in-1 docking station</a>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2Shpo7xuwYtBypGXegsxwL" name="ugreen-revodok-max-213-5.jpg" alt="UGREEN Revodok Max 213 Thunderbolt 4 dock review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Shpo7xuwYtBypGXegsxwL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the best feature is that the docking station can be used vertically or horizontally; there are rubber feet at the bottom and on one side, and it makes the Revodok Max 213 that much more versatile. It also ensures that the dock doesn&apos;t move around in either orientation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Yp57NKwTZKvCzUTNWLFu6M" name="ugreen-revodok-max-213-7.jpg" alt="UGREEN Revodok Max 213 Thunderbolt 4 dock review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yp57NKwTZKvCzUTNWLFu6M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also like that there&apos;s a power button — just like the Revodok Pro — and this makes it easy to switch off power to connected devices in one go. There&apos;s Thunderbolt branding on the side, and the docking station uses a slotted design to deliver passive airflow. Overheating isn&apos;t an issue whatsoever, and UGREEN did all the right things on the design front.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kDTR4zaApbGTjn38m2vUpU" name="ugreen-revodok-max-213-14.jpg" alt="UGREEN Revodok Max 213 Thunderbolt 4 dock review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kDTR4zaApbGTjn38m2vUpU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a lot on offer with the Revodok Max 213, so let&apos;s start with the Thunderbolt ports. You get an upstream Thunderbolt 4 port with 40Gbps bandwidth that also has 90W USB PD charging, so you can connect a notebook and charge it at the same time. The dock has two downstream Thunderbolt ports — which utilize the combined 40Gbps throughput — and you can daisy-chain these ports to connect up to six devices in total.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="N8G5m5jR9ezrGSDYcqZubU" name="ugreen-revodok-max-213-11.jpg" alt="UGREEN Revodok Max 213 Thunderbolt 4 dock review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N8G5m5jR9ezrGSDYcqZubU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a DisplayPort 1.4 port that goes up to 8K at 30Hz or 4K at 60Hz. I would have liked an HDMI port, but you don&apos;t get one here — you&apos;ll have to make do with the Thunderbolt and DisplayPort connectors. What you get instead is a 2.5GbE Ethernet port, and if you have a multi-Gigabit internet connection, you can take advantage of that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rUDYfnMBihtCJxDPmPnNTb" name="ugreen-revodok-max-213-15.jpg" alt="UGREEN Revodok Max 213 Thunderbolt 4 dock review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rUDYfnMBihtCJxDPmPnNTb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>UGREEN bundles two USB-A 3.0 ports at the back, and these go up to 5Gbps each. There are two USB-A ports at the front as well, but they utilize the USB 3.2 standard and go up to 10Gbps. Rounding out the USB ports, there&apos;s a single USB-C connector up front that has 10Gbps bandwidth and charges at up to 20W. In addition to USB connectivity, you get an SD card reader, MicroSD card reader, and 3.5mm jack.</p>

<p>The Revodok Max 213 is powered via a 180W brick, and this is where UGREEN&apos;s proficiency with GaN chargers comes in handy — the charging brick is significantly smaller than what you get with any other dock.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="D73iTj7RJxLkH8LePcLhLU" name="ugreen-revodok-max-213-10.jpg" alt="UGREEN Revodok Max 213 Thunderbolt 4 dock review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D73iTj7RJxLkH8LePcLhLU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Revodok Max 213 utilizes the full bandwidth of Thunderbolt 4, and I didn&apos;t see any issues whatsoever when connected to a Windows machine with Thunderbolt connectivity. It did a terrific job transferring data and driving a 4K monitor, and while I didn&apos;t need to use the charging potential of the dock as much, the USB PD 90W charging claims hold up in real-world use.</p>
<p>The only caveat is that the dock won&apos;t be able to drive an 8K monitor if you&apos;re using a MacBook with the M1/M2/M3 silicon. There&apos;s no limitation with Windows, and the dock is able to drive an 8K monitor over Thunderbolt 4 or DisplayPort without any hassle. I don&apos;t have an 8K monitor at hand, but I didn&apos;t see any problems using the dock with a 4K monitor.</p>

<p>If you need to charge via the other ports, the Thunderbolt 4 ports go up to 15W each, and the USB-A ports at the back have the ability to charge devices at up to 7.5W. The only downside is that you get just a single USB-C port — located at the front — and I think UGREEN should have added at least one more. That said, the USB-C port also leverages USB PD tech and goes up to 20W, and I was easily able to charge devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>.</p>

<p>The CalDigit TS4 continues to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/best-thunderbolt-4-hubs-docks">best Thunderbolt 4 docking stations</a>, offering 18 ports in total. You get more USB-A and USB-C ports, 2.5GbE connectivity, and it charges at up to 98W. It costs the same as the Revodok Max 213, and it is a good overall option to consider.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a dock that looks good and is built to last</li><li>You need plenty of Thunderbolt 4 ports</li><li>You need a dock that charges at 90W</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a dock with HDMI connectivity</li><li>You want the best value</li><li>You need more than one USB-C port</li></ul>
<p>The Revodok Max 213 looks better than just about any other dock today, and while that isn&apos;t a consideration, it&apos;s clear that UGREEN put a lot of thought into the design. There are zero issues with the build quality as well, and the metal chassis means the docking station is guaranteed to last.</p><p>While I would have liked some more USB-C ports and HDMI connectivity, the Revodok Max 213 has a decent set of ports in general, and if you have a Thunderbolt-enabled notebook, it has plenty to offer. You even get 90W charging out of the upstream Thunderbolt port, and that negates the need to connect any other cable to your notebook.</p><p>You&apos;re not getting the best value here, but if you need a high-quality Thunderbolt 4 dock that does a terrific job in daily use, you can&apos;t go wrong with the Revodok Max 213.</p>

<ul><li>Users can now quickly report Gboard glitches with a simple tap using the "Quality Bug Report" shortcut.</li><li>The feature is currently rolling out in the latest Gboard beta release for various Android phone models, indicating a broader availability soon.</li><li>Previously, reporting bugs required navigating through settings, but now it's just two taps or a single press with the shortcut.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>You can now snitch on annoying Gboard glitches with a super quick tap.</p><p>The latest addition to Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-keyboard-android">keyboard app</a> is a new "Quality Bug Report" shortcut, allowing users to give feedback directly to the Gboard team more easily than before, as first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/22/gboard-quality-bug-report/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>This new feature is now being rolled out in the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/top-gboard-tips-and-tricks">Gboard</a> beta release for various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> models, including the Pixel phones, the Galaxy S22 series or later, and even Chinese models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/infinix-note-40-series-launch">recently launched Infinix Note 40 series</a>. This suggests a wider rollout, and it should be available for everyone soon.</p><p>Before, reporting bugs meant navigating through Gboard settings to reach <em>Help & feedback</em>, then <em>Send feedback</em>. Now, it&apos;ll only require two taps by default, or even quicker with a single press if you drag "Quality Bug Report" to the shortcuts toolbar.</p><p>If you&apos;re not part of the beta program but still want to report an issue or suggest something to Google about Gboard, you&apos;ll have to go through the aforementioned steps.</p><p>Once this beta feature goes public, the entire process will speed up for everyone. When you submit a report, the system will automatically add "Quality bug report:" to the start of your feedback. This handy tag helps Google&apos;s team quickly sift through and tackle user-raised issues.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>UGREEN is known for its GaN chargers and power banks, and over the last 12 months the Chinese manufacturer branched out into docking stations, power stations, and a variety of accessories. Now, UGREEN is making its debut into what is possibly its most ambitious category yet: NAS servers.</p><p>Dubbed the NASync series, UGREEN is rolling out six models at launch: a 2-bay DXP2800, 4-bay DXP4800 and DXP4800 Plus (which I&apos;m reviewing), a 6-bay DXP6800 Pro, an 8-bay DXP8800 Plus, and a 4-bay DXP480T Plus that uses all-flash storage. The 2-bay and 4-bay models are aimed at home users, with the 6-bay and 8-bay servers targeted at businesses and enthusiast users. I&apos;ll get to the Pro models a little later, and considering they have Intel Core i5 hardware, there&apos;s clearly a lot on offer.</p><p>But right now, it&apos;s the DXP4800 Plus that stands out in the brand&apos;s portfolio. This 4-bay NAS is powered by the Intel&apos;s Alder Lake-based Pentium Gold 8505, comes with 8GB of RAM as standard, has a 128GB SSD installed out of the box, and has four HDD drive bays in addition to two M.2 slots. And there&apos;s a 10GbE port along with a 2.5GbE port at the back, and there really isn&apos;t much missing on the hardware side of things.</p><p>What you&apos;ll really like is the pricing; UGREEN is taking the unconventional route of crowdfunding, and the DXP4800 Plus can be bought for just $419 as a result. I can&apos;t think of another 4-bay NAS with this caliber of hardware that&apos;s available for under $550, and while there&apos;s usually a downside to backing a relative unknown brand, UGREEN has its bases covered.</p><p>I used the DXP4800 Plus for just over two weeks, and here&apos;s why you should consider the NAS server if you&apos;re looking to upgrade. </p>

<p>UGREEN unveiled the NASync series on March 26, and the products are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/urgreen/ugreen-nasync-next-level-storage-limitless-possibilities">now available on Kickstarter</a>. You can back the DXP4800 Plus for $419, and UGREEN mentions that the retail model will debut at $699 once it starts selling on its website and Amazon.</p><p>There&apos;s a standard DXP4800 that is powered by the Intel N100 platform, and it comes with the same four drive bays and two NVMe slots, but you get dual 2.5GbE ports instead. There&apos;s 8GB of RAM, 32GB of eMMC storage, and the same set of ports as the Plus model. The DXP4800 is going for $359, and it will cost $599 at retail.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CLxKWFDiAhVmH7egfDLC3g" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-2.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CLxKWFDiAhVmH7egfDLC3g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>UGREEN&apos;s products have a distinct design aesthetic, with the brand favoring a metallic grey color scheme. The DXP4800 Plus has a similar aesthetic, and it ends up looking elegant. The chassis is made out of aluminum, and it is clearly built to last — it has a reassuring heft to it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Z5ZgEnppNT3zy74kFFZA5h" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-8.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z5ZgEnppNT3zy74kFFZA5h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I would have liked to see vented sides to deliver passive airflow, but other than that quibble, I don&apos;t have any issues on the design front. The drive trays are numbered, and there&apos;s a single fan at the back that&apos;s covered by a dust filter. While most NAS servers use this fan as the exhaust, it works as an intake on the DXP4800 Plus, with hot air blowing out the front in between the drive trays. The fan itself is quiet, and it isn&apos;t audible even when the NAS is under load; the HDDs are noisier by some margin.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4bVxAzTyawcB4aKhkVuFEh" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-9.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4bVxAzTyawcB4aKhkVuFEh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Talking about HDDs, the DXP4800 Plus has four drive bays, and you can easily install 3.5-inch drives without any tools. UGREEN has a pretty cool mechanism that uses a lever to extend the height of the drive tray, allowing you to slot in an HDD. It is an overengineered solution to a problem that didn&apos;t need solving, but it looks cool nonetheless.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KNvUdGN2NtoYCUxhjoE3Yh" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-10.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KNvUdGN2NtoYCUxhjoE3Yh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t see any slots for mounting a 2.5-inch SATA SSD, so if you&apos;re thinking of using flash storage, you&apos;ll need to rely on the dual M.2 slots that are located at the underside. The power button is located below the drive bays, and you get status LEDs next to it; there&apos;s also an SD card reader, a USB-C, and USB-A connectivity at the front.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="R79aTQ7bUQ89yicgJz97bg" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-5.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R79aTQ7bUQ89yicgJz97bg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s UGREEN branding on both sides, but it meshes into the design and is barely noticeable. On the whole, I think UGREEN did a great job with the design of the DXP4800 Plus, and the NAS server looks good and has excellent build quality.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ugreen-dxp4800-plus-connectivity-and-hardware"><span>UGREEN DXP4800 Plus: Connectivity and hardware</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aBypRNb4mGBRL4sjnbkvHk" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-12.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aBypRNb4mGBRL4sjnbkvHk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to connectivity, there&apos;s plenty to like on the DXP4800 Plus. There are dual USB 2.0 ports along with a USB 3.2 port at the back, and you get an HDMI port that lets you connect the NAS to a TV. You can always stream media from the NAS via DLNA, but HDMI makes things easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sRDNYsb7tiSUrvPpgPwuhj" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-13.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sRDNYsb7tiSUrvPpgPwuhj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The DXP4800 Plus has a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port alongside a 10 Gigabit port, and you don&apos;t really see many enclosures in this segment that have 10GbE connectivity. Like I said, there really isn&apos;t much missing in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Cw9CC4W5jyTNunNSaLugzh" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-21.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cw9CC4W5jyTNunNSaLugzh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The NAS comes with 8GB of RAM as standard, and there are two SO-DIMM slots on the underside, so you can easily add more memory should you wish to do so. The system is able to handle up to 64GB of RAM — 32GB in each slot — so there&apos;s no shortage of upgradability. You also get two M.2 2280 slots on the underside, and UGREEN bundled foam pads that do a good job managing thermals when you install an SSD.</p>
<p>You also get two Cat7 cables in the package, and that&apos;s an added bonus. The DXP4800 Plus is quite heavy on its own, but UGREEN uses an external power brick to drive the NAS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aT8iVtZcnrRfaCP57merMi" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-23.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aT8iVtZcnrRfaCP57merMi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the hardware, the DXP4800 Plus has what is arguably the best package in this segment. Intel&apos;s Pentium Gold 8505 is a tier above the Celeron N4125 and N5105 that&apos;s used in most NAS servers these days, and it has plenty of power to spare. As the software isn&apos;t quite ready just yet, I&apos;m not going to share detailed performance metrics — I&apos;ll do so in an update.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8Kcg8qESPkmYCEqd696rpi" name="ugreen-dxp4800-plus-17.jpg" alt="UGREEN NASync DXP4800 Plus NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Kcg8qESPkmYCEqd696rpi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, I transferred several hundred Gigabytes of data to the NAS and used it with M.2 SSDs over my 10GbE home network, and it handled transfers just as well as other 10GbE NAS servers I tested. There were two instances where the SMB share failed to show up, but a reboot solved the issue.</p>

<p>UGREEN sent me the DXP4800 Plus two weeks ahead of its Kickstarter debut, and the brand mentioned that the software is still in beta. That&apos;s an understatement; there are many issues with the UI, and weird translation errors throughout the interface, and it isn&apos;t close to being ready for consumer use as of writing.</p>
<p>That said, the UI itself looks clean, and it&apos;s clear that UGREEN is trying to emulate DiskStation Manager. Synology is the brand to beat in this area, so it&apos;s good to see UGREEN trying to copy from the best. Considering the state of the software, I&apos;m not going into too much detail, but you get a settings page that lets you tweak the fan settings, add and change user accounts, set up storage pools, and so on.</p>
<p>There&apos;s remote access as well, and you need a UGREEN cloud account to access the NAS from outside your home network. However, there&apos;s no way to enable 2FA on the account, so I wouldn&apos;t suggest setting it up until that feature is live. Also, while I created an account and signed in on day one, I wasn&apos;t able to get back in the next day — I had to register again using the same email address.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2591px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.03%;"><img id="3vA5LRY9Rrrj7i8ywESota" name="ugos.jpg" alt="UGREEN DXP4800 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vA5LRY9Rrrj7i8ywESota.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2591" height="1400" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s no icon management on the home screen, and other than dragging the icons around, you can&apos;t change much. The package center doesn&apos;t have many utilities; the Universal Search does a good job indexing the data stored on the NAS and pulling up useful information, but there is no native Plex client as of writing, or Docker containerization.</p><p>You don&apos;t even get a built-in media or audio service, and UGREEN notes that these are being added. While I didn&apos;t have any issues creating a storage pool with Seagate IronWolf drives, I got an error message a few days later stating the drives are incompatible; UGREEN said it won&apos;t impose any limitations around HDD use, and that all NAS HDDs should work without any issues.</p><p>I&apos;ll revisit this section once UGREEN rolls out software updates to the NAS, but as of now, know that the DXP4800 Plus doesn&apos;t have much to offer from a software point of view.</p>

<p>ASUSTOR&apos;s AS5404T is a good choice if you want a 4-bay NAS with powerful hardware and the ability to transcode Plex content. It is powered by the Intel Celeron N5105 platform, has 4GB of RAM, four M.2 slots, and dual 2.5GbE connectivity. ASUSTOR made a lot of changes to its software in the last 12 months, and you get a good UI along with a ton of useful features. Coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Asustor-AS5404T-Quad-Core-2x2-5GbE-Attached/dp/B0C5M8RMMM">in at $529</a>, the AS5404T is costlier than the DXP4800 Plus, and you miss out on 10GbE connectivity.</p><p>If you need the best software features, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a> is still a terrific choice. That said, the hardware is distinctly second-best; you only get Gigabit Ethernet ports, and while the Ryzen R1600 is plenty fast, it doesn&apos;t do transcodes. Retailing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1735213-REG/synology_ds923_4_bay_nas_enclosure.html">for $599</a>, the DS923+ is considerably costlier, and while you don&apos;t get the best hardware, the software is why you&apos;re paying a premium.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best 4-bay NAS hardware</li><li>You need 10GbE connectivity</li><li>You want the convenience of HDD storage as well as M.2 slots</li><li>You need plenty of memory and an easy way to upgrade down the line</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a native Plex client and Docker out of the box</li><li>You need secure remote access</li></ul>
<p>Overall, UGREEN has a strong showing with its NASync series, and the DXP4800 Plus has the potential to be one of the best 4-bay NAS servers around. The hardware clearly is in a league of its own, and you don&apos;t get the same feature-set on any other $500 NAS today. The fact that it features an Intel 8505 platform along with 10GbE connectivity gives the DXP4800 Plus a distinct edge.</p><p>The build quality is on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">best home NAS servers</a>, the enclosure is quiet in daily use, and 8GB of RAM is more than what you get in this segment. That said, UGREEN still needs to do a lot of work on the software front; there&apos;s no native Plex client or Docker containerization, and UGOS Pro is missing a built-in media and audio servers.</p><p>UGREEN clearly states that the software is in beta, and that it will roll out updates with new features in the coming weeks. I&apos;ll update this post once those features go live, but the little I&apos;ve seen on the software shows a lot of promise. While I&apos;m generally wary of recommending crowdfunded products, UGREEN is a brand with a proven history of delivering reliable products — I use its GaN chargers and docks throughout my home — so I&apos;m willing to recommend the DXP4800 Plus.</p><p>If you don&apos;t mind waiting a few weeks for the software features, the DXP4800 Plus is an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/urgreen/ugreen-nasync-next-level-storage-limitless-possibilities">easy recommendation at $419</a> — there&apos;s nothing else in this segment that gives you as good a value.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has been improving physical keyboards on Android, aiming for a desktop-like experience on any device. The company might introduce new keyboard features in the next version of Android to continue working toward that goal.</p><p>Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-physical-keyboards-3427661/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> dropped news about new keyboard features in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> Developer Preview 2. Apparently, the latest release includes three accessibility options for physical keyboards: <em>Sticky keys</em>, <em>Slow keys</em>, and <em>Bounce keys</em>. Sticky and bounce keys were already spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-2">Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2</a>, but the <em>Slow keys</em> option is brand new.</p><p>You can find the <em>Slow keys</em> option by heading to <strong>Settings</strong>, tapping on <strong>System</strong>, followed by <strong>Keyboard</strong>, and finally, <strong>Physical Keyboard</strong> under the <em>Accessibility section</em>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:337px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.55%;"><img id="eYH3cDVJF5u4ox9EA3jCk9" name="Android-15-physical-keyboard-features.jpg" alt="physical keyboard accessibility features in android 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eYH3cDVJF5u4ox9EA3jCk9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="337" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the <em>Slow keys</em> option, you can set how long you need to hold down a key before it registers. However, in Android 15 DP2, you can&apos;t tweak this duration just yet. Rahman, though, snooped around the latest preview&apos;s code and discovered that Google might allow for up to five seconds for this feature down the line.</p><p>As you might have guessed, when you turn on sticky keys and hit a modifier button like Alt, Ctrl, or Shift, it stays pressed down while you hit other keys. This makes it a breeze to press multiple keys at once for commands or to bang out keyboard shortcuts in rapid succession.</p><p>But with bounce keys, it stops you from registering super-fast presses of the same key.</p><p>These new options are a real game-changer for people with physical disabilities. Android 15 might make it way easier for them to use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-external-keyboards-android-tablets">physical keyboard</a>, whether it&apos;s on their tablets or when their phones are in desktop mode.</p><p>Google is throwing these keyboard features into the mix as part of its plan to beef up Android and make it a serious rival to operating systems like Windows. Microsoft&apos;s desktop OS has been rocking these options for a while, so it&apos;s about time Android caught up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:337px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.55%;"><img id="rT25bumbYPyMG3ihu8Co4A" name="Android-15-physical-keyboard-preview.jpg" alt="Android 15 physical keyboard preview" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rT25bumbYPyMG3ihu8Co4A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="337" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apart from the fresh accessibility features, Android 15 also rolls out previews for keyboard layouts right on the keyboard settings screen. This is a big win for non-English keyboard setups because you can now easily check which characters are mapped to each key.</p>

<p>A new rumor suggests, consumers interested in Samsung&apos;s upcoming foldables may be in for the same old, same old.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/yabhishekhd/status/1772799264336605632">Abhishek Yadav</a> on X, Samsung&apos;s upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 were spotted on the 3C Certification website with the charger model number EP-TA800. More importantly, their listing suggests Samsung will continue to feature 25W charging on both of its foldables this year.</p>

<p>However, there may be a bit of hope as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-6-z-flip-6-certified-with-25w-charger/">SamMobile</a> notes that both foldables could arrive sporting swifter charging speeds. The publication states that a 25W charger is the default choice for regulator authorities when inspecting all of Samsung&apos;s Galaxy phones — tablets, too. Devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> were reportedly tested with a 25W charger but the device launched with support for 45W fast charging.</p><p>Only time will tell which way Samsung is interested in going.</p><p>For now, there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-larger-dual-batteries-rumor">other rumors</a> regarding the clamshell and book-style foldable&apos;s battery, which state an increase in size could occur. In January, the Korean OEM was rumored to have started testing a Flip 6 with a 1,097mAh and 2,790mAh pairing, bringing its total to nearly 4,000mAh. This would bring the clamshell to a battery capacity akin to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p><p>A capacity boost like this would give the Flip 6 a 300mAh advantage over last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>.</p><p>Most recently, the Flip 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-display-memory-rumors">was rumored</a> to feature a smoother cover display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a higher RAM option. Speculation continues to swirl about a budget "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-fe-may-drop-this-key-feature-to-bring-the-price-down">Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE</a>" that may drop its stylus to keep the price low. More concrete information will likely be revealed later this summer as speculation states Samsung could host its Unpacked event <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">even sooner</a> on July 10.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (Mar. 27), it was announced that Disney Bundle subscribers in the U.S. will now find "Hulu on Disney Plus" as its rollout begins.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.disneyplus.com/hulu-on-disney-plus-launches-today-in-the-us-for-bundle-subscribers">press release</a>, Hulu on Disney Plus merges both platforms&apos; streaming content libraries in one place. The company states subscribers will begin noticing Hulu titles, recommendations, sets, and collections on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a> without switching apps. Disney hopes this brings a more customizable and personal experience for users viewing content on their platform.</p><p>Additionally, standalone Disney Plus subscribers will find Hulu&apos;s content available via "upsell options" across multiple devices. This means users will find a "convenient" way to upgrade their plans to the Disney Bundle, starting at $2 more monthly.</p><p>The post reiterates that Disney Bundle plans begin at $9.99 per month. It&apos;s worth mentioning that Hulu on Disney changes nothing; both services are still available on their own if consumers desire.</p><p>Disney urges users to create profiles for those who will be watching and to check their settings to ensure they&apos;re finding the content they care for most.</p><p>Joe Earley, president of direct-to-consumer at Disney Entertainment, said, "[the] official launch of Hulu on Disney+ gives viewers even more opportunities to easily discover and enjoy thousands of titles all in one place, underscoring the extraordinary value of the Disney Bundle."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Disney Plus is launching a new campaign to commemorate Hulu&apos;s inclusion, beginning with a brand-new logo. The company states the rollout will include a new Disney Plus intro color palette that mixes Hulu&apos;s green with the former&apos;s legacy blue.</p><p>Moreover, the orchestral mnemonic (the sound during its animation) was reimagined by Ludwig Göransson, an Academy Award-winning composer.</p><p>Disney is also launching campaigns across social media platforms, digital spots during broadcasts, and more for on-site locations at the Disneyland Resort.</p><p>Disney Plus and Hulu have been running this merger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-and-hulu-merger-app-rolling-out">in beta since November</a>, and its rollout today makes it official. Users should begin noticing the availability of Hulu content on the Disney Plus app with the option to upgrade to a Bundle as the day progresses.</p>

<ul><li>The Verizon-owned carrier Visible has added some new perks to its Visible Plus plan, including free smartwatch coverage (Apple Watch only), one Global Pass day every month, and an unlimited mobile hotspot with twice the speed as before. </li><li>These changes are permanent and the price of the Visible Plus plan will remain the same ($45/month).</li></ul>
<p>It&apos;s no secret that Visible is one of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">wireless carriers</a>, but we just learned that the Verizon-owned company has permanently improved its best plan to be an even better deal for customers. </p><p>Starting today, the Visible Plus plan will include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visible.com/plans"><strong>some new features</strong></a> to enhance your wireless experience, such as free smartwatch coverage (Apple Watch only, unfortunately) and one free Global Pass day every month. All of the existing talk, text, and perks will remain unchanged, and the price of the Visible Plus plan will remain just $45 per month. </p>

<p>In addition to all of the perks and outstanding coverage that made Visible Plus <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">our favorite unlimited plan</a>, Visible is now throwing in free smartwatch service, an upgraded mobile hotspot, and one Global Pass Day per month to the data plan at no additional cost. </p>
<p>Sure, the changes aren't particularly dramatic, but if you were on the fence about switching to Visible, maybe this update will help.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.visible.com/plans" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="80ffd6ac-5912-4da0-8b9b-ced55ecceca4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Visible Plus: $45 per month, including new plan enhancements" data-dimension48="Visible Plus: $45 per month, including new plan enhancements">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Here is everything that the March 2024 update adds to the Visible Plus plan:</p>
<h2 id="1-one-global-pass-day-per-month-2">1. One Global Pass day per month</h2>
<p>Powered by Verizon, the Global Pass can be activated in the Visible app at any time and gives users unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of data across 140 countries worldwide. The 2024 update gives you one free Global Pass day per month, beyond which you can add more coverage by paying $10 per day. </p><p>The existing international features included in the Visible Plus plan — free calling in over 30 countries and texting in over 200 countries — will remain unchanged. </p>
<h2 id="2-increased-mobile-hotspot-speeds-2">2. Increased mobile hotspot speeds</h2>
<p>The Visible Plus plan already came with an unlimited mobile hotspot, but this update increases the data speeds from 5Mbps to 10Mbps at no additional cost.</p>
<h2 id="3-smartwatch-connectivity-apple-watch-only-2">3. Smartwatch connectivity (Apple Watch only)</h2>
<p>Although the March 2024 update doesn&apos;t benefit folks who own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a>, if you&apos;re a Visible user with an Apple Watch, your device service will now be covered by the Visible Plus plan (a $10 value). </p>
