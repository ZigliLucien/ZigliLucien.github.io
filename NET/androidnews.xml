                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Great smartwatch deals are in abundance this holiday season, and those looking for a great premium GPS watch are in luck right now. Amazon has launched a limited-time sale on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYFCZZ9F" target="_blank"><strong>Garmin Epix Pro Gen 2, offering 32% off</strong></a> and bringing the price down to its lowest point ever. To be sure, this deal was expected with the arrival of the newly launched Garmin Fenix, but you can't beat getting a premium last-gen smartwatch for a $350 discount.</p><p>As far as smartwatches go, the second-generation Garmin Epix Pro includes a super high-quality AMOLED screen, 16-day battery life, multi-band GPS for outdoorsy folks, and a broad range of health tracking, fitness, and map features. Originally launched in 2022, this configuration of the watch typically goes for $1,100, so getting it at such a steep discount might be a good option for those who don't mind a last-gen watch.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a premium smartwatch for under $1,000; long battery life is a major priority for you; you need a smartwatch with multi-band GPS.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you'd rather just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-dilemma-buy-the-epix-gen-2-for-an-all-time-low-usd500-off-or-shell-out-for-the-fenix-8">upgrade to the Garmin Fenix 8 </a>for even longer battery life with multi-band GPS; you're not quite ready to commit to the premium smartwatch price range.</p><p>The Garmin Epix Gen 2 is essentially a flagship Garmin watch, featuring a ton of useful features that users have liked over the years. For fitness users, it includes animated workouts, topographical maps, real-time stamina, and scoring methods for things like endurance and hill-running. It also features stress tracking, sleep monitoring, and the useful Garmin Coach feature that'll guide you toward your goals.</p><p>Those wanting the latest from Garmin will want to look at the recently launched Fenix 8, which has a few upgrades and a higher price tag. The main differences include an extra 10 hours of battery life when using multi-band GPS, a new UI, mic and speaker, and dynamic trip routing options. The Fenix 8 is normally only $100 more than this Epix Pro model, but this deal cuts a solid $350 off the purchase price—marking a great option for those seeking a premium smartwatch who don't want to drop over $1,000.</p><p>Garmin and many other brands also offer some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-and-fitness-trackers-gps">best GPS smartwatch </a>options on the market, so if you're not quite sold on the Epix Pro, there are several other options to choose from that may be worth looking at.</p><p>With that being said, this is a solid discount on an otherwise solid watch, and without sacrificing many of the features that come with a premium price tag.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If the European Commission gets its way, the distinct separation between the iOS and Android ecosystems could start to fade away. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/dma100204-consultation-proposed-measures-requesting-interoperability-apples-ios-and-ipados-operating_en" target="_blank">document</a> published Wednesday, Dec. 18, the European Union's European Commission detailed reasons why it thinks Apple should open up iOS and iPadOS to work better with competition devices.</p><p>For <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-2024-retrospective">Wear OS fans</a>, that could mean a world where you can AirDrop to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> or connect a Pixel Watch to an iPhone natively.</p><p>Basically, all those features that helped Apple create its "walled garden" ecosystem could be forced to become interoperable with Android and other platforms. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/document/download/8f28e456-5bd4-4b33-af95-b9f52aeb8a03_en?filename=DMA.100203%20-%20Overview%20of%20proposed%20measures.pdf" target="_blank">separate document</a>, the E.U. outlined the specific features that Apple should open up to third parties — and it's quite the list. AirDrop, the popular Apple file transfer service, is one massive inclusion. AirPlay, automatic audio switching, and media casting are a few others.</p><p>As an Android fan, it's hard not to get excited by the practical benefits of the E.U.'s suggestions. What if instead of needing to carefully make sure your phone, set-top box, and speakers were all compatible, they "just worked?" Or, if you could make AirDrop, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-likely-to-bring-android-quick-share-for-apple-devices">Quick Share</a>, AirPlay, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast">Google Cast</a> all interoperable. It sounds too good to be true, but if it <em>was </em>true, it'd change our novel conception of platforms and ecosystems as we know them.</p><p>The E.U. didn't put it this way, but the government is essentially trying to build a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> equivalent for mobile devices.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Matter is a unified standard supported by Apple, Google, Samsung, and others that aims to make all smart home devices work together. With a Matter device, you don't need to worry about whether a smart home product supports Apple Home, Google Home, or Samsung SmartThings. In theory, they should all work together.</p><p>There's a key difference between what the E.U. is trying to do and what the Connectivity Standards Alliance did with Matter, though. For starters, Matter is something that tech companies did of their own volition, not because they were forced to by a governing body. There isn't a ton of precedent for what the E.U. is trying to do in this situation. Apple has spent its own research and development money to develop great features, and the E.U. thinks the Android platform is entitled to them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DsBa2t3vEyHabPemsFwwK8" name="android-15-21.jpg" alt="Android 15 home page on Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsBa2t3vEyHabPemsFwwK8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For example, here's what the regulatory body had to say about AirPlay: "Apple shall implement an interoperability solution that provides third parties with access to the same AirPlay feature described in the preceding paragraph as available to Apple, in a way that is equally effective as the solution available to Apple."</p>
<h2 id="wait-the-e-u-wants-apple-to-do-what-2">Wait, the E.U. wants Apple to do what? </h2>
<p>As someone who has followed the tech industry for a while, that statement seems inconceivable. It sounds unreasonable to think that a tech company could be forced to make something it developed from scratch for its devices to be interoperable. The E.U. believes that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act's interoperability standards</a> require Apple to open up such features, but I'm not so sure. Even as an Android user standing to benefit from accessories and services working better with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, I can't help but wonder — is exclusivity ever okay?</p><p>To me, it is. Competition isn't about giving everyone the same resources and making every consumer electronics device exactly the same. It's about letting companies build their own products and ecosystems, thoughtfully making sure they don't use "lock-in" attempts to restrict consumer choice. If the market is functioning properly, brands like Apple, Samsung, Google, and others all have their own competing ecosystems. In the end, consumers choose which one they want to buy into.</p><p>It seems like the European Commission thinks that Apple is the only ecosystem-builder with exclusive features, since these documents single out the Cupertino-based company. That's far from the case. In fact, I'd argue that Samsung has objectively the best ecosystem, integrating everything from smartphones, to laptops, to home appliances. Samsung has gone on-the-record saying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-uis-next-release-is-delayed-and-samsung-wants-it-on-your-tvs-and-appliances">it wants One UI to reach TVs and appliances one day</a>.</p><p>Google isn't left out in the cold either. It's reportedly planning to merge Android and ChromeOS to build a software superpower. Smart home devices, phones, tablets, and laptops are all sold with the company's software. I'd go as far as to say that Google Cast is far more reliable in my smart home than AirPlay ever was — I can cast media from my Pixel phone, to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-max-review">Nest Hub Max</a>, to my Google TV HD in seconds without missing a beat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HxKwS6StM6dnQrFTEZkJVW" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-acer-chromebook-plus-spin-714-redmagic-nova-gaming-tablet-pixel-tablet-stacked" alt="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714, RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet, and Pixel Tablet all stacked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HxKwS6StM6dnQrFTEZkJVW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's the big misconception: Android doesn't need extra help. Quick Share is a viable alternative to AirDrop, and it's worth noting that Apple users regularly call AirDrop one of the least reliable Apple features to ever exist (this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8504389" target="_blank">official Apple support thread</a> is just one example). Google Cast is arguably a better version of AirPlay, with the latter being a feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/11it0up/airplay_is_the_worst/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a> routinely describe as "horrible."</p><p>Sure, if the E.U. successfully forces Apple to bring AirPlay, AirDrop, and other features to Android, it'll help the platform in the short term. Maybe it'll convince Apple users to switch, or perhaps it'll make it easier for Android users to stay. However, I think it'll hurt Android in the long run. The truth is, Android comes with a lot of great features — ones that I'm sure Apple users would love to have. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> is one that comes to mind immediately.</p><p>It'll go both ways. Eventually, it'll be Android that's forced to concede a killer feature to iOS. Instead of lawmakers forcing companies to give up their best features for free, I'd rather them focus on the real monopolistic practices these companies partake in. For example, regulators could make it illegal for Google to pay Apple billions to get Google Search as the default search engine on iOS. Or, they could stop Google, Apple, and Samsung from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources">discouraging or preventing sideloading</a>.</p><p>To be clear, there are a ton of things regulators could do to increase competition between major tech companies. Forcing platforms to give away their best features just isn't the way to do it. iOS and Android both have their strengths and weaknesses, and really, they don't need extra help to compete with each other. Make it easier for consumers to switch and freely choose their devices, and they'll vote with their wallets.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want simple, straight LED lights that can be customized via a mobile app; lightweight lighting options are a priority; you want something that can be made into a colorful display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for LED lighting that comes in a different shape than straight lines; you'd rather go with flat lighting panels.</p><p>Nanoleaf offers a ton of great smart lighting panel options in different shapes, but you can't really go wrong with straight lines that you can arrange into various shapes. This lines kit lets you adjust the lighting strips into 60-degree angles, for a broad range of geometric shape options that can be mounted almost anywhere. With 15 lines measuring about 11 inches each, this kit alone will cover a good amount of wall space without requiring you to buy a separate expansion—that is, unless you want an even larger lighting arrangement.</p><p>Choose from a handful of built-in scene presets, create your own look with a fully customizable RGB wheel, or just let the lights follow along with whatever sounds you're listening to. These plug into a standard outlet and they include simple mounting tape to make installation super easy. These go great with gaming PCs, or as standalone lighting pieces for any room, and it's hard to say no to $90 off.</p>

<ul><li>Google is seemingly working on a way to make initiating video calls faster in the Contacts app.</li><li>A tipster discovered that users can set a third-party app as their new default, which means starting a video call would be a tap away in your preferred app.</li><li>Google recently revamped its contact creation page, making it much faster to write down what matters most without all the clutter.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google was spotted working on bringing additional support to its Contacts app that will enhance existing support for video calls.</p><p>During a deep dive into Google Contacts by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-contacts-streamline-connected-app-video-calls-apk-teardown-3509916/">Android Authority</a>), the tipster found that the company is working to make initiating video calls quicker than before. According to the tipster, the Contacts app is currently testing a new long-press option alongside the ability to set a third-party app as your "default" calling avenue.</p><p>The APK teardown shows that, after opening a contact's profile page, users can long-press the video call icon, which will produce a new sub-menu. This menu holds all of the available ways you can video call someone. The default option is "carrier video calling," while other apps like Google Meet can be seen, too. If you've connected with that same contact in a third-party app, it will show in this new menu.</p><p>The tipster adds that this small "video call" menu lets you set an app as your default for video calls. In this case, AssembleDebug uses WhatsApp as an example, stating that if it's set as your default, your contact's video call button will have a mini WhatsApp logo on it.</p><p>This subtle change is said to streamline the process as users can quickly tap the video call button to communicate via their preferred app. The tipster notes that this is much quicker than the current way, which requires users to dive into the "Connected Apps" tab on their contact's saved profile page.</p>

<p>The post adds that if you've saved multiple phone numbers for a person, long-pressing the video call will display each alongside the app you can call them at.</p><p>This slight rework of the Google Contacts video calling method was spotted in version <strong>4.46.53.70</strong>. There's no clear indication at the moment of when users could see this arrive in the stable build.</p><p>This change seems certain to make usingWhat seems certain with this change is that it will help make a user's usage of third-party apps even easier. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Popular Android apps</a> like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> and Telegram both support video calls. This quick method of setting one as a default will help users who prefer those apps over the primary alternative, Google Meet.</p><p>Moreover, this small rework to video calling could pair well with the Contact app's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-just-gave-its-contact-creation-a-fresh-coat-of-paint">recent fresh coat of paint</a>. Google refreshed the process behind creating new contacts in the app, which incorporates a cleaner, more user-friendly approach to things. The key details are highlighted much sooner and more prominently when compared to the old way.</p><p>There is still the option of tinkering with those extra details; however, they're much further down and out of your way in an "Add fields" button.</p>

<p>Nothing has finally dropped the stable Nothing OS 3.0, its spin on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, with fresh features and smarter, shareable interactions.</p><p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-android-15-open-beta-start-detailed">kicking off its beta in November</a>, Nothing officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/22618-nothing-os-30-general-release" target="_blank">launched</a> Nothing OS 3.0. The timing is pretty clever, as Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-pushed-back-again">holding off on its Android 15 updates</a>, giving Nothing a chance to shine.

It smartly organizes the app drawer for easier app discovery and prioritizes your go-to apps for faster access and smoother performance.</p><p>Additionally, the beta for Shared Widgets brings a fresh way to stay connected, letting you interact with friends and family right from your customizable lock screen. That said, Shared Widgets only work on Nothing devices, and you can only share square Photo Widgets.</p><p>Nothing OS 3.0 also brings in some handy productivity widgets, like the Countdown Widget, to help with time management. Plus, the AI-powered Smart Drawer sorts your apps automatically, making everything easier to find and access.</p><p>You also get tons of lock screen customization options. It also spruces up Quick Settings, Pop-up view, visuals, and typography for a more polished experience.</p><p>To grab the update, just head to <strong>Settings </strong>> <strong>System Update</strong> on your Phone 2 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a>.

<ul><li>A report cites a recently published Samsung patent that filed a concept for a 'curved-edge' display.</li><li>The design of the device in question seems similar to an Ultra-level phone (like the S23 Ultra); however Samsung details new improvements for durability.</li><li>Samsung made such displays popular, but they came with issues for screen protectors and accidental touches for the user.</li><li>A recent leak showed off the Galaxy S25 Ultra and S25 Plus alongside a rumor that the series could debut on January 22, 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Thin, flat phones are all the rage, but a newly discovered Samsung patent suggests it could revert that narrative.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mspoweruser.com/future-samsung-galaxy-smartphones-may-have-curve-edged-displays-recent-patent-shows/">MSPowerUser</a>, Samsung recently published a new patent regarding a "new" phone design (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mspoweruser.com/future-samsung-galaxy-smartphones-may-have-curve-edged-displays-recent-patent-shows/">Android Headlines</a>). The design that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20240414859">the document</a> details isn't anything new as the Korean OEM reportedly filed a concept for a "curved-edge display" Galaxy phone. The initial illustration of this design looks familiar as we're able to note the slight curved-edge on its frame, which would (ideally) bend the display downward a touch.</p><p>Moreover, the drawing in question seems to suggest a curved display for an Ultra-level phone as it shows an S Pen in its slot on the left corner. Another illustration then shows the internal component structure to support the stylus and its slot.</p><p>Such a design would make sense for an Ultra model as Samsung has given that device specifically the curved treatment before.</p><p>The publication spotted another aspect of this recently published patent that concerns Samsung's apparent "improved durability" and "leak prevention assembly." The folks at Android Headlines state that the improved "leak" prevention likely regards the sealant used within the phone.</p><p>Regarding durability, Samsung is potentially working on a stronger display that, when curved like this, isn't so prone to damage.</p>

<p>There are no clear signs about whether or not we could see the return of this curved Galaxy phone design. The post speculates that this could fall into our hands for the Galaxy S26 or S27 series, but both are a long ways away.</p><p>Users haven't had such an obvious curved-edge display since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is ever-so-slight, but it was a move toward the flat display trend. Android Central once <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poll-flat-or-curved-display">polled its readers</a> about their preference between flat or curved display and the result was unanimously in favor of the former. While you could say Samsung popularized the curved display — and, for whatever reason they scream "premium" — these screens come with issues.</p><p>Screen protectors have a tough time conforming to such a curved structure and there's always the accidental touch when holding it.</p><p>With the Galaxy S25 series coming up, we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-to-come-on-january-22-2025-leaked-image-suggests">leaked renders</a> that continuously point toward a thin, flat era. It seems as though Samsung is doing this to better compete with Apple, which is something it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">done considerably in other areas</a>.</p><p>Nevertheless, the next flagship trio from Samsung is rumored to arrive on January 22, 2025.</p>

There are also no options for first-party keyboard attachments or styli, and folks looking for laptop-level power may want to consider one of the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablets</a>.</p><p>But with that being said, if you&apos;re a fan of the Google ecosystem and you just want something fun and capable enough to handle most tasks with ease, then the Pixel tablet is a winner.

<ul><li>After Google released its second Android 16 Developer Preview, a discovery was made about a new "screen-off fingerprint unlock."</li><li>Once toggled, the feature lets users unlock their devices without turning the display on first; however, it seems restricted to the Pixel 9 series.</li><li>Android 16 Developer Preview 2 brings enhancements to battery life and other areas of performance.</li><li>Android 16 is expected to arrive in Q2 2025, but a beta is said to begin in January.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google continues to push ahead with Android 16, but a recent discovery shows a new feature for its recent flagships.</p><p>The latest Developer Preview for the next major OS is here and Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-screen-off-fingerprint-unlock-3510174/">Android Authority</a>) found a new fingerprint function for Pixels. According to Rahman, the new "Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock" seems restricted to the Pixel 9, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL</a>. The feature exists within the Pixel settings for Fingerprint Unlock specifically under the "Device Unlock" page.</p><p>Opening this brings up the standard fingerprint credentials, such as which fingers you have on file for unlock.</p><p>However, under the "when using fingerprint unlock" line, Google has added the screen-off usage toggle in Android 16 DP 2. The company's on-device description reads, "use fingerprint unlock even when the screen is off."</p><p>Rahman offered a brief demo of this feature. When toggled on, users can place their thumb or finger on their display (when it's off) to unlock their device. Upon touching, the device's lock screen briefly shows to confirm the print before opening the app you last left open or your home screen.</p><p>What's more, it seems users must place their print (roughly) in the area of the lock screen's in-display fingerprint scanner. It's not clear if the device will pick up your biometrics if you're placing your thumb/index finger elsewhere on the device considering the scanner is placed lower-middle on the screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:441px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:136.05%;"><img id="3XzwyzTitA9MhiaL3As6s8" name="android-16-developer-preview-2-screen-off-fingerprint-toggle" alt="The Pixel 9 series could grab a "screen-off" fingerprint feature in Android 16." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3XzwyzTitA9MhiaL3As6s8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="441" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rahman adds that this feature <em>could </em>be exclusive to the Pixel 9 due to its addition of an ultrasonic scanner. This is a piece of technology Samsung popped into its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, too.</p><p>The first Android 16 Developer Preview arrived in November and testers are beginning to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-2-released">unravel their second helping</a>. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">first iteration</a> offered a glimpse into new features and APIs for Android 16, the second preview offers battery life and performance enhancements for devices. Google highlighted its improvement of "adaptive refresh rates," stating this should aid devices with battery life and improve visuals for apps.</p><p>Background tasks in Android 16 are getting a rework, too, with the company detailing how active apps gain stronger priority. Additionally, "outdated methods for prioritizing tasks" have been retired in this next OS version.</p><p>Google's earlier testing of the next Android OS is jarring, but it said as much during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-gemini-android-studio-sdk-updates">future of SDK Release</a> announcement. Android 16 is staring at a Q2 2025 release and, according to its timeline, that could happen sometime after April 2025. The first Android 15 beta is slated for January.</p>

The brand, still a minor player in the overall market for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, found recent success with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr line</a> of budget and flagship foldables. However, a patent dispute between Sony Ericsson and Motorola Mobility (owned by Lenovo) could eliminate the availability of Motorola handsets in the U.S., according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-trade-tribunal-finds-lenovo-smartphones-infringe-ericsson-patents-2024-12-17/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>.</p><p>In an initial ruling Tuesday, Dec. 17, a judge for the  U.S. International Trade Commission decided that Motorola's phones infringe on key 5G patents held by Sony Ericsson. The smartphones in question include those in the Moto G, Edge, and Razr lineups. If the initial ruling by the ITC stands, imports of Motorola phones in the U.S. could be banned, all but eliminating their availability.</p><p>The ITC will issue a final ruling in April 2025, and if its initial decision is upheld, a ban on Motorola phones in the U.S. is likely to happen. That would have ripple effects throughout the U.S. market, because Lenovo made up 14% of the country's mobile market share as of Q3 2024, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/us-smartphone-market-share/">Counterpoint Research</a>. Crucially, some of the brand's most successful smartphones are involved in the dispute.</p>

<p>Motorola's absence would leave a hole in the market, notably where clamshell foldables are concerned. There simply isn't another player making affordable foldables in the U.S. like Motorola did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Razr 2023</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a>. It's possible that instead of elevating a growing brand like OnePlus, a ban on Motorola phones would just make the big three of Apple, Samsung, and Google even more dominant.</p><p>In November 2024, one industry report indicated that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-and-oneplus-are-crucial-to-foldable-market">a major competitor in the foldable market was considering an exit</a>. Entering 2025, we could be down at least one foldable manufacturer if that report turns out to be accurate. Motorola could represent another, and it's possible that no one steps up to replace it. We could be back where we started, with Samsung as the only major clamshell foldable manufacturer and no need to innovate due to a lack of competition.</p><p>It seems like patent disputes in the mobile sector are becoming increasingly common. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-is-returning-to-europe-after-resolving-patent-disputes">OPPO and Vivo recently ended a dispute with Nokia</a> about 5G patents, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-another-patent-dispute-germany-report">OnePlus is now in hot water again in Germany</a> over a similar issue. While it's great that brands are being held accountable for their use of patents, it's a shame that these decisions only decrease the number of phones that are available for consumers.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-phones-could-be-banned-how-we-got-here-2">Motorola phones could be banned: How we got here</h2>
<p>If that sounds familiar, it should. In recent years, multiple Chinese brands have become involved in patent disputes surrounding their uses of 5G technology in smartphones. Notably, Motorola itself is fighting the same battle with Sony Ericsson in multiple markets. Initial court decisions in Brazil and Columbia already ruled in favor of Sony Ericsson, and more legal battles are taking place in South America and the United Kingdom, per Reuters.</p><p>How did we get here? The tide started to turn in Sony Ericsson's favor earlier this month when an ITC judge rejected Motorola's best defense against the patent infringement claims. Motorola said that a 2011 license agreement between it and Sony Ericsson covered use of Ericsson technology in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">Edge</a>, and Razr phones. In other words, the company isn't denying it used the technology — it's arguing that it was allowed to.</p><p>The problem with Motorola's claim is that the 2011 agreement was penned ages ago, before the company was sold to Google and then sold <em>again</em> to Lenovo. More importantly, a clause in the licensing agreement explained that Motorola would be able to use the licensed technology in "commercially reasonable updates or extensions of such Licensed products." The ITC judge ruled in favor of Ericsson, tossing aside Motorola's argument on the basis that none of the three phone lineups in question even existed at the time the 2011 agreement was reached (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ipfray.com/itc-judge-rejects-lenovos-most-important-defense-against-ericsson-2011-license-agreement-doesnt-cover-current-motorola-phones/" target="_blank">IP Fray</a>).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3806px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nVPhPeAAKVU6SCyLcmTgV8" name="Motorola-Razr-hands-on-1.JPG" alt="Motorola Razr colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nVPhPeAAKVU6SCyLcmTgV8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3806" height="2141" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola could explore other legal avenues to block the move — lawyers for Lenovo previously argued that the licensing agreement was covered by U.K. law, and suggested that the ITC should wait for U.K. courts to rule before issuing its own ruling. Of course, in light of the ITC's preliminary decision, that didn't happen. And if the ITC's ruling is upheld, Motorola phones could be off the shelves for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Three years after Samsung and Google announced their Wear OS partnership to save Android smartwatches from mediocrity, I'm happy to state the obvious: the gambit paid off, and Wear OS in 2024 was stronger than ever.</p><p>As a relative newcomer to Android watches, I wasn't around for this dismal pre-2021 era of Wear OS watches. When I looked back at editorials from old Android Central editors, I saw years of complaints about sluggish performance, mediocre fitness features, a stagnant app ecosystem for developers, and a general feeling that Google had no idea what it was doing and that Tizen, Fitbit, and Garmin offered better Android watches.</p><p>No one thinks that now. It's not that Galaxy and Pixel Watches are perfect, but they've become far more multifaceted, offering more than notifications and Google Assistant. You have more assurance that any watch you buy will get years of support, and you can see how Android OEMs like OnePlus see the potential of Wear OS and think it's here to stay (unlike other Killed-by-Google experiments).</p><p>Looking back on the path of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> in 2024, I'm optimistic that the best years of Android's wearable ecosystem are ahead.</p>

<h2 id="january-2024-fossil-gives-up-2">January 2024: Fossil gives up</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TL28cSJRE8wygXmpiTcxmR" name="Fossil-Gen-6-Hybrid-Wellness-Edition-review-outside-rain.jpg" alt="The Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid Wellness Edition on a wet surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TL28cSJRE8wygXmpiTcxmR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm starting off with the year's low point, in my mind: Fossil <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-group-quits-making-smartwatches">decided to stop making smartwatches in 2024</a>, after its Wear OS 3 and 3.5 updates took about a year longer than Google and Samsung's.</p><p>Aside from Mobvoi TicWatches stubbornly sticking around, Google's pre-Wear OS 3 clients have quietly given up on the brand, either unable to compete on software or not seeing the upside with Samsung dominating sales.</p><p>To remain relevant, Google and Samsung saw that Wear OS needed closer phone-watch integration and improved health tracking. The problem is that this focus leaves little room for Wear OS brands that don't have their own phones to sync software, or the ability to spend billions acquiring IP like Fitbit to compete.</p><p>Fossil gave us the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-gen-6-hybrid-wellness-edition-review">Gen 6 Hybrid Wellness</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/skagen-falster-gen-6-review">Skagen Falster Gen 6</a>, and other subbrand options from Michael Kors, Citizen, and Kate Spade; now we've lost that attention to classic-style design and any likely chance of hybrid Wear OS watches with more variety. Even if Google leaving Fossil behind was a necessity for Wear OS to grow, it's still a shame!</p>
<h2 id="february-oneplus-breathes-fresh-air-and-battery-power-into-wear-os-2">February: OnePlus breathes fresh air and battery power into Wear OS</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GFGAPLHKBfiJbiF35VzCtk" name="oneplus-watch-2-5.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 next to OnePlus 12" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GFGAPLHKBfiJbiF35VzCtk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Losing Fossil was easier to swallow because OnePlus took its place the following month, launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> in February and Watch 2R in July.</p><p>The Watch 2 has its issues, likely stemming from OnePlus using two different OSes — Wear OS and RTOS — that didn't always communicate perfectly. But it was also the coming-out party for Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Wear OS Hybrid Interface</a>, which relegates background tasks to the low-powered coprocessor to save battery life.</p><p>OnePlus's watch easily lasts 3–4 days without needing as massive a battery as a TicWatch, giving a cheaper option for anyone who didn't want to shell out the big bucks for a Galaxy Watch Ultra. And this focus on efficiency has paid off for Google and Samsung, too: Wear OS 5 has made their mainline watches last closer to two days in normal conditions when old Wear OS watches always required daily charges (and sometimes <em>twice</em>-daily).</p><p>I'll also cheat and bring up Xiaomi, which officially rejoined the Wear OS family in late 2023 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/xiaomi-watch-2-pro-official-wear-os-3">Watch 2 Pro</a>, a few years after its one ill-fated Wear OS Mi Watch in 2019. It then sold the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/xiaomi-watch-2-spotted-ahead-of-release">Watch 2</a> with Wear OS in February 2024. Now, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-wishlist">OnePlus Watch 3</a> already rumored for early 2025, it's telling that Chinese OEMs see the profitability in using Wear OS as their baseline after largely ignoring it for a decade.</p>
<h2 id="june-july-samsung-and-oneplus-bring-back-cheap-wear-os-2">June-July: Samsung and OnePlus bring back 'cheap' Wear OS</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vjetnPETsgh9LhrTVY3mZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-galaxy-watch-fe-5.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch FE with Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vjetnPETsgh9LhrTVY3mZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It doesn't take an industry expert to guess that Samsung designed the $199 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-launch">Galaxy Watch FE</a> as its spin on the Apple Watch SE, seeing a chance to target thrifty fans looking for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">cheap Android watches</a>. It gives you years of Wear OS updates for cheap, but I disliked how Samsung gave a 2024 watch a 2021 chip, making it feel last-gen from the start; I think it needed a newer Exynos chip, with cutbacks in other areas.</p><p>Then you have the $229 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>, which has the same chip, display, RAM, battery, and software as the Watch 2 for $70 less, cutting back on premium steel and more durable glass. Basically, it's the same watch, only a bit uglier, which is perhaps why it's not quite as cheap as the Watch FE: better components.</p><p>Even if I'm the kind of smartwatch power user who spends extra for quality, <em>most</em> people prefer something affordable without having to buy an older model; Wear OS getting more bargain-priced watches is a good sign that its market has grown outside of Android superfans.</p>
<h2 id="august-samsung-experiments-again-with-the-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">August: Samsung experiments again with the Galaxy Watch Ultra</h2>

<p>When ten generations of Apple Watches all look largely identical, you have to give props to Samsung for selling three separate Pro, Classic, and Ultra watches in three years, each with a distinct design and perks. The mainline Galaxy Watch design hasn't changed much, but one leak suggested Samsung might try a squircle display for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>.</p><p>The point is Samsung is willing to try new things and see what works; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> is the result. It's a stylish, rugged watch with a bright display, strong fitness performance, and (unfortunately) a higher-than-usual price tag. You can resent the fact that Samsung has started charging so much for a smartwatch, but it also didn't reserve that many killer features for it, meaning the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> is still appealing for features, just not as much for looks or battery. You won't feel too much FOMO if you skip the Ultra.</p><p>Hopefully, we'll see more "premium" smartwatches from Google, OnePlus, and other brands in the future, with designs that aren't quite so...techy.</p>
<h2 id="september-the-pixel-watch-3-closes-the-gap-with-samsung-2">September: The Pixel Watch 3 closes the gap with Samsung</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PqXZpoB9SLWbgwNXTMhvZh" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-app-drawer" alt="The Wear OS 5 app drawer on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PqXZpoB9SLWbgwNXTMhvZh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google's first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> had outdated hardware, limited Fitbit tools, short battery life, and a unique design that drew the eye. Each subsequent generation fixed significant flaws, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> has gotten even closer to being a truly complete package now that it has two display sizes and more efficient battery life.</p><p>Even though Google still falls short of the Galaxy Watch in areas like durability and length of software support, I find that understandable for a third-generation watch up against a seventh-gen watch. And given Google's well-known tendencies to kill projects that aren't instant successes, I'm thrilled the Pixel Watch <em>lasted</em> long enough to iterate into one of my favorite smartwatches, even though we never see Google listed among the top-selling smartwatch brands.</p>
<h2 id="fall-wear-os-5-is-fantastic-except-for-the-rollout-2">Fall: Wear OS 5 is fantastic (except for the rollout)</h2>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> made the system more battery-efficient, finally started reflowing content to match larger or smaller displays, made it easier to emulate fitness watches' workouts with "debounced goals," and added or upgraded core Google apps with Google Home controls, Camera viewfinder, Pixel Call Screening, and Recorder. Compared to past Wear OS versions with more boring update logs, it was a strong year.</p><p>My only gripe with Wear OS 5 is that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">blocks one of my favorite apps</a> for the sake of better battery life.</p><p>Samsung's One UI 6 Watch spinoff focused more on Galaxy AI, with tools like Energy Score, Wellness Tips, gesture detection, and AI-suggested replies — though it also improved workout tools and added sleep apnea detection.</p><p>The only downside to this feature-packed update is that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/long-wear-os-5-update-delay-feels-like-bad-sign">made Wear OS updates even slower</a>. Google had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-wear-os-5-problems-force-pause">roll its Wear OS 5 update back</a> in September because it was crashing watches, then it took until mid-November to fix the issue. Samsung, which started rolling out Wear OS 4 to old Galaxy Watches in August, only began its Wear OS 5 rollout in November and finished in December. That's a substantial gap!</p><p>One big question will be whether brands stuck on Wear OS 4, like OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Mobvoi, will be able to promptly update to Wear OS 5 or remain a year or more behind because of its substantial changes. The other big question is whether this is the new normal and whether Android watches will take as long as Android phones to update.</p>
<h2 id="now-wear-os-5-1-and-beyond-into-2025-2">Now: Wear OS 5.1 and beyond into 2025</h2>
<p>Aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-wear-os-5-1-preview-is-now-available-and-its-based-on-android-15">Wear OS 5.1 preview</a> — an Android 15-backed update that adds support for a credential manager and playing music on watch speakers — we're not going to see any new Wear OS updates through March, according to Google.</p><p>Still, I expect Wear OS watches to go through even more exciting changes in 2025, and I'll cover my predictions next week, from a major AI focus to long-overdue new watch hardware.</p><p>For now, I'll return to my main point: before Wear OS 3, this site recommended non-Wear OS watches to Android users. And if you'd told those industry experts four years ago that the Wear OS market would be this strong, they'd have been skeptical that Google could pull it off. So credit where credit's due! If you're looking for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watch</a> picks today, you're probably looking at Wear OS first.</p>

<hr>
<p>The year is nearly over, and Samsung has yet to announce an actual launch date for the Galaxy S25 series. While it has been rumored that the launch will be in late January, a new leaked teaser image reveals the launch date of the next Unpacked event.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/mark-your-calendars-samsung-galaxy-s25-launch-date-just-leaked/">Android Police</a> notes, leaker Evan Blass shared the Unpacked event <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1869203397024657598">teaser image on X</a> (now deleted), revealing the date as January 22, 2025. The teaser image appears official at first glance, and it looks like the leak came through an Italian source.</p>

<p>The other notable element of the leaked teaser image is that it showcases a tiny glimpse of four phones paired together. This is interesting because a trio of Galaxy S25 models, including the standard Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra, are expected at the launch.</p><p>While it is unclear what the fourth device might be, earlier rumors have pointed out that we could be seeing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-slim-could-pack-a-serious-camera-punch-despite-its-thin-profile">Galaxy S25 Slim</a> later in the year. Perhaps Samsung will give the audience a glimpse of it like the Galaxy Ring unveiled for the first time at the Unpacked event during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series. Or, it could entirely be the same Galaxy S25 trio stacked in no particular order for the teaser image.</p>

<p>Oura Ring users looking for some insights into what went right (and wrong) in 2024 should open up their apps: Oura just released its 2024 Year in Review reports, with "personalized insights" based on your sleep, stress, and activity data this year.</p><p>The report will highlight your average sleep and wake times, and how those changed every month, noting if you weren't consistent or formed bad habits over time, based on data from your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring 3</a>.</p><p>The Oura Year in Review report will also indicate the times of day when you were most active (or stressed), your total steps and naps for the year, and whether your Cardiovascular age (relative to your real age) trended upwards or downwards in 2024.</p>

<p>Outside of your personalized data, Oura is also releasing some curated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/2024-year-in-review/">Global Community data</a> about its users, showing international trends and average stats.</p><p>According to Oura, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden, Finland, and Austria had the five best sleep score averages worldwide. Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/2023-year-in-review-data-story/#:~:text=In%20the%202023%20Year%20in,sunlight%2C%20we're%20impressed!">2023 report</a>, the Kiwis improved their sleep average by 1.8 points to 79.8 to keep their top spot, while Australia rose from #5 to #2 and Austria kicked off Switzerland. The worldwide sleep score average is 77, or Fair.</p><p>Ireland led the daily step-count average at 10,079, the only country to hit the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">10,000-step mark</a> — though there's reason to question <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">how many of those steps are false positives</a>. Estonia, the UK and Northern Ireland, Sweden, and Czechia took the next four spots.</p><p>Sweden seems to be the all-around champion of this Oura 2024 report, as its users have the lowest cardiovascular age gap of -2.63 years, followed by Norway, The Netherlands, Switzerland, and Denmark. Generally speaking, these Scandanavian and middle-European countries seem to have a healthier lifestyle worth emulating.</p><p>If you've noticed America's conspicuous absence from this list, the U.S. did show up #1 in one category: most stressed. Oura attributed it to our "fast-paced cultrue, sedentary lifestyles, and pervasive sleep deprivation," as well as a "high-stakes election" pushing up stress in recent months.</p><p>Oura didn't share specific U.S. state data in this summary, but it did share some interesting tidbits with us directly: Montana had the highest sleep scores, New Yorkers were the most active, Hawaii had the lowest Cardiovascular age, and North Dakota was the most stressed.</p><p>We love this trend of fitness companies sharing general trends, as a baseline for people to compare against. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-dethroned-garmin-on-strava-in-2024-heres-why">Strava annual report</a> showed the median averages for runners, cyclists, and hikers across age groups, along with their favorite devices for activities. And the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/blog/general/2024-garmin-connect-data-report/">Garmin annual report</a> discussed people's average Body Battery, Daily Readiness, sleep, and stress scores; Garmin users seem to sleep worse and be less "ready" than Oura users, though this may be because of a more active lifestyle.</p>

<p>But the reason that should get you excited is the higher density; brands can leverage this tech to add bigger batteries without increasing the size or weight of their phones, and that's always a good thing. In fact, a few 2025 phones that have released globally — including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> — utilize silicon-carbon batteries to great effect, delivering two-day battery life. <br><br>While other manufacturers are switching to silicon batteries now, Honor started doing so two years ago with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-5-pro-review">Magic 5 Pro</a>. This year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a> utilized the same tech, with the brand showcasing how the device holds up in freezing weather. the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a> foldables also benefitted with this tech, and the brand's Magic 7 Pro also utilizes a silicon-carbon battery, with the size going up to 5850mAh. <br><br>The silicon-carbon tech is highly interesting, so I talked to the brand that's actually making it. Honor is using Group14's SCC55 silicon-carbon material in the Magic 7 Pro, and I talked to the brand's VP of Global Strategy, Grant Ray, to get a better understanding of how these batteries are different. <br><br>Basically, SCC55 is a synthetic silicon-carbon compound that's manufactured by Group14 at its facility in Woodinville, WA. The material is then sent to the battery manufacturer; in this instance, that is Amperex Technology Limited, a massive Chinese organization that's one of the leading producers of phone batteries.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QxMxtAgmaGqGU6jP9P2Ffe" name="honor-magic-6-pro-5.jpg" alt="Honor Magic 6 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QxMxtAgmaGqGU6jP9P2Ffe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ray mentioned that the advantage with SCC55 is that it can be a straightforward alternative to graphite that's traditionally used, and all that needs changing is the inclusion of the material while mixing the cement. There's no need to alter any production lines, or make any modifications to manufacturing plans. <br><br>That's one of the reasons why phone manufacturers are able to slot in silicon-carbon batteries at scale. Ray revealed that the Group14 facility in the U.S. produced two million batteries' worth of SCC55 thus far, and that a new facility is going live in 2025 that should increase production capability threefold. <br><br>Another benefit of using a silicon-based anode is that it reduces reliance on graphite, which ultimately is a net positive. Brands can choose the mixture of silicon carbide and graphite they can use in the cells, and this allows greater customizability — higher the silicon, better the density. Ray noted that the tech is still in its nascent phases, but it's already seeing plenty of interest in the EV industry as well as consumer tech. <br><br>In addition to phones, these batteries could make their way to smartwatches, XR glasses, and other wearables, and I think there's a greater potential in those categories. Silicon-carbon batteries have slightly better durability, and the best part is that there's no change with fast charging; I tested the Magic 6 Pro, Find X8 Pro, and Vivo X200 Pro extensively in this regard, and the charging times are in line with standard batteries. <br><br>The next big revolution in phone batteries will be when we can finally move away from lithium-ion cells altogether, but until then, silicon-carbon tech is proving to be a good option to provide better density and longevity. In the case of Honor, the brand clearly has a sizeable advantage in this area, and having used the two previous iterations of its silicon-carbon batteries, I can't wait to see how the Magic 7 Pro holds up against its rivals.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-cross-device-services-spotted-android">Cross Device Services</a> are Google's answer to Handoff on iOS, and they'll now work with more phones. The features, which first debuted on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">select Android phones</a>, were spotted arriving on Nothing OS by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-version-of-apple-handoff-more-phones/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>. After integrating with certain Android phones earlier this year following a Google Play Services update, Nothing phones seemingly gained support for Cross Device Services in a similar fashion.</p><p>When the features are available for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Nothing Phone 1</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a>, you may see a notification pop up explaining how they work and where you can learn more about them in settings. To manually check if Cross Device Services are available on your Nothing phone, navigate to <strong>Settings > Google > Device and sharing > Cross-device services</strong>. From there, all devices currently supporting Cross Device Services can be connected using your Google account.</p>

<p>On that settings page, you can create a group of Android and ChromeOS devices that'll work together and will be tied to your Google account. "Devices with the same Google Account can be added to a device group and use cross-device services together," the page explains. From there, there's an option to <strong>Add this device</strong> to the group with a toggle and tap the <strong>Invite</strong> to send a notification to your other devices.</p><p>Nothing phones will be able to take advantage of useful Cross Device Services features like Call Casting and Internet Sharing. Notably, Internet Sharing isn't available on Samsung phones, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-os-2-review">Nothing OS</a> will now have an edge in this area. Considering that Nothing OS — outside of its design flair — is very similar to Pixel Launcher and "stock Android," it's not surprising that Cross Device Services are coming to the operating system.</p><p>For those looking to build an ecosystem of Android products that work well together, Cross Device Services are must-use features. They'll only work in certain apps and situations, but they're Android's best alternative to Apple's Handoff suite.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is continuing to roll out experimental features based on its Gemini 2.0 models, and now, the Gemini app for iOS is starting to get feature parity with its Android counterpart. The most recent Gemini app update hit the App Store today, Dec. 18, per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-gemini/id6477489729" target="_blank">release notes</a>. In it, Google included support for experimental Gemini 2.0 models and support for two more Gemini extensions.</p><p>Currently, updating to <strong>version</strong> <strong>1.2024.4970016</strong> of the Gemini app for iOS adds the option for Gemini Advanced subscribers to use Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental. This is an early version of Google's smaller, lightweight AI model. Although the app's release notes describe the update as adding support for "our latest experimental Gemini 2.0 models," only 2.0 Flash Experimental appears to be live at the moment. The higher-end model, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-experimental-advanced-is-googles-best-ai-model-yet-and-its-available-now">Gemini 2.0 Experimental</a>, hit the Gemini web client Dec. 17 but isn't available in the mobile app.</p><p>Notably, the Gemini app for iOS is receiving the Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model before the Android app. The functionality <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-subscribers-can-now-use-gemini-flash-2-0-experimental-in-latest-gemini-app-beta">reached beta testers this week</a>, while it went straight to public release on the iOS version. It still requires Gemini Advanced, which costs $20 per month.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="o6Xjj5sUAxYkAC4VcM3nQa" name="google-gemini-iphone-study-quiz-example" alt="Gemini on iPhone can help students learn and study various subjects." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o6Xjj5sUAxYkAC4VcM3nQa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone app got a few other upgrades, too. It's available in the following 11 new languages: Bulgarian, Estonian, Gujarati, Kannada, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malayalam, Serbian, Slovenian, Swahili, and Urdu. Additionally, Gemini Live support was added for the following 21 languages: Bengali, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Gujarati, Hungarian, Kannada, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malayalam, Marathi, Norwegian Bokmål, Romanian, Slovenian, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Ukrainian, and Urdu.</p><p>Gemini Advanced users can also agree to store their personal information to get better responses from Gemini. Plus, "conversation starters" are coming to the Gemini app for iOS for non-subscribers.</p><p>Two new extensions are arriving on the platform for the first time, too. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-integrates-gemini-for-smarter-home-automation">Google Home extension launched on Android last month</a>, and it's now available for iOS. The same goes for the Google Photos extension.</p><p>As it tries to build up Gemini to compete with ChatGPT, it has done a decent job of bringing its best features to both versions of the Gemini mobile app — iOS and Android. This time around, the public build of the Gemini app for iOS is getting a hit feature before the Android version.</p>

Although we still haven&apos;t seen the epic discounts that we were hoping for (insert crying face emoji), Meta just launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3s/"><strong>a few interesting promos</strong></a> that could help you save big on your next VR purchase if you play your cards right. </p><p>For starters, it&apos;s worth noting that most of the best holiday deals on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S</a> are about giving you free stuff rather than straight discounts. That&apos;s the bad news. The good news is that the free stuff included here is actually pretty great. Let&apos;s break it down. Here&apos;s everything you need to know about buying a Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S this holiday season!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-best-meta-quest-deals-right-now-xa0-2">What are the best Meta Quest deals right now? </h2>

<p>The Quest 3S is Meta's attempt at bringing its VR experience into the mainstream. The headset boasts a lot of the same great hardware found in the more-expensive Meta Quest 3, you're just taking a small hit with the lens and display quality. Check out our <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Meta Quest 3S vs. Meta Quest 3</a> guide to learn more, but suffice to say that you're not sacrificing much by going with the cheaper model.  </p>
<p>Pick up the 256GB headset directly from the source before December 31st and you'll get a $30 credit, a copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow, and a free three-month subscription to Meta Quest Plus (including two free games each month). That's over $100 worth of free stuff, no strings attached. Amazon is offering a nearly-identical deal, so take your pick!</p>

<p>If you can spend a little more this holiday season, upgrade to the Meta Quest 3 to experience one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headsets</a> ever made. Buy the console directly from Meta and you'll get that free copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow (a $49.99 value) alongside a three-month subscription to Meta Quest Plus.  There's no free credit to attach to the deal, but if you want peak VR technology with some free games for good measure, now's your chance. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="60bb5ece-5023-4289-ad2b-4284ff62c60d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest 3 512GB: $499.99, plus free copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta Quest Plus at Meta" data-dimension48="Meta Quest 3 512GB: $499.99, plus free copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta Quest Plus at Meta">View Deal</a></p></div>

<h2 id="will-we-see-any-more-meta-quest-3s-deals-before-christmas-2">Will we see any more Meta Quest 3S deals before Christmas?</h2>
<p>With Christmas just a week away and most retailers calling December 19th the shipping cutoff, it&apos;s highly unlikely that we&apos;ll see any serious price drops on the Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S before December 25th. Still, if you want bang for your buck, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3s/"><strong>Meta Quest 3S 256GB deal</strong></a> described above is easily the best VR value of the season, just make sure you place your order before December 31st! </p>

<ul><li>Google says it has seen an uptick in email traffic during the holiday season, and that means Gmail users need to be vigilant to avoid scams.</li><li>The company is leveraging AI models to discern scam emails that it reports having blocked 20% more spam than before, and reviews 1,000 times more user-reported email spam events.</li><li>Google recommends users take the time to stop, think through whether an email is a scam, and report it if it sounds fishy.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The holiday season is well underway, and Google is sharing some tips about how it's keeping you safe from scams — and what you can do to protect yourself. Google says that although it has seen email traffic blossom since mid-November, users reported 35% fewer scams in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail">Gmail</a> compared to last year. Part of that is due to the company's AI features that have continually rolled out to Gmail over the course of 2024.</p><p>Notably, Google quietly bolstered Gmail's security capabilities last month. The company rolled out a new AI model designed to protect against phishing scams before Black Friday. "This new model acts like a supervisor for our existing AI defenses by instantly evaluating hundreds of threat signals when a risky message is flagged and deploying the appropriate protections — all in the blink of an eye," the company explained in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-holidays-2024-spam-scam/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>These AI tools are powered by large language models (LLM) trained using examples of malware and phishing attempts. "By spotting patterns and responding rapidly, this LLM alone blocks 20% more spam than before and reviews 1,000 times more user-reported spam daily," Google says.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CERMSm9HeA2iWusSJDDy7A" name="Gmail-Holiday-Scams" alt="A graphic showing Gmail responding to scam messages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CERMSm9HeA2iWusSJDDy7A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google warns that the three most common scams to watch out for during this holiday season are invoice scams, celebrity scams, and extortion scams. Invoice scams are when a person reaches out with a fake invoice, hoping that the user will pay the owed amount. Celebrity scams involve a fake sender posing as a celebrity or famous person to get you to hand over cash, and extortion scams might include threats and elements of fear to force you to give money.</p><p>To avoid these scams, the company shared what it calls "golden rules:"</p>
<ul><li><strong>Slow it down</strong>. Scams are often designed to create a sense of urgency, and often use terms like “urgent, immediate, deactivate, unauthorized, etc.” Take time to ask questions and think it through.</li><li><strong>Spot check</strong>. Do your research to double-check the details of an email. Does what it’s saying make sense? Can you validate the email address of the sender?</li><li><strong>Stop! Don’t send.</strong> No reputable person or agency will ever demand payment or your personal information on the spot.</li><li><strong>Report it</strong>. If you see something suspicious, mark it as spam. You’ll be making your Inbox cleaner and helping billions of others too.</li></ul>
<p>When in doubt, users should report potential scams and absolutely avoid sending money at all costs. There are also other scam blockers you should know about, like those in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">Google Messages</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/real-time-scam-detection-is-rolling-out-now-in-google-phone-app-beta">Google Phone</a>.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube was spotted testing a new version of its landscape orientation for mobile devices.</li><li>The updated UI test shows a better use of the dead space its orientation currently struggles with as it displays content clearer.</li><li>YouTube was testing a new version of its video page earlier this year for desktops, but users were quick to voice their displeasure.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube is reportedly involved in a new test that could provide a much better experience for larger mobile devices.</p><p>Spotted by X tipster AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-optimized-landscape-layout-apk-teardown-3509862/">Android Authority</a>) during an APK teardown, YouTube is testing a redesigned UI layout for foldables and tablets. The early look suggests the platform is changing the styling of its "landscape" orientation for those larger devices. One of the primary changes is that a user's list of subscribed channels will now appear on the far left side.</p><p>Preceding this list of subscriptions will be an "All Channels" button. Tapping that opens a full view of subscriptions, likely in order of upload.</p><p>The publication offered a quick glimpse at this revamped subscriptions page. One thing to highlight is that the amount of dead space is cut down severely. As the post notes, previously, a video's thumbnail would sit off to the left with its title, channel, views, and upload time to the right. However, beneath that was a void where nothing was present until the next video came in <em>after </em>the large thumbnail.</p><p>Currently, the test shows that the landscape view for videos on YouTube will be placed in pairs down the screen. Shorts also enter the spotlight, but since those are vertical videos, the redesigned orientation displays several of them in a row.</p><p>Tapping on a subscribed channel will adopt a similar layout scheme. The test shows a "View channel" option beneath the channel's name to take you to the full scope of that creator's content.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:993px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.61%;"><img id="sDh8GCJwMsXrEppnDtAjKR" name="youtube-landscape-mobile-app-redesign-test" alt="YouTube is testing a landscape change to its app on mobile, which should make better use of its dead space." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sDh8GCJwMsXrEppnDtAjKR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="993" height="443" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AssembleDebug / Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, AssembleDebug's demo didn't expand on what sort of layout changes concern YouTube channels. It's likely safe to assume the same layout present in the subscriptions tabs and elsewhere will fall into the full channel view for content creators. It's worth mentioning that the changes present in this test might bring mobile devices closer to the wide experience on computers. For now, these landscape orientation changes are still in testing as of YouTube v19.50.36.</p><p>The post states that "some" users will likely see this limited test before a wider, stable rollout.</p><p>More importantly, while this benefits larger devices, the tipster suggests mobile devices could see these landscape changes, too.</p><p>It's been a while since YouTube redesigned the visual elements of its app, especially following the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-video-page-redesign">more immersive video pages</a>. These redesigns benefited mobile and desktop devices as the platform reformatted its icons and shifted several page elements. On mobile, users now see the top comment more prominently following the title, channel name, and interactable video buttons.</p><p>PCs gained a similar update; however, that visual upgrade brought more attention to the description box.</p><p>Elsewhere, YouTube was spotted testing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-might-change-the-location-of-video-titles-and-comments">a radically different desktop UI</a> experience when watching videos. While the video player would remain off to the left, YouTube tested shifting the video's core bits of information to the right, followed by a store, description box, and comments.</p><p>Users who spotted it expressed their disdain for the change vocally on social media.</p>

<p>The cat's out of the bag with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-tipped-to-have-qi2-wireless-charging-case">latest alleged leak from SuomiMobiili</a>, a Finnish tech news site. Reportedly, Samsung will release a Qi2-compatible case for the Galaxy S25 series to go with the phones. The question is, what would this mean for the S25 lineup?</p><p>There's a lot of speculation going on at the moment, and for now, nothing regarding Qi2 support on Samsung's next flagships has been confirmed. That said, I believe that the company isn't going to bring native Qi2 support to its entire S25 family of phones due out in January 2025. My guess is that the base model S25 and S25 Plus could have Qi2 onboard, but probably not the S25 Ultra.</p><p>See, we ran tests and discovered that strong magnetic accessories <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">interfere with the S Pen's functionality</a> on the S24 Ultra. Bringing Qi2, a standard that is basically just rebranded MagSafe with 15W wireless charging, to the S25 Ultra would require Samsung to change the blueprint for its Ultra model, which is a big undertaking.</p><p>If the S25 Ultra skips native Qi2 compatibility, it's likely because Samsung did not have enough time to figure out a fix. A Qi2 phone cover is a short-term solution to buy time for Samsung until the S26 Ultra. Hopefully, by then, the brand will have found a way to rectify the magnetic interference issue.</p>

<p>It might not be the S Ultra phone's redesign alone that could solve the S Pen problem. Recently, another report surfaced from a Korean news outlet stating that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-fold-phone-might-work-with-an-s-pen-you-need-to-charge">Samsung is considering switching from EMR</a> to battery-powered active electrostatic (AES) technology for S Pen styli meant to be used with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><p>The intention behind this move would be to make the Fold 7 thinner by removing the digitizer that goes on top of its display, which is the part that adds support for EMR stylus input. EMR is an abbreviation for electromagnetic resonance, a technology that works by interacting with a magnetic field on a screen's surface.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It might not be the S Ultra phone's redesign alone that could solve the S Pen problem.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>All S Pens are based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wacom.com/en-tr/about-wacom/news-and-events/2024/6">Wacom's EMR pen technology</a>, including the one for the S24 Ultra. In fact, the only reason <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/opinion/the-galaxy-s23-ultras-glorified-stylus-finally-deserves-to-be-called-s-pen">why you need to charge your S Pen at all</a> is because of its Bluetooth features, like air gestures. EMR itself doesn't require any power whatsoever, but it does require a digitizer screen to work.</p><p>It could be possible that it's the EMR technology clashing with Qi2 or MagSafe magnetic accessories that causes the S Pen to malfunction. In that case, Samsung could switch over to AES tech on the Galaxy S26 Ultra following the Z Fold 7, fixing the thickness issue on the Fold 7 and potentially the Qi2/S Pen problem on the S26 Ultra. The only problem is that this will result in the S Pen being less compact than the current ones. Maybe that's why Samsung needs more time and is reportedly settling for a Qi2 workaround instead, at least for the time being.</p>

<p>It's high time the big phone brands started adopting the Qi2 standard. It's embarrassing to the Android phone space to think that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD Global was the first brand</a> to commit to native Qi2 support. Innovations like Qi2 keep the ball rolling in the smartphone industry and push for the conception of newer technologies and specifications.</p><p>As reliable and popular as Samsung's Galaxy S series might be, the phones have become increasingly stale over the past two releases. The Galaxy S22, S23, and S24 all look nearly identical and don't change much. And with Galaxy AI available on both the S22 and S23 series, there are even fewer reasons for anyone to really want to buy the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a>.</p><p>The S25 series desperately needs something fresh, and Qi2 is definitely that "something fresh" that can breathe new life into the Galaxy S lineup.</p>

<ul><li>OpenAI announced the arrival of ChatGPT Search on mobile and desktop for free tier users.</li><li>The post also states that it will display important links before ChatGPT Search's compiled information to aid those who've set it as their default engine.</li><li>Additional features like Maps in the ChatGPT app and "Advanced Voice" search were also teased.</li><li>OpenAI launched ChatGPT Search for Plus and Teams users late in October as it looked to take on Google.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OpenAI expands its recently revealed search engine to more users and highlights upcoming features.</p><p>On X, OpenAI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1868760655878406352">posted a thread</a> that initially announced the arrival of its ChatGPT Search engine for "all Free users" today (Dec 18). The post highlights that users on its free tier can utilize ChatGPT Search "globally" on their mobile and desktop devices. However, it seems that you are required to sign in before you're able to utilize it.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🌐ChatGPT search 🌐is starting to roll out to all Free users today.Search the web in a faster, better way—available globally on https://t.co/nYW5KO1aIg and our mobile and desktop apps for all logged-in users. pic.twitter.com/yf6GJGAm8b<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1868760655878406352">December 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>OpenAI's announcement continues by detailing three new features inbound, such as what happens if it's your default search engine. Users can do this by clicking the "DE" button at the top right of ChatGPT Search. Moreover, the company is shifting how it displays relevant links to accompany this. Now, after typing your query into your address bar, ChatGPT Search will display links ahead (above) of the "relevant information" found during its lookup.</p><p>OpenAI states this should help users navigate the web quickly to find what they need. Users can continue looking through relevant links by tapping the arrow icon in the results to produce a side panel.</p><p>Additionally, OpenAI states an arrow placed near the engine's offered links will produce a sidebar. This panel will contain an extensive list of extra, relevant links to your query in a neater space. The company states these small changes are the result of feedback from its Plus users shortly after ChatGPT Search launched.</p><p>Elsewhere, the thread detailed an upcoming feature called "Advanced Voice" for ChatGPT on mobile. Users will soon find a new "wave" icon when entering the app and opening its text field. Tapping that will surface ChatGPT's AI, which will await your prompt. In the demo, ChatGPT delivers its results vocally; however, there is a chance to offer a follow-up question to the AI afterward.</p><p>The company states Advanced Voice will arrive in the ChatGPT app "over the next week."</p><p>The final update concerns a map integration with the AI on mobile. OpenAI says users can "search for and chat" about locations.</p><p>OpenAI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-search-feature-rollout">launched ChatGPT Search</a> late in October, which brought it into contention with Google's version. The company stated the purpose of its search engine is to give users "better answers" quickly. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">AI backing this feature</a> is said to understand a person's natural and conversational speech. Moreover, it will consider the "full context" of your query <em>before </em>delivering its results.</p><p>There is also a convenient button to access the AI's sources so users can fact-check what they've been given.</p><p>While ChatGPT Search takes the fight to Google, it is reminiscent of the latter's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">AI Overviews</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google has released the second Android 16 developer preview just a month after the first, signaling a faster rollout for Android 16, with the stable version coming in Q2 2025.</li><li>The update brings smoother app performance, better battery life, and new tools for developers to track issues like slow startups or app freezes.</li><li>Google plans two major Android updates in 2025, with the first bringing big changes and the second focusing on smaller improvements.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Today, Google rolled out the second developer preview of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, giving us a closer look at what’s next for its upcoming OS. This release lets developers dive into the latest features and tools that will shape the Android 16 experience.</p><p>Android 16 DP2 is packed with updates to make apps run smoother, save battery, and boost performance. Apps can now collect data on tricky scenarios like slow startups or app freezes. Handy tools like addProfilingTriggers() make it easier to figure out what’s going wrong.</p><p>If you’re a developer and want to know what triggers your app to start, Android 16 lets you see the exact component, helping you streamline the startup process. Apps can now create richer, more detailed haptics (vibrations) that feel just right, regardless of the device. There are also new tools that show why background tasks are delayed or stuck. You’ll know if it’s your app settings or Android’s rules causing issues.</p><p>Adaptive refresh rates are now easier to use, saving battery and improving visuals for apps with fast-scrolling content.</p><p>Additionally, Android 16 tweaks how background tasks are handled based on app activity. For example, active apps get more priority. Meanwhile, outdated methods for prioritizing tasks are now retired.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-photo-picker-gains-cloud-media-app-support"><u>built-in photo picker</u></a> also now supports searching for images stored in the cloud. It’s private and easy to integrate. And with Wi-Fi 6, apps can now use location-based features (like unlocking devices) with improved security and accuracy.</p><p>New tools also let apps track activity intensity (moderate or vigorous) and manage health records securely with user consent. Further, apps can now add custom animations when users swipe back, making navigation feel smoother.</p>

<p>Today’s release comes just a month after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">first Android 16 preview</a>, marking a big shift in Google’s rollout plan. In the past, Google dropped the first beta around Q2, with the stable version coming later in the year. Now, Android 16 is set to launch its stable version in Q2 2025, with the first beta arriving in January. For now, if you want to install the Android 16 developer preview, we have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">handy guide to get you started</a>. That said, we recommend doing so only if you <em>know</em> what you're doing, as most people have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-have-no-reason-to-install-the-android-16-preview">no reason to install Android 16 right now</a>.</p><p>Google says two major Android updates are set for release in 2025, one with big changes in mid-year and another with smaller improvements later. As usual, incremental updates will continue quarterly.</p>

<ul><li>T-Mobile announces that its customers can start registering today (Dec 18) for its satellite service with Starlink.</li><li>The beta is "open and free" for its postpaid voice customers with a "compatible device."</li><li>T-Mobile states the beta is expected to kick off in early 2025.</li><li>Recently, T-Mobile and Starlink received the FCC's go-ahead for its satellite service, which was followed by a launch of 20 more satellites in December.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>T-Mobile's joint effort in satellite communication with Starlink is getting underway for U.S. consumers.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-starlink-direct-to-cell-beta-registration">press release</a>, the company announced that its customers can begin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/satellite-phone-service">registering to beta</a> test T-Mobile Starlink satellite service. The company states that the beta is "open and free for all T-Mobile postpaid voice customers with a compatible device." These users/devices will be picked to enter on a "first come, first served" basis so, if you're interested, sign up as soon as possible.</p><p>While the program is opening its registration for U.S. T-Mobile customers, the post states it will prioritize first responder agencies and individuals.</p><p>T-Mobile says its satellite communication experience has been refined to become "much more user friendly." The company explained that it would utilize this upcoming beta test to see if its service could meet the "high standards" consumers expect. For those who get in, T-Mobile says there will be support for text messages; however, support for voice and data will arrive "over time."</p><p>Additionally, the company states more devices and customers will enter the beta as more satellites are launched into orbit to support them.</p><p>To <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/satellite-phone-service">sign up</a>, users will be met with a short form to verify their name, email, and phone number. After, T-Mobile says it will deliver "regular updates" to those who've registered, as well as any required details if they're welcomed in. It's important to know that the beta isn't expected to start until "early 2025."</p><p>The T-Mobile Starlink satellite service is eyeing a 2025 launch. More importantly, while the beta is free to test, the post states more information about its official commercial service will detailed during launch.</p><p>The two companies are moving swiftly after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/fcc-approves-t-mobile-and-starlinks-direct-to-cell-service">FCC gave the go-ahead</a> for the service. T-Mobile and Starlink have been crafting this satellite-based service to facilitate the "end of dead zones" for U.S. consumers since 2022. Both companies will leverage a network of SpaceX broadband satellites for the heavy lifting. Moreover, during the beta, T-Mobile says its satellite coverage will provide a signal "almost everywhere."</p><p>Additionally, Apple has brought its satellite comms via "Emergency SOS," which is restricted to emergencies. T-Mobile and Starlink want its version to be more than that, as it looks to make the technology more "mainstream."</p><p>In December, SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/starlink-direct-to-cell-open-to-any-telecom-says-spacex-exec">sent 20 satellites into orbit</a> to support this venture between T-Mobile and Starlink. More importantly, Starlink states its new communication service is open for more than just consumers as it extends a hand to "any" telecom company.</p>

<p>Now, to be clear, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> is not for casual users. With its steep $1,199.99 price tag, the premium Samsung tablet is built more like a laptop replacement, with a stunning 14.6-inch AMOLED display, included S Pen stylus, and all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a> you could ever want.

<hr>
<p>OnePlus confirmed what was expected following the brand's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-confirms-the-oneplus-13-global-launch-date">official OnePlus 13 launch announcement</a>: the midrange OnePlus 13R will debut alongside its flagship counterpart on Jan. 7, 2025. The budget smartphone appears to be visually similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, but unlike the higher-priced model, not much is known about the OnePlus 13R ahead of its upcoming launch.</p><p>Notably, OnePlus is announcing that the OnePlus 13R will feature a thin, 8mm chassis while packing a large battery. The OnePlus 13R is equipped with a 6,000mAh battery, which is a significant upgrade over the OnePlus 12R's 5,500mAh capacity.</p><p>The smartphone will be available in two colors: Nebula Noir and Astral Trail. It'll presumably launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a>, as OnePlus describes a "lighter-than-air operating system." Major specifications, including the device's processor, were not mentioned. Instead, the OnePlus 13R is described as having "blistering flagship-level performance."</p><p>With that being said, the OnePlus 13R will almost certainly feature a downgrade from the regular OnePlus 13's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> system-on-a-chip. Last year, the OnePlus 12R still featured a flagship processor — it was just a year-old iteration. If that tracks for this year, we could be seeing the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 power the OnePlus 13R.</p>

<p>We'll learn more details about the OnePlus 13R at the OnePlus 13 series global launch event on Jan. 7, which will also feature reveals of the OnePlus 13 and a new color for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a>. The company says the OnePlus 13R will be sold in the U.S. and Canada, but did not disclose a price.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>One of the most fun parts of buying a new tech product is choosing the color. Before you get to decide on your specifications, upgrades, and cost, you simply pick the color and finish that speaks to you the most.</p><p>There's no right or wrong answer here, but your choice will have some consequences. Certain colors are more desirable than others, which helps with resale and trade-in values later. Some finishes have better longevity, as lighter colorways hide scuffs and scratches better than darker ones. A matte silver smartphone might look better than a glossy black one after a year, for example.</p><p>That's why I'm always surprised when a tech company launches a "Jet Black" colorway, knowing full well that it'll look downright terrible after a few months — and that people will buy it anyway.</p><p>Samsung may soon repeat this cycle with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, which will reportedly feature a Jet Black color option. According to a recent leak, this model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-all-seven-colorways-tipped">will be available in at least seven colorways</a>, including Titanium Black, Titanium SilverBlue, Titanium Gray, Titanium WhiteSilver, Titanium JetBlack, Titanium JadeGreen, and Titanium PinkGold. These colorways are ranked in order of volume, so it's possible that the rumored Jet Black option will be a limited-run Samsung online store exclusive.</p>

<p>Even though there's plenty of precedent for deep black colorways scratching to extreme degrees, I have no doubt people will buy a Jet Black version of the Galaxy S25 Ultra anyway. Then, shortly after the phone releases, the internet will be inundated with social media posts of scuffed and mauled Galaxy S25 Ultra phones with the Jet Black colorway.</p><p>A single drop might take off part of the Jet Black finish. Putting your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phone</a> in the same pocket as your car keys might add an unwanted "patina" to the otherwise unblemished Galaxy S25 Ultra. Eventually, the natural titanium color will shine through the Jet Black coating. When it does, you'll be left with a finish that somehow looks worse than Jet Black <em>and</em> a more forgiving color, such as White Silver.</p><p>There's a reason the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is destined to age unfavorably, and it has to do with the material it's made out of. Samsung switched to titanium last year, and that metal has a lot of perks. It's strong while being lightweight; however, it's not very scratch-resistant.</p><p>More importantly, "black titanium" does not exist, so a black coating needs to be applied to titanium in order to create that finish. It's different than anodization, which is used to create aluminum and titanium colors through an electrochemical process. Other ways to achieve a deep black titanium finish involve heating up the material to extreme temperatures or polishing it.</p><p>This means the black finish is only on the surface level of the titanium. A scratch is just a layer removed from a material, and every single scratch will take a bit of the Jet Black coloring off the Galaxy S25 Ultra. When they do, the natural silver color of the titanium material will shine through. If you're unsure what that looks like, we have plenty of real-world examples, including the Titanium Black versions of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/1forkm6/ultra_2_black_scratches">Ultra 2 Black Scratches</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch">r/AppleWatch</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>With all these things in mind, we know two things about the rumored Jet Black model of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Samsung knows the black finish will scratch off, and people will buy it anyway. That's why companies keep making products with dark finishes that are destined to age terribly — consumers can't stop buying them. For some reason, we want to throw our money toward the risky pick rather than playing it safe with silver or white.</p><p>To be clear, I've been on both sides of the coin. My Natural Titanium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a> and Porcelain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> are both pristine to this day, and I've had the former for more than two years. Meanwhile, my Midnight-colored M2 MacBook Air is absolutely thrashed, with scratches along the palm rests and ports.</p><p>So, if Samsung launches a Jet Black Galaxy S25 Ultra and you end up buying one, don't be surprised when the natural titanium shines through the scratched black finish. It turns out that tech enthusiasts want what we can't have: a dark-colored product that hides scratches just as well as lighter colors. And Samsung's apparent decision to bring Jet Black to the Galaxy S25 Ultra shows that as long as we keep voting for those finishes with our wallets, brands will keep giving them to us.</p>

This model has 64GB of storage, though Samsung also offers an upgrade model with 128GB. As for processing power, the A9 Plus isn't as impressive as the company's higher-priced tablets, but it gets the job done, as backed by the basic Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chipset. You can also select between 4GB or 8GB of RAM, depending on which configuration of the tablet you choose.</p><p>The A9 Plus also offers expandable storage of up to 1TB utilizing the tablet's microSD port, along with an 11-inch display featuring a 90Hz refresh rate. While you can buy other third-party styluses for this tablet, the A9 series is not compatible with Samsung's premium-level S Pen. If that's something you're looking for, you'll have to consider upgrading to one of Samsung's premium tablets, which cost several hundred dollars more than the A9 Plus.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is starting to roll out its latest System update, but its changelog details the goodbye to a three-year-old feature.</p><p>The company's December updates for the Play Store continue as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">support document</a> details the arrival of version 44.1 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/16/google-play-share-apps/">9to5Google</a>). A standout in its patch notes is an update for phones that states "The Share apps feature on Google Play will be retiring."</p><p>The feature was limited to "free and publically available" apps on the Play Store for Android users. Users could previously access this by heading into the Play Store > <strong>Profile icon > Manage apps & devices</strong>. The "Share apps" feature was listed below the sync apps feature. Users could decide whether they wanted to send an app to another person or receive one.</p><p>Now, with v44.1 of the Play Store rolling out, this will soon disappear. The only other option to "send" an app to a friend will be to share its link through the Play Store directly.</p><p>The remainder of the changelog states Google is delivering "updated notifications from Google Play" to users. Additionally, the update adds "visual improvements" in the store for apps and games when searched in the respective tab.</p><p>The latest Systems update concerns Play Services, too, as that area sees the following changes in v24.49:</p>
<ul><li>[Phone] With the new cross-device services with invitations settings screen, you’ll be able to find, invite, and turn on cross-device features.</li><li>[Wear] With this new feature, you’ll be able to update the timezone of your watch to match your current location, even when your watch is offline.</li><li>[Wear] When you update your wearable device, Wi-Fi and cellular networks will now be prioritized over Bluetooth for faster downloads. If Wi-Fi isn’t available, you can choose your preferred network instead.</li></ul>

<p>Google started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/play-store-app-sharing-just-got-easier-googles-airdrop-alternative">rolling out Share apps</a> in the Play Store in 2021 after the company originally debuted Nearby Share a year prior. When activated, users were taken to a list of shareable apps to send to another person. Users were then tasked to select their recipient and match the pairing code to ensure the app wasn't going to the wrong person. This was a much less strenuous way of sharing apps compared to Android's older option through Nearby Share specifically.</p><p>Google noted that paid apps were not shareable with this feature, similar to sideloaded applications. While it was a convenient feature, it's unclear how popular it was. It could be that not enough users utilized it, thus the closure.</p><p>It's worth remembering that Google and Samsung started gearing up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-rolling-out-quick-share-to-pixel-devices">Nearby Share's rebrand</a> during CES 2024. The former <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-19-1pm-et-quick-share-becomes-a-true-airdrop-alternative-with-support-for-all-android-and-chrome-os-devices">highlighted the change</a> a few weeks earlier than the conference, as it became a true Apple AirDrop rival. The new peer-to-peer sharing platform was said to support Android and ChromeOS devices.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I'll be the one to say it: Wear OS is officially good now. The combination of Wear OS 5 software and Pixel Watch or Galaxy Watch hardware has made the best Wear OS smartwatches real Apple Watch competitors. In fact, I briefly ditched my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> before settling on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">Garmin Enduro 3</a> as my daily driver.</p><p>But there's no denying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-watches-could-learn-a-lot-from-garmin">Wear OS still has work to do</a>. The platform is still emerging, and the Apple Watch is still a more attractive product for software and hardware development teams to build for. For example, according to April 2024 data from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/global-smartwatch-market-2024/" target="_blank">Counterpoint Research</a>, Wear OS is expected to hold 27% of the smartwatch market share outside of China. That's a significant uptick from last year, although it's still nothing compared to Apple's 49% projected market share.</p>

<p>Even if Wear OS is clawing back some of Apple's watchOS market share — and that appears to be the case — there's evidence to suggest that Apple Watch users might be more valuable to third-party companies building apps and accessories. Data is sparse, but a 2023 analysis from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.asymco.com/2023/09/05/the-value-of-a-customer/" target="_blank">Asymco</a> estimated that iPhone users spend roughly seven times more on apps than Android users.</p><p>How does that translate to Wear OS apps and accessories? The truth is, we can't know for sure. However, I'd guess that Apple Watch owners are far more likely to purchase watchOS apps and third-party straps, cases, and other accessories than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">the best Wear OS smartwatch</a> owners. To be clear, that isn't a knock on Wear OS users. Android, and by extension Wear OS, has always been the platform for people who are thoughtful — maybe even frugal — with their cash.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Vbdi5h8D7vD2SqEyfgLH3j" name="Tesla-App-Tinypod-Wheel" alt="An Apple Watch inside a TinyPod case running the Tesla app for watchOS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vbdi5h8D7vD2SqEyfgLH3j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These two data points combine to create an unfortunate problem for Wear OS. Developers and product designers just don't spend as much time bringing their apps and ideas to Wear OS smartwatches. Don't get me wrong, there are some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-apps">great Wear OS apps</a>.</p><p>However, even if an app is available on watchOS and Wear OS, the watchOS app may be better. A great example of this is the Nike Run Club app, which I depend on for training. New features might stay exclusive to watchOS forever, and the app sometimes refuses to run on certain Wear OS hardware.</p><p>Of course, the bigger problem is when an app or accessory you like isn't available on Wear OS at all. That's what happened to me this month... twice. First, Tesla announced plans to bring its mobile app to smartwatches as part of its 2024 Holiday Update. There was a catch, though — the Tesla app is only available on watchOS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="rrtGuUHoEjrCuhDC8eZa7K" name="Telsa-Watch-App" alt="The Tesla app running on Apple Watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rrtGuUHoEjrCuhDC8eZa7K.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tesla)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On top of that, Tesla didn't even mention Wear OS. The platform wasn't a thought or a consideration, at least, not a big enough one to warrant public acknowledgment.</p><p>I pulled my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a> literally out of the closet just to test the Tesla app on watchOS. There are no surprises here: it's good, and very useful. You can control your car from your wrist, use your Apple Watch as a key, and more. It's incredibly convenient during times when you want to leave your phone in the car, or even at home.</p><p>I don't like bringing my phone with me when I go to the track and run, and now I don't have to. My Apple Watch tracks my run (with a full-fledged Nike Run Club app), plays music through my Bluetooth earbuds, and now starts my car.</p><p>Coincidentally, this app debuted the exact same month as the TinyPod. Unless you're part of the Apple Watch and iPod niches, you probably don't know what that is. Put simply, the TinyPod is an Apple Watch case that adds a scroll wheel — like the one on old iPods — to your smartwatch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yAdbMezTDR3hX4ffSWHGoD" name="TinyPod-Apple-Watch" alt="The Apple Watch being used with third-party hardware and apps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yAdbMezTDR3hX4ffSWHGoD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's a gimmick, but one you'd never find on a Wear OS watch. There isn't a single brand that makes Wear OS big enough to justify startups, and even major accessory makes to create cool projects, like the TinyPod, for their products. Most companies won't even bother to make an app, like Tesla, at least for now.</p><p>The good news is that if you don't own a Tesla and aren't nostalgic for iPods, you probably won't feel like you're missing out by not having a Tesla app or clever case for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatches</a>. However, these two new releases underscore a problem that you might run into — there simply aren't as many options for Wear OS. Whether you're looking for a fully-featured app or a custom strap, the Apple Watch will always have more choices available compared to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Galaxy Watch</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-wishlist">OnePlus Watch</a>.</p><p>Hopefully, Wear OS will become more attractive to developers and product designers as it continues to grow. If the aforementioned Counterpoint projections are accurate, Wear OS market share outside of China will have grown by more than 5% in 2024 alone. It'll also have pushed watchOS <em>under</em> 50% market share for the first time in years.</p><p>Those are impressive feats, and all Wear OS fans can do is hope that the apps and accessories come alongside the platform's success.</p>

<ul><li>Supposed hands-on images of the Galaxy S25 Plus showcase a phone that's roughly the same as its predecessor.</li><li>The images show then bezels for its display, but a slightly different take on its camera array, which has been rumored to sport black rings for its lenses.</li><li>The Galaxy S25 series is expected in January; however, there's a report that suggests it could see a price increase in some regions.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Images have leaked on social media, supposedly showcasing Samsung's next Plus model.</p><p>The leaked hands-on imagery comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1868995079425462278">Jukanlosreve</a> on X, who states the photos in question are of the Galaxy S25 Plus (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-hands-on-images-3509638/">Android Authority</a>). The tipster showcased three photos of the phone's front, side, and back. From the front, the alleged Galaxy S25 Plus looks largely similar to what we've experienced with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">soon-to-be predecessor</a>. Thin bezels run around the outer perimeter of this rounded corner design.</p><p>A sticker is placed in the center at the top of the phone, likely covering its punch-hole selfie camera.</p><p>While there's nothing new there, the back holds something interesting. Though covered with tape, the triple rear camera array features a slight change: black rings around the lenses. The rest of the back panel is quite plain — although, aside from the Samsung logo, the backing never offers much else. There is an LED flash off to the right side of the vertical array, as well.</p><p>Additionally, the tipster adds a photo of the phone's right side, displaying its volume and power buttons. There is another piece of hardware right beneath those, leaving users to question if it's a new toy like Apple's capture button. Unfortunately, the tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1868998698451276226">quickly refutes</a> such a thought, claiming it's the phone's mmwave for data purposes.</p>

<p>Some notable Galaxy S25 Plus leaks took place in September when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-alleged-rendering">an array of renderings surfaced</a>. Since then, it's been purported that Samsung might not change its design much, especially since it already had rounded corners, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultra-dummy-unit-gives-us-a-better-view-of-its-fresh-design">unlike the Ultra</a>. Rumored specifications claimed the device was slimming down ever-so-slightly by 0.4mm. Additionally, there's the rear camera array, which looks slightly different in these leaked live images.</p><p>The old renderings showcased rings closer to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. What these alleged hands-on images suggest are rings with a smaller diameter and with a glossy sheen.</p><p>We won't have to wait too much longer for a grand reveal as Samsung is expected to unveil the Galaxy S25 series in January 2025. In the meantime, the Plus model's Ultra sibling was leaked in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaks-on-video">hands-on video</a> showing off its design changes.

<hr>
<p>Samsung is desperately trying to make its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables</a> thinner in an effort to better compete with brands like Google, Huawei, and others. Prior reports indicated that the company was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-working-on-a-thin-galaxy-z-fold-phone-with-s-pen-support">having trouble making a thinner screen that also offered S Pen support</a>. For reference, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition — which is thinner than the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> — lacks a display digitizer and S Pen support.</p><p>According to a new report from the Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.etnews.com/20241217000304" target="_blank">ET News</a>, Samsung could take inspiration from the Apple Pencil and develop a thicker, larger S Pen with a battery. Using active electrostatic (AES) technology, the S Pen would be the part that creates electricity, rather than the display. The move would come with pros and cons: the Galaxy Z Fold device would be thinner, but you'd have to keep your S Pen charged.</p><p>This would be a departure from the way S Pen styluses have been implemented in the past. Previously, Samsung used electromagnetic resonance (EMR) technology for the stylus. This allowed the company to make the pen thinner — and in the case of the Galaxy Note and Ultra models, thin enough to be stored within the phone itself. However, the thickness of the necessary display technologies, such as a digitizer, has made thinning the Galaxy foldables more difficult.</p>

<p>"Samsung is vigorously reviewing how not to install a digitizer on the foldable phone to be released next year," a number of industry sources told ET News, translated to English. "A new pen input method to replace the existing technology will be decided early next year, along with or without installation."</p><p>Notably, Samsung is only reviewing possible implementations of S Pen support on displays without a digitizer at this stage. The company could choose a variety of paths for the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 device, including the status quo, which is a thicker foldable with a digitizer and S Pen support. It reportedly doesn't want to drop S Pen support altogether for the sake of thickness.</p><p>Despite lacking S Pen support, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-is-what-the-z-fold-6-should-have-been">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a> appears to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-6-might-be-flopping-in-the-us-but-its-special-edition-is-winning-in-korea">been a hit in Korea</a>. Samsung shaved roughly 1.5mm of thickness off the Galaxy Z Fold 6 to make the Special Edition, in part by removing the digitizer.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus Open 2’s latest leak from Digital Chat Station reveals additional specifications.</li><li>The foldable phone will likely sport an IPX8 rating — a notable improvement over IPX4 from the previous iteration.</li><li>The device is also believed to have a strong build next to a thinner form factor.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus has been taking its sweet time to launch the next foldable phone, the OnePlus Open 2, which should come as the successor to the OnePlus Open — launched back in 2023. While the launch could be near, a new leak reveals some interesting details about the upcoming foldable.</p><p>Prominent leaker Digital Chat Station (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/16/oneplus-open-2-could-bring-ipx8-rating-50mp-periscope-telephoto-camera/">9to5Google</a>) has shared some nifty details about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a>. Before jumping to the leak, OnePlus and Oppo have common designs and other relevant aspects when making phones, especially foldable ones. The foldables made by these companies are largely identical but cater to different markets. Hence, the upcoming OnePlus Open 2 is based on the Oppo Find N5.</p>
<p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/P56t04bfZ">corresponding Weibo post</a>, the tipster shared that the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chip will power the foldable Find N5 (also OnePlus Open 2). Further, the device is notably gaining better IPX8 resistance, a step up from its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>’s IPX4 water resistance. While a notable upgrade, the counterpart Galaxy Z Fold 6 features an IP48 rating.</p><p>Digital Chat Station has further indicated that the OnePlus Open 2 will incorporate a 50MP periscopic telephoto lens and a significantly stronger “anti-fall body structure.” This could translate to better build quality, which is also believed to be lighter in hand. Notably, an improved hinge design is expected. The tipster has also shared that we could see support for wireless charging on the OnePlus Open 2.</p>

<p>The same source interestingly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-camera-charging-leaks">shared more details earlier</a>, mentioning a bigger 5700mAh battery capacity powering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, two 50MP rear cameras, and the aforementioned 50MP periscopic telephoto lens. The bigger battery is also expected to be based on OnePlus’ latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier technology</a>, which the company co-developed and is tailored for high-performance phones.</p><p>All in all, the OnePlus Open 2 might be a better successor if the projected things turn out to be accurate. As for the launch, it is still skeptical.</p><p>On the other hand, the company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-confirms-the-oneplus-13-global-launch-date">just teased</a> the OnePlus 13’s global launch happening on January 7, 2025. While it might not be far away, we could probably see a glimpse of the OnePlus Open 2 if not the device launch itself. Other than the foldable’s anticipated tease, we should be seeing the OnePlus 13 and its sibling, the OnePlus 13R, both on the launch date.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is starting to tease users about the privacy and utility features they can expect with its upcoming One UI 7 (Android 15) update.</p><p>The next OS is expected to bring several new goodies, but a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/the-first-step-towards-true-ai-companion">Newsroom post</a> gives us better insight into two key features, such as its "Personal Data Engine." Samsung starts by highlighting "Galaxy’s approach to AI personalization," which its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discusses-the-ai-phone-future">execs have continued to see</a> as a "main business." The company wants users to utilize its on-device AI features; however, it doesn't want it to come at the risk of exposed data.</p><p>The Personal Data Engine is reportedly a "powerful privacy advancement" safeguarded with an encryption key.</p><p>Samsung states that in One UI 7, a user's data will be stored in a "secure space" on their device. The Knox Vault is the force behind the security parameters keeping a user's information safe. Moreover, the post highlights Samsung's addition of "post-quantum cryptography," which is said to "future-proof" a user's private information on their device from "rising" threats.</p><p>With AI spread across various Samsung apps, the company states its security engine will deliver "cross-app" protection, as well.</p><p>The other side of Samsung's One UI 7 update is the "Now Bar." While this was previously (and briefly) mentioned during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">Beta Program announcement</a>, the post expands on it, stating this brings an "insightful experience" to Galaxy. The Now Bar will be found on your Galaxy phone's lock screen at the bottom between app shortcuts. Samsung states this is more than just a quick glance at alerts; the Now Bar lets you control your entertainment and time a workout.</p><p>More importantly, Samsung states the Now Bar is deeply involved with everything on your phone. For example, if you're traveling, the Now Bar will offer a prompt, asking if you'd like it to create a "folder of essential apps." This folder will seemingly be available via your lock screen and could include a curated playlist for the flight, information on your boarding time, and more.</p>

<p>Last summer, Samsung's Head of Mobile, TM Roh stated how the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discusses-the-ai-phone-future">was looking to make</a> its on-device AI more "multi-modal." The Korean OEM was reportedly refocusing its R&D personnel onto its Galaxy AI path for the future of the "AI Phone." What's more, Roh teased that, in the future, its phones, tablets, and more could look "radically different" to accommodate the tech required for its AI.</p><p>After a series of delays, Samsung kick-started its One UI 7 beta earlier in December and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">Beta 2 just dropped yesterday</a> (Dec 16). A member of Android Central spotted the update landing on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. The update packed loads of bug fixes for errors and malfunctions the software experienced in Beta 1.</p><p>Aside from the AI and security additions Samsung plans, One UI 7 brings help for grammar and other mistakes. One UI 7 is expected to arrive near or alongside the Galaxy S25 when it debuts in January 2025.</p>

<p>The Samsung One UI 7 beta program is fully underway, having just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">released its second beta</a> that's filled with bug fixes for all eligible Samsung Galaxy phones. I've been using it on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and am already convinced this is the best version of One UI Samsung has made in a very long time.</p><p>The latest beta is all about fixing bugs, but there are so many new features in One UI 7 that it's hard not to sift through them all to find my new favorites. Samsung is doing a lot to cater to long-time fans and folks who dislike One UI by doing what it does best: offering options for every imaginable preference.</p><p>So, what's it like to use One UI 7? Exceptional in most ways, thankfully.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-ui-2">A new UI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZpGswcHfE36tUgcaFkrEF6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-One-UI-7-Beta-2-split-notification-shade" alt="The new split notification pane on One UI 7 beta 2 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZpGswcHfE36tUgcaFkrEF6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right off the bat, seasoned Samsung users — and there are a lot of you out there — will immediately notice that Samsung has split the notification shade by default. This means that pulling down on the right side of the status bar brings up a full screen of quick toggle buttons and sliders while swiping down on the left side of the status bar brings up notifications. It's exactly like an iPhone.</p><p>I can see a lot of people getting really frustrated with this new default behavior, and I'm not sure it's my favorite decision ever. On the bright side, you can quickly move between the two panels with a horizontal swipe, so it doesn't take much effort if muscle memory kicks in and you need to get to the other panel.</p><p>Thankfully, you can change it back to the original single-panel behavior, but you'll need to hit the pencil button in the quick toggles pane and swap back over. It's a little bit hidden, and I think Samsung needs to surface it a bit more. I tried the new split pane for a while, but I really don't like it, so I made the switch back to the Android-style behavior.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FgHW7rU7QxyzwQ5JCx43X6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-One-UI-7-Beta-2-vertical-app-drawer" alt="The new vertical app drawer on One UI 7 beta 2 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FgHW7rU7QxyzwQ5JCx43X6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Finally! A vertical app drawer by default!</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The next thing you'll likely notice is the vertical app drawer. Ironically, while Samsung is copying Apple with the default split notification pane, it's going with a more Android-like experience with the default app drawer layout. If you don't like this, you can switch back by choosing the "custom" sort order. It's a weird wording choice and I think Samsung needs to just change it to "vertical" or "horizontal" to avoid confusion.</p><p>The new vertical drawer is wonderful, though, and even has a scroll bar on the right for quickly moving between apps, all sorted alphabetically by default. The vertical app drawer is a massive improvement that makes One UI instantly feel like it was developed in the 2020s rather than the 2000s.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The new multitasking UI is SO MUCH BETTER than Google's awful default design in Android.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The third huge thing you'll notice is the new multitasking UI, which finally lets you see more than one app tile at a time. Instead of spacing tiles out horizontally and making the middle one take up most space, Samsung now arranges tiles in a 3D carousel so you can peek behind and easily see apps ahead as you scroll through the list.</p><p>The active app immediately moves to the right of the screen so you can quickly juggle between multiple apps. Of course, this design is nearly identical to the iOS style of multitasking that has existed on iPhones for over a decade, and it's about time, too.</p><p>Google launched the old horrendous layout with Android 9, and I never understood why the company kept it for as long as it did. It's not a multitasking UI if you can only see one app at a time. This at least does a lot to fix that, even if it's a blatant iOS ripoff.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Good Lock isn't ready yet, so what you see is what you get until then.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>If you want any of the other multitasking styles, you'll have to wait until Good Lock's Home Up module gets updated for One UI 7 compatibility, likely after the final OS launch, which is expected in January.</p><p>Other refreshes around the OS include new icons, updated fonts, a new battery indicator that looks super swanky, and plenty of new widgets you'll definitely want to play around with. I particularly love the countdown widget, which lets you pick a specific date on the calendar and drop it on your home screen to build anticipation.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zxVn5aMDEYed3Vtx6RXggF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-One-UI-7-Beta-2-beta-program-2" alt="One UI 7 Beta 2 running on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zxVn5aMDEYed3Vtx6RXggF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the new UI changes are mostly positive with a few controversial decisions, the "feeling" you get is something of a non-measurable category. If I compare One UI to something like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a>, for instance, Samsung's user experience still doesn't feel like the best of the best.</p><p>Haptics, for instance, still feel weak and are often missing in important places and it makes the experience feel so vacant compared to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>. Moving the brightness slider or clearing notifications on a OnePlus phone delivers satisfying haptics that make them feel like physical buttons or sliders, while Samsung's UI doesn't vibrate or feel responsive at all.</p><p>Animations in One UI 7 aren't anywhere near the caliber of OxygenOS 15 on the OnePlus 12. For instance, when you set a timer and swipe home on OnePlus's OxygenOS 15, the app will "minimize" to the status bar in a super slick way. When you click the timer, it then warps and enlarges into the app when you click it.  This is better shown in motion, which you can see below.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zy5yp3mwcGY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung's new animations still aren't the same caliber that can be found in OxygenOS 15, and haptics in One UI 7 still feel vacant and hollow.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>However, in One UI 7, the app just slides down and away without any pomp. Clicking the live notification timer in the status bar just opens the app in the standard way. No pizazz. Nothing fun is happening at all.</p><p>What I will say is that Samsung's new Live Notifications are a great riff off of the iPhone's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/dynamic-island-android-hole-punch-cameras-overhaul">Dynamic Island</a> that I've been craving. But instead of just copying Apple, Samsung improved on the concept by making the notification "pill" appear at the bottom of the display where it's most clickable.</p><p>You'll see this new pill on the always-on display or the lock screen, making it easy to quickly pause that timer or take actionable information for a supported app. Otherwise, the little pill lives in the status bar on top, so you can see it at all times without it taking up any more room than the status bar ever does. Bravo, Samsung.</p>
<h2 id="ten-thousand-features-2">Ten thousand features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4y4nARBXegXWSs5ZCQPGMF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-One-UI-7-Beta-2-widgets" alt="Some of the new widgets in One UI 7 Beta 2 running on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4y4nARBXegXWSs5ZCQPGMF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you might expect from Samsung, the new features list for One UI 7 is a mile long. While some beloved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-new-one-ui-7-beta-killed-a-handy-lock-screen-feature">features were removed</a>, the new OS version is packed full of things you might only use a handful of times but, ultimately, will find useful when you get the chance to use them.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>There's something here for everyone, even if you only find yourself using it once in a blue moon.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>One example is moving all calendar entries to a new calendar instead of having to do it one by one. If you're sharing a file over Quick Share and it fails, you'll now be offered the option to transfer it using an internet connection instead of having to redo the transfer.</p><p>Notifications will also stack when an app gives you a bunch at a time. This is handy for when you have multiple Gmail accounts, for instance, as you'll get one instance of Gmail in the notification shade but can easily swipe down on it to see everything.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="enJL4UFZZFTfydRXBtZrW6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-One-UI-7-Beta-2-camera-ui" alt="The new camera UI in One UI 7 beta 2 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/enJL4UFZZFTfydRXBtZrW6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even the camera got some love, although I'm not super crazy about everything. The camera has a 2x zoom button right on the viewfinder, adding to the list of .6, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10x zoom options to instantly get where you want without having to scroll.  Samsung even added fun new effects for live photos so you can quickly turn them into a Boomerang or slow-motion preview of your photo.</p>
<h2 id="still-a-work-in-progress-2">Still a work in progress</h2>
<p>One UI 7 isn't perfect, but I think it's a huge step in the right direction for Samsung. One UI has felt a bit dated for a while now and needed some updating to feel modern again. I'm glad to see Samsung not only taking feedback but also being willing to make much-needed changes for UI elements that have been around for way too long, like that terrible horizontal app drawer.</p><p>This is only the second beta release for One UI 7, and the next release of the beta is expected to fix more bugs that'll likely crop up; plus, it could make a few tweaks based on user feedback in the beta program. Most likely, we'll see the next beta update pop up before the year ends.</p>

<ul><li>Google is making a new AI model, called Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced, available for Gemini Advanced subscribers starting today.</li><li>The model is designed for use with complex tasks, like coding and math.</li><li>Early benchmarks suggest that this LLM might not only be the best model from Google, but also one of the best from any company.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is sharing an early preview of its best artificial intelligence model yet, currently known as Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced. The move comes after the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-subscribers-can-now-use-gemini-flash-2-0-experimental-in-latest-gemini-app-beta">released Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental</a> just last week. Like  Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, the new Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced model brings significant improvements over the current crop of Gemini 1.5 models.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/gemini-exp-1206/" target="_blank">blog post</a> today announcing Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced availability, Google explained that the model brings "significantly improved performance on complex tasks such as coding, math, reasoning and instruction following."</p><p>The model is named <strong>Gemini-Exp-1206</strong>, and may be an early look at Gemini 2.0 Pro or another high-caliber AI model. The "Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced" name leaves some mystery as to exactly what this model will be. However, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Gemini 2.0</a> Flash Experimental model — now available on the Gemini web client and in the Gemini app beta — this is an early preview that Google warns might not work as expected.</p><p>"Remember this model is an early preview and might not work as expected," the blog post explains. "Additionally this model will not have access to real time information and won't be compatible with some Gemini features in its experimental state."</p>

<p>Google's claims of improved performance are already being backed up by benchmarks out in the wild. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard" target="_blank">Chatbot Arena</a> lists Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced as the number one LLM on its leaderboard. It's slightly above the latest version of OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o, and also above Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental. By all indications, this is Google's best AI model yet.</p><p>You can try out Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced now in the Gemini web client, as long as you're a paying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> subscriber. The model is available as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> plan, which costs $20 per month.</p>

Notably, OnePlus' press release announcing the forthcoming launch mentions the "OnePlus 13 series," indicating that the unannounced midrange OnePlus 13R could also be in tow.</p><p>The official announcement confirms much of what we already knew about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>. After all, the phone already debuted in China. It'll be available in three colorways: Black Eclipse, Arctic Dawn, and Midnight Ocean. Additionally, the company confirmed the phone will be powered by Qualcomm's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> processor and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">features IP68 and IP69 durability ratings</a>.</p><p>Notably, we still don't know how much the OnePlus 13 will cost — we'll have to wait a few weeks for the launch event for that.</p>

<p>Aside from that the OnePlus 13 will debut with Android 15, and it'll be one of the first phones sold in the U.S. to do so. The Google Pixel 9 series launched with Android 14, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> series is expected to release after the OnePlus 13. OxygenOS 15 already came to other OnePlus devices via OTA updates, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">we already know what it'll bring</a>.</p><p>We're also getting a new colorway for the OnePlus Buds Pro 3, and it's Sapphire Blue. It'll complement the OnePlus 13's Midnight Ocean colorway and give people the option of creating a blue-themed mobile ecosystem.</p>

<p>Finally, the OnePlus 13 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a> will work together to introduce AI translation features, similar to those that Samsung and Google already offer. Information about the OnePlus 13 has been slowly trickling out, and eager buyers won't have to wait much longer to get their hands on the upcoming smartphone.</p>

<p>NotebookLM's Audio Overviews just got a whole lot more interactive. After a successful year, NotebookLM is letting users have actual conversations with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">AI Audio Overview hosts</a>.</p><p>Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-new-features-december-2024/" target="_blank">introduced</a> a new feature that lets you interact with AI hosts of generated podcasts. After a podcast is created, you can turn on "Interactive Mode" and hit "Join" to start chatting live with the AI hosts.</p><p>You can jump into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">NotebookLM</a> podcast with your voice and ask the AI hosts to explain stuff more or give you the details you want. Plus, there's a new three-panel interface that should make managing and creating content in the app a lot easier.</p><p>The three sections include a "Sources" panel to manage all your project info, a "Chat" panel to talk through your sources with AI, and a "Studio" panel for creating new content, like Audio Interfaces, from your sources.</p><p>Audio Overviews and AI hosts are designed to help users tackle their uploaded docs—like class notes or legal papers—in a whole new way, making it easier to understand.</p><p>Google describes it as having a personal tutor who listens to you and answers using the info from the sources you’ve shared.</p>

<p>Talking to NotebookLM could be a cool way to explore your saved content, but Google says it’s still in the experimental stage. So, don’t be shocked if the AI stumbles or slips up with some details.</p><p>Finally, both individuals and organizations can now grab NotebookLM Plus, a subscription that offers five times more Audio Overviews, notebooks, and sources per notebook, plus extra audio customization options and boosted security, privacy, and analytics.</p><p>The subscription is up for grabs now by businesses, educational institutions, and organizations. It’ll roll into Google One AI Premium sometime in early 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out a new PDF viewer for the Files by Google app, as it shared in a recent update to the app's Play Store listing.</li><li>The old PDF viewer incorporated Google Drive, but now, the new one is specific to Google Files.</li><li>It's easier to share, star, and take actions while viewing a PDF while using the new Files by Google interface.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Files by Google is getting a minor upgrade that could improve your PDF viewing experience. The app is rolling out a new view that leverages a custom PDF viewer, rather than using the integrated one from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a>. This will make accessing certain options easier, such as starring a PDF or sharing it with others. Alternatively, you can still use the PDF viewer in the Google Drive app if you prefer the previous user-interface.</p><p>Google previewed the change in an update to the "What's new" section of the Files by Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files&pli=1" target="_blank">app listing on</a> the Google Play Store. "Over the next few weeks, we’re rolling out improvements to your experience with PDF files," the note reads. "Print, find content, or access markup tools whenever you open a PDF in the Files app."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/16/files-by-google-pdf-viewer/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first spotted that the change was rolling out to users of version 1.5687 of the Google Files app after a server-side tweak. Android Central confirmed the new PDF viewer on its devices, but notably, one device had to be updated to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> before the change took effect.</p><p>You can see the new look of the PDF viewer in Files by Google in the screenshots below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JS8osd24PJZhzVjAhtSUdM" name="Files-PDF-Viewer" alt="A PDF opened in the Files by Google app on various versions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JS8osd24PJZhzVjAhtSUdM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">From left to right: Old PDF viewer, new PDF viewer, new PDF viewer + overflow menu. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, the overflow menu lets you access key options that weren't available using the previous UI. With the old version, some menu buttons were only accessible through the list view of documents in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/files-by-google-gains-receive-floating-action-button">Files by Google app</a>. They weren't there after the PDF was opened using the external Drive viewer, but that has been rectified with the new Files by Google custom PDF viewer.</p><p>The <strong>Find</strong> and <strong>Save to Drive</strong> icons have been replaced with <strong>Star</strong> and <strong>Share </strong>on the new viewer. These can be pressed without opening the overflow menu. The new overflow menu includes more options, including <strong>Use as</strong>, <strong>Open with</strong>, <strong>Move to Trash</strong>, <strong>Move to</strong>, <strong>Copy to</strong>, <strong>Move to Safe folder</strong>, <strong>File info</strong>, <strong>Find in file</strong>, and <strong>Print</strong>.</p><p>Finally, the markup button (floating action button) has been redesigned, and some files will have a <strong>Google Lens</strong> button above it that quickly opens <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> QPR2 Beta 2 update is rolling out to testers on eligible Pixel devices starting today, Dec. 16, Google announced in a Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1hftm6b/android_15_qpr2_beta_2_now_available/" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Android Beta Program subreddit. The update includes a variety of bug fixes and other improvements; however, the exciting part of Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2 is what wasn't officially announced.</p><p>A few work-in-progress features spotted in earlier versions of Android 15 beta releases now appear to be functional. For starters, the Linux Terminal app for Android is now working in Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2. The new app was first spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-1-pixel-test-start">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1</a>, but didn't work — it would crash after trying to load a new virtual machine. Now, in Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2, the app can download, configure, and run instances of Linux using the Android Virtualization Framework.</p><p>Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2 testers confirmed the Linux Terminal app worked after upgrading, and so did Android expert Mishaal Rahman in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1868798147989844270" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter). It isn't the only previously-covered feature to appear as part of the update. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-has-a-new-trick-to-put-a-damper-on-annoying-app-pings#:~:text=You%20can%20find%20notification%20cooldown,it%20can%20be%20super%20annoying.">Notification cooldowns</a>, which were originally thought to be an Android 16 feature, are also working in Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2.</p>

That’s because the Pixel 10 is expected to gain a major performance boost since the Tensor G5 chip is expected to be fabricated using TSMC’s 3nm process. To my surprise, Google managed to ship a quite compelling product in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>. Regardless, the Pixel 10 is still something to be excited about — even with this new wild card.</p><p>There’s a part of your smartphone that is absolutely crucial to how you use it to connect with others, access your favorite apps and sites, and more. It’s also one you probably don’t think about often: the modem. According to Android Authority, Google is reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tipped-to-bring-mediatek-5g-modem-to-pixel-10-series" target="_blank">exploring a switch from Samsung modems to a MediaTek modem on the Pixel 10</a>, and it could have significant implications.</p><p>High-speed, reliable 5G modems are hard to come by, and only a few companies in the world can make them. Qualcomm dominated the space for years and still dominates to an extent. However, due to cost and other reasons, smartphone manufacturers have been trying to move away from Qualcomm modems.</p><p>That leaves Samsung and MediaTek as the only other companies with the capabilities of producing a modern 5G modem. That is, unless it wanted to make its own. Apple is an example of how difficult it is to take that path to building a new modem. It got a head start by purchasing Intel’s mobile modem business in 2019, and five years later, it is still trying to build one reliable and competitive enough to best the Qualcomm ones it uses in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review" target="_blank">iPhone 16 series</a>.</p><p>That’s why it isn’t all that surprising that Google probably won’t make a modem in-house. Developing a custom system-on-a-chip, like Google’s Tensor series, is a different thing entirely. Modems can make or break the smartphone experience, and every switch carries the risk of potential disaster.</p>

<p>For years, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-details-pixel-9-modem-security-improvements">Google has used Samsung modems in Pixel phones</a>. The move correlated with the shift to Google’s in-house Tensor processor, which is fabricated by Samsung. The idea is simple — it’s easy to use an Exynos modem with an Exynos chip. The newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> all use Exynos modems to this day, likely for that reason.</p><p>However, all signs point to the next Tensor G5 chip being fabricated by a company other than Samsung. In fact, it’s nearly a lock that the Tensor G5 will be produced using TSMC’s advanced 3nm process node. Back in July, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">Google reportedly gave the green light to manufacture the Tensor G5</a> on TSMC’s 3nm process. If easy integration and cost were reasons for Google using Samsung modems, they wouldn’t be applicable to future Pixels now that Google is moving away from using Samsung Foundry for Tensor chipmaking.</p><p>That means Google is poised to make a switch, and its choice will be an interesting one. After all, only a handful of brands use external modems. Qualcomm integrates its modems with its systems-on-a-chip, so any phone using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> processor will also feature a Qualcomm modem. So, Google could purchase an external modem from either Samsung, Qualcomm, or MediaTek to pair with its Tensor G5 chip.</p><p>Google reportedly settled on MediaTek, specifically on using an unannounced MediaTek T900 modem in the Pixel 10 series. Per the report, it considered a few options, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-x75-5g-modem">Qualcomm’s X75 modem</a>, in its upcoming phones. It’s unclear what led Google to decide on MediaTek modems, but efficiency and cost are presumably two large factors. The tight integration between Samsung’s 5G modems and Google’s Tensor processors can be partially attributed to the excellent efficiency and battery life offered by Pixel phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ppx2XnXUjksHgLDqz4RePJ" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-10.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL angled view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ppx2XnXUjksHgLDqz4RePJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s impossible to say how the MediaTek T900 modem will perform compared to the top options from Samsung and Qualcomm, considering it’s not even available yet. Additionally, since MediaTek, Samsung, and Qualcomm all integrate their in-house modems with their SoCs, there isn’t a lot of data covering how they’d perform as external modems.</p><p>With that caveat in mind, there’s still an adage that I think applies in this case: if it ain’t broke, don’t fit it. Google has found a great balance between 5G performance and efficiency with its current Samsung Exynos modems, and disrupting that carries a huge risk. Of course, it was probably inevitable since Google would disrupt the easy integration of Samsung-produced chips and modems when it moved to TSMC on the Tensor G5.</p><p>In that case, why not shoot for the best and use Qualcomm modems? The Qualcomm X75 is still clearly the industry standard for 5G modem technology, and it’s found inside the iPhone 16 series. Crucially, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/08/qualcomm-achieves-world-s-fastest-5g-downlink-with-sub-6-ghz-ban" target="_blank">the X75 achieved the world record</a> for the fastest 5G downlink. It’s an absolutely fantastic modem that’s reliable, and it beats anything that MediaTek, Samsung, and Apple currently have the ability to make.</p><p>I'll reiterate that while the reasons behind the MediaTek move will probably never be known, it’s likely that cost is a driving factor. In that case, I’m disappointed. Pixel phones are not exactly cheap anymore, and going for the best 5G modem available would’ve given Google even more credibility as a manufacturer of some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>.</p><p>Instead, it appears that Google went the cheap route. Only time will tell whether that was the right or wrong decision. The modem is a part of your phone you hope you don’t have to think about. If this move works out in Google’s favor, no one will talk about the new modem on the Pixel 10.</p><p>However, it’s a move Google can’t afford to get wrong. It could completely undermine the real progress it’ll make with Tensor G5 on the Pixel 10.</p>

<ul><li>TECNO recently held its Future Lens 2024 event in China.</li><li>The company unveiled new Image Matrix that will use AI to enhance images using a multi-layered process.</li><li>TECNO also revealed features that will enhance telephoto images and photos of fast-moving subjects.</li><li>These features are expected to appear in a new TECNO smartphone in 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TECNO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tecno-pioneers-ai-imaging-with-unveiling-of-tecno-image-matrix-and-two-ai-powered-imaging-technologies-at-future-lens-2024-302324650.html">unveiled</a> its latest AI efforts during its Future Lens 2024 event in China, which aim to enhance mobile photography and overcome major pain points for users when taking photos.</p><p>At the helm of these is TECNO's new Image Matrix, which will be the backbone of a new imaging process. The Image Matrix will take a multi-layered approach to imaging, working to enhance a photo at each step. This, of course, starts at the hardware level, utilizing the camera hardware, display, chipset, and sensor to capture the image. The image is then deconstructed using as many as 10 different algorithms, focusing on various aspects of the image, such as noise reduction, focus, tone adjustment, detection, and more.</p>
<p>The Image Matrix takes that information and reconstructs the image using the TECNO Algorithm Process Stack (TAPS), which powers several different image processing engines to enhance speed, low-light performance, skin tone, and more. The final layer is the application layer, where the final output is available for use with TECNO's other imaging features for further enhancement.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.11%;"><img id="FxyZM4ADo5aToQW8n77zUJ" name="TECNO-Image-matrix" alt="TECNO Image Matrix details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FxyZM4ADo5aToQW8n77zUJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1276" height="716" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TECNO is also introducing some unique methods that aim to improve high-speed image capture and zooming. The first, dubbed EVS Dynamic Snapshot, tracks and records the motion of a subject at a high frequency, then combines static and motion image data to ensure that the resulting image remains sharp at the pixel level. This feature is ideal for capturing fast-moving subjects such as athletes or vehicles in motion, promising a clearer image than you would get using traditional methods with some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">other premium Android phones</a>.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9SAvEw1CVds" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Finally, TECNO's Tap Any Zoom feature utilizes a dual prism telephoto design to better frame subjects when zooming in. According to TECNO, a user can double-tap a subject, and the camera will select the appropriate zoom level to keep it in the frame. Additionally, the lens-shift optical image stabilization will let you zoom into virtually any particular section of the frame, keeping the subject in focus with minimal camera shake, even at high magnification levels, to ensure your subject remains in the frame.</p><p>And with telephoto sweep, users can stitch together multiple telephoto images for a high-quality ultrawide-angle image with out the distortion often found in traditional wide-angle cameras. This also makes it possible to easily recompose a shot while retaining a high-quality image.</p>

<p>In the image below, you can see how the photo utilizes both EVS and Tap Any Zoom by automatically framing the biker in the shot while keeping the fast-moving subject in focus. The result is a stark contrast from the image without these features enabled.</p>

<h2 id="coming-soon-2">Coming soon</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, TECNO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tecno-ai-foldable-strategy-interview">announced a suite of features</a> that it's bringing to its smartphones as part of its efforts to bring "practical AI" to consumers. This means focusing on features that will make it easy to summarize, translate, and create content for users. These new camera-focused features are the latest approach to using AI to further enhance its devices, which can help bridge the gap between high-end and low-end smartphones.</p><p>TECNO is well-versed in emerging markets by launching impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget Android phones</a> in regions where consumers may not be able to spend exorbitant amounts of money on tech. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">Phantom V Flip 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-fold-2-review">Phantom V Fold 2</a> are just two examples of great phones that undercut the competition by a significant margin, with the latter in particular impressing us with its imaging capabilities. By utilizing AI to enhance camera quality, the company is basically saying you don't need to spend a ton of money to capture a good image. Furthermore, the company hinted that we could see more AI imaging capabilities down the road, although for now, it is focused on bringing these features to market.</p><p>Fortunately, we may not have to wait too long to see these features in action. TECNO says these features will arrive sometime in 2025 on an upcoming smartphone.</p>

<ul><li>Google highlighted the rollout of its ChromeOS M131 update for Chromebooks, which includes a "Safety Reset" for users.</li><li>Another major inclusion is Flash notifications: a function that will flash a user's screen to ensure they don't miss important alerts.</li><li>Google pushed M130 for Chromebooks and Chromebook Plus models in November with several AI features and OS-level security tools.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is returning with another update for its Chromebooks with a few new features to shore up its major November patch.</p><p>A Chromebook <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/313128087?hl=en&s=31">community post</a> highlighted the update titled ChromeOS M131, which should start hitting devices today (Dec 16). While this update is lighter than the M130, Google is detailing a feature for Chromebooks called <strong>ChromeOS Back to Safety</strong>. As the title implies, the set of tools is intended to give users a clear look at the state of their laptop's security and ways to improve their online/device safety.</p><p>The primary function of this feature is "Safety Reset." Google's on-device description states Safety Reset will "help remove unwanted pop-ups, fix network issues, and address other unexpected issues." Specifically, this safety-focused refresh can reset your Chrome shortcuts, delete cookies, and temporary site data.</p><p>Google adds that Back to Safety will inform users of extensions they should disable and reset settings that could pose a threat to their device. Moreover, Safety Reset will not touch your bookmarks, history, or saved passwords.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:755px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.47%;"><img id="FgnwyKXaaDgjystc3cZXGh" name="google-chrome-os-m131-flash-notifications" alt="Google's ChromeOS M131 brings Flash notifications to Chromebooks." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FgnwyKXaaDgjystc3cZXGh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="755" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ChromeOS M131 is also adding a tool to help bring more awareness to your alerts via <strong>Flash notifications</strong>. Added into the Audio and Captions page of the Accessibility settings on your Chromebook, Google states Flash notifications will flicker or "flash the screen when you receive notifications." The company states this feature could be useful for those who utilize screen magnification or for the hard of hearing.</p><p>Moreover, it seems these Flash notifications can be colored. The settings option for it indicates a "flash screen color" with a drop down menu. Google didn't deliver specifics; however, we can see that a user's screen could quickly flash yellow to grab your attention.</p><p>Google also states that light-sensitive users should take caution should they enable this feature.</p><p>The final portion of M131 includes a restyling update for ChromeOS' AI-powered Quick Answers. Google reiterates that these responses provide the user with useful information via summaries, interactive outlines, and document Q&A. A separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/13616580">support document</a> states Quick Answers is accessible when right-clicking and can provide tools such as spell check, definitions, translations, and unit conversions.</p><p>ChromeOS M131 is rolling out today (Dec 16), so users should keep their eyes open as we go through the week.</p><p>This light M131 update adds a little more to what Chromebook and Chromebook Plus users experienced with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-chromeos-130-chromebook-plus-update-rollout">the huge M130 patch</a>. Chromebook Plus devices gained several AI features like "Help me read," which assist users by getting to the core of an article or lengthy passage of text without them needing to read through it. The feature also includes a freeform Q&A function for follow-up questions.</p><p>Additionally, all Chromebook devices picked up OS-level privacy features in Chrome.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is pushing One UI 7 beta 2 to Galaxy S24 devices in the U.S., packed with loads of bug fixes.</li><li>Among the fixes, beta 2 is correcting malfunctions with the Now Bar, issues with TV product connections over DeX, and more.</li><li>Samsung finally opened its One UI 7 beta program on December 5, which introduced the Now Bar on the lock screen.</li><li>One UI 7 is expected to arrive near or alongside the Galaxy S25 in January.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems enrolled One UI 7 beta testers can begin to expect the next iteration of software today (Dec 16).</p><p>Android Central has started receiving the update today on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> bearing software version <strong>ZXL5</strong>. Samsung detailed the rollout of the One UI 7 beta 2 update in its Members app, highlighting improved "system stability." The second beta packs quite a few fixes to bugs that testers have encountered since the program's start.</p><p>According to the changelog, Samsung states it has fixed a Quick Panel operation error alongside a display error regarding the "personal drawer App." Another bug fix rolling in is for the Galaxy S24's wireless connection to TV products through DeX. The company is also fixing an issue where "reminder widget transparency is not applied." However, the company states that an app update is required for that fix to go into effect.</p><p>The One UI 7 beta 2 patch informs users of app updates when the software is available. Tapping "view more" will likely take you to where you can update apps that require it post-download.</p><p>Another bug fix arrives for Samsung's newly unveiled Now Bar. The patch notes state it has corrected a "continuous display error and malfunction" after closing it.</p><p>The remainder of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:424px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:141.51%;"><img id="JfquUBgVZq4QorwKCExB9N" name="samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-bug-fixes-alt" alt="The changelog for One UI 7 beta 2 on the Galaxy S24 series." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JfquUBgVZq4QorwKCExB9N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="424" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the update spotted, other users enrolled in the One UI 7 beta program should soon expect it. Additionally, those just getting involved in the second beta can expect a huge 4GB download. However, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-rollout-3509206/">Android Authority</a>, those who've been enrolled since the beta's beginning will only download a 1GB patch as Samsung progresses its development. The publication also cites <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1868601315875787203">Max Jambor</a> in stating the update was spotted in Germany, the U.K., and South Korea alongside the U.S.</p><p>Users can head into the <strong>Samsung Members app > One UI 7 Beta Program banner </strong>to view the full changelog or provide testing feedback.</p><p>Samsung dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">the One UI 7 beta</a> earlier in December after the software faced an insurmountable amount of delays. Based on Android 15, the beta opened access to those with a Galaxy S24 series devices with the possibility of hitting others and a few past-gen phones.</p><p>Galaxy AI is at the core of this beta, with Samsung providing an early glimpse at Writing Tools: a set of AI-based writing and grammar options. The Now Bar was another major addition as users can find it incorporated as a significant feature on the lock screen. Users can view "important notifications dynamically" without opening their phones.</p><p>The stable version of One UI 7 is expected to arrive near or alongside the Galaxy S25's launch in January 2025.</p>

<p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-25-ultra-color-options-leaked">earlier leak</a> and also a new Finland-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://suomimobiili.fi/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-muisti-ja-variversiot-suomessa/">carrier listing</a> have revealed some of these color options. While Black, Green, Blue, and Titanium were already expected color variants just like the previous iteration models, the new ones that will likely take the limelight might be the new JetBlack and PinkGold. There are several JetBlack enthusiasts, and it could be on the likes of the Galaxy S23's Phantom Black or maybe even calling back to the iPhone 7.</p><p>The Pink Gold colorway, on the other hand, is not new to Samsung devices; older smartwatches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a> featured Pink Gold, and we expect the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra to likely incorporate the same or more pinkish to catch up to its counterparts like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> series.</p>

<p>Young has further shared that the aforementioned color options list are ranked by the number of units, which means the first few are likely to be widely available across online and offline stores, and presumably, the new ones at the bottom are more likely to be Samsung's online-exclusive units.</p><p>Aside from these colorways, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">thanks to the renders</a>, we have an idea of how the Galaxy S25 Ultra would appear. The handset will likely sport a more flatter design than the predecessor model and be slightly lighter to hold in hand than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced Gemini 2.0 last week, its newest set of models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental.</li><li>The experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Flash, a lightweight and fast model, became immediately available in the Gemini web client.</li><li>Now, Google is starting to bring the latest model to the Gemini app, adding support for Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental in the most recent beta update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">debuted Gemini 2.0 last week</a>, and now, the Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model is starting to make its way to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">mobile Gemini app</a>. The full suite of models is yet to be released, as Google is only making an “experimental” version of Gemini 2.0 Flash. The new, experimental model launched on the Gemini web client immediately, but Google said it would soon come to the official mobile apps.</p><p>Only a few days later, Google is beginning to roll out the Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model as part of the latest Gemini app beta, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/16/gemini-2-0-flash-app-android/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. Previously, the way to access Gemini Advanced models was to enable an option in settings. Now, with version 15.50 of the Gemini app, there is a new way to switch between models. You can top the model name at the top of the landing page to switch between models and learn more about them.</p><p>Expectedly, Google describes Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental as its “latest experimental model,” adding that it “might not work as expected.” Conversely, Gemini 1.5 Pro is “for complex tasks” and Gemini 1.5 Flash is a way to “get everyday help.” The company clearly wants users to know that this experimental version of Gemini 1.5 Flash is not a final release.</p><p>“While we’re excited for you to try it, remember it’s an early preview and might not work as expected,” the company warned in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. “Additionally, some Gemini features won't be compatible with this model in its experimental state.”</p>

<p>On top of that, the option will only be available to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> subscribers. The higher tier is available through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium plan</a>, which costs $20 per month. Aside from Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, the subscription also unlocks Google’s other top AI models, like Gemini 1.5 Pro.</p><p>You can try Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental today by enrolling in the Google app beta via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox/join" target="_blank">this link</a>. Otherwise, the option to use this model should become available through the stable channel soon.</p>

<hr>
<p>Your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> are about to get a major intelligence update, and you won't have to wait if you're an Early Access program member.</p><p>On Monday, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/ray-ban-meta-v11-software-update-live-ai-translation-shazam/">announced the v11 update</a>, with <strong>Live AI</strong> as the standout feature.  Until now, Meta AI could only respond to "Hey Meta" queries by taking a single photo and analyzing it. Now, "Meta AI can see what you see continuously and converse with you more naturally than ever before."</p><p>During a Live AI session, it'll record video and analyze what it sees in real time. You can ask it questions without the Hey Meta wake word, and the AI will remember things you asked earlier. You can also "interrupt anytime to ask follow-up questions or change topics," and Meta promises that the AI will proactively "give useful suggestions even before you ask."</p><p>If that sounds familiar, it's because Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a> offers similar conversational AI, with interruptions and remembered queries. But that's tied to your Android phone, whereas Meta's Live AI will let you ask questions without needing to hold anything.</p><p>During Meta Connect 2024 in October, Zuckerberg gave an example of using Live AI to look at your closet and ask which clothes would best fit a Roaring 20s-themed costume party. We'll have to test how well it works in practice, but the concept is intriguing and a big step up for the smart glasses.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I7JyydkqDeI?start=1717" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The second v11 update feature is <strong>Live translate</strong>, which Zuckerberg demoed at Meta Connect 2024. As the name suggests, you can speak in English with someone speaking Spanish, French, or Italian and either see their responses on your phone or hear them through the Ray-Ban Meta glasses' speakers.</p><p>Google has offered live translate for years, and in more languages. Meta's version is unique because of its hands-free option, but the translation delay will still make conversations a bit awkward (based on Zuckerberg's Connect demo).</p><p>The final v11 update is <strong>Shazam integration</strong>. You'll simply say, "Hey Meta, Shazam this song," and find out what the music playing around you is.</p><p>If you want to test these features today, you'll need to sign up for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/smart-glasses/articles/voice-controls/early-access-program-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">Early Access program</a>, or else wait for the final release. That link walks you through the steps, but all you really need to do is opt in from the Settings menu of the Meta View app. Otherwise, the stable version should arrive in early 2025.</p><p>Meta has pushed out several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-just-got-a-bunch-of-ai-upgrades-and-live-translation">useful AI updates</a> in recent months, such as the ability to ask Meta AI to "remember" something — such as where you parked — and have it photograph the relevant thing and create a reminder for later.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion AR glasses</a> on the horizon, Meta is wisely pushing out iterative AI updates on its display-free smart glasses for now, getting Meta AI ready for the next generation and challenging Google Gemini and its nascent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">Android XR platform</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google starts the week with a new AI experiment in Labs that U.S. users can start signing up for.</p><p>As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/httpsbloggoogletechnologygoogle-labswhisk/">Keyword post</a>, the newest test for Labs is called "Whisk" and goes about image generation in a new way: by letting users "prompt with images." This is an alternative to writing a detailed description, in case the words aren't flowing. Google explains that its newest model, Whisk, which leverages Gemini and Imagen 3, "extracts only a few key characteristics from your image."</p><p>To get started, the company says users must provide three images for the following areas: subject, scene, and style.</p><p>The AI model is said to consider everything to generate a new "unique" image, like a Whimsical Walrus or an image of a pink donut enamel pin. However, Google warns that its AI only considers things to capture the "essence" of whatever images the user has uploaded to Whisk.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fyFDztZxlEc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Google says that this design is intentional as Whisk <em>will not </em>replicate whatever you've uploaded to the letter. The post adds that certain aspects of your images, such as subject height, hairstyle, and skin tone might vary, too. It understands that these attributes are important to users, which is why Google says Whisk gives users a "review and edit" feature after generation.</p><p>The company adds that this AI model is intended to give users a quicker experience with image generation than the typical methods. Moreover, Whisk lets users "remix" the images they've added to the creation tool for another round of ideas. After an image is created — using Gemini's model — Whisk will create a "detailed" description of what it created.</p><p>Labs testers in the U.S. can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://labs.google/whisk">sign up today</a> (Dec 16) for Whisk and try it out.</p>
<h2 id="new-veo-and-imagen-versions-2">New Veo and Imagen Versions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1041px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:41.11%;"><img id="AcHCyCZDQgb8JwYuGpsd6B" name="google-veo-2-imagen-3-updates-detailed" alt="Google detailed several updates for Imagen 3 and Veo 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AcHCyCZDQgb8JwYuGpsd6B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1041" height="428" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/video-image-generation-update-december-2024/">blog post</a>, Google detailed new versions of Veo 2 and Imagen 3. Beginning with the latter, the post says Imagen 3 has been updated to produce "brighter" and "better composed" images. Imagen 3 can reportedly follow your descriptions (prompts) better than before with richer details in its final renders.</p><p>The newest version of Imagen 3 is rolling out today (Dec 16) globally in ImageFX in Google Labs.</p><p>The latest updates to Imagen 3 arrive just before the year's end <em>and </em>several months <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-imagen-3-is-now-open-to-everyone-in-the-us">after its (quiet) U.S. launch</a>. Google started making its AI image generator available to users more prominently in August on its Vertex AI platforms. The company touts its safety precautions in place to avoid the creation of illegal or otherwise offensive imagery through Imagen 3.</p><p>Elsewhere, Veo 2 is receiving an update that widens the AI video generator's horizons. Google states this new version of Veo 2 lets users create "incredibly high-quality" videos for a "wide range of subjects and styles." Veo 2 can reportedly reach resolutions heights of 4K and it can supposedly understand more detailed descriptions of what you want.</p><p>The company gives the example of a user telling Veo 2 to utilize an "18mm lens" and states the AI will understand how to replicate a wide angled shot. Moreover, its understanding of expressions, movements, and more help to facilitate a more engrossed AI-generated video experience.</p><p>Google also states that Veo 2's latest updates help it hallucinate details "less frequently."</p><p>Today (Dec 16), Veo 2's update is rolling out in Google Labs' VideoFX and the company is slowly expanding the number of test participants. If you're interested, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google/fx/tools/video-fx">signup on the waitlist</a>. Google then teased its plans to bring Veo 2 to YouTube Shorts and "other products" next year. Plans for YouTube incorporation are something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-longer-content-template-details">we heard about earlier this year</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung will likely add a new Magnet case accessory supporting Qi2 charging tech.</li><li>The long-rumored charging tech might finally be seen on Galaxy S25 series’ accessories next month.</li><li>The flagship trio is expected to be unveiled in the U.S. on January 22, 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is prepping for the Galaxy S25 series at an anticipated launch happening in a month, as rumored; however, it isn’t stopping us from wondering what to expect, and the latest report brings back some exciting information regarding the wireless charging capabilities of the upcoming Galaxy S25 models.</p><p>According to the Finland-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://suomimobiili.fi/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-muisti-ja-variversiot-suomessa/">SuomiMobiili</a> report (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/qi2-wireless-charging-galaxy-s25-but-only-with-magnetic-case/">Android Police</a>), Samsung will be throwing in a new accessory with the sale of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series, which brings support for the Qi2 standard wireless charging to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>.</p><p>Although it is entirely different from native Qi2 charging support built right into the handset, it still gets the job done for users who would want their phones to meet modern wireless charging standards with the help of an essential accessory.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="y8h3vMdZKACqFBnA9YtG5H" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-caseborne-case-01.jpg" alt="The Caseborne clear case with MagSafe magnets for the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y8h3vMdZKACqFBnA9YtG5H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Qi2 standard has been around since 2023, no major Android OEM has been able to bring it to the mainstream handsets, and the Galaxy S24 series was anticipated to incorporate the feature; however, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-dropped-the-ball-qi2-galaxy-s24">made no avail</a>. Further, the compatible accessories were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">reported to be altering</a> with the S-Pen feature on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p><p>With the latest information, however, things might move around as Samsung is bringing compatible Magnet cases next to traditional protective cases. It also eliminates the need to rely on third-party compatible cases, which caused some issues in the first place.</p>
<p>It also means users will be able to use Apple’s MagSafe accessories for the upcoming trio of Galaxy S25 series if the report turns out to be accurate. Other than the accessories, the report further confirms the launch date of the Unpacked event, which is most probably bound to happen on January 22, 2025 in the U.S.</p><p>Moreover, the regular Galaxy S25 is likely to carry 128GB as the base variant, whereas the Galaxy S25 Ultra should start with 256GB as the base variant and go all the way up to 1TB.</p>

<ul><li>Google's next flagship phones are likely to introduce MediaTek's new 5G modem.</li><li>The yet-to-be-announced 5G modem is rumored to be in testing on the Pixel 10 prototype handsets.</li><li>Alongside the new Tensor G5 produced by TSMC instead of Samsung, this might be a new addition to the Pixel 10 lineup.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google might be silently working on the next flagship models—the Pixel 10 series. While very little is known about the devices via rumors and leaks, new information reveals the possible shift of the modem on the upcoming Pixel 10 models.</p><p>The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-mediatek-modem-pixel-10-3507964/">Android Authority</a>, which indicates that Google is testing the MediaTek T900 modem for the alleged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> prototypes. While the publication cites an inside source for this new information, very little is known about the upcoming modem, which is yet to be released by the chipset maker.</p>
<p>As the publication notes, Google only has three major chipset makers to choose from for the device's modem, including Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Samsung, unless it wants to develop the modem in-house. This is similar to what the company is trying to achieve with the Tensor G5 and other succeeding SoCs going forward, which will likely be used in the upcoming Pixel devices.</p><p>It is believed that Google has even considered using Qualcomm's Snapdragon X75 modem, primarily used in the Apple iPhone 16 series; however, for reasons uncited, the search giant is likely opting for MediaTek's T900, notes Android Authority.</p><p>The upcoming T900 is expected to be based on MediaTek's M85 IP modem; for reference, the previous iteration, M80, relied on 3GPP Release 16 5G specification. This means that the presumed successor is likely to rely on the specifications of Release 17 5G.</p>
<p>All the evidence regarding the modem is still speculative at this point, and it could be way too early to jump on assumptions about the performance aspect of the modem on the Pixel 10 series.</p><p>On the other hand, Google is rumored to bring at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">four Pixel 10 models</a> next year with the in-house <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">customized Tensor G5</a>, which will be a departure from Samsung as TSMC steps in for the chipset production. The supposed models could include Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>However, the next product launch before the flagship series is believed to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">recent renders</a>/ <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-real-life-images-leak-again">real-life images</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-leak-reveal-every-last-spec-of-the-handset">leaked specs</a> of it already indicate a promising handset from the search giant.</p>
