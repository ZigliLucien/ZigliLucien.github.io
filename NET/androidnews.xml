                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OpenAI has done something nobody would have expected: it slowed down the process of giving you an answer in the hopes that it gets it right.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/">new OpenAI o1-preview models</a> are designed for what OpenAI calls hard problems — complex tasks in subjects like science, coding, and math. These new models are released through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-now-use-chatgpt-without-an-account">ChatGPT service</a> along with access through OpenAI&apos;s API and are still in development, but this is a promising idea.</p>
<p>I love the idea that one of the companies that made AI so bad is actually doing something to improve it. People think of AI as some sort of scientific mystery but at its core, it is the same as any other complex computer software. There is no magic; a computer program accepts input and sends output based on the way the software is written.</p><p>It <em>seems</em> like magic to us because we&apos;re used to seeing software output in a different way. When it acts human-like, it seems strange and futuristic, and that&apos;s really cool. Everyone wants to be Tony Stark and have conversations with their computer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the rush to release the cool type of AI that seems conversational has highlighted how bad it can be. Some companies call it a hallucination (not the fun kind, unfortunately), but no matter what label is placed on it, the answers we get from AI are often hilariously wrong or even wrong in a more concerning way.</p>

<p>OpenAI says that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-voice-assistant-demo-teaser-io-2024">GPT-4 model</a> was only able to get 13% of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imo-official.org/">International Mathematics Olympiad</a> exam questions correct. That&apos;s probably better than most people would score but a computer <em>should</em> be able to score more accurately when it comes to mathematics. The new OpenAI o1-preview was able to get 83% of the questions correct. That is a dramatic leap and highlights the effectiveness of the new models.</p>
<p>Thankfully, OpenAI is true to its name and has shared how these models "think." In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/">an article about the reasoning capabilities</a> of the new model, you can scroll to the "Chain-of-Thought" section to see a glimpse into the process. I found the Safety section particularly interesting as the model has used some safety rails to make sure it&apos;s not telling you how to make homemade arsenic like the GPT-4 model will (don&apos;t try to make homemade arsenic). This will lead to defeating the current tricks used to get conversational AI models to break their own rules once they are complete.</p>
<p>Overall, the industry needed this. My colleague and Android Central managing editor Derrek Lee pointed out that it&apos;s interesting that when we want information instantly, OpenAI is willing to slow things down a bit, letting AI "think" to provide us with better answers. He&apos;s absolutely right. This feels like a case of a tech company doing the right thing even if the results aren&apos;t optimal. </p><p>I don&apos;t think this will have any effect overnight, and I&apos;m not convinced there is a purely altruistic goal at work. OpenAI wants its new LLM to be better at the tasks the current model does poorly. A side effect is a safer and better conversational AI that gets it right more often. I&apos;ll take that trade, and I&apos;ll expect Google to do something similar to show that it also understands that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overview-problems">AI needs to get better</a>.</p><p>AI isn&apos;t going away until someone dreams up something newer and more profitable. Companies might as well work on making it as great as it can be.</p>

<hr>
<p>Testers rejoice; Google is starting to push its OTA update for all users enrolled in its Android 15 QPR1 beta program.</p><p>The march toward the December feature drop continues as Google posted the official patch notes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1ff93un/android_15_qpr1_beta_2_now_available/">on Reddit</a> today (Sept 12). The update is rolling out from the Pixel 6 series to the Pixel 9 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> joining the test. Those with the original Fold and the Pixel Tablet are also eligible as everyone downloads the newest update bearing version <strong>AP41.240823.009</strong>.</p><p>The changelog this time is quite extensive, as Google details several fixes for Pixel devices across several areas. The company states it solved an issue for Pixel phones regarding a Google Maps crash. Another fix brings back user control over the "80% device charge limit" as some couldn&apos;t disable the feature.</p><p>NFC payment fixes, a Satellite SOS demo bug preventing it from launching, and Bluetooth connection interruption fixes are included. The update also solves an "unexpected restart" that has plagued Pixel devices. Google states it&apos;s continued to implement solutions for various other stability, performance, and connectivity issues.</p><p>Users report varying download sizes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1ff93un/comment/lmsxfq8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">as posts claim</a> it&apos;s 2.7GB while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1ff93un/comment/lmsxqje/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">others state</a> 2.4GB. Either way, the remainder of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>(Bluetooth) Made AIDL changes to support LE Audio multi-codec, including extensions for vendor codecs.</li><li>(Bluetooth) Fixed a bug of <a href="https://android.devsite.corp.google.com/reference/android/bluetooth/le/ScanRecord#getManufacturerSpecificData()" target="_blank">ScanRecord.getManufacturerSpecificData()</a> to return merged multiple Manufacturer Specific Data instead of only returning the first Manufacturer Specific Data.</li><li>(Bluetooth) Fixed an issue where the phone gets stuck in an incorrect state when the remote device does RFCOMM Disconnection during Codec Negotiation while the phone is already having an active connection with a different device.</li><li>(Bluetooth) Fixed an issue where subsequent connection attempts failed locally after an outgoing HFP connection attempt was discarded.</li><li>(Bluetooth) Fixed an issue where the first paired device lost audio focus when a second device was paired and reconnected.</li><li>(Bluetooth) Fixed an issue where some headsets couldn't pair using Fast Pair due to a race condition where the Bluetooth stack incorrectly treats a LE-ACL disconnection during classic pairing as a pairing failure.</li></ul>

<p>Enrolled testers should begin noticing the update appear on their device today (Sept 12). However, it could take some time before your device picks it up, so continue to check as we end the week.</p><p>The fun doesn&apos;t stop there, as notable Android enthusiast <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1834263404950782236">Mishaal Rahman</a> dove into QPR1 Beta 2 on X and fished up some goodies. One highlight from the thread is Rahman noticed Google has developed its (potential) Android 16 Quick Settings menu redesign. This was previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notifications-quick-settings-panel-android-16-rumor">spotted last week</a>, but the latest beta update shows that the Android icons are "now present."</p><p>Additionally, Rahman made note of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1834294677157101611">desktop windowing</a>," which is now available on Android tablets courtesy of Android 15 QPR 1 Beta 2. The beta also shows a recording chip at the top left of your Pixel&apos;s display when recording your display or when screen casting. Lastly, Rahman notes that Google&apos;s proposed keyboard switcher has arrived for testing.</p><p>Users can quickly tap the globe icon at the bottom of their display to switch to another installed keyboard.</p><p>We&apos;re all still eagerly awaiting a stable Android 15 debut, but the wait might not last too long as rumors claim it could drop in October.</p>

<ul><li>A set of renderings from OnLeaks purport to show the design of the vanilla Galaxy S25 model.</li><li>The S25 could sport a change to its camera array, as Samsung could feature a black ring around the individual lenses and slightly shrink the device's dimensions.</li><li>The phone is rumored to continue to feature a 6.2-inch display, flat sides, and rounded corners.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems no one can contain the hype surrounding Samsung&apos;s next S series as new leaks purport another Galaxy S25 device.</p><p>The leaks, from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-2025">Android Headlines</a> in conjunction with X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1834273669066977384">OnLeaks</a>, showcase Samsung&apos;s base Galaxy S25 model. An initial glance shows a Galaxy S25 with a design that remains close to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">S24 predecessor</a>. However, the leaked rendering suggests Samsung will slightly change its triple camera array by encasing the individual lenses in a thicker, black ring.</p><p>An LED flash is still likely to arrive beside the array. Another proposed change may arrive for the S25&apos;s dimensions. The publication claims Samsung will shrink the phone to the following numbers (estimations): 146.9 x 70.4 x 7.2mm, compared to 147.0 x 70.6 x 7.6mm for the S24.</p><p>This change will supposedly deliver slightly slimmer bezels for the S25, too.</p><p>Despite the ever-so-slight shrinkage, the post states it shouldn&apos;t affect the display. Rumors say the S25 is likely to feature a 6.2-inch display just like the S24. Allegedly, the similarities continue as the renderings show flat sides and rounded corners. Such device aspects were common with the base and Plus Galaxy S models, leaving only the Ultra with the boxy, squared-off corners/frame.</p>

<p>There were some intriguing rumors about the vanilla <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-triple-camera-array-rumors">Galaxy S25&apos;s camera</a> in June. Speculation claims the device will continue its predecessor&apos;s 50MP primary lens, but upgrade the other two. This regarded the vanilla model and its Plus sibling, though it failed to deliver specifics — so take the rumor with a grain of salt.</p><p>On the other hand, an analyst predicted this summer that Samsung will likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-may-be-all-snapdragon-again-not-all-exynos">go all in on Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon SoC</a>. Supposedly, the Korean OEM implemented a dual-chip strategy by delivering the Snapdragon to U.S. consumers throughout the series, then dropping Exynos in other areas. For 2025, Samsung is rumored to stick with the former globally as its yield for the next Exynos chip was "lower than expected."</p><p>In case you missed it, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">batch of alleged renderings</a> representing the Galaxy S25 Ultra surfaced earlier this week. The images showcased a completely flat Ultra model, as Samsung may switch its design language. The renderings showed a similar change to the phone&apos;s camera lenses with a thicker black ring.</p><p>Samsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S25 series in January, if its past behavior is anything to count on.</p>

<ul><li>Google today announced plans to start beta-testing U.S. passports as digital IDs in Google Wallet soon. </li><li>Additionally, residents of Iowa, New Mexico, or Ohio will soon be able to add their state IDs to the Google Wallet in the coming months.

<hr>
<p>Google has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">teasing improvements</a> to pass and digital ID support in Google Wallet since January, and now, it&apos;s announcing a few major changes. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-pay/google-wallet-update-september-2024/" target="_blank">press release</a> today, Sept. 12, the company laid out plans to add support for three more state IDs and more commuter benefit cards in the Google Wallet. More importantly, it&apos;ll be beta-testing support for U.S. passports in Wallet.</p><p>There are two main reasons that digital IDs haven&apos;t taken off in the many years since they were first introduced. For starters, only a handful of states support them, and even fewer airports and restaurants accept them. The law requires you to carry your physical ID in every state that supports digital IDs in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a>, limiting its usefulness. Google&apos;s plan to add support for U.S. passports could solve at least one of these common grievances in the future.</p><p>It should be noted that U.S. passports added to the Google Wallet can only be used to pass through select Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints domestically. You can view the full map of TSA checkpoints that accept digital IDs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/digital-id/map" target="_blank">here</a>, which includes major hubs like LAX and SFO in California and JFK and LGA in New York City. However, the digitized version of your passport in Google Wallet will <strong>not</strong> allow you to pass through U.S. Customs and Border Protection domestically or abroad. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cGNYGkYbhKEJAo4Vn8ygUG" name="Google-Wallet-Passport-Setup.jpg" alt="Creating a passport pass in Google Wallet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cGNYGkYbhKEJAo4Vn8ygUG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, support for passports is significant because it allows anyone eligible for a U.S. passport to use the Google Wallet to speed through select TSA checkpoints. Previously, you needed to live in and have a driver&apos;s license for one of the few states that permitted digital IDs in Google Wallet. When support for U.S. passports goes live — the beta test is only described as "starting soon" — it will immediately make digital IDs more accessible to U.S. residents. </p><p>Adding a passport to Google Wallet will be fairly simple. It&apos;ll start with pressing a prompt titled <strong>Create an ID pass with your U.S. passport</strong>. Then, you&apos;ll scan the security chip embedded in the back of your passport. You need to take a selfie video to confirm it&apos;s you adding your passport to Google Wallet. From there, the app will notify users when their pass is ready. It&apos;ll usually take a few minutes. </p><p>Google says that passports are secured with encryption and your fingerprint, PIN or passcode is required to access them. The company adds: "You’re in control of the information shared: before using your digital ID for identity verification, you can review what information is being requested."</p><p>In addition to U.S. passports, three more states will support digital IDs in Google Wallet "in the coming months." Iowa, New Mexico and Ohio will join the current list of states supporting Google Wallet IDs: Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, and Maryland. Google wants you to be able to use these identification passes for more than just TSA checkpoints — in Colorado, a new MyColorado app feature will make it possible for businesses to accept Google Wallet IDs.</p><p>Finally, Google is expanding the ways you can use Google Wallet for commuter transit in the U.S. an abroad. Prepaid commuter benefit cards, starting with those from Edenred and HealthEquity, will be supported first.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-how-digital-ids-in-google-wallet-will-become-ubiquitous-2">Is this how digital IDs in Google Wallet will become ubiquitous?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yn9qGuZok7LNMr7ARZkrAS" name="Google-Wallet-new-features.jpg" alt="Google Wallet new features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yn9qGuZok7LNMr7ARZkrAS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve written in the past that getting 50 states to agree on everything is incredibly difficult. That&apos;s why digital IDs in Google Wallet are a tricky thing to make ubiquitous. In the years since digital IDs were conceptualized, neither Apple nor Google have been able to get even a double-digit number of states onboard. Well, instead of trying to get 50 entities onboard, it just has to get one: the federal government. </p><p>I&apos;d argue getting digital U.S. passports to be supported at every TSA checkpoint is just as hard, if not harder, than getting each and every U.S. state to allow their IDs to be added to Google Wallet. To be clear, today&apos;s announcements show Google is still working with state governments to allow their driver&apos;s licenses to work as digital IDs. However, by supporting U.S. passports, Google can effectively cut out the middle men (the states) and allow every U.S. citizen to use a digital ID in Wallet.  </p><p>Will it work? Only time will tell. But I&apos;m much more confident in Google&apos;s new plan to support U.S. passports than its continuous efforts to add states to Google Wallet, which has slowed to a crawl at times. If digital IDs are to become ubiquitous one day, they will be passports, not state IDs. </p><p>We have to give Google credit here. The company seems to have quietly pulled off an impressive feat that no one really expected. I said that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-support-for-california-ids-alongside-apple-wallet">Google Wallet was officially an Apple Wallet competitor last month</a>, but if U.S. passport support takes off, it&apos;ll be <em>better</em> than Apple Wallet.</p>

<ul><li>Apple announced the iPhone 16 series this week, which brings a minor redesign, a new Camera Control button, and a chip upgrade. </li><li>Once again, the iPhone 16 series represents a minor year-over-year upgrade that is unlikely to convince current users to upgrade.</li><li>To revitalize the iPhone lineup and shake things up, Apple needs a foldable. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Is Apple&apos;s current iPhone strategy to add one minor feature, plus a spec bump, to its smartphones each year and call it a day? That&apos;s certainly what it looks like. With the iPhone 14 Pro, it was the Dynamic Island. Then, the iPhone 15 Pro brought the Action button. Now, the entire iPhone 16 series gets a Camera Control button. </p><p>Add in a design tweak here and there, and a camera upgrade every few years, and you&apos;ve summed up the iPhone refresh schedule. There are some things to like — Apple&apos;s silicon is still the top performer compared to Qualcomm and Google, for example — but recent iPhone launches, including the iPhone 16 series, appear to be massively underwhelming. Especially when you consider what&apos;s happening in the Android world, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">the release of tri-fold phones</a>.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@relatablevijay/post/C_ztaq7T8CZ?xmt=AQGzpqgQHw5ZGObAFmR7bRr40daPO3AhLR7QIn2cpvNTEg" target="_blank">Vijay on Threads</a> perfectly summed up the problem with recent iPhone launches in the graphic above. In five years and six iPhone generations, it&apos;s hard to tell what&apos;s really different. To be clear, Android phones aren&apos;t immune from this issue, which is a consequence of market maturity. Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> lineup barely looks any different from the past few generations of Galaxy phones. </p><p>In fact, Google is one of the few phone manufacturers that really tries to shake things up every single year. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> looks different than the Pixel 8, which appears unique compared to the Pixel 7, and so on. Despite some of Google&apos;s shortcomings, I have to give it credit for continually trying to innovate with each Pixel generation. </p><p>You could argue that Apple tries to do the same with the iPhone, adding things like the Dynamic Island, Action button, and Camera Control button. However, as a user of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-14-pro-review">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, I&apos;ve found that these flagship features fall short. They&apos;re cool every now and then, but I don&apos;t feel like the way I use my phone has fundamentally changed because of them. I certainly don&apos;t miss the Dynamic Island or Action button when I switch back to one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> on a regular basis. </p><p>So, will the shiny new Camera Control button be any different? We&apos;ll have to wait and see, but the Android Central team loves the concept, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16s-camera-control-button-is-actually-cool-i-want-it-on-android-phones">even hopes it&apos;ll come to Android phones in the future</a>. As someone who fumbles with one-handed smartphone photography often, I certainly see the potential. I also might use it for the first week that I get my hands on the iPhone 16 Pro, only to forget about it and never use it again.</p>

<p>Again, it&apos;s worth noting that there are other things to like about the iPhone 16 series. The A18 and A18 Pro systems-on-a-chip look like great performers, Apple Intelligence could be a real game-changer when it arrives, and both models of iPhone 16 Pro share the same great camera system. It&apos;s just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-apple-iphone-16-launch-compared">not enough to get me truly <em>excited</em> about the new iPhones</a>. </p><p>I think Apple needs to shake things up to get tech enthusiasts interested in the iPhone again. It needs a <em>foldable</em> iPhone. </p>

<p>The best way to enjoy technology is to chase the most cutting-edge tech rather than stick to a single brand. I was an iPhone user exclusively until I tried the Galaxy Z Flip 3; I was a Mac user exclusively until I tried the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i. Now, after using modern foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, only an Apple foldable can really pull me back in. </p><p>There are only so many ways to change a traditional, slab-style foldable each year. They&apos;re matured to what is nearly their final form, and only iterative updates are likely to come. Meanwhile, foldables are a budding form factor. Devices like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold are almost as thin as a regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, and their build quality is better than ever. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gWpcKsPZyBw6FCupAZdd2f" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Half-Opened.jpeg" alt="The Pixel 9 Pro Fold half-opened." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gWpcKsPZyBw6FCupAZdd2f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve been using the Pixel 9 Pro Fold for more than a week, and it&apos;s hard to imagine myself getting excited about a non-foldable phone again. They&apos;re bland compared to the foldable (and now tri-fold) phones out there. </p><p>Even Apple fans seem to be getting disinterested in the iPhone. If you spend a bit of time on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@4pamala/post/C_zWdLKxBPb?xmt=AQGzpqgQHw5ZGObAFmR7bRr40daPO3AhLR7QIn2cpvNTEg" target="_blank">Threads</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chernikovalexey/status/1833404048843632887" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, you&apos;ll find many Apple users making comments like "Steve Jobs would never" in relation to the company&apos;s recent announcements. While I generally disagree with this sentiment and don&apos;t see it as constructive, it&apos;s just another way of saying that iPhone progress has stalled and could use a jump-start. </p><p>As an Apple convert who moved to Android at least part-time years ago, I think a foldable could be that jump-start. When Android Central editor-in-chief Shruti Shekar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/former-iphone-users-discuss-interest-in-apple-foldable">interviewed former iPhone users</a> about whether a foldable would lure them back into the Apple ecosystem, the results were mixed. Some were adamantly against a so-called "iPhone Fold," and one person was ready to jump right back in. </p><p>Either way, a foldable would put Apple back in the cutting-edge tech conversation, and that could be a win in itself.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is closing out the week with a few key Google Chrome updates that aim to boost your privacy when surfing the web.</p><p>Google is preparing to roll out three updates for Chrome on Android, beginning with an "improved" Safety Check. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-safety-update-september-2024/">a blog post</a>, the company states this upgraded safety feature now runs "automatically" in the background in Chrome. Safety Check will protect users against "abusive" notifications from websites Chrome&apos;s Safe Browsing deems malicious or false.</p><p>As an extra precaution, the feature will automatically remove permission from sites you haven&apos;t visited in a while.</p><p>Google adds that Safety Check picks up diagnostic checks for your software to ensure you&apos;re running the latest version. Similarly, the security function can look over your passwords to weed out any possible security issues. The updated Safety Check page will offer a "Safety at a glance" section. From there, users can see which permissions the browser has removed, software status, and other crucial online security information.</p><p>Those using Chrome on desktop can receive security notifications about any installed extensions. Google states if Safety Check finds one that could threaten your online privacy it will advise you and surface its details page with a button to quickly remove it. Of course, this smaller update will join <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-android-biometric-unlock-incognito-tabs">the major patch Google dropped</a> for desktop users earlier this year.</p>

<p>Granting permissions bears weight on Android, which is why Google is rolling out a one-time action for websites. The post states users can select which aspects of their device a website has access to (mic/camera) <strong>while they&apos;re there</strong> instead of permanently.

The second round of Prime Day is slated for October, and it will also be a 48-hour event.</p><p>There will be thousands of products on sale, but the ones I&apos;m interested in are home NAS servers. The category has seen a meteoric rise in recent years, and that&apos;s understandable; data needs are going up, and a NAS offers an easy way to centralize data. While I don&apos;t have details on which NAS enclosures will go on sale during Prime Day — I&apos;ll have that information ahead of the event — I can recommend products you need to consider.</p><p>So if you&apos;ve been thinking of getting a NAS, or have one and want to switch to a model with better hardware or just need a new NAS hard drive, these are the products that should be on your horizon.</p>

<p>I get to use dozens of NAS servers, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/asustor-nimbustor-2-gen2-as5402t-review">ASUSTOR AS5402T</a> is among the best in its category. The Taiwanese brand did a great job with the hardware; it has a powerful Intel platform with transcoding, 4GB of RAM, and dual 2.5GbE connectivity.</p><p>What&apos;s also interesting is that you get four M.2 slots in addition to the two 3.5-inch drive bays, giving you the ability to add fast SSD storage in addition to regular mechanical drives. And while ASUSTOR&apos;s software efforts have been lacking in the past, that isn&apos;t the case in 2024. The brand overhauled its software, and the new ADM interface looks polished and has plenty of great features.</p><p>Coming in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Asustor-AS5402T-Quad-Core-2x2-5GbE-Attached/dp/B0C5MB5MTS">at $369 on Amazon</a>, the AS5402T is a great choice in its own right, but I estimate the NAS to get a 20% discount during Prime Day, making it a real bargain.</p>
<h2 id="diskstation-ds923-2">DiskStation DS923+</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8H4XG8zH74V5MubFfC3dx5" name="diskstation-ds923-plus-review-20.jpg" alt="Synology DiskStation DS923+ review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8H4XG8zH74V5MubFfC3dx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a> is a standout product, and a big part of its allure isn&apos;t the hardware — it doesn&apos;t have the best hardware in its segment. The reason the DS923+ outsells its rivals by several magnitudes is the software; the DSM interface is the best you&apos;ll find in this industry, and it just makes things easier. You have all the software packages you need, the interface is clean, and you get container management, giving the DS923+ a lot of extensibility.</p><p>The hardware is decent enough; the Ryzen platform is fast, and you get 4GB of RAM and dual M.2 slots. The Gigabit Ethernet ports are annoying — I would have liked 2.5GbE instead — but there is a way to add a 10GbE network card. The DS923+ doesn&apos;t have transcoding, but other than that, it makes a phenomenal Plex media server.</p><p>The DS923+ isn&apos;t <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Synology-4-Bay-DiskStation-DS923-Diskless/dp/B0BM7KDN6R">exactly affordable at $598</a>, but it should go down to $499 during Prime Day, and at that price, there really is no reason to buy any other server in this segment.</p>
<h2 id="diskstation-ds223j-2">DiskStation DS223j</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9p5bjazVJrDcLqHab4wQm8" name="synology-diskstation-ds223j-12.jpg" alt="Synology DiskStation DS223j review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9p5bjazVJrDcLqHab4wQm8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You don&apos;t have a NAS yet and want to see what all the fuss is about, so you need something on a budget. That&apos;s where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds223j-review">DiskStation DS223j</a> comes in; it is the ideal gateway into the world of home servers, and you get a good inkling of what a NAS delivers in daily use.</p><p>Predictably, the DS223j doesn&apos;t have the best hardware — the main reason for buying this is to get a sense of the software, and all the ways you can integrate a NAS in your home. As such, it is ideally suited to back up data from various connected devices, and it does a decent enough job as a media streaming device.</p><p>Retailing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Synology-2-Bay-DiskStation-DS223j-Diskless/dp/B0C8814GKB">at $189</a>, the DS223j is a great value, and it usually is available for $159 during Prime Day.</p>

<h2 id="much-more-to-come-2">Much more to come</h2>
<p>We are still a month out from Prime Day, so I don&apos;t have details on all the products that will go on sale. That said, having covered previous sales events, I can say with some confidence that the deals are usually better than the summer events, so if you held out on upgrading until now, there will be plenty of great deals on servers as well as storage drives. I&apos;ll have much more to share in this area over the coming weeks, so stay tuned. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>During <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ifa">IFA 2024</a>, TECNO unveiled its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tecno-ai-vision-unveiled-at-ifa-berlin-2024-302238253.html">new AI vision</a>, which will focus on bringing "practical AI" to smartphones around the world. As part of this, the company showed off new features we can expect to see on its phones, including tools that will let users summarize, translate, and create. The company has also been teasing its upcoming foldable phones, the Phantom V Fold 2 and Phantom V Flip 2, which are expected to arrive soon and will likely be low-cost alternatives to devices like Samsung&apos;s latest Galaxy Z series foldables. </p><p>I had the opportunity to ask TECNO&apos;s Chief Marketing Officer, Laury Bai, about the company&apos;s AI strategy and how it plans to make AI useful for emerging markets.</p>
<h2 id="the-meaning-of-quot-practical-ai-quot-2">The meaning of "practical AI"</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lbJ2EvJRnVw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>TECNO is no stranger to AI. The company previously launched its own AI assistant called Ella, which was powered by ChatGPT and is already found on devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-camon-30-premier-5g-review">Camon 30 Premier 5G</a>. However, as part of the company&apos;s new vision, Ella has been upgraded with capabilities from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, enabling tons of new features and conversational abilities for users, and thus becoming more practical.</p><p>"For example, after integrating Gemini, Ella has the ability to do AI search, provide the best response, real-time analyze, and effectively solve the problems with the latest data," Bai tells me in an interview.</p><p>Beyond AI interactions, Ella can also do more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Assistant</a>-like functions, such as toggling Bluetooth on/off, enabling power-saving mode, and over 600 system functions. But more so, Bai says that one of the biggest benefits of using Ella over other assistants is that there are more local languages available, which ties in with TECNO&apos;s main mission: to bridge the gap in the technology experience between developed countries and developing countries.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eVzHBCW3wKn5ijCujAdxtJ" name="Tecno-ai-translate-text.jpg" alt="TECNO AI translate" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eVzHBCW3wKn5ijCujAdxtJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1536" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"There is a clear technology gap, especially with AI being very advanced in places like the US, while lots of consumers living in emerging markets are still behind," Bai explains. Because of this, TECNO focuses its efforts on making its products more accessible to these markets.</p><p>According to Bai, language is one of the main ways that AI becomes practical for users and guides how the company develops its new AI features. He says that when Samsung launched its first batch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features, TECNO received feedback that the AI could not fully understand them. So, TECNO focused on ensuring that its AI would support various dialects.</p><p>"Talking about English, it differs across countries, like Nigerian English and Kenyan English. They have things in common, but they have very different accents. Also in India, there are a lot of local languages."</p>
<p>However, the idea of practical AI also extends to other AI features introduced in TECNO&apos;s new AI vision, which focuses on both efficiency and creativity. As highlighted in the video above, the company showed off features such as Real-Time Translation for calls and texts, AI writing to summarize or even generate text, and AI Search to provide real-world and context-based results. On the creativity side, TECNO also showed off new image editing features like Smart Eraser, which is not too unlike Google&apos;s own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, and AI Artboard, which lets users generate images from text. </p>
<h2 id="foldables-and-ai-for-all-2">Foldables and AI for all</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eXVMK8g4TNKVWyh7KcVab4" name="tecno-phantom-v-flip-10.jpg" alt="TECNO Phantom V Flip review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eXVMK8g4TNKVWyh7KcVab4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TECNO&apos;s mission to bring useful AI features to more users in emerging markets also correlates with the company&apos;s hardware strategy. TECNO&apos;s devices offer plenty of value, bringing impressive designs and specs while undercutting the competition in various smartphone categories. This also includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, with the company&apos;s first models, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-flip-review">Phantom V Flip</a>, costing hundreds of dollars less than their competitors.</p><p>Bai says TECNO wants to ensure that it develops products that aren&apos;t detached from its target audience by stuffing them with exorbitant specs and features. "We believe that those high-end and mid-range phones should be designed and priced based on local market needs and focusing on the most core demands." That said, TECNO&apos;s products still offer a lot for what you get. The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-fold-launch">Phantom V Fold</a> comes with a 7.85-inch folding OLED display, a 50MP triple camera system, and is powered by a very capable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9000-plus-launch">Mediatek Dimensity 9000 Plus</a>, while the V Flip features a circular cover screen, a 4,000mAh battery with 45W charging, and is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 8050.</p><p>Now, the company is looking forward to its next foldable phones, which will be equipped with the AI features outlined in the company&apos;s AI vision. According to Bai, the Phantom V Fold 2 will focus on productivity, thanks to a larger screen, while the Phantom V Flip 2 will be targeted at "fashionable consumers."</p><p>And if the upcoming foldables are anything like their predecessors, we can expect them to be priced  well below the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a>.</p>

<p>While AI has become a hot topic for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-ai-image-generation-disabled">less-than-desirable reasons</a>, TECNO says it is ensuring that consumer data will be protected with the advent of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> and the ability to manage these features in the device settings.</p><p>"We process sensitive data such as real-time translation through on-device computing," Bai explains. "However, we will also combine cloud-based AI. Regarding cloud-based AI, our AI assistant is integrated with Gemini, and our partner Google will also protect user privacy with its advanced technology and strict principles concerning network security for users."</p><p>These principles also extend to the types of content users can generate with TECNO&apos;s AI, and the company says that it has safeguards in place (through the training of AI models and a partnership with Microsoft Azure) to keep consumers from producing offensive or harmful content on its devices. Of course, even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-not-the-only-way-to-create-unhinged-ai-photos">giants like Google have slipped up</a> with the launch of new features on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> series devices, so it&apos;ll be interesting to see if TECNO can avoid the same problems, but Bai seems confident that it can.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-that-tri-fold-phone-2">What about that tri-fold phone?</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qxkNq49lqr8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Ahead of revealing its new AI vision, TECNO also showed off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">Phantom Ultimate 2</a>, a concept phone with a tri-fold design. It features a unique design with a single display that folds into three different sections. When folded, it&apos;s only 11mm thick, which is thinner than the Galaxy Z Fold 6. It can be adjusted to various form factors based on how it&apos;s being used.</p><p>For now, it&apos;s just a concept, but TECNO is hopeful that it will be more than that. However, a tri-fold device brings some interesting challenges that TECNO has to overcome, and it obviously needs to make sense to launch a device like this.</p><p>"In fact, the challenge is to really find consumers&apos; needs and user behavior towards this kind of factors or shapes," Bai tells me. "What exactly are the local consumers&apos; needs? We need to design this kind of phone that can be well-connected by local consumers in emerging markets. That&apos;s hard."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1447px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hyvakgUdvGMXWyN3sWT8be" name="huawei-mate-xt-tri-fold-rear-panels.jpeg" alt="The Huawei Mate XT's textured leather back and triple, circular camera array." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hyvakgUdvGMXWyN3sWT8be.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1447" height="814" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Huawei Mate XT features a textured leather back and triple camera array. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Pricing is probably one of the biggest challenges. Regular foldable phones can be pricey, and TECNO has obviously found a way to overcome this. However, as we&apos;ve seen with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design</a>, which starts at roughly $2,809, a tri-fold phone enters a whole new price category that may be hard to avoid, at least for now.</p><p>Given TECNO&apos;s focus on making hardware and software more accessible in emerging markets where buying a $3000 phone may not be possible, a tri-fold phone probably isn&apos;t practical in the near term. "We need to find more local scenarios where people will use the device in [these countries]. I think that&apos;s the hardest part."</p><p>However, it&apos;s clear TECNO is at least thinking about this, and the company is planning to show off the Phantom Ultimate 2 at MWC 2025. But until then, we can look forward to its upcoming foldable launch alongside its practical new AI features.</p>

<ul><li>It seems Google is in the early stages of a new Home app feature called "Vacation" mode.</li><li>This mode would join the pre-existing options for "Home" and "Away," which let users set how their smart device should act in different scenarios.</li><li>It was discovered in an Android 15 dive that Google could add a Thread network option to "certain" devices to improve Matter-supported device operations.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Even on vacation, the wellbeing of our home is important and it seems Google is working on a way to bring peace of mind.</p><p>Google Home&apos;s recent 3.23.1.3 update version seemingly holds clues pointing toward an upcoming "Vacation" mode. The discovery was made by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-vacation-mode-3480901/">Android Authority</a>) as the post stating users can let the feature automatically "trigger the new routine."</p><p>Currently, tapping the name of your hub in the app will bring up a menu with "home" and "away" options. Selecting either will invoke your previously created selection of automated routines/tasks for your devices to carry out.</p><p>However, the tipster discovered a new "Vacation" option beneath the pre-existing options with a calendar icon.</p><p>The post states its functionality is non-existent as the option was found in an APK dive. Regardless, it seems that users will be able to select a series of dates for their smart home devices to carry out daily tasks automatically. The post adds Google&apos;s version of Vacation mode could also operate your blinds to simulate the daily life of someone that&apos;s home.</p><p>Additionally, Google hasn&apos;t added anything (yet) to the Automation tab. This Vacation mode will lean heavily on these pre-created routines for your desired <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-home-compatible-devices">smart home devices</a>. Most of the option&apos;s functionality is speculative as the publication states a majority of the details are still missing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:268px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.88%;"><img id="FMhfbAXYTcLfx5o4qVgbUA" name="google-home-vacation-mode-feature-spotted.jpg" alt="Google could rollout a "Vacation" mode for its Home app users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FMhfbAXYTcLfx5o4qVgbUA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="268" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has been relatively quiet on the smart home front; however, a recent discovery shows there&apos;s more in store for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-3-upgrade">Matter</a> devices. It seems that Google could roll out better device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/android-15-matter-thread-netowrk-support-previewed">control for Matter devices</a> over a Thread network. This network is a wireless mesh protocol that brings an enhanced connection between your array of Matter-supported devices.</p><p>With this potentially arriving for Android 15, users won&apos;t need a Thread border router. A router, like Google TV, bridges the gap between your smart home toys and your Wi-Fi. Not all devices will feature this Thread network as Google will likely bring it to "certain" phones with the necessary Thread radio.</p><p>Of course, this upgrade would fit well with Matter&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-3-upgrade">recent 1.3 upgrade</a>. The new connectivity standard included additional support for devices like EV chargers, stovetops, dryers, and other appliances.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It seems that it&apos;s becoming more common for companies making tech products to promise a future update that enables a key feature. It&apos;s really not, but it feels that way because the wait times keep getting longer, and the prices of the gadgets keep growing. This makes us notice it more and more.</p><p>You can&apos;t single out any one company for doing it, either. We&apos;ve seen it from Google, Samsung, Apple, and all the smaller players in tech time and time again. While I can&apos;t say with authority why companies do this, I can guess: they want to entice you to buy the thing they are showing you. Letting you know what it may be able to do one day is being used as a selling point.</p>
<p>What we can do is take a look at why it might take extra time to get features working. Nobody wants to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-delays-galaxy-buds-3-pro-shipments">hold up the release of a product</a> because one thing isn&apos;t ready and none of us would be happy about waiting for the thing we want next. Doing that would push people to buy a competing product and no tech company wants that. </p>

<p>There are a couple of good reasons why it may take extra time to enable a feature. I think the biggest issue is also one that&apos;s unsolvable for even tech giants like Samsung or Apple: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/why-net-neutrality-is-so-important">government regulation</a>.</p><p>If a feature uses new technology or has a chance of interfering with existing tech, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-why-is-fcc-certification-necessary">right government bodies</a> for each country need to evaluate it and approve it. This is a good thing because products all have to work together on the same "infrastructure." Signals need to coexist and we can&apos;t have one device causing trouble for others. The only way to ensure that is by having a strict set of rules that everyone has to follow and an agency that tests and certifies that products adhere to these rules.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XvktPzSnoLPKTe2LShH8Ta" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-temperature-sensor-measurement-02.jpg" alt="Testing the temperature sensor on the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvktPzSnoLPKTe2LShH8Ta.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This all goes double when it comes to healthcare. Anything used to diagnose, evaluate, or treat fitness and health issues must be both safe and accurate, or at least accurate enough to not be harmful. Nobody wants a health-tracking device that gives bad information, even if all these products come with a disclaimer that they aren&apos;t to be trusted. Miscounting your steps is merely inconvenient; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/earbud-heart-rate-accuracy-test">misdiagnosing your heart rhythm</a> could be much more serious. We saw the holdup of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-pixel-8-pro-body-temperature-sensor">working temperature sensor</a> inside the Pixel 8 Pro because of this.</p>
<p>Another issue that crops up often is a legal one: patent infringement or disputes. We just saw this in action with the new Apple Watch; devices sold in the United States can&apos;t measure blood oxygen because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255434500?sortBy=rank">a dispute between Apple and Masimo</a>, a company that builds medical-grade oxygen sensors. When this dispute is settled, Apple can send a software update that enables it, but until then, it will not work.</p>
<p>Other reasons are valid but harder to accept. Google promised an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/lesson-learned-with-google-zoom-enhance-feature">enhanced zoom feature using AI</a> on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, but we had to wait for the release of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> a year later to see it. Google knew what it wanted to do and knew the Pixel 8 Pro hardware was capable, but it didn&apos;t know when it would be ready. It still told us about this future feature, though.</p><p>This happens a lot. Companies have grand plans and are certain they can make something happen, but it takes longer than anticipated. Sometimes it never happens at all.</p>
<p>I&apos;m not saying companies need to stop doing this or telling you to stop buying products based on what they might do one day. Those decisions are not mine to make. I&apos;m saying why it might happen and each of us should decide how much blame we should lay at the feet of the company making the promises. I really don&apos;t think a few small features should hold up the release of any device.</p><p>Myself? I only spend money based of what a product can do <em>right now</em>. If I get any future capability I consider it a bonus, not keeping a promise.</p>
