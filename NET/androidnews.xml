<hr>
<p>Google recently made Chrome for Android even better on the accessibility front. Now, you can listen to web pages while doing other things, thanks to a nifty upgrade for the "Listen to this page" feature.</p><p>This update, which was first announced last month as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-september-2024-feature-drop">September Android Feature Drop</a>, makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">fan-favorite browser</a> more user-friendly and accessible. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/18/chrome-listen-page-background-android/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, Chrome 130 is now bringing background playback support for the "Listen to this page" feature to Android users.</p><p>The background playback feature first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mspoweruser.com/chrome-on-android-to-support-background-playback-for-read-aloud/" target="_blank">popped up</a> in June after a low-key rollout, and it was kept under wraps as an experimental flag. Before this update, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Chrome for Android</a> would only read web pages aloud when the app was open. You could switch tabs, but if you left the browser or locked your screen, the audio would stop if Chrome wasn’t in the foreground.</p><p>The latest update finally tackles this issue. Now, the browser will keep playing audio even if you turn off your screen or switch to another app. When you do switch, the article will show up as a media player in your notification panel, complete with easy play/pause and 10-second skip/rewind buttons.</p><p>On top of that, the media player in your notifications will highlight the article's headline and website. If you want to tweak the playback speed or change the voice, you’ll have to hop into the playback widget within Chrome itself.</p>

<p>As always, you can adjust the audio speed to fit your vibe. There’s a bunch of voice options to pick from, too.  Plus, you can set Chrome to highlight the text as it reads and scroll through the content, so it’s easy to keep up.</p><p>Just like the name implies, Listen to this page uses text-to-speech to read articles and web pages out loud in Chrome. When you turn it on, a handy mini-player shows up at the bottom of the screen for easy access.</p><p>You can quickly access the feature from Chrome's three-dot menu. If you use it a lot, you can add a handy shortcut right by the address bar. Just head to the Toolbar shortcut settings in Chrome and choose "Listen to this page."</p>

Google also surprised us by releasing both the Android 15 update <em>and</em> the October Pixel Feature Drop at the same time.</p><p>With that, we can enjoy even more features than what we initially expected. Although this isn't a roundup of everything new in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, we've already done that, these are the 9 features that I've been enjoying since receiving the update.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-app-archiving"><span>App Archiving</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RyVW86LVFbXfiXJYAUPhfK" name="app-archive-notifications-pixel-9-pro.jpg" alt="Amazon app archive notification on Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RyVW86LVFbXfiXJYAUPhfK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You know you have a problem when you see an interesting app you want to try out, only to realize that you have already downloaded it. I deal with this more often than I'd like to admit. Another part of the problem is that I tend to run out of space fairly quickly, but I don't want to delete any apps from my phone.</p><p>Android 15's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-built-in-app-archiving-feature">App Archiving feature</a> is something that I never really thought I would have a use for, but it's become rather indispensable. The best part is that this feature isn't limited to just apps from the Play Store. Instead, you can archive almost any app on your phone, regardless of whether it was downloaded from the Play Store or from a third-party repository like F-Droid.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-tap-passkey"><span>One-tap Passkey</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1294px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="k9ZrK3dDpFXtoVCxoho7TW" name="1password-existing-users-gain-passkey-support-android.jpg" alt="1Password is rolling out passkey support for all existing users on Android 14 and above." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k9ZrK3dDpFXtoVCxoho7TW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1294" height="728" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 1Password)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I haven't had the greatest experience with Passkeys, as I still prefer relying on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">two-factor authentication</a> with codes being generated by my password manager. Part of the problem has been the less-than-seamless experience whenever logging into a Passkey-enabled account.</p><p>For the most part, Android 15 has solved a bit of this for me, as signing in with a Passkey now only requires a single tap. Sure, it's only one less step than before, but when you're trying to quickly sign into something, the wasted time adds up.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-manually-enable-astrophotography"><span>Manually enable Astrophotography</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Cfw4WHK6c8VuMC7yWgWw7H" name="northern-lights-on-pixel-9-pro-fold-shot-3.jpg" alt="Northern Lights captured by the Pixel 9 Pro Fold with Astrophotography Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cfw4WHK6c8VuMC7yWgWw7H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Recently, I was able to see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-saw-the-northern-lights-for-the-first-time-thanks-to-the-pixel-9-pro-fold">Northern Lights for the first time</a> thanks to using Astrophotography mode on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. However, one of the frustrations with using this at any time, and not just trying to capture a specific event, is that the conditions needed to be <em>perfect</em> in order for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography mode</a> to be activated.</p><p>Previously, the only options were to either turn it off or set it to "Auto," which was fine when your Pixel decided to let you use it. Thankfully, that's no longer a problem with Android 15, as you can now manually enable it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-home-controls-on-the-lock-screen"><span>Home Controls on the Lock Screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT" name="home-control-screen-saver-pixel-9-pro-fold-google-pixel-tablet.jpg.jpg" alt="Home Control screen saver on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and widgets on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've written more than a few words about how I believe the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> was released as a public beta test for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-not-nest-hub-replacement">redesigned Nest Hub</a>. Android 15 adds further credence to that idea, thanks to the new Home Controls screen saver. When activated, all of my Google Home toggles and controls are just <em>there</em>.</p><p>Hopefully it's not a bug, but this is also an option on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, which came as a nice surprise. Another surprise is that I'm able to swap out Google Home for my Home Assistant dashboard, which gives me even more control over my smart home. Not to mention that you're able to customize Home Assistant to your liking, and aren't limited to just controlling your "favorites."</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-pin-the-taskbar"><span>Pin the Taskbar</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.68%;"><img id="bUZqn9PmE8qP4UKF2mAY6j" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-multitasking-bar.jpg" alt="Taskbar on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bUZqn9PmE8qP4UKF2mAY6j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1667" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As someone who loves tablets and foldable phones, I was rather surprised when the Pixel Fold didn't include the ability to pin the Taskbar. This is something that Samsung introduced back with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>,and is also an option with the OnePlus Open. Despite that, it's not currently an option on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> for reasons that I can't explain.</p><p>Android 15 should solve that problem once it makes its way to more tablets and foldables. On either the Pixel Tablet or Google's foldable phones, slowly swipe up to make the taskbar appear, long-press it, then tap the toggle to "Always show Taskbar."</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-go-from-the-big-screen-to-the-small-screen"><span>Go from the Big Screen to the Small Screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sCjLTjsmraBP7RKK4F4x7N" name="continue-using-apps-settings-pixel-9-pro-fold-1.jpg" alt="Continue apps on cover screen settings panel on Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sCjLTjsmraBP7RKK4F4x7N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although I've been using foldable phones since the Galaxy Z Fold 2, one feature that I constantly forget about is being able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-samsungs-continue-apps-feature-between-your-galaxy-phone-and-tablet">continue using an app</a> from the inner screen on the cover screen. It's one of those things that can come in handy when you want but isn't a "defining" feature of the user experience.</p><p>Nevertheless, it's also something that wasn't available with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> on the Pixel Fold, despite being an option on Samsung's foldables and the OnePlus Open. On Android 15, it can be enabled under the "Display & touch" settings, and from there, you can choose to always have apps appear, perform a swipe-up gesture, or turn this off entirely.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-keeping-apps-together"><span>Keeping apps together</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BPAY9T9qMoxUh4BjGcnUMk" name="split-screen-apps-on-pixel-9-pro-fold.jpg" alt="Split-screen multitasking on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BPAY9T9qMoxUh4BjGcnUMk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can't believe it took Google this long to bring App Pairs to its Pixel devices, but I'm sure glad it's here. Using two apps side-by-side is already incredibly helpful, as it lets me use something like Chrome on one half and Keep or Obsidian on the other.</p><p>However, it was rather annoying not being able to save that combination and use it later. Once Android 15 is installed on your foldable or Android tablet, open two apps side-by-side, then swipe up to reveal the app switcher. From there, tap the <strong>Save app pair</strong> button, and a new icon will appear on your Home Screen.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-gemini-improvements"><span>More Gemini improvements</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="4sUeciYBZHaLoMa5KiYw7h" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-20.jpg" alt="Gemini response on Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4sUeciYBZHaLoMa5KiYw7h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As Google continues to improve Gemini, one thing that I've been hoping for is deeper integration between apps. The latest update does just that, as it's now possible to activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and ask it questions about items within the Pixel Screenshots app.</p><p>Although it's probably not something that I'll use on a regular basis, I'm just happy to see more functionality being added to Gemini.

<p>As someone who owns almost as many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a> as smartphones, switching between them has been quite a pain. Previously, I'd have to jump into the Settings app, head into the Bluetooth menu, and then select the headphones that I want to switch to.</p><p>Android 15 makes life easier, in this regard, courtesy of the updated Quick Settings tile. Now, I can just tap the toggle and pick from the list of available headphones. This is great for when I want to go from using my over-ear headphones at my desk to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>.</p>

<p>These are just a handful of the new features that are now available with the stable release of Android 15. There are so many more that might appeal to others, even if they don't really resonate with how I use my phone on a daily basis.</p><p>If you just received the update, I highly recommend diving into the Settings app. Just take a look at all of the different screens, panels, and toggles, so that you can better feel for what your phone is actually capable of.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3">Manifest v3</a> rules for Chrome Extensions seem to have everyone up in arms because the popular ad-blocker extension Ublock Origin was pushed out. Of course, social media and discussion groups are full of comments stating this was the purpose of the changes, and since Google is an ad company of course they want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-three-strikes-policy-for-ad-blockers">ban all ad blockers</a>. neither is true.</p><p>It's also not true that Ublock Origin doesn't work; I'm using it right now even though I was told it doesn't function. What is true is that Chrome extensions have some new rules to follow, which Google says are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/06/improving-security-and-privacy-for.html">designed to increase security and privacy. </a>Nobody believes them.</p>
<p>In the simplest terms, Manifest v3 is a response to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dataspii.com/">DataSpii</a>. DataSpii was described as a catastrophic data leak from Chrome and Firefox users who had certain extensions installed that were able to stay within the old set of rules but harvest user data ranging from Tax Returns to credit information. It was pretty bad.</p><p>Changes like preventing remote code from downloading or running and changes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/webRequest">WebRequest API</a> make it much more difficult for this to ever happen again. It will happen again but not for the same reasons or in the same way. Again, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/googles-plans-chrome-extensions-wont-really-help-security">not everyone agrees</a> that these changes are helpful.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.75%;"><img id="B2pW9JhqxFB2Rvf5yoo9Gh" name="best-chrome-extensions-2020-hero.jpg" alt="Best Chrome Extensions 2020 Hero" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B2pW9JhqxFB2Rvf5yoo9Gh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="534" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unless you write Chrome extensions, none of this matters to you. Your concern is that extensions you've come to depend on may stop working. That hasn't happened yet, but it might.</p><p>I mentioned that I'm still using Ublock Origin without any issues; I simply had to turn it back on in Chrome's settings. Because this goes against Google's perceived best security practices, I won't tell you how to do that, but you can easily Google the answer and do the same. I think this is one of those times where if you didn't know how to manage extensions yourself, you're better off using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=en">Ublock Lite</a> anyway. That's not me being elitist (flipping a toggle on a settings page is hardly elite behavior), but I think some people are better off not messing with things. You know people like this if you aren't one of them yourself, and there is no shame in it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.93%;"><img id="S7hegeBbXDGL6rmLzBtsAV" name="ublock" alt="Extension management" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S7hegeBbXDGL6rmLzBtsAV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="410" height="217" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the changes that prompted all of this — they were necessary... at least some of them. It's hard to believe that Google was OK with any extension running outside code that was never reviewed as long as it did, but it happened. I wanted to understand how extensions worked a while ago, so I wrote a couple of very complicated ones to display Photospheres stored in Google Photos and depended on the fact that I could host scripts that ran remotely. I don't have the same experience as someone who builds extensions regularly, but I know enough to understand why some of these changes are a good idea.</p><p>Will this kill off the next great idea? Maybe. I can't see the future, but if an idea comes along that would break the rules, someone could still write it for Firefox or Microsoft Edge. If Google continues to allow older extensions to run, users could install the unpackaged version in Chrome using developer mode. I wouldn't let this stop me from developing something I wanted to share with the world, even if very few people would ever be able to use it.</p><p>Ad blockers are a must. I know I work for a company that loves to place ads everywhere, but I would advise you never to browse the web without the protection of an ad blocker and a tracking cookie blocker because not only is the experience bad, but it can also point you towards malware. Don't do it. Use Ublock Lite and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Privacy Badger</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ghostery-tracker-ad-block/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij?hl=en" target="_blank">Ghostery,</a> and you'll be glad you did. Install them, use the default settings, and turn them on if nothing else.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fFm38nhC7it8P3mYHaHFZN" name="Pi-4-logo.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fFm38nhC7it8P3mYHaHFZN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you want to go a step further, use a fast <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nordvpn.com/features/threat-protection/ad-blocker/">VPN that blocks ads</a> or build your own hardware-based device like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-block-all-ads-pi-hole-raspberry-pi">Pi-Hole</a>. Or heck, do all three if you want. Just don't surf the web without some sort of insulation against the ads. You could even switch browsers and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/latest-mozilla-firefox-update-so-important-even-department-homeland-security-says-you-should-upgrade">use Firefox</a> because almost every website supports its engine with no issues.</p>
<p>What not to do is pay attention to things that tell you the sky is falling. It's not. This is a case where another tech company is doing something that hurts developers or forces them to do extra work. We see that every day and should be glad that developers are willing to do that work and continue to provide the tools we need.</p><p>Focus that energy and outrage on the fact that it's 2024, and Chrome for Android <em>still </em>doesn't support extensions, which is far worse.</p>

Users will be able to experience full-color illustrations with faster page turns and better image quality than a traditional Kindle.</p><p>For readers who like highlighting things, the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition will also allow users different color highlighter options, which should spice up your reading a bit and help organize your thoughts.</p><p>The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is available for preorder now and will ship on October 30.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola is finally rolling out Circle to Search on some of its phones months after the feature was a Samsung and Pixel exclusive.</p><p>Google's powerful AI assistant, which first launched with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series in January, quickly made its way to Pixel phones and other Galaxy models. Earlier this year, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/circle-to-search-coming-to-more-android-phones-in-october">teased that the feature would soon roll out to more Android devices</a> by October 2024.</p><p>In September, Xiaomi <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/googles-circle-to-search-might-soon-break-out-of-its-pixel-and-galaxy-bubble">made waves by launching its first devices</a> with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> feature. Not long after, Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-steps-up-to-challenge-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-6-with-this-ai-feature">revealed plans to bring the feature to its Magic V3 foldable and Honor 200 series</a>. Now, Motorola is jumping on board too.</p><p>While Motorola’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-is-redefining-the-mobile-experience-with-new-experiences-powered-by-google/" target="_blank">press release</a> confirmed that Circle to Search is coming to select <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Moto devices</a>, it left out one key detail—exactly which models will get the feature.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Motorola to confirm which devices will support the AI feature, and we’ll update the article as soon as we get a response.</p><p>Since other brands have been selective with Circle to Search, it’s probably safe to say that only a handful of Motorola models will get it. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">2024 Razr</a> foldables look like strong contenders, but we might see some inconsistencies in how this feature rolls out across Motorola’s lineup.</p>

After identifying the object, it instantly pulls up relevant search results.</p><p>Along with Circle to Search, Motorola announced that select devices will also support Rich Communication Services (RCS), Gemini Live, and the new AI features from Google Photos.</p><p>This rollout comes shortly after Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">introduced a new proof-of-concept that merges Large Action Models (LAM) with Moto AI's capabilities</a>, allowing your phone to understand your surroundings and tackle complex tasks just by having a natural conversation with it.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>You've come to the right place if you need to know how to set the IPD on Meta Quest 3S. Setting the correct inter-pupillary distance, or IPD, is one of the key pillars of having a good VR experience. When your IPD is set incorrectly, it can cause nausea, headaches, and dizziness. It can also make it difficult to slice blocks accurately in Beat Saber because your brain can't deduce the proper distance between objects.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>'s IPD adjustment method is quite different from other VR headsets on the market, so we've put together this guide to help you find your ideal IPD preset as well as some hidden tricks to enable additional IPD settings. If you have a Meta Quest 2 (formerly known as the Oculus Quest 2), these steps will also work for that headset.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-measure-your-ipd-2">How to measure your IPD</h2>
<p>In order to measure your IPD, you'll need two things: a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Westcott-Non-Shatter-Ruler-Inches-13862/dp/B00309RVJ6/">ruler with millimeter markings</a>, and a mirror. Any ruler will work so long as it has millimeter markings, but you will want a hard ruler instead of a flimsy tape measure to ensure accuracy.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>While looking in the mirror, <strong>close your left eye</strong>.</li><li>Look straight into the mirror at your right eye <strong>with your right eye</strong>.</li><li>Hold the ruler just below your eye and center the <strong>zero marker</strong> on your right pupil.</li><li><strong>Close your right eye</strong> and <strong>open your left eye</strong>, making sure to not move the ruler.</li><li>Look into the mirror at your left eye <strong>with your left eye</strong>.</li><li>Look straight and <strong>note the millimeter distance</strong> that matches up to the center of your left pupil.</li></ol>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ycnsgzER8Le3Q8T4xprv2H" name="measure-ipd.jpg" alt="How to measure your IPD by using a ruler" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ycnsgzER8Le3Q8T4xprv2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For example, my IPD is 66mm. The average IPD sits around 63mm, but can range between 55mm and 72mm (or higher) depending on the person.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-adjust-the-ipd-on-meta-quest-3s-2">How to adjust the IPD on Meta Quest 3S</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="M9yDchVsbRfkFHcNUpXpMB" name="Meta-Quest-3S-lenses-close" alt="Looking at the lenses inside a Meta Quest 3S headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M9yDchVsbRfkFHcNUpXpMB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that you have your IPD measured, you can accurately set the IPD on your Meta Quest 3S. You'll do this by physically sliding the lenses closer or further apart from one another. The Meta Quest 3S features three presets for IPD adjustment: preset 1 is 58mm, preset 2 is 63mm, and preset 3 is 68mm. By default, the Meta Quest 3S ships at IPD preset 2, which covers the average IPD.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Determine which preset works best for you using the measurements you wrote down earlier.</li><li>The closest preset is <strong>58mm.</strong> The middle preset is <strong>63mm.</strong> The furthest apart preset is <strong>68mm</strong>.</li><li>While holding the Meta Quest 3S, <strong>grab ahold of the gray cover </strong>on the outside of one lens.</li><li>Gently push the lens in toward the other to <strong>lower IPD</strong>, or push them apart to <strong>raise IPD</strong>.</li></ol>

<h2 id="what-if-my-ipd-doesn-t-match-the-presets-on-meta-quest-3s-2">What if my IPD doesn't match the presets on Meta Quest 3S?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="B5TbKFZYw8FCZsRWoQQGNB" name="Meta-Quest-3S-lenses-angle" alt="Looking at the lenses inside a Meta Quest 3S headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5TbKFZYw8FCZsRWoQQGNB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If your IPD isn't exactly 58mm, 63mm, or 68mm, don't worry. Meta has designed the lenses on the Meta Quest 3S to help fit a range of IPD, but while one of those presets will fit nicely for most people, some folks will find they need a setting in between.</p><p>The trick is to gently move the lenses between presets and stop somewhere between the preset point.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>While holding the Meta Quest 3S, <strong>grab ahold of the gray plastic</strong> on the outside of one lens.</li><li>Gently push the lens in toward the other to <strong>lower IPD</strong> or push them apart to <strong>raise IPD</strong>.</li><li>Try to <strong>push just past</strong> preset 1 or preset 2 to get a more accurate IPD.</li><li>If you're having trouble pushing past, try pushing the lenses inward <strong>from a higher IPD preset</strong> instead.</li></ol>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S still only supports a maximum IPD range of 58-68mm, but using the spaces between presets can help folks who have IPD between the numbers. For instance, someone with an IPD of 60 or 61 might try the space between preset 1 and preset 2. Someone like me who has an IPD of 66 can try the space between preset 2 and preset 3 for a more comfortable experience.</p>

<hr>
<p>Whispers about Samsung&apos;s next A-series budget phone entry surface with a change that&apos;ll give you flashbacks.</p><p>In conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1847222100697698340">X tipster OnLeaks</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.giznext.com/news/giznext-exclusive-samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-full-design-out-via-5k-renders-360-video/">Giznext</a> posted some alleged information regarding the upcoming Galaxy A36 5G. The device&apos;s leaked renderings show it could continue to feature smooth, flat sides with rounded corners and a "relatively thin" body. However, the most significant change concerns its rear panel. According to the rumors, the Galaxy A36 5G could see the return of an old-school camera array.</p><p>The renderings show the device could sport a triple vertical camera array inside a raised, bordered housing. It seemed familiar to us <em>and </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/hendrawaskitha/status/1847226423960060147">users on X</a>, who stated the design is reminiscent of the 2019 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review">Galaxy Note 10</a>.</p><p>While the images suggest three cameras, the details of the sensors are unknown.</p>

<p>The front of the device seems relatively similar to its soon-to-be predecessor. The publication claims the Galaxy A36 5G will feature a flat 6.6-inch, 120Hz fresh rate display with "thin bezels." However, while the display&apos;s chin isn&apos;t <em>too large</em>, it does catch your attention. A centered punch-hole selfie camera rounds out its relatively tame front appearance.</p><p>Other specifications are still speculative; however, the post states the A36 5G could feature an Adreno 610 GPU. Moreover, Samsung could power the phone with the Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 7s Gen 2</a>. The latter debuted late in 2023, built on a 4nm process with the promise of "significant" camera performance boosts for midrange phones.</p><p>A potential launch date is still in the air — at least for overseas markets. The publication purports that a launch in India is "imminent," but fails to mention the U.S.</p><p>The rumored design of the Galaxy A36 5G sticks close to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-a35-just-landed-in-the-us-with-a-sweet-deal-on-the-galaxy-buds-fe">the A35 5G</a>. That device offers a 6.6-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display with thin bezels and that same (slightly) noticeable chin. This phone also features 6GB of RAM with 128GB of storage. The current rumors suggest a similar trend, at least RAM-wise for the A36 5G.</p><p>On the other hand, rumors about its potential launch echo what Samsung did with the A35. After its debut overseas, U.S. consumers had to wait for the device to launch. Samsung ended up dropping the product in the States a month later. With the A36 5G rumored to launch in India "soon," perhaps the Korean OEM will give U.S. folks a later pick-up date again.</p><p>The features of a device are always a talking point, but the recent rumors don&apos;t touch on that for the Galaxy A36 5G. However, it makes sense to expect some level of Galaxy AI, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discusses-the-ai-phone-future">Samsung&apos;s newfound R&D focus on it</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">Motorola Edge (2024)</a> isn't going to win any awards for performance, but it's a great-looking phone that handles casual use quite well. You get Motorola's vegan leather finish with a lovely pOLED display, plus great battery life and 68W charging. I wouldn't buy it at full price, but with a $200 Black Friday discount, the Edge (2024) is a steal. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-edge-2024-256gb-unlocked-midnight-blue/6580484.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="87041979-bc8f-4cef-9b0a-0740167815ef" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$549.99" data-dimension48="$549.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Motorola has always produced great <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phones</a>, and the Moto G Power 5G (2024) is no exception. Currently priced at a mere $199.99 (or $99.99 with activation), the G Power 5G features outstanding battery life with wireless charging support and 8GB of RAM, plus I'm kind of obsessed with this Pale Lilac color variant. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-moto-g-power-2024-5g-128gb-unlocked-pale-lilac/6572572.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7725fee1-f70b-4fc5-bffb-05bafbbc4432" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299.99" data-dimension48="$299.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

None of them cost over $20. In fact, most of these sets cost below $10, so money isn&apos;t much of an issue when buying a good screen protector. You need to decide whether you want something made of glass or plastic. Both are protective, but glass is more durable while plastic is thinner and offers a higher touch response. Our collection includes the best of both worlds.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-screen-protector-for-your-galaxy-s24-fe-2">How to choose the best screen protector for your Galaxy S24 FE</h2>
<p>There are plenty of different screen protectors available for the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE. Most of them are made of tempered glass, which is an excellent shatter-proof material. The industry standard is 9H tempered glass, which is what you should seek out when buying screen guards. However, if you don&apos;t like the thickness that glass adds, you can always get a TPU or PET plastic film. TPU plastic is more durable than PET and can repair itself as long as the scratch is small.</p><p>With that being said, I always recommend tempered glass screen protectors over plastic films. In some cases, a plastic screen guard is actually a better choice. For example, the Pixel 6 had a finicky fingerprint sensor so I advised against glass screen protectors. Fortunately, the Galaxy S24 FE doesn&apos;t have this issue as far as I know.</p><p>The best screen protector for the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE comes from amFilm, a brand that&apos;s famous for selling good quality screen guards at really great prices. The amFilm Auto-Alignment OneTouch for Samsung Galaxy S24 FE comes with everything you could ever need, from two camera lens protectors and two tempered glass screen guards to a cleaning and installation kit. It&apos;s priced below $10, making this the best overall choice without a doubt.</p><p>If you don&apos;t like the bulk of glass, IQShield offers a reliable alternative to consider. The IQShield Samsung Galaxy S24 FE Clear Film (2-Pack) includes a duo of durable TPU films. There&apos;s no lens protector in the box, but the film is really thin so it delivers a fantastic touch response and self-repairs small scratches and abrasions. This set will set you back $10 too, which is also filthy cheap albeit not as value-packed as the amFilm kit.</p><p>After getting a solid screen protector, be sure to check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-cases-for-the-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe">best cases for the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE</a> as well. You don&apos;t want to damage the body of your $650 phone either. A good case keeps your phone fresh for years, increasing its resale or trade-in value.</p>

<p>More layoffs strike Meta employees late in 2024.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24272195/meta-layoffs-whatsapp-instagram-reality-labs">The Verge</a> was tipped off about the layoffs thanks to a post on Threads by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@wongmjane/post/DBMuvFvTw8H?xmt=AQGzhz1IKFrde8FeEKMQ8tNplRUM9yJ4dwSk_3fXs--4pQ">Jane Manchun Wong</a> and other former Meta employees. In their post, Wong states, "I’m still trying to process this but I’m informed that my role at Meta has been impacted." </p><p>The publication&apos;s report states the company has issued layoff notices to employees working on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Reality Labs. Unfortunately, the exact number of impacted personnel at Meta is unknown.</p><p>Meta spokesperson Dave Arnold informed The Verge that the company is "making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy." Moreover, there&apos;s a chance that not everyone will be let go entirely.</p><p>Arnold adds the latest wave includes "moving some teams to different locations and moving some employees to different roles." Additionally, Meta is supposedly "working hard" to find "other opportunities" for those caught in the layoffs.</p><p>It seems Meta is still regressing to its 2021-era employment levels. In March 2023, the company hit its Comms team and project and policy managers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-may-2023-layoffs">from Reality Labs with a wave of layoffs</a>. It&apos;s worth noting that the company&apos;s Reality Labs Division was hit the hardest that time as former staff members took to LinkedIn to tell the news. That wave arrived just before Meta&apos;s major VR Gaming Showcase in 2023.</p><p>The blow to the Reality Labs team (again) is strange considering Meta has been pushing its VR hardware more as it recently launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-launch">entry-level Meta Quest 3S</a>.</p><p>The layoff trend continues as you may remember Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-q4-2022-earnings">laid off roughly 11,000 employees</a> toward the end of Q4 2022. This was part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg&apos;s &apos;Year of Efficiency" for the company. Zuckerberg added Meta is "focused on becoming a stronger and more nimble organization." The company turned around and let go of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-announces-more-layoffs-year-efficiency">additional ~10,000 employees</a> a month later in March 2023.</p>
