<ul><li>New promotional images of the Pixel 8a leak ahead of Google I/O event.</li><li>It confirms the device’s Tensor G3 chipset, IP67 rating, and other notable AI features.</li><li>The Pixel 8a is also confirmed to come with a seven-year security update promise, just like the Pixel 8 series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Pixel 8a launch is likely just around the corner as we approach Google I/O 2024, and a new leak spills the beans on what we can expect from the device.</p><p>The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-8a-renders-leak-features">Android Headlines</a> that share additional new renders of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> and its cases in all colors — the Obsidian, Porcelain, Mint, and Bay, next to the accompanying cases and some promotional images of the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range Android phone</a> from Google. </p>

<p>Some of the popular Pixel’s signature AI features can be seen on the upcoming Pixel 8a, including “Best Take,” which combines similar photos into one. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a>, which can extract sounds from videos, is also coming to the upcoming handset. Other features include Night Sight, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a>, and more.</p><p>Per the promotional images, the other notable things to expect from the Pixel 8a include the incorporation of Google Tensor G3 and fast charging support up to 30W.</p>

<p>Additionally, the phone will include an IP67 rating, the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, meaning it should be relatively safe from slips, spills, and dust. Like the Pixel 8 series, the Pixel 8a also appears to have seven years of security updates, per the promotional images, which is quite impressive for a mid-range phone.</p><p>To corroborate the leak, reliable leaker @Onleaks has also provided a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/google-pixel-8a-promo-video-exclusive/">promotional video</a> of the Pixel 8a that showcases the aforementioned features as well as the phone&apos;s design.</p>
<p>Lastly, while we expect the device to be unveiled at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O 2024</a>, Android Headlines hints at the sale to take place on May 16, citing the date showcased on the home screen of the Pixel 8a on the shared marketing material.</p><p>The latest promotional material leak follows the live <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-live-images-show-mint-and-bay-colors">hands-on video</a> from early this week, showcasing the Pixel 8a in striking Blue and Mint hues.</p>

This has been my first experience with such a device — as I decided against the Humane AI Pin and have yet to grab the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review" target="_blank">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> — and I have a few thoughts on my first day with it.</p><p>That&apos;s not to say that I haven&apos;t dabbled with AI as I continue to tinker with a combination of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-one-year-later">ChatGPT</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>, and Perplexity. But the Rabbit R1 intrigued me for a few reasons, namely the much lower price compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/humanes-ai-pin-will-work-with-google-photos-and-contacts">AI Pin</a>, along with the idea of having a smart device without relying on apps.</p>
<h2 id="the-rabbit-r1-is-incredibly-sleek-2">The Rabbit R1 is incredibly sleek</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CZinrVGKGjbA9DrGS3SV9M" name="close-up-rabbit-r1-logo.jpg" alt="Close-up on the Rabbit R1 logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CZinrVGKGjbA9DrGS3SV9M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By now, you&apos;ve probably seen at least an unboxing or two, but I have to point out how sleek and elegant it really is. It&apos;s about as minimal as it gets. Seriously, all you&apos;ll find inside the cardboard box is the R1 being held in place by a transparent carrying case. Rabbit doesn&apos;t even include a charging cable, although that probably won&apos;t be much of an issue for many.</p><p>Okay, with the R1 out of the box, I have to admit that despite the plastic build, it&apos;s an extremely elegant design. Outside of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, the only other device to invoke a sense of appreciation was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a>, which Teenage Engineering also had a hand in designing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Emsedp6BXudknccS482YEN" name="rabbit-r1-nothing-phone-2-2.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 next to Nothing Phone 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Emsedp6BXudknccS482YEN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the outside of the clear case is a QR code that you&apos;ll need to scan to get the R1 set up. Unlike some other R1 owners I know, I didn&apos;t have any issues creating a Rabbit account and attaching it to my R1. After connecting it to my home Wi-Fi network, there was a day-one update, and it immediately started to download.</p><p>In the meantime, I perused the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hole.rabbit.tech/journal/details">rabbithole</a>," a web portal for connecting the likes of Spotify, Uber, DoorDash, and Midjourney to the R1. It&apos;s also home for your "journal," where your various interactions will appear. This is actually a pretty cool concept, although I do wish there was an accompanying app.</p>
<h2 id="putting-the-r1-to-the-test-2">Putting the R1 to the test</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PyFrrdb6Rjkajnucyd5BCR" name="rabbit-r1-miyoo-mini-plus-game-boy-advance-sp.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 next to Miyoo Mini Plus and Game Boy Advance SP" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PyFrrdb6Rjkajnucyd5BCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Enough of all of the mundane stuff. Now for the "fun" stuff. Although I watched the initial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22wlLy7hKP4">announcement keynote</a>, I haven&apos;t paid much attention to the R1 otherwise. I didn&apos;t even watch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDTXzrEMEQQ">Live Unboxing</a> from a special event in NYC, meaning I&apos;ve gone into this thing somewhat blind.</p><p>After the update was finished, the first thing I did was ask the R1 a few basic questions.</p>
<ul><li>Who won the Orioles game yesterday?</li><li>When is the next Capitals game?</li><li>What's the weather going to be tomorrow?</li></ul>
<p>A few moments later, the R1 responded, answering the first two questions correctly, complete with the score of the Orioles game and the time of the Capitals game. When asked about the weather, I was surprised to see the screen light up with an hourly forecast. I expected a three or five-day overview, but I was okay with the hourly breakdown as it was another excuse to make use of the scroll wheel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="M6zxwkWkqnruE2zyF5GpVC" name="weather-forecast-rabbit-r1.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 weather forecast" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M6zxwkWkqnruE2zyF5GpVC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Those are menial questions that I could&apos;ve asked Siri or Gemini about, so we can say that the R1 succeeds in the mundane. But this thing has a camera and its "Vision" mode can essentially act as a standalone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-google-lens-google-photos">Google Lens</a> device.</p><p>I double-clicked the side button, pointed it at the back my iPhone 15 Pro Max, and asked "What model iPhone is this?" I chuckled to myself as the R1 told me that it&apos;s "an iPhone 13 Pro based on the camera layout and design of the device shown in the image."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The R1 mistaking the iPhone 15 Pro Max for an iPhone 13 Pro is genuinely hilarious. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>From there, I wanted to see if I could actually use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.midjourney.com/explore">Midjourney</a> integration. Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to get the R1 to actually take advantage of this feature. Instead, I&apos;ve been met with messages such as "Apologies, there was an error generating an image. It may be due to maintenance or login issues." I&apos;ve seen that others have been able to use Midjourney on the R1, so I&apos;m not really sure what&apos;s going on here.</p>

<p>On the bright side, I have been able to take advantage of another integration, using the Rabbit R1 as a Spotify controller. First, I just asked it to play some John Mayer, and within a few moments, it started playing "Gravity" from Mayer&apos;s "Continuum" album.</p><p>It shouldn&apos;t come as too much of a surprise, but the speakers aren&apos;t exactly going to fill the room. However, since the R1 includes Bluetooth, I decided to pair a set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> with it so I could walk around listening to music. It works pretty well, as long as you don&apos;t want to adjust the volume or skip tracks from the R1.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LDBWp434mSBxy9WEvhDzqd" name="rabbit-r1-settings.jpg" alt="Settings menu on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LDBWp434mSBxy9WEvhDzqd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s because you can only change the volume on the R1 itself from the Settings menu. I assumed that just using the scroll wheel would work, but I found that nothing happened. I couldn&apos;t even adjust the volume from my earbuds while the music was playing. Hopefully, this is just an oversight and something that Rabbit solves.</p><p>In terms of just pairing your earbuds to the R1, the process is pretty easy. Shake the R1 a couple of times in your hand to open the Settings panel, scroll down and open the Bluetooth menu, enable Bluetooth, and then select your earbuds from the list. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="n5ohzTSPgZ7LQfdqiKBrSD" name="rabbit-r1-midjourney-fail.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 Midjourney fail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n5ohzTSPgZ7LQfdqiKBrSD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Part of me keeps asking myself why I bothered to spend money on such a device when the smartphone in my pocket can already do everything this does and more. Part of it has to do with the idea of the Rabbit R1 being part of a new product category. While being on the "ground floor" has its benefits, it&apos;s clear that the R1 isn&apos;t quite as polished as it was initially shown to be.</p><p>For instance, I asked the R1 to set a timer for me to get my son&apos;s bottle off of the warmer. The R1 told me it couldn&apos;t do that. I then asked the R1 to remind me to take the trash out. It told me that it couldn&apos;t do that either. So, while it&apos;s cool that you can order DoorDash or use it as a cloud-based MP3 player, I kind of hoped that the "basics" would have been covered.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You can't even set a timer with the Rabbit R1, which is just mind-boggling.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s the battery life, and man oh man, is it abysmal. Supposedly, there&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/jessechenglyu/status/1783623002258649236" target="_blank">already an update planned</a> that will "make further improvements." But, even with a 95% charge out of the box, I had to recharge the R1 twice on the first day. Then, I went to bed, leaving the R1 on my desk in another room with about 75% battery, came back the next morning, and it was completely out of juice. Mind you, that&apos;s just with it being connected to Wi-Fi, as I&apos;ve yet to put a spare SIM card in it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZNohd6QNepvAqkFPZZb5YE" name="setting-a-timer-rabbit-r1.jpg" alt="Trying to set a timer on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZNohd6QNepvAqkFPZZb5YE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ll save my thoughts on product launches and updates for another day, but I&apos;m <em>really, really</em> hoping that Rabbit can stay on top of software updates to expand its usefulness. I have a vague idea of where the R1 will fit into my daily lifestyle, but it&apos;s just not there yet.</p><p>Speaking of which, the company already has a slew of features it plans to add, as I noticed in a tweet from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/HyanRaines/status/1782935825489023078/photo/1" target="_blank">Ryan Haines of Android Authority</a>. The list includes obvious features such as alarms, calendars, and contacts, but there&apos;s much more on the roadmap. I just have to keep my fingers crossed that Rabbit follows through and doesn&apos;t just abandon the R1 in favor of whatever it wants to build next.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Meta made waves this week when it announced Meta Horizon OS, a rebranding of the Meta Quest operating system. This new OS will work similarly to Android or Windows, allowing companies like Lenovo, ASUS ROG, and even Xbox to develop their own headsets without worrying about the operating system layer.</p><p>In a way, this means Meta&apos;s first-party headsets, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>, will become far more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">similar to a Google Pixel</a>. Meta has its own hardware and, like Google, will also maintain the operating system behind it while simultaneously supporting other companies using that same OS. It&apos;s a lot more complicated than ever, and that&apos;s making a few VR developers nervous.</p><p>Max Weisel, founder of development house Normal VR and creator of the eSports game Nock, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/maxweisel/status/1782450856706650479">compares the move to Android</a> phones that all have different hardware qualities and often never run the same operating system version. This makes it difficult to optimize for a specific piece of hardware and also means developers have to bug test the same things on more than one headset, adding time and stress to already difficult development cycles.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Being the "Android of VR" can sound very positive, but it also carries a lot of development baggage with the term.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But Road to VR&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/benz145/status/1782991511522557976">Ben Lang notes</a> that Meta Horizon OS isn&apos;t "truly open." That means people can&apos;t just make a VR headset in their basement, get Meta Horizon OS running on it, and mass produce it for sale. Meta has to approve headsets before they can run Meta Horizon OS, and the company is only allowing specific hardware configurations at this time.</p><p>That means every new headset that&apos;ll ship in the near future—whether that means the limited-edition Xbox VR headset, the Lenovo productivity-focused headset, or the Asus ROG ultimate VR gamer headset—will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 or XR2+ Gen 2 processor.</p><p>That substantially limits potential hardware problems since most headsets will run similar internals. The biggest differences will likely revolve around headset design and display resolution.</p>

<p>The only exception is the ASUS ROG headset, which is rumored to potentially ship with a haptic feedback vest or some kind of other experience-enhancing accessories. On the bright side, though, accessories like the bHaptics vest are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/3454125161357542/">already officially supported</a> in the current Meta Horizon OS that runs on Meta Quest headsets.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Most headsets will remain fairly similar in specs, but the Asus ROG headset could ship with additonal peripherals that need support.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Still, we don&apos;t know how Meta will handle updates and other features on non-Meta-built headsets. The company is still relatively early in the planning stages and isn&apos;t ready to reveal all of its secrets and, unfortunately for us, this is one of the current mysteries.</p><p>Ironically, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/oculus-founder-palmer-luckey-horizon-os-quest-reaction/">Road to VR</a> points out, bringing a more open operating system to market was the original plan all along, even if Meta put the option on the back burner for nearly a decade.</p>

<p>Former Oculus CTO John Carmack also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/1782826465207165288">voiced his concern</a> over the move. "This initiative will be a drag on software development at Meta. Unquestionably." Carmack has been a critic of Meta&apos;s operating system development for years.</p><p>In December 2022 when he left his position at Meta, he said  "we have a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort. There is no way to sugar coat this, I think our organization is operating at half the effectiveness that would make me happy."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>We don't know how Meta will handle updates and other features on non-Meta-built headsets, and that could potentially spell trouble for developers.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This was almost entirely directed at the software side of things, which Carmack was most focused on and concerned about. In essence, he noted that the Quest OS was a mess and needed a total overhaul to fully take advantage of the hardware it powered.</p><p>It&apos;s not immediately clear if Meta has done this, but the company is launching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-ui-overhaul-tease">a UI overhaul</a> later this year, likely coinciding with the potential release of the first Meta Horizon OS-powered headsets.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/RenjiBijoy/status/1783248105300705757">Renji Bijoy</a>, founder of Immersed and creator of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/immersed-visor-with-visor-plus-announcement">upcoming Visor headset</a>, is more skeptical than negative about the move, saying that "3rd-party Horizon OS headsets may really struggle to sell a meaningful number of headsets compared to Meta&apos;s all-purpose headsets that are MUCH less expensive."</p><p>The idea is that Meta sells its headsets at cost, and examples like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-2-deal-amazon-big-spring-sale">recent price drop of the Quest 2</a> prove that Meta is willing to price its headsets incredibly low to sell volumes of them. In other words, that won&apos;t work well for 3rd parties unless they can focus on one particular niche very well.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>More platforms ultimately means more players, helping fund further development.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While several prominent folks have criticized this move, Resolution Games&apos; CEO, Tommy Palm, is much more positive about it. Resolution Games makes some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>, including Angry Birds VR, Demeo, and Racket Club, and it is even behind Game Room on the Apple Vision Pro, so it knows a thing or two about multiplatform VR development.</p><p>Palm tells me his company currently employs around 100 people, which is large for a dedicated VR developer. As such, it likely will have the resources to handle any additional quality assurance testing that might be required from additional VR headsets in the market.</p><p>"More platforms means more competition and more marketing, but it&apos;s going to end up bringing in more players" says Palm. More widescale development "has been tricky up to this point because the audience hasn&apos;t been big enough to support the type of games you see on console or [non-VR] PC."</p><p>This move could solve that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RVRWYFojhq5TAzEtmaMZv5" name="meta-quest-3-augments-official-lifestyle-02.jpg" alt="Official lifestyle imagery of the Augments feature coming to Meta Quest 3 headsets in Fall 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RVRWYFojhq5TAzEtmaMZv5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I asked if Resolution Games finds Steam VR development more difficult because of the number of headsets and different hardware configurations, he simply replied, "I wouldn&apos;t say so."</p><p>"There&apos;s a little bit of edge cases and outliers on hardware that isn&apos;t that common that we haven&apos;t tested on, and we&apos;ll see a comment and then we we have to dig it up somewhere and look at it. But it&apos;s rare."</p><p>In other words, while the company does run across situations where some hardware configurations cause issues, many are niche pieces of hardware, and most of them seem relatively easy to fix, based on the conversation. Because of the way Meta appears to be structuring its platform, it&apos;s unlikely these situations will repeat themselves during Meta Horizon OS development.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="5jqo8RXtFaYPjRMP8oKWha" name="Meta-Horizon-OS.jpg" alt=""Made with Meta Horizon OS" printed on a box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5jqo8RXtFaYPjRMP8oKWha.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="780" height="439" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Development is friendlier today than ever, according to veteran developers, but competition is also more fierce.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Palm went on to praise the tools available today compared to when he started professionally programming video games 25 years ago.</p><p>"The tools today, like Unity and Unreal, takes a lot of the super hard work away. I&apos;m saying that as somebody who worked 25 years with game development so I remember the pains of having to do all these different platforms. Most of the, you know, younger indies don&apos;t even think about that because that&apos;s a that&apos;s a thing of the past."</p><p>If Meta is able to successfully create a set of tools that developers can use to create bespoke applications for its ecosystem—not too dissimilar to iOS development—it may very well be able to get beyond the stigma that multiplatform development carries. But until then, it seems that many people may remain skeptical.</p>

<ul><li>Multiple sources have confirmed the next Galaxy Unpacked event date with SamMobile.</li><li>With July 10 on the cards, the event will likely occur in Paris.</li><li>It seems it's meant to coincide somewhat with the Paris Summer Olympics of 2024, of which Samsung is one of the main sponsors.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While there&apos;s a lot of anticipation for Samsung&apos;s next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, which have been rumored to launch earlier than the previous models, new information reveals the possible launch date of the next Galaxy Unpacked event.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-next-galaxy-unpacked-2024-event-date-exclusive/">SamMobile</a>, the Galaxy Unpacked event will be held on July 10, 2024. It will likely be held in Paris, the publication states, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter. It falls alongside the 2024 Summer Olympics, which begin later that month in the same country, and it is believed that Samsung will be the most significant sponsor for the games.</p>
<p>This new date for Galaxy Unpacked is a bit earlier than the 2023 summer event, which occurred in late July. Lately, it seems to be a trend to move up phone launches, which we&apos;ve seen not just with Samsung&apos;s foldables but also with the S series phones, and this year appears to follow the same. The event official invites will likely be sent out to the invitees sometime in late May, notes SamMobile.</p><p>Next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Z Flip 6</a>, we expect to see more details of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, the company&apos;s first compact fitness tracker, which had its first glimpse early this year during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> launch.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Z Flip 6 have already been spotted, thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-renders-leak">leaked renders</a>, which surfaced a while ago. They gave us a clear picture of what to expect, revealing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-renders-leak">familiar design</a> to their predecessors. Both foldables will likely ship with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy, just like their non-foldable flagship counterparts.</p><p>As SamMobile further notes, the event will likely introduce the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> series smartwatches and at least one pair of new wireless earbuds. Next to them, we might also see several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> announcements at the Paris event.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Android 15 includes a new "force dark mode" feature that works better than the old developer option.</li><li>Dark mode in Android isn't truly dark on all phones, making the feature less effective than it could be.</li><li>Pixel phones, in particular, opt for a dark grey instead of true black dark mode.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new dark mode feature is coming to Android 15 that allows users to force more apps into swapping out those white backgrounds for darker ones. But, while this will work nicely for some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, phones like the Google Pixel don&apos;t actually use <em>true black</em> backgrounds when in dark mode, and this new option doesn&apos;t appear to fix that.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-make-all-apps-dark-3437447/">Android Authority</a> details that the new feature will be available in the accessibility section of system settings, making it easier to find and use than the old developer mode switch.</p><p>The new force dark mode switch is also said to work on more apps since it doesn&apos;t follow the previous way of letting developers opt out of the mode. That means more apps that don&apos;t have an option for a dark mode should work with the new system switch.</p>

<p>The problem with the new feature is that it doesn&apos;t solve the <em>actual</em> accessibility problem with OLED displays on many Android smartphones. Phones that use gray backgrounds in place of true black ones, like the Google Pixel line, are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/dark-mode-is-a-lie">worse for your eyes</a> as shown by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/ssl-miller-etal-2023-LRT-pae-se%20visibility-tlm%20parameters.pdf">several studies</a> over the past year. This brings into question why Google would put this mode under accessibility settings rather than display settings since it doesn&apos;t seem to solve an accessibility issue.</p><p>Thankfully, not all phones follow Google&apos;s Pixel line in this regard. Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus, and Motorola phones with OLED displays generally have true black backgrounds when dark mode is enabled, making them better choices for dark mode lovers.</p><p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-even-dimmer-setting-spotted">new brightness control features</a> in Android 15 seem likely to cause further problems for folks who are sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> methods. Android Central has reached out to Google about both new features but representatives did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information on either feature.</p>

<hr>
<p>There were rumors swirling around recently about Samsung dropping an update this month to fix the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>&apos;s camera glitches, but now it looks like that might not happen.</p><p>Reliable leaker Ice Universe says that a major camera update for the Galaxy S24 Ultra won&apos;t be coming until June (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/next-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-improvement-update-delayed/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">S24 Ultra's camera update has been delayed, at least until June.<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1783107452961001543">April 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1776877562536546451" target="_blank">early April</a>, the same tipster claimed that a Galaxy S24 Ultra update was on its way, promising fixes for issues like wonky telephoto image quality, off-target white balance, and weird red hues. It now seems like that&apos;s the update that&apos;s been held up.</p><p>Even though the Galaxy S24 Ultra comes with top-tier camera capabilities, its picture quality isn&apos;t hitting the mark. People on Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S24/S24-Ultra-camera-issues-white-balance-off-and-over-exposed/td-p/2812057/page/4" target="_blank">forums</a> are venting their frustrations about camera problems they&apos;ve been facing since they got the phone. Things like the HDR feature not quite delivering and the telephoto cameras not living up to expectations are some of the major concerns.</p><p>Samsung did try to fix things up with an update at the end of March to boost the camera game on the Galaxy S24.</p><p>Usually, Samsung releases a major camera upgrade for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">top-notch Galaxy phones</a> around June each year. For example, last year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-acknowledge-blurring-problem-galaxy-s23">Galaxy S23 got a sweet update in June 2023</a> that jazzed up the portrait modes with 2x zoom and smoothed out the HDR processing.</p><p>Samsung is pretty tied up right now, rolling out the One UI 6.1 update for its smartphones and sorting out a bunch of bugs that came along with it. So, it may make sense if the company is putting the brakes on those specific camera upgrades for the Galaxy S24 Ultra for now.</p><p>With a bit of luck, Samsung will take advantage of this delay to tackle the heap of problems that Galaxy S24 users are grappling with regarding its camera. Apart from the lackluster HDR performance, the phone is also having a tough time capturing moving subjects, such as kids and pets, according to various posts on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1ajmfi5/android_authority_moving_pets_and_people_are/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/mobile-apps-services/capturing-fast-moving-subjects-issue/td-p/9465802" target="_blank">Samsung Community pages</a>. This issue <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-galaxy-s23-ultra-finally-better-at-taking-photos-of-moving-objects">has been a recurring headache with Galaxy phones</a>, and it feels like Samsung hasn&apos;t done much to sort it out.</p>

<p>Moondrop also makes planar headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/moondrop-venus-review">Venus</a>, but it has loftier ambitions for its next product, the MIAD01. Abbreviated for Mobile Internet Audio Device, MIAD01 is a phone that has a balanced 4.4mm connector alongside a single-ended 3.5mm jack, a flagship decoding chip, and independent audio circuitry that should mitigate any interference.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the phone hardware itself. The MIAD01 will have a 6.7-inch flexible OLED panel with 1080p resolution, 120Hz refresh, and interestingly, 1920Hz DC dimming. In renders shared by the brand on X, the device looks like any other giant slab, with the ports located at the top.</p><p>As someone who tests enthusiast audio products along with a gazillion phones a year, it feels like the MIAD01 is tailored to my needs. Moondrop teased details of the MIAD01 at the start of the year, but I didn&apos;t take those seriously — audio brands tend to share grandiose plans all the time, but most of them don&apos;t come to fruition. In this instance, however, the brand has actually launched the phone, and it is available via audio retailer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hifigo.com/products/moondrop-miad01">HiFiGo for $399</a>. </p>

<p>Obviously, that invites a lot of questions. Why is Moondrop making a phone? Will it have the Play Store? How many updates will it get? What about after-sales service? Making a phone is significantly more challenging than audio products, and most brands instead choose to go with digital audio players. These players have a screen, decent hardware, dedicated audio circuitry, and usually run an AOSP build of Android. Think of these devices as phones without all the connectivity bits.</p><p>Fiio&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m11s-review">M11S</a> is a good example; it is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 660, comes with ESS Sabre&apos;s high-end ES9038Q2M DACs, a 5-inch 720p screen, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 5300mAh battery. It runs Android 10, and will make the switch to Android 12 later in the year. While Android 10 is outdated, it is still usable in this setting, as all you&apos;re doing with the interface is playing your music streaming service of choice.</p><p>Designing a phone is much more complex; it needs cellular radios, and should be able to handle a variety of mundane tasks — send texts, make calls, browse the web, use social media, play games, and everything else you do with a phone — in addition to playing music. Moondrop just doesn&apos;t have the resources or the technical knowhow to make a phone, so the MIAD01 will be a rebranded version of an existing device.</p>

<p>Considering the MIAD01 has 1920Hz PWM dimming, it limits the options to a Chinese entity. I don&apos;t see Xiaomi, Honor, or any of the BBK brands somehow turning into a white label manufacturer, so if I had to venture a guess, the MIAD01 is using an ODM that caters to smaller manufacturers, like Blu.</p><p>The blocky design of the MIAD01 is reminiscent of ZTE&apos;s Nubia Z60 Ultra, but the MIAD01 is a mid-ranger. The brand confirmed that it will be powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7050, which uses older Arm v8 cores, including two Cortex A78 and six A55 cores. It will have 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage, 12GB of RAM, and a MicroSD slot that holds up to 2TB cards.</p>

<p>While it&apos;s interesting to speculate on the hardware, it&apos;s the software that is the biggest limiting factor for a new brand venturing into this segment. And unlike digital audio players, AOSP doesn&apos;t cut it on a phone, so the MIAD01 will need differentiated software. And somehow, I doubt Moondrop&apos;s ability to deliver on that front; the brand&apos;s Link app to connect to its earbuds is riddled with issues, and is often unusable.</p><p>It would be ideal to have a phone that also doubles as a music player, and LG did a great job catering to this niche. But that&apos;s in the past, and I don&apos;t quite see Moondrop rising to the challenge. The brand had its share of misses in recent years, and it may have taken on too much with the MIAD01. The device will need to deliver terrific audio, and simultaneously go up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best mid-range phones</a>.</p><p>A more sensible option would have been to launch a digital audio player like Fiio, HiBy, Shanling, Sony, Astell & Kern, and other audio brands, but as we&apos;ve seen in the past, Moondrop doesn&apos;t like to play by conventional rules. That said, I am interested in taking a look at the MIAD01, and seeing how it holds up — both as a phone, and as a digital audio player. </p>

While the latest build is much more stable than earlier releases, it still isn&apos;t quite ready to be used on a daily driver just yet.</p><p>That will change with subsequent builds, and while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15 beta program</a> is limited to Pixels, third-party manufacturers should announce plans to offer the beta on their own devices by mid-May, which is when the beta will kick into high gear. If history is any indication, the stable build should be rolling out sometime in August.</p><p>Unlike the last two Android versions, Android 15 has plenty of interesting additions, including a notification cooldown mode, better optimization, ability to record parts of the screen, audio sharing over Bluetooth, and a slate of upgrades around foldables. So let&apos;s take a look at what phones will make the switch to Android 15, and when your device is likely to get the update.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google"><span>Google</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg" name="android-15-logo-highlight.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo on Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like previous years, the Android 15 update will hit Pixels ahead of every other device. The beta program is limited to the Pixel series, and if you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> or above, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">install the Android 15 beta</a>. Obviously, Pixels will get the stable build on the day of release, and this gives Google&apos;s phones a distinct advantage.</p><p>That said, not all Pixels will upgrade to Android 15, with only the devices released in the last three years eligible to receive the build. Here&apos;s the list of Google devices that will get Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Pixel 6</li><li>Pixel 6 Pro</li><li>Pixel 6a</li><li>Pixel 7</li><li>Pixel 7 Pro</li><li>Pixel 7a</li><li>Pixel 8</li><li>Pixel 8 Pro</li><li>Pixel Fold</li><li>Pixel Tablet</li></ul>
<p>While these devices can install the beta right now, I&apos;d advice against it; the build is usable, but it still has connectivity and camera bugs, and it isn&apos;t designed to be a daily driver. That may change with the second public beta, and I will update the post once that becomes available in the middle of May.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung"><span>Samsung</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bhrhd5s7hMV6FCcDRVCnG5" name="galaxy-s24-ultra-2024-phone-pile-7.jpg" alt="Galaxy S24 Ultra against other high-end Android phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bhrhd5s7hMV6FCcDRVCnG5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung continues to be the largest phone manufacturer, and it releases more devices than any other phone brand. Samsung doesn&apos;t usually join the beta program at the same time as other manufacturers, instead opting to wait until it can roll out the next iteration of One UI. As the brand uses the stable Android 15 release as the base, that means you&apos;ll need to wait at least until August to get your hands on the next version of Android on your Galaxy phone.</p><p>Samsung does a great job rolling out the stable update to its flagships in a timely manner, but its mid-range and budget phones don&apos;t get the same level of attention, so if you have a Galaxy A device, you&apos;ll likely need to wait until Q1 (or even Q2) 2025 to make the switch to Android 15.</p><p>These are the Samsung phones that should get the Android 15-based One UI 7 update:</p>

<h2 id="galaxy-f-series-2">Galaxy F series</h2>
<ul><li>Galaxy F14</li><li>Galaxy F15</li><li>Galaxy F34</li><li>Galaxy F54</li></ul>
<p>Samsung tends to prioritize its current devices over others, so it is likely that the beta update will be limited to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> series when it goes live. Select Galaxy A devices also got beta builds last year, and we&apos;ll have to wait and see if the Galaxy A55 joins the list this time around.</p><p>As always, the list is a tentative guideline based on Samsung&apos;s update guarantee; while all the devices mentioned above should receive Android 15, there&apos;s no telling if that will be the case until Samsung confirms it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus"><span>OnePlus</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="V2UZcanyFQqZVSzA2Rz48K" name="oneplus-12-30.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 camera island next to OnePlus 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2UZcanyFQqZVSzA2Rz48K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus used to do a good job with updates, but it fumbled recent platform updates, leading to device-breaking bugs and lingering connectivity issues. And because the manufacturer uses ColorOS in all but name, it doesn&apos;t have much control over when it gets to roll out updates.</p><p>These OnePlus phones will be updated to Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>OnePlus 10 Pro</li><li>OnePlus 10T</li><li>OnePlus 10R/10R 150W</li><li>OnePlus 11</li><li>OnePlus 11R</li><li>OnePlus 12</li><li>OnePlus 12R</li><li>OnePlus Open</li><li>OnePlus Nord 3</li><li>OnePlus Nord CE3</li><li>OnePlus Nord CE3 Lite</li></ul>
<p>OnePlus continues to just roll out a single update to its Nord N series of devices sold in North America, so even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">Nord N30</a> launched last year, it won&apos;t be updated to Android 15.</p><p>Considering how bad OnePlus was at delivering timely updates, I&apos;m not going to share any estimated timelines — this time, I&apos;ll wait until my devices get the stable Android 15 update before writing about it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-7-best-new-features-in-oneplus-oxygenos-14">OxygenOS 14</a> is in a decent state now, but that wasn&apos;t the case during the beta — or even the initial stable builds. So if you have a OnePlus phone, I&apos;d suggest waiting and seeing if the stable update has any issues before installing it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo"><span>OPPO</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LDJWVMS9US6s3p6RgQjCQn" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-27.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LDJWVMS9US6s3p6RgQjCQn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO is doing a much better job with platform updates in general, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n2-flip-review">Find N2 Flip</a> picked up the stable Android 14 update before the end of 2023 — a sizeable achievement. With ColorOS 15 set to debut this year, it is likely we&apos;ll see a similar update cadence as last year.</p><p>OPPO guarantees four platform updates to its high-end phones, with its mid-range devices getting three updates. These are the OPPO phones that will get the Android 15-based ColorOS 15:</p>
<ul><li>OPPO Find X5</li><li>OPPO Find X5 Pro</li><li>OPPO Find X6</li><li>OPPO Find X6 Pro</li><li>OPPO Find X7</li><li>OPPO Find X7 Ultra</li><li>OPPO Find N2</li><li>OPPO Find N3</li><li>OPPO Find N2 Flip</li><li>OPPO Find N3 Flip</li><li>OPPO Reno 9</li><li>OPPO Reno 9 Pro</li><li>OPPO Reno 9 Pro+</li><li>OPPO Reno 10</li><li>OPPO Reno 10 Pro</li><li>OPPO Reno 11</li><li>OPPO Reno 11 Pro</li><li>OPPO Reno 11F</li><li>OPPO F25 Pro</li></ul>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo"><span>Vivo</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="x3Fev8SEapidxjDpNT8jX8" name="vivo-x100-pro-22.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Pro next to iQOO 12" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x3Fev8SEapidxjDpNT8jX8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar to OPPO, Vivo is delivering updates at a faster pace than previous years. And in Funtouch OS 14, the Chinese manufacturer has an interface that actually looks modern. Outside of that, Vivo continues to launch a lot of phones, with the V series getting a new model every six months.</p><p>As is the case with ColorOS, Vivo is unlikely to roll out an Android 15 build until Funtouch OS 15 is available. That said, these are the Vivo phones that will be updated to Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Vivo X80</li><li>Vivo X80 Pro</li><li>Vivo X90</li><li>Vivo X90 Pro</li><li>Vivo X90 Pro+</li><li>Vivo X90s</li><li>Vivo X100</li><li>Vivo X100 Pro</li><li>Vivo X Fold</li><li>Vivo X Fold+</li><li>Vivo X Fold 2</li><li>Vivo X Flip</li><li>Vivo V27</li><li>Vivo V27 Pro</li><li>Vivo V27e</li><li>Vivo V29</li><li>Vivo V29 Pro</li><li>Vivo V29e</li><li>Vivo V30</li><li>Vivo V30 Pro</li></ul>
<p>As iQOO is basically a Vivo sub-brand, I&apos;m including its devices in the same list:</p>
<ul><li>iQOO 9 Pro</li><li>iQOO 10</li><li>iQOO 10 Pro</li><li>iQOO 10T</li><li>iQOO 11</li><li>iQOO 11 Pro</li><li>iQOO 12</li><li>iQOO Neo 7</li><li>iQOO Neo 7 Pro</li><li>iQOO Neo 8</li><li>iQOO Neo 8 Pro</li><li>iQOO Neo 9</li><li>iQOO Neo 9 Pro</li><li>iQOO Z7</li><li>iQOO Z7 Pro</li><li>iQOO Z7s</li><li>iQOO Z8x</li></ul>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor"><span>Honor</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QxMxtAgmaGqGU6jP9P2Ffe" name="honor-magic-6-pro-5.jpg" alt="Honor Magic 6 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QxMxtAgmaGqGU6jP9P2Ffe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor is making a lot of progress in global markets, and the brand&apos;s ability to deliver standout devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a> have allowed it to distinguish itself against its immediate rivals. While MagicOS 8.0 brings a lot of welcome additions, it still isn&apos;t quite as polished as other Chinese interfaces. Honor is instead leaning into AI, and it has a few unique features that are great to use.</p><p>Honor doesn&apos;t have a beta program as such, and the brand takes its time in rolling out stable updates to its devices. So if you have any of the phones listed below, you&apos;ll likely need to wait until Q1 2025 to get Android 15. With that out of the way, these are the Honor phones getting Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Honor Magic 5</li><li>Honor Magic 5 Pro</li><li>Honor Magic 5 Lite</li><li>Honor Magic 6</li><li>Honor Magic 6 Pro</li><li>Honor Magic 6 Pro RSR</li><li>Honor Magic Vs</li><li>Honor Magic V2</li><li>Honor Magic V2 RSR</li><li>Honor 90</li><li>Honor 90 Pro</li><li>Honor 90 Lite</li><li>Honor X50</li><li>Honor X50 Pro</li><li>Honor X50 GT</li></ul>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus"><span>ASUS</span></h2>
<p>ASUS continues to be obstinate when it comes to platform updates, and the brand only guarantees two Android OS updates even though its devices have powerful hardware. This is the biggest drawback of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a>, an otherwise great device that is hobbled by a shortsighted update policy.</p><p>Therefore, there are only six ASUS devices that will make the switch to Android 15, and three of those phones launched in 2024: </p>

<p>Nothing is a relatively small brand, but it is doing the right things when it comes to software updates. All of the three devices in its portfolio — including the budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> — will get three platform updates, and while it isn&apos;t quick to roll out updates, the fact that it is delivering the same update guarantee to its budget phone is a big deal.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rVsa5tGkkr9zRBkfVzgVoH" name="xiaomi14-ultra-27.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rVsa5tGkkr9zRBkfVzgVoH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most major phone manufacturers do a great job rolling out timely updates, but that still isn&apos;t the case with Xiaomi. In the last three years, Xiaomi phones were the last to receive platform updates, and I don&apos;t see that changing in 2024. Like its Chinese rivals, Xiaomi now guarantees four platform updates to its high-end and select mid-range phones, but it doesn&apos;t make any promises as to <em>when</em> it will roll out those updates.</p><p>This is frustrating if you&apos;re using a phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>; the device has the best camera package available today, and while the software is fluid and has good customizability, I&apos;m unwilling to bet on the phone picking up Android 15 before the end of the year. As for the update itself, the Xiaomi 12 series and above will switch to Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Xiaomi 12</li><li>Xiaomi 12 Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 12 Lite</li><li>Xiaomi 12S Ultra</li><li>Xiaomi 13</li><li>Xiaomi 13 Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 13 Ultra</li><li>Xiaomi 14</li><li>Xiaomi 14 Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 14 Ultra</li><li>Xiaomi Mix Fold 2</li><li>Xiaomi Mix Fold 3</li><li>Xiaomi 12T</li><li>Xiaomi 12T Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 13T</li><li>Xiaomi 13T Pro</li></ul>
<p>Redmi devices make up an overwhelming majority of Xiaomi&apos;s sales, but the brand uses an underhanded tactic where it doesn&apos;t launch these devices with the current version of Android. It&apos;s this strategy that makes it so hard to recommend a recent Redmi device; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-12-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 12</a> series launched in Q1 2023 with Android 12 out of the box, six months after Android 13 became available. As such, these devices will not be updated to Android 15.</p><p>Similarly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 series</a> debuted with Android 13 in February 2024, and this measure is to ensure that the devices don&apos;t get updated beyond Android 15. Therefore, the actual list of Redmi devices getting to Android 15 is a tiny minority:</p>
<ul><li>Redmi 12</li><li>Redmi Note 12 4G</li><li>Redmi Note 12R</li><li>Redmi Note 12T Pro</li><li>Redmi Note 13</li><li>Redmi Note 13 Pro</li><li>Redmi Note 13 Pro+</li><li>Redmi K70</li><li>Redmi K70 Pro</li><li>Redmi K70E</li></ul>
<p>POCO is in a similar situation, and last year&apos;s X5 and X5 Pro won&apos;t get Android 15. These are the POCO devices that will get MIUI 15 based on Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>POCO F5</li><li>POCO F5 Pro</li><li>POCO X6</li><li>POCO X6 Pro</li><li>POCO X6 Neo</li><li>POCO M6</li><li>POCO M6 Pro</li><li>POCO C65</li></ul>

<p>Motorola changed its update policy, and the brand now rolls out three platform updates to most of its phones. Of course, that&apos;s limited to select mid-range and flagship devices, with its entry-level phones only getting one update. Also, when those updates show up is an altogether different matter — the brand isn&apos;t anywhere as fast as its rivals at rolling out version updates.</p>

<p>As always, I&apos;m closely monitoring the progress of Android 15, and will share any details as and when brands officially announce them. Based on previous years, Samsung is likely to kickstart its beta program a few weeks after Google rolls out the stable release, and other brands will follow suit. </p><p>Before that though, most major Android vendors will offer a vanilla Android 15 beta build that serves as a good baseline to see all the changes Google has introduced this year. That build should go live around the end of May, when public beta 2 rolls out. </p><p>And as for the stable builds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phoneshttps://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> should switch over to Android 15 before the end of the year, but that&apos;s contingent on the latter betas being devoid of bugs. </p>

<ul><li>Ahead of Google I/O next month, Google revealed a preliminary schedule for developer sessions.</li><li>One of those sessions is a preview for Wear OS 5, and it serves as the first official confirmation from Google that a Wear OS upgrade is coming this year.</li><li>The description for the "Building for the future of Wear OS" session includes a few early details about what the upgrade will bring. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google I/O 2024 is quickly coming to the forefront, as the event will start in a few weeks and may bring new hardware and software announcements from Google. The company gave us our first real idea of what to expect when it released a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2024/explore/" target="_blank">preliminary I/O 2024 schedule</a> on Thursday, April 25. That schedule includes an early confirmation that a Wear OS upgrade is coming soon.</p><p>There are four main categories for events at Google I/O this year: mobile, web, ML/AI, and cloud. One of the mobile sessions is titled "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2024/explore/19faa1a5-5b4f-4e7a-ac06-8564a5a324af/" target="_blank">Building for the future of Wear OS</a>," and it explicitly lists Wear OS 5 — the unreleased version of Wear OS previously expected to come this year — as its focus. Back in January, references to Wear OS 5 were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-google-reportedly-testing-wear-os-5">spotted in an Android 14 build</a>, hinting that an upgrade was on the horizon. </p><p>Still, there was no official confirmation from Google that Wear OS 5 would be released in the near future. While we expect to hear about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">upcoming Android updates</a> at Google I/O, Wear OS upgrades are typically released on a staggered and inconsistent schedule. That&apos;s why Google&apos;s announcement has more significance than a typical Google I/O software announcement and bodes well for the future of Google&apos;s wearable ecosystem. </p>
<h2 id="what-we-know-about-wear-os-5-so-far-2">What we know about Wear OS 5 so far</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9Sw4Jg6698WXgSrkTGaJq4" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-bay-02.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Sw4Jg6698WXgSrkTGaJq4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Surprisingly, Google gave a little bit away about Wear OS 5 in the description for its preview session. "In this talk, we&apos;ll discover the new features of Wear OS 5," Google says. "This includes advances in the Watch Face Format, and how to design and build for the increasing range of device sizes."</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/05/introducing-watch-face-format-for-wear-os.html" target="_blank">Watch Face Format</a> was introduced about a year ago alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>, and Google explains that it "can be used to build watch faces directly, or it can be integrated into creation tools, allowing designers to create watch faces without having to write any executable code." It shifted much of the burden of creating a custom watch face — such as optimization, updates, and bug fixes — off of individual developers and onto the Wear OS platform. Additionally, it added a consistent UI for editing watch faces across first and third-party options. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:856px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.64%;"><img id="ecxNApgkzHtcffC7HvLRMK" name="Wear-OS-4-watch-faces.jpg" alt="Wear OS features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ecxNApgkzHtcffC7HvLRMK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="856" height="288" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This gives watch face designers a lot of ways to customize their offerings, and pairs nicely with the Watch Face Studio from Samsung, which can be used to create XML-formatted watch faces in the Watch Face Format.</p><p>So, Google&apos;s talk about updating the Watch Face Format in Wear OS 5 could bring new features and options to your favorite watch faces. There might be new ways to show complications, adapt a watch face&apos;s appearance situationally, or add new design tools. This is all just speculation, but Google clearly has new tricks available in the updated Watch Face Format that will be showcased at I/O 2024. </p><p>The one thing we do know for sure is that the Watch Face Format, or watch face design software, will be updated to help developers build for different smartwatch sizes. Google says as much in the description for the Wear OS 5 showcase, and it isn&apos;t exactly surprising. Rumors are swirling that Google will finally add a new, larger Pixel Watch size later this year in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> series. It only makes sense that it wants to make sure Wear OS watch faces will look great on all Pixel Watch models.</p>
<h2 id="we-apos-ve-come-a-long-way-since-google-apos-s-neglect-of-wear-os-2">We&apos;ve come a long way since Google&apos;s neglect of Wear OS</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="edKfA2vywic6DuWe33ErJo" name="wear-os-logo-fossil-gen-6-wide.jpg" alt="Wear OS logo on a Fossil Gen 6 watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edKfA2vywic6DuWe33ErJo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Forget specific features — it&apos;s a massive achievement that we&apos;re getting a Wear OS 5 upgrade this year at all. Wear OS devices are firmly hitting their stride, with Samsung releasing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">excellent Galaxy Watch models</a> and Google joining in with the Pixel Watch over a year ago. In that context, it&apos;s easy to forget how feeble the entire Wear OS platform was just a few years ago. </p><p>Looking back at Google&apos;s Wear OS forums, you can find countless examples of early Wear OS users describing the uncertain future of the platform and issues that had gone unresolved for months or years. One post from 2020 asked, "Is Google abandoning Wear OS?" and received support from other Wear OS users before it was locked and replies were disabled. The issue cited in the post? Google had developed a YouTube Music app for watchOS, but not Wear OS. It&apos;s a perfect microcosm of the problems that plagued the dark days of Wear OS. </p><p>Now, it&apos;s rebounding, and Wear OS 5&apos;s release this year may be the start of a consistent annual release schedule for Google for major version updates. That would put it on par with Apple&apos;s watchOS release schedule and would be great news for Wear OS users. The hardware available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> is quite good in 2024, thanks to chips like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen 1</a>, but the software still lags behind Apple Watch models in many ways. Now, with Google seemingly going all-in on Wear OS with its partner Samsung, that may be changing for good. </p>
