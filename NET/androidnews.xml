<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google's new charger for the Pixel 9 series may feature a vertical design, which could save space and avoid cable tripping hazards.</li><li>The European version has extending prongs, while the US model is expected to be smaller with fixed prongs.</li><li>The new charger could also cost more than the current $25 30W model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> event just around the corner, the leaks are flowing nonstop. While the Pixel 9 models are grabbing the headlines, a new leak uncovers the upcoming 45W USB-C charger in the flesh.</p><p>Leaker @MysteryLupin on X (formerly Twitter) has shared some images of the new 45W charging brick, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/31/pixel-9-battery-life-charging/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. Unlike the usual horizontal design of charger bricks, this new one looks to be vertical when plugged in. This could mean better space-saving compared to the current 30W model.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google's new 45W Charger pic.twitter.com/bT3qLr4eWt<a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryLupin/status/1819493727158915361">August 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Furthermore, this design means your charging cable won’t stick out from the back of the plug, so it won’t be a tripping hazard for anyone walking by.</p><p>However, the charging cable for your Pixel 9 might not have the longest reach. Nevertheless, the new charger’s compact and stylish design is a step up from the old 30W brick, which was pretty much just a clunky block.</p><p>This follows a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-ncc-3461263/" target="_blank">leak of the charger&apos;s U.S. variant</a> from Taiwan’s NCC over a month ago, which also features a vertical design. The key difference is that the prongs on the European model extend out from the charger’s body.</p><p>The charger swaps out the classic square look for a sleeker, oval shape, matching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-massive-pixel-9-leak-ruins-the-suspense-ahead-of-googles-big-event">design cues of the upcoming Pixel phones</a>.</p>

<p>The leaked image reveals the European version of the charger, but the US variant is likely to be smaller and sport fixed prongs rather than the foldable design.</p><p>Recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9-storage" target="_blank">leaks</a> hint at impressive charging speeds for the Pixel 9 series. The standard models could hit 55% charge in just 30 minutes with the new 45W adapter, while the Pro XL might even reach 70%.</p><p>Google’s current 30W USB-C charger goes for $25, so with the boost to 45W, the new model will likely cost a bit more. We’ll get the exact price at Google’s event on August 13.</p><p>Before jumping on Google&apos;s new 45W USB-C charger, check out other high-powered options. Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">third-party chargers</a> offer similar or higher wattage and often come with multiple USB-C ports for charging more devices at once.</p>

<p>Judge Amit P. Mehta has decided that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">Google is a monopoly</a> when it comes to the search and advertising markets. If you use a phone or a computer, you probably agree with that. This is big news and is the first of the Department of Justice&apos;s big tech anti-trust trials. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-faces-another-antitrust-lawsuit-illegal-monolopy-targeted-ads">Google has another one coming</a>, as does Apple, Amazon, and Meta. </p><p>A Google spokesperson <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">gave Android Central the following statement</a> from Kent Walker, Google&apos;s president of Global Affairs, in response to the ruling:<br>
<br>
"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn&apos;t be allowed to make it easily available. We appreciate the Court&apos;s finding that Google is &apos;the industry&apos;s highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users,&apos; that Google &apos;has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices,&apos; &apos;has continued to innovate in search&apos; and that &apos;Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google&apos;s search quality relative to its rivals and find Google&apos;s to be superior.&apos;"</p><p>Reading this, I think Google is right, and its search product is the best. I&apos;m not sure if hundreds of millions of people use it because they trust Google or because it&apos;s the default, which supports the court&apos;s findings. A lot of people don&apos;t know if Google Search is the best because they haven&apos;t been exposed to alternative options.</p>
<p>Each company has its own set of online fans and detractors. As I type this, people are busy in online comments and on social media arguing why this is unfair and why it&apos;s not. </p><p>I&apos;m not a lawyer, not even close. That means much of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25032745-045110819896">286-page-long court decision</a> reads like it&apos;s in another language to me. I get the gist of some of it and think some of the findings are valid, and some may not be. </p><p>Then again, I&apos;m not a lawyer. I&apos;m a cowboy who wrangles words instead of steers.</p>
<p>Some people are lawyers and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit">have a handle on what all those pages mean</a> and if you are curious about what Google has done and how it broke the law, you should read what they have to say about it. Feel free to ignore the tech-bro Xitter crowd though unless you want to watch the bonfire. </p><p>One thing I do understand is that this will have almost no effect on me. I <em>want</em> the DoJ to go after these tech companies and the billions and billions of dollars to make sure they are dotting every i and crossing every t. No single company should have an insurmountable advantage in any market and be able to leverage it to drive competition out of business. Investigate them as much as you can.</p><p>I just want it all to actually matter once the dust settles even though I know it won&apos;t.</p>
<p>It&apos;s important and it <em>does</em> matter for a lot of companies and the whole business around search and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/new-bipartisan-bill-targeting-googles-digital-ads-business-may-arrive-this-week">online ads</a>. It should matter more and be an effective path toward changes that trickle down to consumers like you and me, but I&apos;m not going to hold my breath. If anything, the price we pay for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">a new phone</a> will climb a few dollars.</p><p>The big tech shakeup is probably going to have the same effect on us regular folks as Microsoft&apos;s antitrust trial years ago did. Some words on some pages will change, deals will be renegotiated, and money will change hands. So much money will change hands. For us though? Imagine <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-launcher-default-search-engine-picker-spotted">a new check box</a> when you first sign into an iPhone and you&apos;ve got the picture.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.16%;"><img id="qdDEmgtD6aUSTTMRMy9BtT" name="google-eu-antitrust-adx-ad-exchange.jpg" alt="The European Commission's example of the buying and selling side in the ad industry." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qdDEmgtD6aUSTTMRMy9BtT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="640" height="353" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: European Commission)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rules always favor the players that know how to exploit them. When it comes to search and online ads, that&apos;s Google. They&apos;re the New England Patriots of internet search. Google will weather this storm through years of appeals, meanwhile shifting its strategies and ways of making money to better comply in case it doesn&apos;t get away with it in the end. </p><p>In a perfect world, the penalty phase of these tech antitrust trials would be held back and kept secret until all the guilty parties are ferreted out. then swing it down in one big blow of the hammer and shake everything and everyone up.</p><p>In the real world, Google will keep on being Google and finding ways to try and make all the money from all the things. The same goes for the rest of the big tech companies that seem to want to set their own rules and policies until they get caught.</p>
<p>One day a company will dethrone google when it comes to search and ads. It ain&apos;t today.</p>

<hr>
<p>Leaks surrounding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> series are heating up ahead of a Made by Google event that&apos;s less than two weeks away. We expect to see a whopping four phones debut there, including the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. They&apos;ll all presumably be powered by the Tensor G4 chip, which will be Google&apos;s next in-house mobile system-on-a-chip (SoC). However, if recent reports are to be believed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-tensor-g4-minimalistic-upgrade-report">Google might not be planning a massive performance increase</a> over the current Tensor G3 chip. </p><p>The news comes via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-tensor-g4-small-upgrade-3466398/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, which says an unnamed source at Google revealed the Tensor G4 isn&apos;t going to be a considerable upgrade over the Tensor G3. There is a new architecture for the chipset, which uses a 4+3+1 layout with Cortex-A520 (1.9GHz), Cortex-A720 (2.6GHz), and Cortex-X4 (3.1GHz). This will reportedly lead to "slightly higher" clock speeds compared to the Tensor G3.</p><p>Still, it&apos;s much of the same for the Tensor G4. According to the report, the Mali-G715 will be used for graphics, just like the Tensor G3. Although it is said to be clocked higher this time, at 940MHz instead of 890MHz, it&apos;s unclear how much of a difference that will make in everyday usage. The biggest upgrade might come from the inclusion of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-likely-to-bring-satellite-connectivity-to-pixel-9-series">Samsung Exynos 5400</a> modem that&apos;s reported to reduce power consumption by as much as half.</p><p>Sometimes, chip progress stalls and it&apos;s just part of the ebbs and flows of processor design and fabrication. However, slow development will impact Google more than it would, say, Apple and Qualcomm. The latter two companies are at the top of their game, with the A17 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoCs both representing the best mobile processing has to offer.</p>

<p>The same can&apos;t be said for Google. The company fixed the glaring problems with the Tensor G2 platform last year, solving the overheating issues and the disastrous performance. Still, it&apos;s hard to describe the current Tensor G3 as <em>great</em>. It&apos;s passable, but performance lags behind the likes of Apple and Qualcomm even still. Another year of middling performance with the Tensor G4 wouldn&apos;t do anything to quell concerns that Pixels don&apos;t have the performance to keep up with other flagships nowadays.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are now marketed as long-term buys, with Google and Samsung touting seven years of software support across their current crop of flagship devices. And yet, if the Tensor G3 and G4 lag behind the competition today, how will these chips fare seven years from now? We&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">called these OS update promises into question</a> before, but the guarantees are more concerning if the Tensor G4 isn&apos;t a notable improvement. To run Android in the 2030s, these chips will almost assuredly need more power. </p><p>So, it all comes down to this: are you willing to invest in a Pixel that isn&apos;t even performance-competitive today, especially when reports indicate that the following Tensor G5 upgrade could represent the biggest year-to-year performance upgrade we&apos;ve seen from Google? If I&apos;m considering spending my hard-earned cash, I&apos;m waiting for the Pixel 10.</p>

<p>It&apos;s tricky to understate how big of a performance leap we&apos;re expecting from the Tensor G5 platform, which could launch in 2025 with the Pixel 10 series. The Tensor G5 is said to be the first Google chip made using a fully custom design. If you recall, custom designs are what helped Qualcomm and Apple both deliver excellent performance and optimization from their chipsets. It&apos;s also rumored to be produced by TSMC, which is clearly the leader in chip fabrication at the moment, trouncing Intel and Samsung.</p><p>According to a recent report from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20240629700043-430501" target="_blank">Taiwan Commercial Times</a>, Google is at the "tapeout" step in the chip design and fabrication process. This is a big moment where the company will decide whether to move forward with mass production of the Tensor G5. It&apos;s a lengthy process to make a smartphone chip, but the fact that this stage is occurring now could indicate that the TSMC-made Tensor G5 chip <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">will be ready for the Pixel 10 series</a>.</p><p>To date, every Tensor chip was based on a Samsung Exynos design, and is fabricated by Samsung. However, reports say that the switch to TSMC for the Tensor G5 platform will utilize the company&apos;s 3nm process node. For perspective, Apple was the first to use TSMC&apos;s 3nm process in the mobile sector with the A17 Pro, which is the leader in mobile performance. Qualcomm is actually a step behind with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 platform</a>, which uses the 4nm process.</p><p>All together, it looks more and more like the Pixel 10 and its Tensor G5 chip will be the one to wait for. Tensor G4 is reportedly nothing special, meanwhile the Tensor G5 made by TSMC could be groundbreaking. If you&apos;re considering investing in a Pixel, perhaps think about waiting a year to get the best value for your money. </p>

<ul><li>It seems that Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold appeared for its Camera FV-5 certification, which offered a look at its primary and front-facing camera specs.</li><li>The database suggests that the device won't offer much of an improvement as it still features a 48MP primary lens with a slightly higher 10MP front camera.</li><li>A user spotted the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in Taiwan, giving us a good look at its revamped camera array and design in a new case.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Among the rumors of the Pixel Fold successor, its supposed camera specifications have been absent — until now.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-camera-fv-5-certification/">91Mobiles</a> states that Google&apos;s upcoming foldable device appeared in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.camerafv5.com/devices/">Camera FV-5 database</a>, spilling a few camera specifications. According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.camerafv5.com/devices/manufacturers/google/pixel_9_pro_fold_comet_0/">listing</a>, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold may arrive sporting a pixel-binned 48MP primary lens with an f/1.7 aperture.</p><p>The database suggests the camera will feature OIS (optical image stabilization) and EIS (electronic image stabilization). What&apos;s odd is that the Camera FV-5 listing doesn&apos;t expand on the rear camera array, leaving just the primary camera open for discussion.</p><p>The listing shifts to the selfie camera, stating it will arrive at 10MP alongside EIS. That camera will supposedly reach a f/2.2 aperture with a larger 77.8-degree FOV over the rumored primary camera&apos;s 55.8-degree gaze.</p><p>Interestingly, the camera specifications we can dissect don&apos;t appear wildly different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. The original model offers a 48MP with f/1.7 aperture similar to what&apos;s been discovered for the 9 Pro Fold. The internal display offers an 8MP selfie lens while the cover display features a 9.5MP. It remains to be seen which "front" camera the listing is referring to; but either way, it&apos;s a minimal upgrade.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jgwCNBLT2zkiKn6VrnzE9i" name="Pixel-9-Pro-Fold.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jgwCNBLT2zkiKn6VrnzE9i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1276" height="718" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Made by Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite the rest of the rear array&apos;s absence, the publication adds that the 9 Pro Fold is rumored to feature a 10.5MP ultrawide lens and a 10.8MP telephoto. These are numbers incredibly close to what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2#section-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-cameras">the original model already provides</a>, so it seems Google isn&apos;t prioritizing the foldable&apos;s camera this year.</p><p>Regardless, the company recently confirmed the existence of a Pixel Fold successor after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-confirms-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-real-in-official-tease">releasing a quick teaser</a>. Google gave us a look at the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in a champagne gold/cream colorway. The standout of the teaser was confirmation of its redesigned camera array, as the device drops the classic Pixel visor for a square array.</p><p>Earlier today (August 5), a photo of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/check-out-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-flaunting-its-official-case-in-the-wild">9 Pro Fold in the wild</a> surfaced, showing the device in a new Google case. It seems the device was sporting an Obsidian colorway within the Porcelain colored case, featuring the typical Google "G" in the center. The case offers a sleek, streamlined cutout for the new squared camera array at the top left of the device&apos;s back panel.</p><p>More importantly, the live photo doesn&apos;t suggest that the Fold&apos;s camera bump will be too awkward — which might help consumers breathe easily. Nevertheless, Google is preparing to host an earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">hardware event on August 13</a> where we&apos;ll learn all about the 9 Pro Fold in full detail.</p>

<ul><li>A discovery in Android 15 Beta 4 showed that Google plans to bring a "compact" version of the software's notifications to users.</li><li>The "compact" layout displays an app's logo, a single line of text, and a quick "REPLY" button, leaving the rest in its dropdown expansion menu.</li><li>Android 15 Beta 4 launched in mid-July and marches Google toward a (hopeful) August release if testing goes swimmingly.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems Google plans to rework the pop-up notifications that appear when using your device or watching videos.</p><p>The discovery was made by Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-compact-heads-up-notifications-3468061/">Android Authority</a>) when searching through the depths of Android 15 Beta 4. To make them intrusive and disruptive, Rahman found mention of a "compact" notification layout. Getting it to work showed Google plans to have notifications displayed smaller and as a single line of text, accompanied by the app&apos;s logo.</p><p>What&apos;s more, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> still plans to give users a quick and easy way to reply instantly. The upcoming compact form factor features a "REPLY" option beside an arrow, indicating an expansion of the notification.</p><p>It seems that tapping the arrow will open the notification to what users are currently used to seeing on Android. In doing so, users will find an extensive look at the received message alongside a small snapshot of any included photos. The "mark as read" option should be visible after expanding the compact view, as well.</p>

<p>There&apos;s some uncertainty regarding Google&apos;s intended debut of this "compact" notification variant. Rahman suggests it may not roll out during Android 15&apos;s official debut, considering the option isn&apos;t readily available for beta testers in Beta 4. Moreover, he states there&apos;s no option to set your notifications to abide by the compact view or the regular expanded version.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-4-is-here-as-the-stable-release-gets-closer">Android 15 Beta 4</a> started arriving for enrolled Pixel testers in the middle of July.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google has been embroiled in a case over its power in online search and advertising.</li><li>On Monday, a judge ruled that Google acted illegally to maintain its search monopoly by securing itself as a default on devices.</li><li>Google has a separate trial over its advertising technology set for later this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A major blow was struck against Google on Monday after a judge ruled that the company illegally maintained a monopoly in search, reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/google-antitrust-ruling.html">The New York Times</a>. The ruling comes years after the Justice Department and U.S. states sued Google over its search dominance back in 2020. The ruling could have far-reaching consequences for Alphabet and Big Tech.</p><p>Judge Amit P. Mehta made the ruling after closing arguments were made in May. He acknowledges in the ruling that Google has hired skilled employees and continues to innovate its product while making "shrewd business decisions" to maintain its market dominance.</p><p>However, the problem lies in how Google has positioned itself as the default search engine across various products. Judge Mehta has determined that Google has violated section 2 of the Sherman Act, which promotes competition and prohibits "monopolization, attempted monopolization, or conspiracy or combination to monopolize."</p><p>"For years, Google has secured default placements through distribution contracts," Judge Mehta states in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25032745-045110819896">289-page ruling</a> obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit">The Verge</a>. It explains how this is achieved through advertising revenue share, which it pays to companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/doj-sues-google-for-anti-competitive-practices">in exchange for making Google Search the default</a> on products like Safari.</p><p>"In exchange for revenue share, Google not only received placement at the key search access points, but its partners also agree not to preload any other general search engine on the device. Thus, most devices in the United States come preloaded exclusively with Google."</p><p>Because users generally stick to the default search engine on their devices, this is seen as extremely valuable real estate, forcing competitors to find other avenues to get consumers to use their search engines. To put into perspective, Google had nearly 95% of search market share on mobile phones by 2020, with Microsoft&apos;s Bing making up the rest.</p><p>The ruling goes on to note how Google has become synonymous with search, going largely unchallenged by the competition.</p><p>Yet, there was some reprieve. While the court found Google held a monopoly in search and text advertising, it was also determined that Google does not hold monopoly power in general search advertising and that there is no market for search advertising. The court also declined to sanction Google for not preserving employee chat messages.</p><p>"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn&apos;t be allowed to make it easily available," says Kent Walker, Google&apos;s president of Global Affairs, in response to the ruling.</p><p>"We appreciate the Court&apos;s finding that Google is &apos;the industry&apos;s highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users,&apos; that Google &apos;has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices,&apos; &apos;has continued to innovate in search&apos; and that &apos;Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google&apos;s search quality relative to its rivals and find Google&apos;s to be superior.&apos;</p><p>Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal. As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use."</p><p>However, Google&apos;s woes are just beginning. The company still faces a separate trial later this year over its advertising technology.</p>

<ul><li>A report claims that Samsung plans on bringing a few Galaxy AI features to the Galaxy A35 and the Galaxy A55 midrange phones.</li><li>This will reportedly occur during the rollout of One UI 6.1.1, but the AI's arrival will not include "everything."</li><li>One UI 6.1.1 is still under development and has supposedly further delayed the start of Samsung's One UI 7 (Android 15) beta.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amid Samsung&apos;s rapid push for its AI software, rumors swirl about its next potential expansion to another range of phones.</p><p>A few unnamed sources have reportedly informed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ai-select-2024-galaxy-a-phones/">SamMobile</a> that Samsung will bring Galaxy AI to its Galaxy A series. Although the information given was limited, there&apos;s a chance the company will roll out its AI software on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-galaxy-a55-and-a35">Galaxy A35 and the Galaxy A55</a> mid-range phones. The publication could "confirm" as much, though it&apos;s stated that there&apos;s no chance of it coming to any older A-series devices.</p><p>It was then rumored that "not every" Galaxy AI feature would be featured on the A35 and the A55. This is likely due to the lack of some internal hardware components as Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI heavily relies on the NPU and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Nano</a>. A more concrete answer to which features we could see was left unanswered.</p><p>With the hardware limitations in mind, it would come as little surprise if the Galaxy A35 and A55 received Galaxy AI features that rely on the cloud. This means that we could see the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">Generative Edit</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">Generative Wallpaper</a>, and others. </p><p>This move isn&apos;t entirely unprecedented, as the Galaxy S24 series&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-instant-slow-mo-galaxy-ai-pure-magic">Instant Slow-Mo</a> feature was mentioned as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">S23 FE</a> lacks it. That trend may continue with the A series devices as that feature may require a processing power they don&apos;t have.</p><p>When it could land is reportedly up to Samsung&apos;s planned release of the One UI 6.1.1 update. The post claims that this could take place "this month or the next."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Samsung rolled out its One UI 6.1 update to a few devices, including a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-midranges-may-rumor">couple of A series phones</a>. The patch notably lacked any Galaxy AI upgrades for the devices and their hardware capabilities were the culprit. However, with the latest round of rumors, it seems that Samsung has found a way to implement Galaxy AI into its mid-range devices to some capacity.</p><p>The Galaxy S22 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-galaxy-ai-support-potential">went through a similar issue</a> and the Korean brand found a way to patch in <em>some </em>AI features despite the limited hardware.</p><p>More importantly, Samsung&apos;s Head of Mobile, TM Roh, discussed the company&apos;s newfound <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discusses-the-ai-phone-future">R&D focus on AI</a> following Unpacked. In the future, Roh stated that AI will become "multi-modal" and that the "AI Phone" will become Samsung&apos;s main business since the introduction of the Galaxy S24. Additionally, this new era will require the company to invest in new hardware to meet the software&apos;s requirements.</p><p>We&apos;re still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-has-allegedly-put-the-brakes-on-the-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">waiting on One UI 6.1.1</a>, which seems to have delayed the originally planned start of the One UI 7 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>) beta. So, those with a Galaxy A35 or Galaxy A55 will have to wait a little longer to see if these rumors pan out.</p>

The OnePlus Pad 2 does support stylus input, however, its compatibility is limited to the company's Stylo 2.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="the-oneplus-pad-2-has-stylus-support-with-a-catch-2">The OnePlus Pad 2 has stylus support, with a catch</h2>
<p>After the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a> was released with stylus support, complete with the OnePlus Stylo, it would have come as a bit of a shock to see a new tablet arrive without it. Thankfully, that&apos;s not something we need to worry about as the OnePlus Pad 2 features stylus support.</p><p>In addition to the OnePlus Pad 2 and Smart Keyboard, the Stylo 2 was also introduced. Currently, this is the only stylus that works with OnePlus&apos; latest tablet. We tried using an array of USI stylus options, such as those that work with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/best-stylus-pixel-tablet">Pixel Tablet</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>, but none of those worked with the Pad 2.</p><p>There was a bit of hope that this might not be the case after noticing that the "eraser" on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/penoval-usi-2-pen">Penoval USI 2.0 Stylus</a> was able to interact with the display. However, it was extremely inconsistent and isn&apos;t something that we recommend trying to use.</p><p>Nevertheless, the OnePlus Stylo 2 was released alongside the Pad 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/product/product/oneplus-stylo-2">retailing for $99</a>, and is available directly from the company. The Stylo 2, too has been slightly redesigned, as it ditches the matte white finish from its predecessor in favor of a leather-like texture for improved grip.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FtyN6zA3XTxzign7yKn49f" name="oneplus-pad-2-stylo-2-notes-app.jpg" alt="OnePlus Pad 2 with Notes app open and Stylo 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FtyN6zA3XTxzign7yKn49f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other features of the Stylo 2 include 16,000 levels of pressure, while OnePlus claims it offers "near-instant response." When used with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-just-launched-but-it-might-be-the-best-prime-day-tablet-deal">OnePlus Pad 2</a>, the Stylo 2 also provides "subtle feedback" by interacting with the display using the stylus. This also applies when jotting down notes, attempting to replicate the feeling when writing with pen and paper.</p><p>Pushing the boundaries even further, the Stylo 2 can double as a laser pointer for presentations. All you&apos;ll need to do is press and hold on to the built-in touchpad, and the Stylo 2 will spring into action, removing any headaches that might&apos;ve occurred if you didn&apos;t have the Pad 2 and Stylo 2. Plus, the aforementioned touchpad can even be used to scroll through documents without needing to touch the screen or the Smart Keyboard&apos;s trackpad.</p><p>Additionally, those worried about the potential of losing the Stylo 2 can rest easy. Thanks to the series of magnets built into both the tablet and stylus, just place the Stylo 2 along the top and it will snap into place. This is how you pair the two devices together, and while the Stylo 2 is attached, it will also be wirelessly charged until you remove it or the battery is full.</p><p>Although we wish the OnePlus Pad 2 featured USI 2.0 support, at least the Stylo 2 is here to prevent any additional frustrations.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Pad 2 could end up offering the best value of the year, as it's the first Android tablet to launch with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and is priced less than the Galaxy Tab S9. Plus, you can pair it with the OnePlus Stylo 2 and Smart Keyboard for the ultimate portable workstation.</p></p>

It&apos;ll only take you a minute, assuming you have a Galaxy phone.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> has no built-in GPS or UWB. The Galaxy Wearable app will save the last <em>known</em> location based on your phone&apos;s GPS data, but if you leave your Galaxy Ring in a public bathroom and someone takes it, you&apos;ll have no way of finding it.</p><p>Worse, if you connect your Galaxy Ring to a non-Samsung phone, you have no way of tracking it, because the system uses the Samsung Find app only available through the Galaxy Store. All you can do is light up the ring&apos;s LEDs to make it more visible, which won&apos;t help if the tiny wearable falls into a couch cushion.</p><p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring reviewer</a> has middling impressions of it thus far, and his inability to track it with a non-Samsung phone is a big knock against it. Still, for Samsung phone owners, here&apos;s how to find your lost Galaxy Ring!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-find-your-lost-samsung-galaxy-ring-2">How to find your lost Samsung Galaxy Ring</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As mentioned above, most of the steps below only work on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a>. </p><p>1. On your Galaxy phone, open <strong>Settings > Security and privacy > Lost device protection</strong>. </p><p>2. Toggle <strong>Offline finding</strong> and hit <strong>Turn on</strong> on the subsequent pop-up screen.</p><p>3. Open the <strong>Galaxy Wearable app</strong>. If you have multiple devices connected — like the Galaxy Ring and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> — and the Galaxy Ring isn&apos;t immediately visible, tap the <strong>devices button</strong> (a hovering circle with two squares and circles) and switch to it.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Find My Ring</strong> at the bottom of the app menu.</p><p>5. Samsung will tell you to <strong>enable location permissions</strong>. Be sure to enable these to <strong>allow devices to be found</strong>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HXKx6YkTg2wbAgkh9bppea" name="how-to-find-lost-samsung-galaxy-ring-screenshots.jpg" alt="Galaxy Wearable and Samsung Find screenshots showing how the Lost Ring feature works for the Galaxy Ring." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXKx6YkTg2wbAgkh9bppea.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this point, Samsung will track the Galaxy Ring&apos;s location by default in the <strong>Samsung Find app</strong>, which Samsung uses instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Google&apos;s Find My network</a>. </p><p>With a Samsung phone, you open Samsung Find and tap your ring under <strong>Devices</strong>. A Galaxy Ring icon will appear wherever it was last detected, whether online or offline.</p><p>You&apos;ll see the <strong>Blink light</strong> option, as well as a <strong>Refresh</strong> button to update its last known location. Under <strong>More</strong>, you can toggle <strong>Notify me when it&apos;s found</strong> or <strong>Notify when left behind</strong>. The latter is especially useful for warning you immediately if your phone detects it disconnecting.</p><p>With a non-Samsung phone, your process is simpler (and less useful). Open the Galaxy Wearable app and tap Find My Ring. You&apos;ll find a threadbare menu with only one option: <strong>Tap Start</strong> to make the Galaxy Ring LEDs blink.</p>
<h2 id="finding-your-galaxy-ring-shouldn-apos-t-be-a-samsung-exclusive-2">Finding your Galaxy Ring shouldn&apos;t be a Samsung exclusive</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C36SKfEDC3XzvmGDA4crLM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-battery-life-02.jpg" alt="The gold Samsung Galaxy Ring showing battery percentage on the Samsung Wearables app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C36SKfEDC3XzvmGDA4crLM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s a common trend for Samsung to make vital tools exclusive to push you to buy all of their devices, like making life-saving AFib detection on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> restricted to the Health Monitor app.</p><p>In this case, Samsung made a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-samsung-galaxy-ring-features-are-exclusive-to-samsung-phones">Galaxy Ring features exclusive to Samsung phones</a>, including the Energy Score, Wellness Tips, and gesture controls. But making the Find My Ring feature Galaxy exclusive, with no alternative option like Google&apos;s network, is borderline inexcusable for a device this small and expensive.</p><p>Our Galaxy Ring tester tried connecting it to Google&apos;s Find My Network, but it wasn&apos;t visible. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/rings/galaxy-ring/" target="_blank">official Samsung Galaxy Ring page</a> claims that the lost ring feature "requires a smartphone with the SmartThings app," but he couldn&apos;t make the Galaxy Ring appear there, either. He even tried a third-party Bluetooth finder app to see if he could use it to hunt it down locally; again, it wasn&apos;t visible in the devices list. </p><p>We&apos;ve emailed Samsung to ask whether they have any plans to add lost-ring tracking to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> besides Samsung&apos;s own. They responded that "Android phone users will see blinking lights when prompted to locate their ring," and didn&apos;t provide further details. As it is, it&apos;s extremely easy to lose track of a smart ring unless it&apos;s left in plain sight, and you should be careful whenever you take it off to note where you&apos;ve left it.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring lasts up to a week per charge, 10ATM and IP68 protection via the titanium frame, an ultra-lightweight design, and a complimentary charging cradle for on-the-go charging. It tracks a bunch of heart rate and sleep data passively, while being much more comfortable than a smartwatch.</p></p>

<p>If you&apos;re planning to get a new smartwatch soon, it only makes sense to compare the OnePlus Watch 2R vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 7, which are hands-down two of the finest wearables available in the market right now. Both are recent launches, with the former sitting next to the awesome OnePlus Watch 2, and the latter sitting alongside the uber-premium Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p><p>Offering powerful hardware, great software, and the ability to track a wide range of health and fitness parameters, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and the OnePlus Watch 2R have a lot going for them. The two are priced (fairly) reasonably too, but which one really deserves the moolah? Let&apos;s find out!</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="o8oMMm8bAgxKY3PjpEhKEd" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-closeup.jpeg" alt="The OnePlus Watch 2R and its standard watch face, worn on the author's wrist." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8oMMm8bAgxKY3PjpEhKEd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the Galaxy Watch 7 and the OnePlus Watch 2R do a solid job of replicating the look and feel of traditional wristwatches, thanks to their circular cases made from aluminum. The two smartwatches also support standard (albeit different-sized) straps, so you shouldn&apos;t have any issues <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands" target="_blank">finding one</a> that suits your style. However, while the Galaxy Watch 7 lets you choose between two (40mm and 44mm) sizes, the OnePlus Watch 2R only comes in one (46mm) size. Both wearables have an IP68 rating and are water-resistant up to 5ATM, but only the Galaxy Watch 7 is compliant with the MIL-STD-810H standard, which makes it a bit more rugged than the OnePlus Watch 2R.</p>
<p>While the Galaxy Watch 7 is powered by a 3nm Exynos W1000 SoC, the OnePlus Watch 2R is driven by a 4nm Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 chipset, and you also get 2GB of RAM and 32GB of eMMC storage with each. If these specifications look familiar, it&apos;s because they&apos;re exactly the same as what you&apos;d find if you were to take a look at our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-oneplus-watch-2" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. OnePlus Watch 2</a> comparison. The Galaxy Watch 7 does have a slightly more efficient processor, but the OnePlus Watch 2R also comes with a secondary BES2700BP processor for less resource-intensive activities like step tracking and notification alerts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="WQbshdpZ6mYeN6wdpY8bQg" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-3d-watch-face.jpg" alt="3D watch face on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQbshdpZ6mYeN6wdpY8bQg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 is available in two display sizes — 1.3-inch and 1.5-inch — with both having Sapphire Crystal protection. On the other hand, the OnePlus Watch 2R comes with just one display size — 1.43-inch — which is shielded with Gorilla Glass. Nonetheless, the screens on both wearables are incredible touch-enabled AMOLED panels having deep blacks, rich contrast levels, and super-high pixel density. The two smartwatches also get identical physical controls — a pair of tactile buttons that can be customized to perform a variety of functions — located on the right edge.</p>

<p>Both smartwatches are no slouch when it comes to keeping tabs on your activity and personal wellness metrics, having a variety of sensors to help you do just that. As far as essentials like heart rate, sleep quality, and stress levels are concerned, the two wearables fare equally well. However, the Galaxy Watch 7 comes with an upgraded &apos;<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking" target="_blank">BioActive&apos; sensor</a> that not only allows for improved accuracy, but also helps in monitoring your metabolic health. Female users will also appreciate the menstrual cycle tracking feature, which is something the OnePlus 2R doesn&apos;t have.</p><p>As Android Central&apos;s Ara Wagoner found in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review" target="_blank">her review</a>, the majority of these features work great. What&apos;s not so great is that many of them are exclusive to Galaxy phones.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Watch 2R and the Galaxy Watch 7 definitely seem like they can give the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness" target="_blank">best fitness smartwatches</a> a run for their money. Both wearables can automatically detect and log a number of workouts and provide detailed information (e.g., average speed, distance travelled) about the wearer&apos;s overall performance when playing a variety of sports. The two smartwatches also have dual-frequency GPS that should help you in tracking your outdoor running sessions with even better accuracy.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 is among the first smartwatches to run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5" target="_blank">Wear OS 5</a> out of the box. While the latest version of Google&apos;s wearable-centric software platform is largely focused on under-the-hood enhancements, Samsung&apos;s One UI 6 Watch overlay brings several interesting features. Arguably the most notable of these is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai" target="_blank">Galaxy AI</a>, which analyzes the health and fitness data collected by the smartwatch and turns it into actionable insights. Not just that, Galaxy AI also enables things like suggested replies and voice-to-text summaries.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 2R does come with Wear OS 4, but the platform works in conjunction with a proprietary version of RTOS (Real Time Operating System) to manage basic functions like notifications.</p>
<p>As noted by Android Central&apos;s Michael Hicks in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review" target="_blank">his review</a>, this dual-OS architecture allows the wearable to go for up to three days with the battery completely juiced up. Speaking of which, the OnePlus Watch 2R has a large 500mAh battery with super-fast wired charging. In comparison, the Galaxy Watch 7 does have smaller 300mAh (40mm) and 425mAh (44mm) batteries, but you do get fast wireless charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ubr3aUgtSFHaXthdqnK6fZ" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-app-drawer.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7's app drawer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ubr3aUgtSFHaXthdqnK6fZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Talking about connectivity, both smartwatches include basics like dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and NFC for contactless payments. That said, only the Galaxy Watch 7 is offered with (optional) 4G/LTE. That makes the OnePlus Watch 2R a no-go for proper untethered calling, even though it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-used-to-want-lte-smartwatch-but-not-anymore" target="_blank">not that big of a deal</a> as you might think.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-watch-2r-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-which-should-you-buy-2">OnePlus Watch 2R vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 7: Which should you buy?</h2>
<p>If there&apos;s one thing that&apos;s clear, it&apos;s that the OnePlus Watch 2R and the Galaxy Watch 7 are among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch" target="_blank">best Wear OS watches</a> currently available in the market. They&apos;re well-built, have stunning displays, and do just about everything you&apos;d expect from a modern wearable without issues. Sure, the Galaxy Watch 7 does have a MIL-STD-810H certification for added durability, but the OnePlus Watch 2R features phenomenal battery life with its dual-engine architecture. Just like any other product, both have their own sets of pros and cons. But the question is, which one should you spend your money on?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HNhfwnyfVhHuac6RGU34TP" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-running-form-stats.jpeg" alt="Running form data on the OnePlus Watch 2R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HNhfwnyfVhHuac6RGU34TP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 2R is priced at $229.99, which is a very reasonable price for what it offers. On the other hand, the Galaxy Watch 7 will cost you $299.99 or $329.99, depending on the size you go for. The extra $70-100 is not a small amount, but you do get features like better software support and menstrual tracking. However, if you want 4G/LTE connectivity, you&apos;ll have to spend $349.99 or $379.99 for the cellular version of the Galaxy Watch 7. That&apos;s $120-150 over the OnePlus Watch 2R, which is only offered with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity.</p><p>So, here&apos;s the thing! If all you want is a well-rounded smartwatch that can perform the usual core functions (e.g., health and fitness tracking, managing notifications from a paired smartphone) admirably, either of these two wearables should fit your requirements (and wrists) just fine. Go for the OnePlus Watch 2R if you&apos;re on a budget and value battery endurance over anything else. Conversely, get the Galaxy Watch 7 if money is no object and untethered calls are a must-have for you.</p>
