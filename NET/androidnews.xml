A few brands do it, except Jabra is the only one on the higher end that consistently does so. Its Active earbuds continue to provide excellent results, and that&apos;s very much the case with the Elite 8 Active Gen 2.</p><p>By their name, these earbuds carry on from their predecessors and add a few new improvements to the mix. However, a solid pair of ruggedized earbuds gets overshadowed by Jabra&apos;s decision to move on from its earbuds business, but that still doesn&apos;t really change how viable these are.</p>

<p>Jabra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabras-new-elite-earbuds-come-with-a-case-thats-more-than-meets-the-eye">launched</a> the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 in June 2024, and they will be easy to find in retail and online stores for some time. They start at $230, though discounts aren&apos;t out of the question down the line now that Jabra is pulling out of its consumer business and will no longer make earbuds. Jabra confirms it will keep supporting its existing lineup of Elite earbuds with updates and warranty commitments for years to come. They come in black, navy, coral, and olive.</p>

<p>The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 may not have everything their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-gen-2-review">Elite 10 Gen 2</a> siblings do, but they may be the more appealing of the two for a couple of reasons. First is durability. While the Elite 10 Gen 2 boast an impressive IP57 rating for any pair of flagship earbuds, the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 take both dust and water resistance further with IP68 protection. It&apos;s rare enough to find rugged earbuds, but it&apos;s another to find a pair that does so many things well. You could be hiking up a mountain or splashing into a pool, and there wouldn&apos;t be a problem. Dealing with sweat is just part of the deal here.</p><p>That&apos;s where the second reason comes in: the durability makes the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 more compelling as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout earbuds</a>. Much like their predecessors, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-review">first-gen Elite 8 Active</a>, Jabra wisely chose to stick with a design formula that simply works. A rubberized matte finish handles water so well that it slides off the coating. </p><p>I wish Jabra applied 100% coverage with this material but it basically took the same approach as it did with the first-gen Elite 8 Active and left a sizeable inner portion more exposed. Granted, that doesn&apos;t necessarily pose a danger because dust and water resistance apply equally here, but it still would&apos;ve been nice to see here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ezJiHueGcaESSy4BdgCCkc" name="Jabra-Elite-8-Active-Gen-2-wearing.jpg" alt="Wearing Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ezJiHueGcaESSy4BdgCCkc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sticking with a familiar design bodes well for fit and comfort. These are some of the most comfortable and stable earbuds available, in my opinion, having worn and tested hundreds of wireless earbuds at this point. You get three ear tip sizes to choose from to find the best, snuggest fit for your ears. One more size would&apos;ve been nice, like an extra-large or extra-small, though.</p><p>A tighter seal is critical to getting the most out of the onboard active noise cancelation (ANC), and that&apos;s no different here. It&apos;s also crucial to the sound, especially if you&apos;re looking to wear these during a run or workout and want to trap in as much bass as possible. </p><p>The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 have smaller 6mm drivers compared to the 10mm ones in the Elite 10 Gen 2, so they work harder to play the same tunes. However, the tuning isn&apos;t different, and you can always tweak the EQ in Jabra&apos;s Sound+ app to deliver a balanced sound. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PN8Vn2ibWRHcDH9LKNpyJc" name="Jabra-Elite-8-Active-Gen-2-plugged-in.jpg" alt="Jabra Elite 8 Active case plugged into laptop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PN8Vn2ibWRHcDH9LKNpyJc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Truth be told, there&apos;s no major difference in how music generally sounds through these buds, though changes do occur under certain circumstances. Improved ANC, particularly in lower and mid-range frequencies, helps drown out more background noise to let audio playback feel more resonant. </p><p>It largely works efficiently. I can&apos;t tell you the ANC is twice as good as Jabra claims, but it is more refined this time. It does better with street noise and wind, though phone calls in windy conditions still pose a challenge sometimes. I was more impressed with HearThrough, where ambient sounds come through much clearer than before, making it more natural to hear an announcement or chat with someone without removing the buds. </p><p>The bigger deal is the fact the charging case also acts as a Bluetooth LE smart case. It works with the LC3 codec, so once you use the included cable and plug in via USB-C or 3.5mm to a playback device, it streams the audio to the earbuds. On a plane, this feels like magic, even if Jabra is hardly the first to ever do it. Same with a TV, where keeping quiet could mean the difference between happiness and misery. It&apos;s also gold with laptops or tablets where latency and audio/video sync might be a concern. It doesn&apos;t even need any setup; just plug in, hold the button on the case until a white light appears, and you&apos;re good. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.58%;"><img id="D6x6x23L4uBFzudnPqoLLa" name="Jabra-Elite-8-Active-Gen-2-screenshots.jpg" alt="Screenshots for Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D6x6x23L4uBFzudnPqoLLa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1466" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As always, Jabra offers a significant level of granular control in the Sound+ app, letting you adjust the controls (which still work well as physical buttons), set up Spotify Tap, and update the firmware, among other things. You just have to dig a little to see where everything is if you&apos;re new to Jabra&apos;s earbuds.</p><p>Spatial sound is more front and center as a feature, and it&apos;s OK. Not great, nor terrible. One reason is that it&apos;s Dolby Audio rather than Atmos, giving you Dolby&apos;s more general spatial audio tech. As such, there&apos;s no head tracking as the Elite 10 Gen 2 have, and the effect feels less substantial here, anyway. I chose to leave it off most of the time, particularly for music, and I only tried it again when watching a show or movie.</p>

<p>Jabra gets other things right, like the wear sensors, where taking an earbud off pauses playback or mutes a call, or using only one earbud automatically turns on HearThrough. Multipoint connections also let you pair with two devices simultaneously, making the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 buds just as useful in an office situation. </p><p>On paper, battery life is rated at up to eight hours per charge with ANC on or up to 14 hours with it off. That&apos;s all based on default volume levels, so if you crank these up, you&apos;re never hitting those numbers. I easily got above seven hours at about 60% volume—and spatial audio off—so the batteries in both buds hold up well. The case offers an extra three full charges, and since it also supports wireless charging and a five-minute quick charge, the conveniences add up.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-what-s-not-good"><span>Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2: What's not good</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1690px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BnbubVXMiWe9jNkXZ2xmqa" name="Jabra-Elite-8-Active-Gen-2-close-up.jpg" alt="Close-up of Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 earbud in ear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BnbubVXMiWe9jNkXZ2xmqa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1690" height="951" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I still don&apos;t understand Jabra&apos;s motivation for not supporting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res audio codecs</a>. Here, you only get SBC and AAC. Still no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">aptX</a>, LDAC, or LHDC, to name a key few. You could argue hi-res tracks are less relevant for more active-focused earbuds, but I don&apos;t see why running or working out suddenly negates such a feature. Jabra did the same with the Elite 10 Gen 2—a missed opportunity for both pairs.</p><p>Perhaps it&apos;s a moot point anyway, considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/gn-kills-jabra-elite-and-talk-products">company is leaving its consumer business behind</a>. The shocking exit comes at a time when it seemed Jabra was still top-class in the category. Its hearing aid and enterprise businesses make more money, so in a tighter and tighter consumer market for wireless earbuds, Jabra&apos;s decision-makers made what was very likely a pure business decision. </p><p>It&apos;s just odd for a brand to launch a key product and then step away from the entire business altogether. On the bright side, Jabra will continue to support its consumer audio products for "years" to come with updates and warranties, and given its track record that way, I&apos;m inclined to believe it.</p>

<p>Despite Jabra&apos;s surprising move, the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 deserve to be mentioned along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>. Certainly, if you were looking at the best earbuds for workouts, they would be at the top of the list. If you feel you could do without the improved ANC and HearThrough, you&apos;ll find similar comfort and durability with the previous Elite 8 Active. If you wanted good durability with additional features and the same fit, the Elite 10 Gen 2 are an excellent choice. </p><p>When it comes to other brands, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a> don&apos;t have dust resistance but their IPX7 protection is pretty rugged for sweat and water. For a pair with ear hooks and much cheaper price, you could look at the Treblab X3 Pro or JBL Endurance Peak 3. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5TGyuCrx62jVqiVCVso6Ab" name="Jabra-Elite-8-Active-Gen-2-in-hand.jpg" alt="Jabra Elite 8 Active earbuds in case in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5TGyuCrx62jVqiVCVso6Ab.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want rugged durability.</li>
  <li>You want good sound with ANC support.</li>
  <li>You want a comfortable fit with physical buttons.</li>
  <li>You want an EQ to work with.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You really want hi-res audio codecs.</li>
  <li>You don&apos;t need spatial audio.</li>
  <li>You&apos;re on a tighter budget.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>As I already pointed out, it&apos;s strange for a brand to launch a key product and turn away from the entire business at the same time. That&apos;s where we are with the Elite 8 Active Gen 2—putting consumers in a tough spot. But despite the unusual situation, I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to recommend these earbuds simply because they don&apos;t have many rugged competitors. And definitely not of this quality. Plus, Jabra is still manufacturing them to accommodate retail demand. </p><p>They are a very iterative upgrade over their predecessors, though. Unless you&apos;re really particular about noise cancelation, HearThrough, and really want the Bluetooth LE feature in the case, you won&apos;t go wrong with the previous pair, either.</p>

<p>This is Android Central&apos;s News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week&apos;s most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape. </p><p>This week saw the first look at RCS messaging on the iPhone, YouTube is tightening its reigns on Premium subscriptions via VPN, Android 15&apos;s Beta 3 launches, Motorola teases its upcoming foldables, and Spotify introduces a new basic plan.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/early-look-rcs-support-apple-iphone"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>RCS was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-made-rcs-messaging-an-afterthought-at-wwdc-why-wouldnt-it">barely mentioned</a> at Apple&apos;s WWDC; however, days later, we saw a glimpse of the messaging feature with the iOS 18 beta. </p><p>X user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/dhinakg/status/1802405645955567958" target="_blank">Dhinak</a> spotted this and posted a lengthy thread breaking down its availability and present features. The first look shows that green bubbles are still used to identify texts from Android users despite RCS—as<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone#section-update"> expected</a>. Apparently, Android users can send RCS messages to iPhone users in individual and group chats. Additionally, the X user states that higher-quality audio files, photos, and other forms of media can be shared via these chats. </p><p>However, it appears Apple has a lot of work to do when it comes to RCS. Firstly, there is a lack of E2EE (end-to-end encryption) in group chats, something that was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-rcs-group-chat-e2ee">implemented in Android last year</a>. Emoji reactions continue to be an iPhone user thing, as only they get to see a "proper" reaction to messages. If an iMessage user reacts to an Android user&apos;s message, the green bubble user will receive a new message saying "Liked," followed by their text in quotes.</p><p>Replying to a specific message continues to be a challenge for both Android and Apple users, as they don&apos;t have the option to do so. Another thing to note is that RCS is limited to iPhones on T-Mobile and AT&T networks at the moment.</p>

A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1di5mz5/comment/l91rrqr/" target="_blank">thread on Reddit</a> highlighted that these cancellations were linked to users resorting to VPN services in order to score cheaper rates by taking advantage of regional pricing loopholes.</p><p>To illustrate the price difference, a Premium subscription costs Rs.129 ($1.54) per month in India, whereas it normally costs $13.99 in the US. Some use YouTube Premium for a fraction of the cost in their home market. Although the subscription worked fine after the initial VPN trick, Google seems to be aware of this loophole and is going after these users.</p><p>In response, Google indirectly confirmed to Android Central that it&apos;s tightening its reigns and that "to provide the most accurate plans and offers available, we have systems in place to determine the country of our users," the spokesperson said. "In instances where the signup country does not match where the user is accessing YouTube, we&apos;re asking members to update their billing information to their current country of residence."</p>

Google is now allowing enrolled testers to have single-step sign-in capabilities through biometrics like facial recognition, fingerprint, or screen lock. Previously, users were given two sub-menus: one asking about a "saved passkey" and another for their biometrics. Users will now see one unified sub-menu detailing the service they&apos;re signing into, a prompt for their fingerprint, or the option to use a PIN.</p><p>Android 15 Beta 3 wants app developers to prepare their products, libraries, tools, and game engines for Android 15. Google hopes this will prepare their apps for the new "FLAG_STOPPED" changes that ensure apps don&apos;t run until a user&apos;s manual input is detected. Support for 16KB pages, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/gmail-gets-predictive-back-feature-on-android-14">predictive back animations</a>, and support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">Private Spaces</a> are items to keep an eye out for. </p><p>Android 15 Beta 3 is rolling out now to all enrolled testers and supported devices.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There&apos;s been a thought bouncing around in my head about the state of tablets. I&apos;ve talked about how stale the category is and how there&apos;s a definite need for a change in the space. It&apos;s part of the reason why I decided to upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-should-think-different-with-ipad-pro">M4 iPad Pro</a>, just because I thought Apple would have something to blow our minds with iPadOS 18 at WWDC.</p><p>Since then, I have been thinking that Samsung got the formula right, specifically with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a>. If you want smaller tablets, there are plenty to choose from. They probably won&apos;t have all the bells and whistles, but they&apos;ll get the job done for whatever you need.</p><p>So, while I&apos;ve been on the hunt for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablet</a>, maybe it&apos;s been right in front of me this whole time. It&apos;s not perfect, not by any means. For one, using it as in vertical orientation in any scenario is laughable. I&apos;m also still scratching my head and wondering why a tablet of this caliber doesn&apos;t include an option for cellular connectivity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Kbsrw9dS4aUQ8j8Mx28EHP" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-in-lap-in-car.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra in lap" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kbsrw9dS4aUQ8j8Mx28EHP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And I&apos;m still not the biggest fan of the keyboard case, as it just isn&apos;t great to use in my lap. If I can set it up on a table or at a desk, then it&apos;s perfect, but Samsung needs to borrow some notes from Apple or Microsoft for its next tablet keyboard.</p><p>Setting all of that aside, there&apos;s nothing that can rival the versatility of what the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra offers. It&apos;s fantastic as an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-samsung-phone-tablet-second-screen-windows">extra monitor</a> for my desktop PC thanks to the <em>huge</em> AMOLED screen. I just prop it up below my main monitor, and everything pretty much just works.</p><p>Using it this way also makes it easy to just use it as an Android tablet if I need to try something out or if I want to just watch a video while I&apos;m eating lunch. The Tab S9 Ultra is also arguably the ultimate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handheld</a>—and yes, I mean handheld.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fr8qS98NFcVBhfm5hidqJh" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-gamesir-galileo-g8.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra with the GameSir G8 Galileo controller attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fr8qS98NFcVBhfm5hidqJh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For one, it&apos;s powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, has plenty of RAM, and plenty of storage thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot. This makes everything so much easier, as I don&apos;t need to worry about not having enough storage for everything at a time when companies are stripping away expandable storage on more and more devices. As for being a handheld, I usually keep the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-galileo-review">GameSir Galileo G8</a> nearby so I can use it as an oversized screen to play games without relying on a Bluetooth controller. Sure, it looks goofy, but who cares if it works?</p><p>What really made me realize that the Tab S9 Ultra is the perfect tablet for me is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a>. Apple&apos;s implementation of a multi-window interface is just downright awful. Don&apos;t get me wrong; it definitely works, but only within the confines of what Apple deems the proper way to use multiple apps.</p><p>I don&apos;t have to fiddle with anything or try to jump through a bunch of hoops to use my tablet as a laptop. Just tap the button or connect the keyboard, and I&apos;m there. All of the apps that I install work just as I&apos;d expected, even the ones that didn&apos;t want to work with adjustable windows in the past.</p>

<p>If I&apos;m away from home and my desktop is turned on, I can turn the Tab S9 Ultra into a proper laptop, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://parsec.app/">Parsec</a>. There are a bunch of other apps that do the same thing, but Parsec has been the most stable for me. When I&apos;m done, I just close Parsec and go back to whatever I was doing.</p><p>Usually, it&apos;s just transferring files that aren&apos;t stored in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">NAS</a>, but it&apos;s nice having this flexibility. Meanwhile, you can&apos;t even get Parsec on the iPad, and the other solutions don&apos;t work nearly as well for me.</p><p>This is to say that sometimes, it&apos;s better to take a step back and reevaluate the devices you already have before trying to make reasons for replacing them. The M4 iPad Pro is great, but what I already had with me is just as great and perhaps even better.</p>

<p>Buy the Google Pixel 8 alongside any six-month data plan at Mint Mobile and the carrier will hook you up with a $180 discount AND six months of additional wireless at no cost to you. That's 50% off a year of great coverage on T-Mobile's vast 5G network, not to mention a huge discount on a stellar Android device. If that's not the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro-deals-of-the-month">best Google Pixel 8 deal</a> on the web today, I don't know what is. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-8/4367987/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="05ce294e-683b-4889-8599-33e2611b0075" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699" data-dimension48="$699">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Since its unveiling last October, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a> has reigned as one of the best flagship devices on the market, pairing the efficiency of the Tensor G3 chipset with AI-powered software features and seven years of OS updates guaranteed. As a Pixel, you can also expect cutting-edge camera technology straight out of the box with one of the best portrait modes that we&apos;ve ever used. Sure, it may not get as much attention as the more-powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, but if you&apos;re looking for something simpler (and more affordable), you can&apos;t go wrong with the base model Pixel 8. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a>, if you&apos;re unfamiliar, is a popular MVNO carrier that sells wireless service in 3, 6, and 12-month increments of time, utilizing T-Mobile&apos;s vast 5G network to bring excellent coverage to users at a much lower cost. In fact, Mint Mobile ranks among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">our favorite MVNOs</a> because of its simplicity, vast coverage area, and bountiful deals. You also get free calls to Mexico and Canada, a mobile hotspot included with all plans, and compatibility with a wide assortment of devices.  </p><p>If this offer sounds familiar to you, it&apos;s probably because it&apos;s just the latest in a string of bundle-focused <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes">Mint Mobile deals</a> that we&apos;ve seen this year. The Pixel 8 Pro and new Google Pixel 8a have received similar deals with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-8-pro/4367961/"><strong>$440 off</strong></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-8a/5777318/"><strong>$100 off</strong></a>, respectively, so if you&apos;re a Pixel fan, take note. </p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung appears to have accidentally confirmed the long-rumored Galaxy Watch Ultra on its own website, matching up with some of the previous leaks and rumors.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-moniker-confirmed-via-official-support-pages/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a> spotted a support page for the yet-to-be-announced Galaxy Watch Ultra on Samsung Canada&apos;s website. This page not only confirms the smartwatch&apos;s existence but also reveals key details.</p><p>The upcoming model will supposedly feature LTE connectivity and a 47mm case, suggesting it might only come in a single size. On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> comes in two sizes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1423px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.13%;"><img id="C2ZdxZvFGHwcSvJiyTQ8SP" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-website-listing.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra website support page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C2ZdxZvFGHwcSvJiyTQ8SP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1423" height="756" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though the support page has since disappeared, it undeniably confirmed the existence of the upcoming model. Samsung&apos;s next-generation premium smartwatch promises a fresh design aimed at shaking up the market and competing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a>.</p><p>The buzz around Samsung&apos;s next-gen wearable is off the charts. Leaks and rumors have given us a pretty clear picture of its design, features, and possible price.</p><p>This top-tier smartwatch is said to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">sport a unique and tough look with a circular dial in a square case</a>. Rumor has it, it&apos;ll come in white and dark gray colorways, both featuring a vibrant orange side button for a bit of flair.</p><p>As per earlier leakers, the Watch Ultra is expected to feature an orange crown button on the right, flanked by two other buttons. Rumors also point to a grade 4 titanium chassis and a sapphire crystal glass display, indicating a premium build designed to endure an active lifestyle.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra is also rumored to have a peak brightness of up to 300 nits and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techmaniacs.gr/apokleistiko-mathame-ta-panta-gia-osa-erchontai-sto-epomeno-unpacked-tis-samsung/" target="_blank">offer water resistance up to 100 meters</a>, outperforming some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-waterproof-smartwatches">best waterproof smartwatches</a> on the market.</p><p>Rumor has it that the Galaxy Watch Ultra will launch on July 10 during Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Unpacked event. This event is expected to showcase a slew of Samsung&apos;s latest products, including the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Galaxy Z Flip 6, Galaxy Buds 3, and the classic Galaxy Watch 7.</p><p>However, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is expected to come with a hefty price tag, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-alleged-render-pricing-leak">rumored to be around $700</a>. While that&apos;s still a significant amount, it’s a bit cheaper than Apple&apos;s $800. So, if you&apos;re in the market for a high-end smartwatch and want to save a hundred bucks, the Galaxy Watch Ultra could be a great option.</p>

<ul><li>A dive into Google's Device Health Services app shows signs of a new "Adaptive Thermal" feature for Pixels.</li><li>The feature seems designed to help users take the necessary measures if their Pixel is overheating, which the feature will alert them to.</li><li>Adaptive Thermal features various warning states if a Pixel's temperature is rising too high before shutting itself down for protection.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems that Google is working on a way to help users keep their Pixels cool if it&apos;s running a risk of overheating.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-adaptive-thermal-3453215/">Android Authority</a>, version 1.27 of the Device Health Services app on Pixels holds clues about "Adaptive Thermal." Early strings of code in the app suggest that Google&apos;s new feature will warn users if their Pixel is encroaching on those hotter temperatures so they can assist with it.</p><p>It was discovered that Adaptive Thermal will push a "pre-emergency" notification to users if their device is rising toward 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The notification is joined by a tagline reading "phone needs to cool down" and that your Pixel&apos;s performance will slow.</p><p>Google explains within the app&apos;s code that these performance "limitations" include your Pixel&apos;s speed, the disabling of your 5G network connection, "and more."</p><p>The feature will also offer a few suggestions users can use to cool down their Pixel when tapping "See care steps." The code shows that users might see the following options:</p>
<ul><li>Try avoiding direct sunlight</li><li>Put your phone in the open for airflow</li><li>Close any battery-intensive apps like videos, games, and the camera</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL" name="Google-Pixel-8-mint-colorway-holding-back-01.jpg" alt="The mint colorway of the Google Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rahman states that Adaptive Thermal will continuously check on your device&apos;s temperature every five minutes. If your Pixel hasn&apos;t gotten better and instead rises in temperature to 126 degrees or above, this will activate its "emergency" state. While it sounds serious, Rahman adds that he couldn&apos;t see the details of that phase.</p><p>Additionally, if the temperature rises considerably to 131 degrees or higher, your device will warn you of an impending shutdown. The code shows that Adaptive Thermal will warn you that your Pixel shut off in 30 seconds for protection.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when Google plans on rolling this feature out to Pixels, but it could arrive on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/entire-pixel-9-series-live-photos-specs-leak">Pixel 9 series</a> if anything.</p><p>It&apos;s nothing new to say that Google&apos;s Pixel series has a bad history of overheating, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-6-battery-overheating-issues">the problems Pixel 7 and 6 users</a> faced last year. Those issues followed a security patch where users on Reddit reported a severe rise in device temperature, followed by a costly drain on their batteries.</p><p>The Pixel 8 series encountered some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro-battery-drain-and-network-issues">overheating issues</a> later last year, as well. It didn&apos;t appear widespread, however, several users reported that their devices would get quite warm when browsing the internet and while charging.</p>

<ul><li>A new report from alleged sources close to the matter states Amazon is looking to charge anywhere from $5 to $10 for its "Remarkable Alexa" (Alexa Plus).</li><li>Amazon intends for the AI to help users with shopping queries while a stronger variant is being developed for "complicated queries."</li><li>The report adds that Amazon has faced severe problems with its next-gen AI, such as fabricated information, alongside "poor employee morale."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A few more details about Amazon&apos;s proposed future for its AI assistant, Alexa, and how it will impact consumers have surfaced.</p><p>The report comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-mulls-5-10-monthly-price-tag-unprofitable-alexa-service-ai-revamp-2024-06-21/">Reuters</a>, which cites several people close to the project known internally as "Banyan." According to its sources, Amazon is thinking of including "two tiers of service" for this new Alexa. Its sources claim this could involve a $5 monthly charge or a $10 fee for this "Remarkable Alexa."</p><p>Reuters adds that Amazon is facing a "must-win" scenario. The company is reportedly moving toward infusing Alexa with even stronger AI brains to empower users when they visit the website. The publication&apos;s sources stated that working Alexa deeper into Amazon is to help customers with "shopping advice" and other purchase-related queries.</p><p>However, this won&apos;t come without cost, and it seems Amazon is considering two different price points. The company is allegedly considering replacing "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-alexa">Classic Alexa</a>" (its free variant) with a stronger AI version alongside another that leverages AI software for "complicated" tasks. The paid variant of Alexa is rumored to feature email composure, ordering from UberEats, and more from a "single prompt."</p><p>Moreover, it seems that Amazon isn&apos;t considering some sort of AI "bundle" with its higher-priced Prime membership plan.</p><p>It seems that Amazon is feeling pressured due to advances made by Google with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and its many models, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-play-store-launch">Microsoft&apos;s Copilot</a>, and OpenAI&apos;s ChatGPT. The report adds that the unnamed sources who&apos;ve come forward are hesitant about Amazon&apos;s decision to begin charging for a "revamped" version of Alexa&apos;s free services.</p>

<p>There are also rumors that Amazon&apos;s development of this new "Remarkable Alexa" has been hindered by AI hallucinations. The AI has supposedly fabricated information, which was often "false or misleading." Moreover, the company has had to wrangle with "poor employee morale."</p><p>Murmurings about "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-working-on-premium-alexa">Remarkable Alexa</a>" or "Alexa Plus" have been tumbling about since January. Those early reports stated that Amazon had around 15,000 users putting the new AI assistant through the wringer to iron out those problems. Again, rumors of severe development problems and delays were a recurring theme throughout that previous post.</p><p>The company is reportedly interested in launching Alexa Plus on June 30.</p>

Throughout its lifecycle, Nothing states this has helped the Phone 2 achieve an 8.6% lower carbon footprint over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Phone 1</a> at 53.45 kg CO2e.</p><p>Another major takeaway is that Nothing reports that it has removed the use of PVC in available products alongside brominated flame retardants (BFR). The report continues, stating that PVC endangers the health of humans and the environment throughout its lifecycle from creation to disposal. Nothing has reportedly worked since 2022 to eliminate PVC from its products, as it&apos;s a common material for wrapping wires in cables.</p>

<p>Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-three-years-os-updates">got candid</a> about its endeavors into a more environmentally-focused mindset last year in May. The Phone 2&apos;s carbon footprint reduction was labeled as a "significant achievement" considering the performance boosts Nothing provided. Elsewhere, the company stated that the device&apos;s mid-frame is made out of 100% recycled aluminum with 100% recycled copper making up its main circuit board.</p><p>Even the Phone 2&apos;s packaging cut back on harmful materials as Nothing highlighted its usage of over 60% FSC Mix-certified recycled fiber. The company also announced its partnership with the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) and the IRMA to continue on a path that&apos;s safer for the environment.</p>

<ul><li>Spotify has brought in a new basic plan for individuals and families in the U.S.</li><li>It costs $10.99 per month, but it has the benefits of the Premium Individual plan without audiobooks.</li><li>The same plan is available for six members under the Basic Family plan, which reportedly costs $16.99 per month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Spotify users in the U.S. can now take advantage of a new Basic plan that offers all the benefits of a Premium plan without audiobook listening time.</p><p>The streaming giant recently hiked its Premium individual plan from $10.99 to $11.99 monthly. It now has the $10.99 plan dubbed the Basic plan with limitations.</p>
<p>"Enjoy the music streaming benefits of your Premium plan without the monthly audiobook listening time. Starting at $10.99/month for eligible users, "Spotify notes in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-06-21/more-choice-for-us-subscribers/">announcement post</a>. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/21/spotify-basic-plans-audiobooks/">9to5Google</a> states that users, for some reason, can&apos;t "directly sign up for the new plan" through Spotify&apos;s website but rather can downgrade to the new plan, provided they are already existing individual plan users.</p>
<p>The new introduction of the Basic plan confirms the recent Bloomberg report, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-price-increase-new-plans-claims">shared Spotify&apos;s plans</a> to increase the Premium Individual plan by over $1 and the company&apos;s intention to introduce the latest $10.99 per month plan forgoing the audiobooks.</p><p>The new $10.99 per month plan appears to be the entry-level for subscriptions to the music streaming platform. While there is still a $9.99 per month plan, it is only for audiobook listening dubbed under the "Audiobooks Access" tier. It gives 15 hours of audiobook listening time.</p>

<p>Spotify now has some diversified plans for people in the U.S., starting with $10.99 Basic followed by Premium Individual ($11.99), which provides ad-free music online/offline next to 15 hours of audiobook listening time per month. </p><p>Then there&apos;s Premium Duo for $16.99 per month, giving the benefits of the Premium Individual plan but for two members. The Premium Family is another notable plan that costs $16.99 per month, and up to six users can take advantage of it with all $11.99 plan benefits.</p><p>9to5Google further notes that there is a new Basic Family plan costing $16.99 per month, which, for some reason, isn&apos;t mentioned in the aforementioned post but is visible for Spotify subscribers. It works similarly to the Basic plan for up to six members without audiobook listening experience.</p><p>It is interesting to see Spotify omitting the audiobook listening experience by introducing these new plans while the primary intention to increase the Premium Individual in the first place is reportedly to "cover the cost of audiobooks," according to the earlier mentioned Bloomberg report.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung announces a new color hue for the Galaxy S24 Ultra.</li><li>Dubbed Titanium Yellow, it sits right next to Titanium Black, Gray, and Violet colorways.</li><li>The new Ultra model starts at $1299 for the base 256GB of RAM.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As we are looking forward to the next foldables from Samsung, the company, meanwhile, just slipped in a new colorway for its flagship Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>The Ultra already has a notable amount of colors in the lineup, including the Titanium Black, Gray, and Violet colorways, which are sold online and offline. Then, there are exclusive online colors like Titanium green, blue, and orange. Adding to the vibrant color portfolio, Samsung is now introducing the Titanium Yellow color option to the lineup.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UXKHBvYjGx8499nyBtboHW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-Titanium-Colorways.jpg" alt="Galaxy S24 Ultra in Titanium Yellow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UXKHBvYjGx8499nyBtboHW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8TVyJHOjGE/?img_index=1">teasing</a> about the new colorway since early this week, the company finally made it official today (Jun. 21). At first glance, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> in new Titanium Yellow looks a lot more familiar to the Amber Yellow from its siblings, the Galaxy S24 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">S24 Plus</a>. The former looks darker and more vibrant than the latter models.</p><p>It isn&apos;t the first time Samsung has added new colors to its flagship phone, and it has also been a trend with past models. For instance, the predecessor model, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>, was introduced in two new colors, red and blue, on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SamsungIndia/status/1671439255749402625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1671439255749402625%7Ctwgr%5Eb34b6e5715343932aa4aaf19b0bd79906a6dfde4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbeebom.com%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-new-colors-india%2F">same date</a> last year.</p>

<p>As for the yellow colorways, OEMs are seen experimenting with new, vibrant colors for their premium handsets. Apple introduced bright yellow for the iPhone 14 Plus last year, and OnePlus followed the same with its Nord series. On the other hand, Pixel has been pushing the blue hue for its Pixel phones like the Pixel 7a, Pixel 8 series, and Pixel 8a.</p><p>Nonetheless, adding a new color to a premium handset six months after the launch would surely jog one&apos;s memory and could regain interest in the flagship. However, Samsung is bringing it right before the Galaxy foldables: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Z Flip 6</a>&apos;s launch is intriguing.</p><p>Those interested in purchasing the new Titanium Yellow colorway of the flagship would have to shell out $1299 for the 256GB variant, $1419 for the 512GB variant, and $1659 for the larger 1TB variant. Users can head over to Samsung&apos;s website to initiate the purchase of the latest colorway.</p>
