                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Here&apos;s a scenario you may have found yourself in before. You pick up a great new phone or e-reader but you can&apos;t find any cases for it. This commonly happens when you buy something from a company that&apos;s not Samsung, Google, or Apple, and seems pretty ridiculous. But I&apos;d bet my hat that Tudia makes a case for whatever device you&apos;re about to buy.</p><p>That&apos;s one of the many reasons I love Tudia. They&apos;ve got cases for every smartphone manufacturer you can think of—even more obscure ones like Blu, Nuu, or even TCL phones—plus a bevy of other devices like Kobo and Onyx Boox e-readers, heart rate monitors, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/backbone-is-releasing-a-limited-edition-call-of-duty-controller-with-in-game-perks">Backbone Gaming controllers</a>. Not only that, but they&apos;re super affordable, coming in at a fraction of what some of the other big-name case makers cost, and Prime Day on October 8, 2024, will no doubt bring a fresh wave of discounts for my new favorite cases.</p><p>Plus, unlike many other case manufacturers, Tudia&apos;s cases aren&apos;t the same boring look on every device they make. Rather, each case feels bespoke for the device, giving it a unique look and feel that does more than just protect it.</p><p>Take this Tudia case I have for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a>, for example. When I first put it on the phone, I couldn&apos;t believe how well it matched the phone&apos;s original styling and feel. This is the very definition of perfection in design, as it maintains an authenticity to the original phone&apos;s look while still providing excellent protection. </p>

<p>It&apos;s got the transparent back in view, ensuring the unique glyph LEDs are unobstructed, and even displays the prominent, darker side rails in a way that feels authentic to the original style. The company makes this style of case for all of Nothing&apos;s excellent phones, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TUDIA-Nothing-Phone-Anti-Yellowing-Semi-Transparent/dp/B0CZ3SGFRQ/">Phone 2a and 2a Plus</a>.</p><p>Unlike a bunch of other case manufacturers, Tudia&apos;s case prices are incredibly reasonable. I&apos;m talking around $20 for a case—and often less than that—plus coupons and Prime Day discounts for when Prime Day begins on October 8, 2024.</p><p>I also love that Tudia makes cases for even the most niche devices. I love my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Boox Palma</a> e-reader and would confidently call it the best e-reader ever, but finding reasonably priced cases for it, especially in the first few months after release, was surprisingly difficult.</p><p>Thankfully, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TUDIA-Reinforced-Anti-Yellowing-Transparent-Lightweight/dp/B0D2QCN22C">Tudia&apos;s Boox Palma case</a> not only comes in a range of colors and styles but is also <em>super</em> lightweight. That&apos;s incredibly important for an e-reader, as those devices are designed to be light and easy to hold for long periods of time.</p>

<p>Lightweight doesn&apos;t mean that it&apos;s not protective. In fact, I&apos;d trust this case over the official Boox case if for no other reason than that Tudia&apos;s case includes padded corners and more protective sides made of squishier TPU.</p><p>On my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a>, Tudia&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TUDIA-DualShield-MergeGrip-Shockproof-Protective/dp/B0D78NB5C8/">DualShield case</a> feels supremely sturdy in a way most cases wish they could, all without feeling like one of those obnoxious bulky cases you may have used before. Better yet, it&apos;s normally only $25, making it less than half the price of other well-built cases all while feeling better designed and made.</p><p>This one even comes in the phone&apos;s original colors, including that lovely Jade Green. Many of the company&apos;s other cases, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TUDIA-MergeGrip-Military-Shockproof-Protective/dp/B0CSFLGW13">like this one</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, even feature unique phone elements like OnePlus&apos;s camera island design. Again, all of these things make the phone you&apos;re using look more like <em>that</em> phone and not just another generic phone in a case.</p>

<p>And oh my gosh is this case ever grippy! Those raised dots on the back give it a lovely texture that&apos;s fun to rub a fingernail over when feeling fidgety.</p><p>Tudia often puts MagSafe rings inside these types of cases, too, giving you the ability to use your Android phone with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">best MagSafe accessories</a> like car chargers and magnetic wallets. So even if your phone isn&apos;t Qi2 ready, you can make it so that it uses Magnetic wireless chargers anyway.</p><p>Even if Tudia&apos;s designs are your thing, Prime Day will undoubtedly bring along some incredible deals on the phone case you&apos;ve been waiting to pick up, and it&apos;s just around the corner, too. Mark your calendars for October 8!</p>

This is a simple, single app on your phone you can use as a hub to control all Google-compatible devices, from your smart lights to your security camera, smart speaker, and even robot vacuums.</p><p>Once you have the Google Home app set up on your mobile device and have logged in via your account and added your home’s devices, you might want to add new members so they can access everything, too. It could be other members of the family, the grandparents, babysitter or dogsitter, or even a neighbor who pops in to check on your cats while you’re away. You can add up to six members to a Google Home.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-add-voice-profiles-with-voice-match"><span>How to add voice profiles with Voice Match</span></h3>
<p>If you add voice profiles for each person, everyone can call up their settings with simple voice commands. Each person, once added, can personalize the settings to their liking and with Voice Match. Then, they can use audible commands and Google will recognize it’s them. They might have their own scenes, like “game night” for dad that turns on the TV and switches the smart lights to a favorite team’s colors or “meditation evening” for grandma with classical music playing and a fireplace video on the smart display. It’s simple to add others in Google Home.</p>

<p>First, you’ll want to teach Google Assistant your own voice through Voice Match. This is essential to Google being able to recognize the multiple users once you add them.</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Google Home app</strong> on your mobile device.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Settings</strong> in the bottom menu.</p><p>3. Scroll down to <strong>Google Assistant</strong> and select.</p><p>4.

With the Galaxy S25, we expect to see Samsung further improve the overall Galaxy experience with more refinements and even better hardware.</p><p>So, what do we expect from a 2025 Galaxy S25? Big changes for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, for starters, and plenty of rumors and leaks to use to assemble the full picture of what Samsung has in store for us in the New Year.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ftKY3oDQJFypppWvFxfEbi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-s-pen-translate-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ftKY3oDQJFypppWvFxfEbi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the earliest rumors popped up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-rumored-price-increase">in October 2023</a> and directly addresses the question of price. According to the leak, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 that&apos;s likely to power the Galaxy S25 series features "astonishing levels of performance" that may require Samsung to hike the price up a bit.</p><p>Samsung has already increased the price of the Galaxy S24 Ultra by $100, making the cheapest model $1,299. The Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24 Plus didn&apos;t get a base price increase, but this rumor certainly suggests that 2024 may be the last year we see a mainline Galaxy S phone as low as $799.</p><p>We fully expect Samsung to unveil the Galaxy S25 in January 2025, as the company has been sticking to an early annual announcement cycle for a few years now.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S23 simplified the Galaxy S series&apos; design language with free-floating camera lenses, flat backs, flat displays, and rounded corners. The exception throughout that time was the Galaxy S Ultra model which, in any given year, featured more rounded side rails, square corners, and a much bigger profile than the other two models.</p><p>With the Galaxy S25, Samsung looks to be fully unifying the design language across <em>all three</em> models, including the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">leaked renders</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see from the images above, all three models look nearly identical in shape. All of them have flat sides all around, completely flat front and back glass, and rounded corners.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra&apos;s corners are a bit less rounded than the other two models and look similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a>&apos;s corners. I&apos;m personally excited for this as I wasn&apos;t a fan of the 90-degree-angle corners used on the last three models of Galaxy S Ultra phones, as I felt they dug into my palms too much when holding the phones with one hand.</p><p>All three models look to sport the same style of camera modules as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, which take on a more traditional DSLR camera lens look with ribbed edges and thicker borders. Not everyone likes this style, though, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1833535783522979869">one leaker says</a> the Galaxy S25 series could see changes from the Fold 6&apos;s camera lens design despite what the renders above show.</p>

<p>To prove the point, you might have noticed that there&apos;s no S Pen in the leaked render of the Galaxy S25 Ultra above. There&apos;s no reason to think that Samsung will abandon the S Pen on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which means this render isn&apos;t of the final product.</p><p>According <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-dimensions-leak">to another rumor</a>, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will see a size shift this year, coming in at 0.5mm shorter, 1.4mm narrower, and 0.4mm thinner than the Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Galaxy S24 Ultra dimensions: </strong>162.3 x 79.0 x 8.6 mm</li><li><strong>Leaked Galaxy S25 Ultra dimensions: </strong>162.8mm x 77.6mm x 8.2mm</li></ul>
<p>There are also rumors that the Galaxy S25 Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-thinnest-lightest-model-rumor">will be lighter</a> than "all ultra flagship phones" like the iPhone 16 Pro Max and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. That would put it under 221 grams, which means it&apos;ll at least be 12 grams lighter than the Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is rumored to be making a huge change with its camera sensors. Per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-rumored-to-use-sony-sensors">a December 2023 rumor</a>, Samsung will stop using its own ISOCELL GN3 sensors on the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus in favor of using all-Sony sensors.</p><p>While we don&apos;t know the specs for those camera sensors yet, it would mean the first time we&apos;ve seen a big camera change since the Galaxy S22. That phone swapped out the 12MP main sensor for a 50MP main sensor, but Samsung hasn&apos;t changed too much since then.</p><p>The rumor suggests that Samsung will continue to use Samsung ISOCELL sensors for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which makes sense since the Ultra line has historically utilized different sensors than the other two models.</p><p>Traditionally, Samsung seems to swap out at least one camera module (sensor and lens) per year. Samsung just updated one of the telephoto camera modules with the Galaxy S24 Ultra, so it&apos;s plausible that we could see an upgraded ultrawide or upgraded secondary telephoto lens on the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p>

<p>With the Galaxy S25 line, Samsung is expected to go all Qualcomm again <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-may-be-all-snapdragon-again-not-all-exynos">if rumors are to be believed</a>. That means every Galaxy S25 model—Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra—will use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>.</p><p>In a nutshell, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 is purported to be the biggest change to Snapdragon processors in over a decade. Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">will officially unveil</a> the new processor at October&apos;s Snapdragon Summit, but it&apos;s said this new processor utilizes the same custom Oryon cores that Qualcomm built for its very successful line of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite</a> laptop processors, meaning this should be one wicked-fast SoC.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-hits-benchmark-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4">Early benchmark leaks</a> from the OnePlus 13—which is said to be using the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4—show significant gains in performance over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the Galaxy S24 series.</p>

<p>The numbers above say just about everything there is to be said. Single-core scores are nearly identical to Apple&apos;s A18 chip in the new iPhone 16, while multicore scores put it 14% faster than Apple&apos;s best mobile chipset ever. For reference, the powerful Apple M3 processor in the latest Macbooks scores 11959 on the Geekbench multicore test, putting it only 10% faster than Qualcomm&apos;s new <em>phone</em> chipset.</p><p>That&apos;s some crazy speed!</p><p>Aside from the upgraded chipset, it doesn&apos;t look like Samsung is making too many changes in key areas for the Galaxy S25 family. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-alleged-rendering">Many rumors</a> so far point to Samsung slimming up all three models despite not changing the battery size or charging speed for any of the three models.</p><p>Samsung is said to be making the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra 0.4mm thinner, but we have no leaked specs on the smaller Galaxy S25&apos;s dimensions yet.</p><p>And battery size might not be changing but the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 inside the Galaxy S25 is rumored to power a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-flagship-phones-might-get-a-battery-boosting-ai-feature">new AI battery feature</a> that should help save 10% battery life over a day.</p>

<p>Every company seems to have at least one annual conference these days, and Meta&apos;s own event is called Meta Connect. This year&apos;s Meta Connect 2024 takes place on September 25, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg taking the stage at 10 a.m. PT to announce the latest and greatest Meta products and services.</p><p>At the show, we&apos;re expecting to see a brand-new VR headset, a pair of advanced smart glasses, and maybe even a few big game announcements thrown in for good measure. Last year, we got the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>, both of which were well-reviewed by us and many across the internet.</p><p>In fact, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses are easily the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> you can buy today, but Meta&apos;s up-and-coming pair may very well blow them out of the water. And that new headset looks to be the most affordable one yet, especially considering the rate of inflation with tech gadgets these days. Here&apos;s everything we expect to see at Meta Connect 2024.</p>

<h2 id="meta-quest-3s-2">Meta Quest 3s</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:625px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.12%;"><img id="oK4FZfptBaYL7oyeovWPgM" name="meta-quest-3s-september-leak-01.jpg" alt="Leaked images of the Meta Quest 3s from user dpxl on arca.live" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oK4FZfptBaYL7oyeovWPgM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="625" height="407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: dpxl on arca.live)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The name <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3s</a> almost seems to be referring to more than one Meta Quest 3 headset, but rumor has it that Meta&apos;s up-and-coming budget VR headset is called just that. Once known as the Meta Quest Lite, the Meta Quest 3s is supposed to pack the same processor as the powerful Meta Quest 3, all in a slightly smaller headset than a Meta Quest 2.</p><p>That means it&apos;ll be able to play Meta Quest 3-exclusive games like the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-hands-on">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> and Alien Rogue Incursion, among a bunch of other Quest 3-exclusive titles that have already been released this year. It also means that all of the games that have been visually upgraded for the Quest 3 should also have the same caliber of visuals on the Quest 3s, ensuring that even people who want to save some cash can still get the best VR games around.</p><p>While the Meta Quest 3 starts at $499, the Meta Quest 3s is said to drop that price to an impressive $299, or the same price the Oculus Quest 2 debuted at back in 2020. Given that consoles like the PlayStation 5 have seen price increases since launching in 2020, and new versions like the PS5 Pro are debuting at $700-plus, it&apos;s refreshing to see a new console—the Quest 3s—debut at the same price as one from a few years back.</p>

<p>Of course, cutting $200 off the price tag means there are concessions to be had. The Quest 3s is slated to launch with the same Fresnel (pronounced fruh-nel) lenses from the Quest 2, which are bulkier and aren&apos;t as clear as the pancake lenses in the Quest 3.</p><p>Because of the size difference, the Quest 3s will be a larger headset than the Quest 3, but, as I said before, leaks show that Meta was able to make it physically smaller than the Quest 2.</p><p>Meta also looks to be taking off the 3.5mm headset jack for the Quest 3s, which means you&apos;ll need to pick up a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Low-Latency-Connection-Compatible-Playstation/dp/B0CDH3SMDW/">PrismXR Vega T1 earbuds</a>, which are specifically designed for a Quest, if you don&apos;t want to use the onboard speakers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UkjPwMh6VnPTbfrXTZFwaZ" name="behemoth-vr-official-screenshot-giant.jpg" alt="Approaching a giant in an official screenshot from Behemoth running on PSVR 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UkjPwMh6VnPTbfrXTZFwaZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Expect big games like Behemoth to be on the new Meta Quest 3s </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Skydance Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But while those things are a downgrade, most of the rest of the Quest 3 experience seems to be intact. On top of cutting-edge graphics, the Quest 3s is said to feature color passthrough with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-v64-update-improves-passthrough-casting-and-microphones">improved clarity</a> Meta delivered on the Quest 3 a few months ago.</p><p>Quest 3s leaks note that the headset will ship with four IR tracking cameras, two 4MP color passthrough cameras, and two IR illuminators for depth sensing. Those IR illuminators could mean the headset will even work in the dark, which would be a first for any Quest headset. If you wanted to do this before, you&apos;d have to spend $20 or so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Hanpusen-Illuminator-Infrared-Accessories-Tracking/dp/B0BRHDW22C/">on an IR illuminator</a> that plugged into the headset&apos;s USB-C port.</p><p>The Quest 3s is also said to be shipping with the same controllers the Quest 3 ships with, meaning advanced haptic feedback and a significantly smaller profile when compared to the Quest 2&apos;s controllers, which featured giant tracking rings around each controller filled with LEDs.</p>
<h2 id="new-meta-horizon-headsets-2">New Meta Horizon headsets</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5yht2KykcNozwXueoxxrB8" name="Amazon-luna-and-xbox-wireless-controllers.jpeg" alt="The Amazon Luna and Xbox Wireless controllers next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5yht2KykcNozwXueoxxrB8.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Joe Maring / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Back in the Spring, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">Meta announced</a> that the operating system that powers the Quest would be licensed out to other companies to make new VR hardware. In essence, Meta Horizon OS would become the Android of VR, as companies like ASUS ROG, Lenovo, and even Microsoft Xbox would soon be making VR headsets powered by the same OS.</p><p>We&apos;re expecting to see at least one of these headsets at Meta Connect 2024, which would give us a good look at how each of them differentiates from headsets like the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3s.</p><p>Since all of them run the same operating system, Meta would likely be the one delivering the OS updates while the hardware partners would be the ones to develop new headsets. This seems to be a similar structure to Windows, where Microsoft makes an operating system that powers billions of devices worldwide and develops all the updates, but also makes its own line of Surface hardware that acts as a sort of "reference" or "pure" device for its OS vision.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Meta Horizon OS could become the Windows or Android of VR, but we'll have to wait and see which model Meta goes with when it's expected to detail things at Meta Connect 2024.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>However, depending on how Meta structures things, it could also mean that the Meta Quest line becomes the "Pixel of VR. " Google develops phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9" target="_blank">Google Pixel 9</a> while simultaneously developing the Android operating system, which runs on billions of other devices. However, unlike Microsoft, Google&apos;s build of Android isn&apos;t pushed out to devices made by other companies.</p><p>Instead, companies like Samsung take Google&apos;s code, add their own features and looks to it, and then ship that to their devices. We&apos;ll have to wait and see which format Meta goes with, and hopefully, that&apos;ll all be revealed at Meta Connect 2024.</p>

<p>We already got our hands on the upcoming Quest 3-exclusive Batman Arkham Shadow game, and while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ready-at-dawn-studios-closing">Meta just closed</a> one of its internal studios, the company still has just under a dozen other studios working diligently on other first-party games for its headsets.</p><p>In total, Meta&apos;s studios include:</p>
<ul><li>Armature Studio — Resident Evil 4 VR (2020)</li><li>Beat Games — Beat Saber (2018)</li><li>BigBox VR — Population: One (2020)</li><li>Camouflaj — Iron Man (2020`) and the upcoming Batman Arkham Shadow</li><li>Downpour Interactive — Onward (2019)</li><li>Sanzaru Games — Asgard's Wrath 2 (2023)</li><li>Twisted Pixel Games — Path of the Warrior (2019)</li><li>Unit 2 Games — likely working on Horizon Worlds content</li><li>Within — Supernatural (2020)</li></ul>
<p>As you can see from the list, the only studio that has released anything recently is Sanzaru Games with last year&apos;s superb <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/asgards-wrath-2-review">Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2</a>, which I dubbed the greatest VR game of all time. Other than that, Camouflaj has Batman this year, but we have no official confirmation of what any of the other studios are working on right now. Hopefully, that changes at Meta Connect 2024.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Meta Horizon OS announcement, I got the opportunity to interview Meta&apos;s head of AR glasses hardware, Caitlin Kalinowski. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">In the interview</a>, she discussed the upcoming Meta AR glasses product that the company has been working on for years, calling it the "OMG moment that AR needs."</p><p>While I had thought she was referring to Project Nazere in that interview, later teasers and leaks pointed to the actual reveal this year being for Project Hypernova or Project Orion, two additional AR projects in a long list of prototypes that cost the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-earnings-q1-2024">billions of dollars to develop</a> each quarter.</p><p>No matter which of the many prototypes Meta decides to show off publicly, we know the company is hard at work on the future of AR glasses, a product category CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be the "Holy Grail" of the way we interact with technology in the future.</p><p>In short, true AR glasses will house displays inside a pair of glasses that will be able to overlay digital objects onto the real world. We&apos;re already used to this with things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps-can-now-determine-your-precise-location-using-live-view-ar">Google Maps Live View</a> or even Pokemon Go, but having them on your face would make things not only a lot easier but also a lot more believable.</p>

<p>I saved this one for last because I feel like everyone is pretty tired of hearing the term "AI" this year. Meta has been pushing its AI platform out to more and more devices throughout the year, including a launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-news-recap-july-26-2024">Meta AI on the Quest</a> at the end of July and the same technology on Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses a few months before that.</p><p>Since Meta&apos;s AI platform can be injected into the company&apos;s biggest platforms—Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp—I fully expect to see them announce something new at Connect and how it can help bridge the gap between iOS, Android, Windows, and other platforms.</p>

<ul><li>The MatePad Pro 12.2 has made its global debut, with the tablet available for £699 ($925).</li><li>It has a 12.2-inch tandem OLED panel that goes up to 2000 nits and charges at 100W.</li><li>Huawei also introduced the MatePad 12 X, which costs £549 ($727).</li></ul>
<p>The iPad Pro continues to be the best overall choice if you need a high-end tablet, and the introduction of an OLED panel in the 2024 model made it that much more enticing. Of course, Samsung has been offering AMOLED panels on its Galaxy Tab S series for a while now, and Honor&apos;s MagicPad 2 sees the tech make its way to mid-range tablets.</p>
<p>Huawei joined the bandwagon at the start of the year, and is now taking things to a new level with the debut of the MatePad Pro 12.2. The tablet features a 12.2-inch PaperMatte Display with a tandem OLED, and it goes up to 2000 nits. Interestingly, the panel uses an anti-sparkle and nanoscale anti-glare etching to reduce light interference and glare.</p>

<p>Coming in at 5.5mm, the MatePad Pro 12.2 isn&apos;t quite as thin as the iPad Pro&apos;s 5.1mm, but it gets close. The tablet is available in a Golden Silk model that has a matte finish, , and the design looks elegant. On the hardware side of things, you get the Kirin 9000S, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage on the base model, and a 10100mAh battery with 100W charging tech.</p>

<p>The MatePad Pro 12.2 is now available in the U.K. for £699 ($925), and it will be heading to other countries in the region in the coming weeks. The tablet comes with the Glide Keyboard bundled in the package, and Huawei is throwing in a stylus as well — provided you order before October 22. Huawei is also debuting the MatePad 12 X, which uses an LCD panel but instead retains a similar design, and the tablet costs £549 ($727) in the U.K.</p>

<p>Huawei knows how to make great smartwatches, and with the Watch GT 5 series, the brand is setting its sights on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. The Watch GT 5 and GT 5 Pro feature new designs and sensors, and there&apos;s a golf-focused edition of the Watch Ultimate.</p><p>The standard Watch GT 5 is available in 41mm and 46mm variants, and there&apos;s a ceramic edition that looks particularly striking. Both models get AMOLED panels and are available in a range of color options and bands, and the model with the brown leather band stands out quite a bit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PkgearzJHz4idvFro7xgFh" name="watch-gt-5-pro.jpg" alt="Huawei Watch GT 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PkgearzJHz4idvFro7xgFh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The GT 5 Pro, meanwhile, is available in 42mm and 46mm sizes, and it is made out of a titanium alloy, giving it much better durability. Huawei is touting considerable upgrades to fitness and health monitoring thanks to the introduction of its TruSense System, where all the sensors are integrated into a single module. Huawei says this allows detecting heart rate, blood oxygen, and respiratory rate, and the system has new algorithms that deliver more accurate results.</p><p>Like the best smartwatches, the GT 5 Pro features an ECG mode that lets you view your ECG waveform in 30 seconds. Both smartwatches feature the Sunflower Positioning System with better tracking during various activities, and Huawei is adding Running Form Analysis as standard.</p><p>The GT 5 Pro gets two additional features; a professional trail-running feature with trail information and real-time details, and a golfing mode that gives you 3D views of course maps at 15,000 golf courses around the world.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.56%;"><img id="RUZTxRXxcymoBvKcmb6kNh" name="watch-ultimate-golf-1.jpg" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate Golf" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RUZTxRXxcymoBvKcmb6kNh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1097" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the subject of golfing, Huawei is rolling out a new variant of the Watch Ultimate that&apos;s aimed at golfers. The new model has a green colorway, a dual-tone bezel, and has the same 3D views of golf courses. What&apos;s new is an AI Caddie feature that offers recommendations on clubs to use and best landing spot. The green model of the Watch Ultimate is now on sale, and is available for £749 ($991) in the U.K.</p><p>The standard GT 5 starts at £229.99 ($303), and the GT 5 Pro is retailing at £329.99 ($435). Huawei is incentivizing the launch by bundling the Huawei FreeBuds 5i with all orders made until October 22.</p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s year-old Ultra model is encountering a few strange problems during the rollout of One UI 6.1.1.</p><p>As reiterated by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1836006630749512067">Tarun Vats on X</a>, the Galaxy S23 Ultra&apos;s camera is suffering because of the One UI 6.1.1 update.

<hr>
<p>The General Court of the European Union has scrapped a massive €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) antitrust fine that Google faced from the European Commission back in 2019. The EU had charged the search giant with using its power in the online ad space to unfairly dominate the market.</p><p>The EC said in 2019 that Google used its dominance in digital advertising to block websites from working with other ad brokers. The focus was on Google&apos;s AdSense for Search (ADS) platform, which handled search ads. According to the Commission, these anti-competitive practices took place from 2006 to 2016.</p><p>ADS allows website owners to embed ads directly into their search results. Google acts as the middleman, connecting advertisers with third-party websites to display ads through their search features.</p><p>Three months after the Commission&apos;s ruling, Google filed a legal appeal against the antitrust fine. At the same time, to avoid further penalties, the company made major changes to how Google Shopping and Android functioned within the EU.</p><p>The General Court in Luxembourg mostly agreed with the Commission’s findings in the Google case but ruled that the EC overlooked some important factors (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/google-nets-court-win-against-eus-1-7b-adsense-antitrust-decision/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>).</p><p>The judges found that the Commission made a mistake in how it assessed the length of Google&apos;s advertising contracts with publishers. They also pointed out that the Commission didn’t check if those publishers had the choice to use competing ad services besides Google&apos;s.</p><p>The Commission, with the option to appeal to the EU Court of Justice, said it will thoroughly analyze the ruling and weigh its next actions.</p><p>This landmark decision is a major win for Google in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-loses-appeal-eu-4-billion-fine">legal battles with EU regulators</a>. Additionally, this positive outcome could give the Alphabet-owned company a strong boost in its ongoing fights with the U.S. Department of Justice.</p><p>Google has been a frequent target of antitrust scrutiny in recent years, both in the EU and the United States. While this latest victory is a significant win for the company, it remains under investigation for other alleged anti-competitive practices. Last week, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-loses-eu-shopping-antitrust-case">scored significant victories against Google in a different case</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">reviewed the OnePlus Pad</a> when it came out last year, and while I liked the hardware a lot, there were plenty of issues with the software. OnePlus addressed these shortcomings via software updates in subsequent months, and the Pad became one of the best tablets in its category.</p><p>OnePlus is continuing that momentum with the Pad 2. The tablet is bigger, much more powerful, has better sound, and better connectivity. But what gives it a noticeable edge is that the software doesn&apos;t feel half-baked out of the box, and that&apos;s a refreshing change of pace.</p>

<p>The Pad 2 ditches the distinctive green color scheme, instead coming in a grey option that doesn&apos;t quite have the same design flair. That said, the build quality is fantastic, and the aluminum chassis along with curving sides and rounded edges makes the tablet comfortable to hold and use. While it is heavy at 584g, I didn&apos;t notice the heft in regular use.</p><p>Basically, the Pad 2 doesn&apos;t look or feel like a mid-range tablet, and OnePlus did a great job with the overall design. Dominating the front is a 12.1-inch LCD panel that goes up to 144Hz, and it renders Dolby Vision content. While an AMOLED panel — like the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> — would have made the tablet much more enticing, it would have raised the cost significantly, and for now, OLED screens remain the purview of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">flagship tablets</a>.</p><p>While it isn&apos;t an OLED, the LCD panel has good colors and excellent brightness figures, and the 3:2 ratio is ideal for my use case. I read a lot on tablets, and the screen is ideally suited to read books or long-form content. I&apos;m still annoyed that the Reading Mode feature found in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oxygenos">legacy OxygenOS</a> builds hasn&apos;t made its way into the ColorOS era, as that would have made a significant difference in my usage of the Pad 2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DsRMAo973WtCoMj3Yqb7Ma" name="oneplus-pad-2-4.jpg" alt="OnePlus Pad 2 home page against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsRMAo973WtCoMj3Yqb7Ma.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 12.1-inch panel is great for streaming content as well, and the upgraded audio with six drivers manages to deliver detailed sound with no distortion even at a high volume. It doesn&apos;t have the same color vibrancy as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/ipad-pro-2022-productivity">iPad Pro</a>, but it costs less than half, so for what you&apos;re ultimately paying, you are getting a good quality panel and impressive onboard sound.</p><p>I didn&apos;t see any issues with gaming either; the Pad 2 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and comes with 8GB of RAM as standard, and it runs demanding titles without any hassle. The panel technically goes up to 144Hz, but that&apos;s just marketing; in regular use, it won&apos;t cross 120Hz, and like every other device running OxygenOS, games are limited to 60fps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MSpFLNH76MAz4KkHwyNUDa" name="oneplus-pad-2-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus Pad 2 keyboard accessory" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MSpFLNH76MAz4KkHwyNUDa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, there&apos;s no lag or jitter in visually-intensive games, and the Pad 2 does all the right things when it comes to the performance. Battery life is similarly great, and the Pad 2 easily offers ten hours of video playback between charges. The tablet charges at 67W, and a full charge takes under an hour — that&apos;s better than just about every other device in the mid-range segment.</p><p>Most Android tablets have great hardware, but it&apos;s the software that continues to be the differentiator, and there is a lot to like in this area on the Pad 2. The tablet runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-oxygenos-14-android-14-hands-on">OxygenOS 14.1</a> based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and you&apos;ll find the usual tablet-focused additions that maximize the real estate, including a dock, split notification pane, tabbed browsing, and two-pane view in Gmail and messaging clients.</p>
<p>But what I like the most about the tablet is Open Canvas multitasking; the mode lets you have up to three windows side-by-side, and it is effortless to use. The software itself is fluid in daily use, I didn&apos;t run into any bugs in the month I used the Pad 2, and it&apos;s a much better showing than last year. The tablet will pick up four Android OS updates, and while it won&apos;t get updates anywhere as quickly as OnePlus phones, it will make the switch to Android 18 when that becomes available.</p><p>Sure, there are a few omissions; you don&apos;t get biometric authentication, there&apos;s no vibration motor, and the Pad 2 misses out on a MicroSD slot. These are inconveniences, but they don&apos;t ultimately hinder the use of the tablet, and the caliber of the hardware more than makes up for the omissions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FtyN6zA3XTxzign7yKn49f" name="oneplus-pad-2-stylo-2-notes-app.jpg" alt="OnePlus Pad 2 with Notes app open and Stylo 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FtyN6zA3XTxzign7yKn49f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus did a good job with the accessories as well, and the Stylo 2 is much better. The stylus has a textured finish that feels great, and it has increased pressure sensitivity, making it a good choice if you want to take notes or sketch. I&apos;m not as fond of the Smart Keyboard; it uses a detachable design this time, and the means the kickstand is integrated into the back cover, and that makes it fiddly to use.</p><p>While the keys are better than last year, there&apos;s still no backlighting, and the detachable design just isn&apos;t convenient to use. Unlike the iPad, you don&apos;t get anywhere as much in the way of external accessories with the Pad 2, and that means you&apos;re limited to the Smart Keyboard if you need a keyboard accessory.</p><p>Android tablets have seen a resurgence in the last two years, and there&apos;s a decent amount of choice if you need a budget or mid-range device. Coming in at $499 for the 12GB/256GB variant, the OnePlus Pad 2 is one of the most powerful options you can buy in this category, and it has a terrific screen, detailed sound, top-notch hardware that&apos;s great for gaming, and standout battery life.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>TerraMaster continues to have a major presence in the NAS category, and while its servers offer decent hardware and a good value, they don&apos;t have anywhere close to the same sales volume as larger brands. The Taiwanese brand is now looking to change that with its 2024 selection; products like the F4-424 Max and F6-424 Max have much better designs, significantly upgraded hardware, and 10GbE connectivity as standard.</p><p>But it&apos;s the F8 SSD Plus that stood out the most. Unlike the other products, the F8 SSD Plus is an all-flash NAS; it doesn&apos;t have 3.5-inch drive bays, instead offering just M.2 slots. The NVMe segment is at a point where you can get high-density SSDs for not a lot of cash — the 2TB WD SN770 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-SN770-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B09QV5KJHV">available for $118</a> — and that makes M.2 SSDs a viable alternative in NAS servers.</p><p>I put this to the test with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ugreen-dxp480t-plus-review">UGREEN&apos;s DXP480T Plus</a> earlier in the year, and while that particular model didn&apos;t have much in the way of software, the hardware was seriously impressive. Switching to an all-flash NAS comes with considerable advantages; you get significantly faster transfers, and much better long-term reliability as M.2 drives don&apos;t have any moving parts.</p><p>Pricing has always been the biggest barrier in this segment, and TerraMaster is addressing that with the F8 SSD Plus. The all-flash NAS server is available for $799, and while that costs more then the brand&apos;s traditional NAS offerings, it comes with much better hardware. I used the F8 SSD Plus for a week, and I think this is the best overall option currently available if you&apos;re ready to switch to an all-flash NAS.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eJVg2djigoqNSTtj6DaPLW" name="terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-10.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus internals next to external casing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eJVg2djigoqNSTtj6DaPLW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TerraMaster introduced the F8 SSD Plus on September 19, and the NAS server is now available globally. The 8-bay NAS server <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F8-SSD-Plus-NAS/dp/B0D9HWLDX5">retails for $799 on Amazon</a>, but TerraMaster is incentivizing the launch with a $100 discount, bringing the cost down to $699.</p><p>There&apos;s also a standard model of the F8 SSD that has the same design, same eight M.2 slots, and 10GbE connectivity, but it is powered by the Intel N95, and comes with 8GB of pre-installed memory. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F8-SSD-Plus-NAS/dp/B0D9HWLDX5">model costs $599 on Amazon</a>, and again, you get a $100 discount, bringing it down to $499.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-design"><span>TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eqXWNTysQbC7cyBpB2THdS" name="terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-3.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus side view with logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eqXWNTysQbC7cyBpB2THdS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The F8 SSD Plus doesn&apos;t look like like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f4-423-review">F4-423</a> or any other TerraMaster NAS, and that&apos;s understandable considering it doesn&apos;t have any 3.5-inch drive bays. What immediately stands out about the design is the size; the F8 SSD Plus is roughly the size of a traditional single-bay NAS server, but it accommodates eight M.2 SSD drives, and that&apos;s a sizeable achievement in and of itself.</p><p>The NAS doesn&apos;t take up much room at all, and the generic design means it easily blends into the background — it doesn&apos;t have the same presence as UGREEN&apos;s NAS servers. That&apos;s not a bad thing necessarily as most users will slot the NAS into a cabinet anyway.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="95qcGD2ZBnxWQ4Xh2QvHmT" name="terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-4.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus vents act as passive cooling" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/95qcGD2ZBnxWQ4Xh2QvHmT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get the TerraMaster logo on the sides of the NAS, and the top has a vented design that acts as the exhaust; there are dual fans located at the bottom that provide active cooling to the innards. The rubber feet at the bottom ensure the NAS stays upright, and the build quality is decent enough. There&apos;s a power button at the top that lets you power on the NAS, and besides that, you don&apos;t get any buttons.</p><p>What I like the most about the design is the tool-less installation of the M.2 drives; the entire enclosure slides up and is held in place by a single thumb screw, and you can easily add M.2 drives as needed. TerraMaster did a great job with the accessories as well, and you get eight heatsinks, thermal pads, and elastic bands to attach to M.2 drives.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fbg6ceoKxzCdob3TmJ9v6S" name="terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-2.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus next to power cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fbg6ceoKxzCdob3TmJ9v6S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because of the diminutive size of the chassis, you can&apos;t really use SSDs with bundled heatsinks — I tried — so the inclusion of heatsinks with the package is a welcome touch. The only issue I have with the design is that the F8 SSD Plus has a plastic chassis; an aluminum design would have been preferable in this situation, and considering TerraMaster goes this route with most of its mid-range NAS servers anyway, I don&apos;t quite understand why it didn&apos;t do so with this NAS.</p><p>Other than that, there are no issues with the product in this regard. The small chassis combined with eight drive slots gives the NAS a notable advantage over its rivals, and TerraMaster deserves credit for the overall design.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-ports-and-connectivity"><span>TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus: Ports and connectivity</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mWuDDnmYcizJbKsL7GZAnS" name="terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-5.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus back showing ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mWuDDnmYcizJbKsL7GZAnS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TerraMaster is known for delivering great hardware, and that&apos;s true of the F8 SSD Plus as well. The NAS has 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity as standard, and you get an HDMI port. While I would have liked dual 10GbE ports — that would have made the NAS much more enticing — I understand why the brand decided to offer just one on the NAS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zGzd6BrBVxU4wpQwNgBMwS" name="terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-6.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus has three USB ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGzd6BrBVxU4wpQwNgBMwS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are two USB-A ports and a single USB-C port, and all three are based on the USB 3.2 Gen 2 standard and offer 10Gbps bandwidth. I would have liked Thunderbolt 4 connectivity; the NAS is aimed at content creators, and the inclusion of Thunderbolt 4 would unlock a suite of new use cases.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jtokTe8csoVgwLjzcRPXBT" name="terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-7.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus with 10GbE port and HDMI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jtokTe8csoVgwLjzcRPXBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching to the innards, the F8 SSD Plus comes with 16GB of DDR5 RAM out of the box, and it is slotted into one of the dual SO-DIMM slots available on the motherboard. You can add another 16GB module if you need to increase system memory, and it&apos;s relatively easy to do so.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SwrdrFxtEwhfNnM3XX7e9U" name="terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-12.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus M.2 slots with WD SN770 SSDs installed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SwrdrFxtEwhfNnM3XX7e9U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the M.2 connectors, you get four M.2 2280 slots on either side of the motherboard, with each slot able to accommodate up to an 8TB drive, giving you a total of 64TB of addressable storage. The fans at the bottom are positioned in such a way that they do an effective job cooling the drives.</p>

<p>The active cooling combined with the provided heatsinks ensure the drives don&apos;t overheat, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in this area in the week I used the NAS. There isn&apos;t much in the way of audible noise either, and you can easily change the behavior of the fans within the TOS 6 software.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hGTjTAeBiP3CsLYLzfiMqV" name="terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-14.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus internal housing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hGTjTAeBiP3CsLYLzfiMqV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The F8 SSD Plus is powered by the Intel i3-N305 platform, and it is much more powerful than the Celeron N5105 that&apos;s present on models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/asustor-nimbustor-2-gen2-as5402t-review">ASUSTOR AS5402T</a>. The N305 has eight cores and eight threads, goes up to 3.80GHz, and you get hardware transcoding, which is great if you&apos;re eyeing the NAS as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">powerful Plex NAS server</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fTqNu9Saw95W92y7qarUyU" name="terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-11.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus M.2 slots with WD SN770 SSD installed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fTqNu9Saw95W92y7qarUyU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used four 2TB WD SN770 Gen 4 drives, and frankly, they&apos;re overkill in this scenario. As the M.2 slots on the NAS use a Gen 3 interface, you&apos;re better off picking up something like the Crucial P3 instead; I use it in my gaming machine, and it is great as a storage drive. The best part is that it is much more affordable than Gen 4 options; the 4TB P3 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-PCIe-NAND-NVMe-3500MB/dp/B0B25P44CL">available for just $225</a>, making it the ideal choice to use in the NAS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2156px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.72%;"><img id="iaCFaWJWXzzLVT9tnAnFZD" name="f8-ssd-2.jpg" alt="TOS 6 software on the TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iaCFaWJWXzzLVT9tnAnFZD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2156" height="1266" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TerraMaster overhauled its software last year, and TOS 6 has a cleaner interface. There&apos;s now a dock that sits up top, and you can access all installed packages, control system settings, and set up container management. There&apos;s a native Plex client, and while TOS 6 doesn&apos;t have anywhere close to the same number of utilities as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/synology-dsm-7-review">DSM 7.1</a>, you can spin up containers via Docker.</p>

<p>The software still has its share of quirks; when setting up the NAS, you&apos;re asked to verify your email so that you can reset the user account should you need to. This needs a one-time code that&apos;s sent to the email, but that never showed up, and I wasn&apos;t able to set it up after initial configuration.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.57%;"><img id="R3FEecEqii79QXrY9JgDTD" name="f8-ssd-3.jpg" alt="TOS 6 software on the TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R3FEecEqii79QXrY9JgDTD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2160" height="1222" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the interface is fluid and there aren&apos;t any issues with slowdowns. The increased power makes the NAS a decent choice as a VM server, something that isn&apos;t the case with most traditional HDD servers in this segment. The best part is that you can install TrueNAS on the NAS if you&apos;re used to its feature-set.</p><p>The use of M.2 drives exclusively combined with 10GbE connectivity makes this one of the best NAS servers around if you need to move a lot of data regularly. It&apos;s much better with productivity-focused tasks that involve a lot of random reads as well.</p>

<p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ugreen-dxp480t-plus-review">reviewed UGREEN&apos;s DXP480T Plus NAS</a> earlier in the year, and it is one of the best options in this category. The NAS has even better hardware thanks to Intel&apos;s Core i5 1235U, and you get dual Thunderbolt 4 ports along with 10GbE connectivity, and a metal chassis that looks elegant. The main issue is that you get just four M.2 slots, 8GB of memory installed out of the box, and the software just doesn&apos;t have as many features even now. And <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ugreen.com/collections/nas-storage/products/ugreen-nasync-dxp480t-plus-nas-storage">coming in at $999</a>, the DXP480T Plus is costlier.</p><p>ASUSTOR has the Flashstor 12 Pro (FS6712X), and while it has 12 M.2 slots and 10GbE connectivity, it isn&apos;t nearly as powerful as the F8 SSD Plus, and you just get 4GB of RAM out of the box. That said, it is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Asustor-Flashstor-Pro-FS6712X-Quad-Core/dp/B0BZCMV1QD">decent choice at $799</a> if you want plenty of M.2 slots and don&apos;t necessarily need the best hardware.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're ready to switch to all-flash storage</li><li>You need plenty of M.2 slots</li><li>You want powerful hardware and 16GB memory</li><li>You want a high-end Plex NAS that doubles as a VM server</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best software</li><li>You need Thunderbolt 4 connectivity</li></ul>
<p>The F8 SSD Plus is the best showcase yet of an all-flash NAS, and the fact that you get eight M.2 slots in such a small package is a big deal in and of itself. TerraMaster nailed the hardware part, and the N305 combined with 16GB of RAM and 10GbE connectivity ensures you can take full advantage of the increased bandwidth available with M.2 storage.</p><p>The NAS is aimed at enthusiasts and content creators, and what I like the most is that it doesn&apos;t cost as much as its rivals while still providing one of the best hardware packages in this segment. If you&apos;re ready to make the switch to an all-flash NAS and want a server with plenty of M.2 slots and powerful hardware, the F8 SSD Plus gets my recommendation.</p>
