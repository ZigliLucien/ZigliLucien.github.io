<ul><li>Google posted on Reddit that old and new Android 15 users can start downloading the software's QPR1 Beta 1 build.</li><li>The patch reportedly weighs around 490MB, though Google doesn't state the specifics behind everything users are downloading.</li><li>The company rolled out its final Android 15 beta build earlier this August, leaving users to speculate that a full release could happen in September.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Time to get excited. Google is rolling out the first QPR beta test for its Android 15 software to enrolled testers.</p><p>The company posted its announcement for the arrival of Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1eyqjlx/android_15_qpr1_beta_1_now_available/">on Reddit</a>, alerting users to the enrollment period. Google states users with a Pixel 6 series, Pixel 7 series, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 series</a> device can begin signing up. The QPR&apos;s beta extends to the Pixel Tablet and the original Pixel Fold.</p><p>The post reminds users that if they were a part of the Android 15 beta, and <em>did not</em> opt-out, they will automatically receive this OTA update.</p><p>Users getting into things will find the QPR1 Beta 1 build listed as version <strong>AP41.240726.009</strong>. Moreover, Google states the download includes its recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-august-2024-update">August 2024 security patch</a>, which solved an alarming reboot problem. Users are already picking up the update and say the build is around 490 to 500MB.</p><p>Google didn&apos;t get into the nitty-gritty of what this first QPR beta entails. However, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes-qpr1">detailed a few things</a> users should be aware of:</p>
<ul><li>This release might have various stability, battery, or performance issues.</li><li>For users with accessibility needs, this release might not be appropriate for daily use.</li><li>Some apps might not function as expected when running on this release. This limitation includes Google's apps as well as other apps.</li></ul>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1eyqjlx/android_15_qpr1_beta_1_now_available">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>If you&apos;re not in the beta, Google has published a page packed with the appropriate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/get-qpr1">Android 15 QPR beta builds</a>.</p><p>This QPR1 Beta 1 builds off the stable version of Android 15, which might seem odd considering we don&apos;t have it yet. Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/final-android-15-beta-4-2-rollout">the final beta test</a> for its next major OS earlier this month. The patch minor patch was fairly minor as the company implemented a few fixes for issues that caused UI flickering, a YouTube app crash, and more.</p><p>Additionally, with the beta final update already in our hands, speculation suggests September could hold the full release. Google has worked to bring a few new features to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> alongside better optimization for a better system experience.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-it-mean-if-both-google-and-samsungs-android-15-updates-are-delayed">Google and Samsung&apos;s Android 15 delays</a> have concerned plenty of long-time Android fans. The timing is especially odd, as Google chose to release the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> months earlier than usual but didn&apos;t have Android 15 ready, so it launched with last year&apos;s Android 14. Perhaps this beta test on post-stable software is a good sign.</p><p>While we&apos;ve yet to test the QPR1 Beta 1 ourselves yet, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/22/android-15-qpr1-beta-1-everything-new/">9to5Google</a> has spotted a long-press Quick Settings tile and a new loading indicator.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out a new Windows app called Essentials, which bundles its services into one handy spot. It also offers quick access to a full range of other Google services that you can download whenever you need them.</p><p>Google’s new app is basically a way of getting all its services into one place. It’s part of the search giant&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-chrome-windows-arm-optimization-rollout">plan to win over more Windows users</a> and spread its reach.</p><p>The company revealed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/google-essentials-windows-pcs/" target="_blank">blog post</a> that the Essentials app will come preloaded on a bunch of upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-laptop">Windows laptops</a>, starting with HP.</p><p>HP is set to roll out Google Essentials on its lineup of computers, including Envy, Pavilion, and Omen models. Google highlights how handy Essentials will be but also makes it clear that you can uninstall any of its services or the whole app if you want.</p><p>The Essentials app will act as a hub, letting you access various Google services right from your PC’s start menu. For example, you’ll be able to browse <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> and chat through Google Messages without leaving the app.</p><p>Google hasn’t revealed all the apps that Essentials will support yet, but its promo shows icons for Google Sheets, Drive, Quick Share, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a>.</p>

<p>Essentials will also give you quick web shortcuts to Google’s productivity tools, like Docs, Drive, and Calendar. Plus, eligible Google One users will get a free two-month trial of 100GB of cloud storage.</p><p>Essentials also includes Google Play Games, letting you download and play <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">popular Android games</a> like Clash of Clans right on your PC. You can access these games through Essentials or the HP Omen Gaming Hub and sync your game progress with your Android devices.</p><p>Although the Essentials app will initially be exclusively available for HP devices, Google plans to roll it out to more brands in the coming months.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s satellite SOS emergency feature on the Pixel 9 is available now. Testing it would actually trigger an emergency response, but you can (and should) see how it works with Google&apos;s interactive demo.</p><p>Pixel 9 owners can head into <strong>Settings > Safety & emergency > Satellite SOS</strong>. You can then tap the "Try a demo" button. For this demo, your device will skip all of the usual on-screen questions while also shutting off your mobile, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connections. The questions involve crucial bits of information like how many people are lost, how long have you been lost, and the nature of your emergency.</p><p>The company states that users can message and share their location with authorities to seek help.</p><p>To get started, users are met with a fun graphic instructing them where they should turn to be in line with a nearby satellite. The more you turn and approach the right angle, the more the satellite&apos;s graphic will shift until it&apos;s in the center of your screen. Users are advised to remain outside and in clear view of the sky until this process is completed.</p><p>Once the graphic shines green, keep your phone still until it has established a stable connection. After, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> will automatically submit the answers to the on-screen questions (if this were a real scenario) to the Garmin Response Team. It may take a moment, but someone from your team should respond with some more follow-up questions.</p><p>After enough is received, they will then dispatch 911 to your location.</p>

<p>In a real scenario, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z7GuHsiV5s&ab_channel=GoogleHelp">Google states</a> that after your initial contact with emergency services and you still need help, users should tap "yes, I still need help." This option will appear during the "End Satellite SOS?" screen. The company states that tapping "no" will end communications and call off the authorities.</p><p>Additionally, the feature&apos;s page in Settings will state that users <em>must </em>set Google Messages are their default SMS app. It adds that Satellite SOS is included with your device for free for two years. Google has not stated what such pricing will look like after this period ends.</p><p>Google&apos;s Satellite SOS feature on the Pixel 9 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> helps users feel like they&apos;re never truly alone, especially in critical moments. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-satellite-sos-explained">How it works</a> seems reminiscent of Apple&apos;s version; however, Google leverages tech from Skylo and Garmin to get things going. Skylo handles the sending, receiving, and routing side of the Pixel 9&apos;s SOS function to users, connecting your phone to the satellite.</p><p>Garmin&apos;s involvement brings its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15311420?sid=ac-us-1263994775969339572&url=https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/corporate/garmin-announces-support-of-new-satellite-sos-on-google-pixel-smartphones/">24/7 Response Team</a> into things as they work to locate where you are using the information from Skylo&apos;s side.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola is ramping up its teaser engine, bringing awareness to an upcoming launch of what could be a mid-range smartphone.</p><p>Motorola posted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Moto/status/1825925883670221193">short video on X</a> that takes users through an assortment of colors. Aside from the aesthetics, Motorola&apos;s video continuously teases two things: Lytia and Pantone. The latter references a company Motorola has leaned on for colors for various devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-special-edition-peach-fuzz-color">Razr Plus and the Edge 40 Neo</a>.</p><p>The teaser clip may have clued us into at least two colors we might expect: Peach Fuzz and Latte. Then there&apos;s "Lytia," which references the mobile imaging sensor within the device.</p><p>The post&apos;s teaser states Moto is gearing up for a launch on August 29, but doesn&apos;t spill the name.</p><p>However, we may have an inkling, as a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/moto-edge-50-neo-launch-imminent-new-renders-leaked/">YTECHB</a> suggests the device in question is the midrange Moto Edge 50 Neo (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/new-motorola-phone-launching-globally-august-29th/">91Mobiles</a>). According to a Ukrainian listing, the phone may arrive with a 6.4-inch POLED, 120Hz refresh rate display. Internally, Moto may pack MediaTek&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">Dimensity 7300</a> SoC alongside Android 14.</p><p>Other alleged specifications include a 50MP primary lens, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 10MP telephoto camera. The publication reportedly picked up on another listing from Hungary, which claims the device will arrive in four colors: Nautical Blue, Latte, Poinciana, and Grisaille.</p>

<p>If this device is the next iteration of Moto&apos;s Neo, it will offer a slight upgrade in terms of photography. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-40-launch">Edge 40 Neo</a> launched with a vertical, dual sensor array on its rear panel with a 50MP primary lens and a 13MP ultrawide lens. This year&apos;s rumors claim that a new telephoto will join the fray, turning things into a triple configuration.</p><p>Elsewhere, the device&apos;s display may shrink to 6.4 inches instead of continuing with its predecessor&apos;s 6.5-inch screen. There&apos;s also the fact that Motorola launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/we/smartphones-motorola-edge-40-neo/p?skuId=539">Edge 40 Neo</a> in mid-September last year, meaning an August 29 debut of the next version (sort of) makes sense.</p><p>Motorola launched another mid-range earlier this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-pro-announced-in-india">the Edge 50 Pro</a> with a passable 4,500mAh battery and a 6.7-inch display. The phone features Qualcomm&apos;s 2023 mid-range specific <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phone/snapdragon-7-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 3</a> SoC with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p>

<p>E3 used to be a mythical event that took place every June, acting as the beacon for what to look forward to in video game releases for the rest of the year (and beyond). But now that E3 is dead and gone, Gamescom is the new E3 and I got to check out 11 new Meta Quest games that made an appearance at the show.</p><p>While the lineup featured several games from established genres — including VR favorites like shooters and rhythm games — most of them are trying something new to set themselves apart from the pack. Last week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vendetta-forever-superhot-vr-spiritual-successor">I got a look at Vendetta Forever</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-weekly-news-roundup-august-16-2024">VR Gaming Showcase</a> debuted a ton of new games just the day after.</p><p>Now, I&apos;m picking out my favorite games from the show, including new titles from Combat Waffle Studios, Fast Travel Games, Beyond Frames Entertainment, and Virtual Age. Many of these games are very early still and lack the polish you&apos;ll find closer to release, but that didn&apos;t cage my excitement to get my hands on something new and fun.</p>
<h2 id="survival-games-hit-the-big-time-2">Survival games hit the big time</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3DwgXn6Iw8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Combat Waffle Studios, the makers of Ghosts of Tabor, are back with two brand-new survival games that are being shown off in early form at Gamescom 2024. While I got to try the zombie-themed Silent North, the game was a bit on the early side and I&apos;d rather not set expectations at this point. However, I was also given access to Combat Waffle Studios&apos; other game, Grim.</p><p>Grim can be best described as Valheim on Mars with guns. Maybe just Total Recall: The Game, then. The test server I joined featured a cap of 40 players at once, all of whom were given a large dome to build in. Inside of these domes, the atmosphere is a lot like Earth. Green grass, tall trees, and even roaming deer are ripe for the harvest.</p><p>Crafting is similar to Valheim in that you&apos;ll need to use tools to smash resources readily found in the environment — you start with a large rock you&apos;ll hold with two hands that can be used to smash trees or rocks. Once you&apos;ve accumulated enough of the required resources, you can craft using a simple menu system that looks straight out of Valheim. Each piece even takes a few seconds to craft, too.</p><p>You can also use resources to build out a base inside your dome, starting with the foundation and moving on to walls, beds, and other niceties to make it feel like home.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Grim feels like part Valheim, part Total Recall as you are tasked to survive on Mars alongside other humans who can kill you whenever they want.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But instead of a never-ending sprawling landscape of ripe resources, your dome will eventually run out of things to collect, and that&apos;s where the real fun begins. Grim is a PvPvE game that encourages players to venture out onto the rocky Mars landscape in search of other players&apos; domes and their selection of resources.</p><p>Since this is a server, your dome and everything inside of it is persistent between play sessions. Day and night cycles ensure you feel like you&apos;re on an actual planet, and there&apos;s even a subterranean section to explore.</p><p>Given the scope of the show floor demo, my encounters with other players were very limited, but the game&apos;s design, complete with the freshness of being on another planet, got me looking forward to how the game will feel in a more final form.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/geEXM3hltr8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I also got to give Bootstrap Island a try, although this demo was running on Steam on a PC, and it was streamed to Meta Quest 3. While this one will eventually see a Quest release, it&apos;s primarily being developed for PCVR headsets and can even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942110/Bootstrap_Island/">be purchased now</a> in early access.</p><p>In a nutshell, Bootstrap Island is Robinson Crusoe in video game form. You&apos;re shipwrecked on a tropical archipelago filled with picturesque vistas and a giant, looming active volcano on the main island.</p><p>What I really loved about this game is that there&apos;s no handholding at all. As you make your way from the beach to the main island, a narrator voices thoughts out loud, making you wonder if this is a narrated adventure or if you&apos;re just going a little bit mad.</p><p>I instinctively understood that the first thing I should do is build a fire. After putzing around for a while trying to figure out how to do this, I realized that stacking some wood, bringing over palm frond tinder, and striking two rocks next to this pile would produce a flame. It happened just in time, too, as frightening beasts appeared out of the dark and proceeded to circle my campfire the entire night. I didn&apos;t exactly get much sleep.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Bootstrap Island is Robinson Crusoe in video game form, bringing roguelike elements to island survival in a unique way.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The visuals are truly stunning, something I don&apos;t expect in the age of most VR games being built for mobile chipsets, and gameplay is as realistic as it can get without being mundane. I survived for four nights before calling it quits, each night haunting me more than the last. There are very real dangers on the island, and the erupting volcano isn&apos;t the one that&apos;ll kill you first.</p><p>Even more interestingly is that Bootstrap Island is a roguelike game, which means progress made carries through each death and directly benefits subsequent playthroughs. This is one I&apos;ll absolutely be sinking a few more hours into.</p>
<h2 id="rhythm-games-with-a-new-twist-2">Rhythm games with a new twist</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zvkj_RpkPKc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Two rhythm games stood out to me in a way that few have since Pistol Whip or Beat Saber, but for two very different reasons. First up is Band Space, a new take on the classic "Rock Band" game series from a decade or so ago. Like that game, each player will play a different musical instrument, hopefully playing in unison to create a beautiful song for an onlooking crowd.</p><p>But unlike Rock Band, you won&apos;t need expensive bespoke instrument controllers — just your Meta Quest headset and its controllers. Jumping in is fast and easy, just tap quick play and a matchmaking service will pair you up with anyone currently ready to play.</p><p>From there, you&apos;ll select from the available list of instruments to play: guitar, bass, keyboard, or drums. Keyboard was my favorite of the four as it feels very different from any other rhythm game I&apos;ve played in the past, giving you a full piano worth of keys to play music from.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Playing live music with other people is one of the most unique aspects of Band Space.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Thankfully, for someone who isn&apos;t well-versed in playing a real piano, normal skill levels allow you to put your hands in the general area of a key and press them to play. You&apos;ll sometimes hold keys for a few seconds or even slide across the row to move to different notes without letting go.</p><p>Even if I wasn&apos;t particularly great at playing the piano (or drums, as I also tried) yet, there&apos;s a very specific level of pure joy that comes with playing music with other people. You can walk around the stage before and after — after the song finishes being the celebratory portion — and being able to chat with, give high fives, and generally vibe with the other humans on the stage wearing headsets was nothing short of brilliant. It&apos;s also something no other VR rhythm game offers at the moment.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t familiar with any of the songs in the game which, for me, was actually a nice change of pace. I get bored when rhythm games include only songs I already know, although I do hope that future DLC includes some more well-known bands just for the fun of it.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9MZGaYETSU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The second rhythm game that caught my eye was The New Salsa Academy, a game that goes beyond typical rhythm game mechanics in an aim to actually teach you <em>how</em> to dance Salsa.</p><p>Once you get past the two intro levels, the game shifts focus and allows you to use a mixed-reality mode to really get the feel for the dance. As my colleague Derrek Lee previously wrote in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zumba-fitxr-makes-fitness-fun">his piece about Zumba VR</a>, mixed reality helps you feel more confident because you can actually see your surroundings while wearing a VR headset.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t want to learn a new dance if I couldn&apos;t see the walls or furniture I might potentially bump into, and The New Salsa Academy did a brilliant job of using this tech to encourage me to branch out and try something new. Best yet, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/7386321584720513/">it&apos;s available right now</a> in early access on Meta Quest.</p>
<h2 id="finding-neverland-2">Finding Neverland</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-JZlU43UkA4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Among the games I didn&apos;t necessarily expect to like was Escaping Wonderland. I never played <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/2476104599150595/">Down the Rabbit Hole</a>, the prequel to Escaping Wonderland, but now I&apos;m fully convinced it&apos;s time to give that game a shot.</p><p>Escaping Wonderland can be best described as a clever fusion of adventure games and puzzlers, all wrapped in a fascinating diorama-sized world. You control Molly, a girl who has once again found herself in the Underland sometime before the events in Lewis Carroll&apos;s Alice in Wonderland books.</p><p>As you might imagine from something that uses a classic literary backdrop, Escaping Wonderland is a fully voiced, heavily story- and character-centric tale that&apos;s safe for everyone in the family. But don&apos;t take that as meaning this was "made for kids." The story and the game&apos;s puzzles and scenarios are just as fun for adults to explore.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Escaping Wonderland can be best described as a clever fusion of adventure game and puzzler, all wrapped in a fascinating diorama-sized world.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As I said previously, the entire world is diorama-sized, which means you&apos;ll control an action figure-sized Molly. The trick here is that the entire world is designed to fit around the edges of a giant vertical rabbit hole, so you&apos;ll start at the bottom and slowly make your way to the top as you progress through the story.</p><p>Just as is the case on games with a similar scale — like Moss — you can move around in space freely, look anywhere, and even interact with elements to help Molly in her adventures. Some puzzles might require you to move staircases so Molly can climb, while other puzzles actually put you in Molly&apos;s shoes and have to be solved in first person.</p><p>It&apos;s purely delightful, and my 20-minute demo gave me enough of a tease that I can&apos;t wait to see what&apos;s next in the intriguing tale.</p>

<p>While we&apos;re waiting to see if we&apos;ll ever get a sequel to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review">Assassin&apos;s Creed Nexus VR</a>, another studio is hard at work on its own vision of a VR version of the classic Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Ember Souls isn&apos;t officially associated with the Prince of Persia series but there&apos;s little doubt at the influence you&apos;ll find here.</p><p>My three-section demo started with the intro to the game where you arrive by boat to a massive, elegant Persian castle. After a brief dialog with a talking hawk, I bounded up the side of the building and into the antechamber of a side room.</p><p>Parkour and climbing aren&apos;t free-roaming as it was in Assassin&apos;s Creed Nexus — these levels are more linear in the style of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time — but there are plenty of similarities to basic mechanics between the games. Climbing is effortless and can be done by any of the bricks jutting out of walls. You can also swing from flagpoles, each swing peppered by a dramatic slow-motion time dilation.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>From the parkour to the time-stopping elements and even the combat, Ember Souls aims to be the Price of Persia VR we've wanted.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Combat in the demo wasn&apos;t anything particularly special, but that&apos;s fine by me, so long as the final game doesn&apos;t necessarily focus on these kinds of encounters. Halfway through the demo I was introduced to the game&apos;s stealth mechanics which give me hope that players can choose to dispatch enemies in more ways than pure swordplay.</p><p>One of the coolest mechanics is a grappling hook that allows you to reach and pull yourself to any grabbable surface. In many ways, it feels identical to Half-Life: Alyx&apos;s gravity gloves, except in reverse since you&apos;re pulling yourself toward an object rather than the other way around.</p><p>It was a great preview for what I&apos;m hoping is a brilliant adventure when it&apos;s scheduled to launch later this year.</p><p>And thankfully, most of the games I previewed are coming out this year, although I expect Grim and Silent North to be in Early Access for a few months before they&apos;re considered "finished." Keep an eye out for them on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> list!</p>

Something about the simplicity of the carrier&apos;s offers is refreshing in the bloated world of complicated trade-in terms and eligibility requirements, even if the company&apos;s buy-in-bulk system isn&apos;t for everyone. </p><p>And then, of course, there&apos;s the free wireless. For a limited time, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/free/"><strong>T-Mobile-owned MVNO will give you up to </strong><em><strong>four free lines</strong></em></a> when you add a line and switch from AT&T or Verizon. Just sign up for one of Mint&apos;s three-month data plans with a single upfront payment of $45, and the carrier will hook you up with four identical lines for free. In other words, you&apos;re looking at three months of <strong>five total lines</strong> for what amounts to $15 per month. But again, the catch is that you need to be switching from Verizon or AT&T.</p>

<p>Ready to leave your Big Three carrier? Switch to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a> from AT&T or Verizon and the T-Mobile-powered MVNO will hook you up with <strong>four free lines</strong> when you sign up for any three-month data plan. Since all of Mint's plans start at $15 per month for new customers, your entire family could be enjoying three months of unlimited data on the world's largest 5G network for a single upfront payment of $45. Compare that to your current phone bill and tell me that isn't an amazing offer. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/free/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ae6fbea7-b5b0-4c4f-9d66-479577a14114" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Buy one plan, get four plans FREE when you switch from Verizon or AT&amp;T" data-dimension48="Buy one plan, get four plans FREE when you switch from Verizon or AT&amp;T">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re an AT&T or Verizon customer and you&apos;re ready to switch carriers; you&apos;re looking for a wireless deal that will cover the whole family; you live in an area with good T-Mobile coverage. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re locked into a device contract; you&apos;re happy with your current phone bill; you don&apos;t want to commit to three months with a single carrier.</p><p>Mint Mobile ranks among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carriers</a> due in part to its simplicity and speedy T-Mobile coverage. Its also interesting in the sense that you have to pay for your wireless in three, six, or 12-month increments of time, but you&apos;re free to change data plans or leave altogether in between those periods with zero hassle. </p><p>At any given time, there are plenty of great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes">Mint Mobile deals</a> to choose from, but it&apos;s unusual to find an offer that will cover the whole family. If you&apos;ve been wanting to switch to a prepaid carrier but were discouraged by the shortage of family deals, this offer is tailor-made for you. </p>

<p>If you want to switch to Mint but you don't necessarily need the four free lines, this deal on the Pixel 8 Pro shouldn't be missed.

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest Gemini features are now live on Gmail for web, Android, and iOS, with one highlight being an AI tool that makes polishing your email drafts a breeze.</p><p>The search giant has introduced a new "Polish" feature in the Gemini-powered "Help me write" tool on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gmail-android-how-to">Gmail</a> for both mobile and the web. This feature fine-tunes your drafts, ensuring your emails are clear and polished, as per Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/08/refine-emails-faster-with-help-me-write-gmail.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>This new feature lets users drop in rough notes, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> then crafts them into a polished, formal email with just one click or tap.</p><p>The "Refine my draft" tool in Gmail used to streamline email writing with options like "Formalize," "Elaborate," "Shorten," and the now-removed "I&apos;m Feeling Lucky." This means the latter has been replaced with "Polish."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RH7WEyB4FCnwA9ZUYfz3RX" name="Gmail-new-polish-option.gif" alt="Gmail's new polish option in the help me write feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RH7WEyB4FCnwA9ZUYfz3RX.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, the new option is only available to users subscribed to Gemini for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> or Google One AI Premium. Google says it will be automatically enabled for all eligible subscribers.</p><p>Furthermore, Google has updated Gmail on Android and iOS by adding shortcuts directly within emails. These make it easier for users to find and use AI writing tools while they&apos;re drafting.</p><p>The shortcuts pop up in your email draft when it’s empty, next to the "attach" icon. Just tap them to start the full "Help me write" experience and access all the AI writing tools.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DNnCndJDWh5bWfXwWWmY6h" name="Refine-my-draft-shortcut.gif" alt="Refine my draft shortcut in Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DNnCndJDWh5bWfXwWWmY6h.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the "Refine my draft" shortcut shows up below the email content when your draft is at least 12 words long. Swiping on this shortcut gives you access to the complete set of "Refine my draft" tools.</p><p>It should be noted that these features are only available to Google Workspace users who have the Gemini Business or Enterprise add-on, the Gemini Education or Education Premium add-on, or the Google One AI Premium plan.</p>

Nobody should be surprised because this is the third version of the Pixel Watch and the third one that "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-wont-repair-pixel-watch-displays">can&apos;t</a>" be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-warranty-option">repaired</a>.</p><p>While I&apos;m sure someone with enough determination and a steady hand could take a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-best-google-pixel-watch-3-preorder-deals-how-to-buy-and-what-to-expect">Pixel Watch 3</a> apart to replace broken or faulty components, realistically, Google is telling the truth when it says it can&apos;t be repaired. All wearables are packed full of small parts bonded together in a way that requires machinery to assemble, so cracking them open isn&apos;t easy. It would be far more cost-effective to offer a replacement. While Samsung and Apple may offer some types of service for their wearables, it&apos;s not cheap. It can&apos;t be cheap.</p>
<p>Something still feels off about this whole thing to me, though. Google suggests you purchase <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/magazine/preferred_care?hl=en-US">Google Preferred Care</a> insurance if you buy a device from the Google Store. Like insurance offerings from companies like Best Buy or your phone carrier, this isn&apos;t crazy expensive: Preferred care for a Pixel Watch 3 is $89 for two years or $4 per month.</p><p>I dunno if it&apos;s worth it to you because I&apos;m not you. You decide how to spend your money and if you think you&apos;ll want or need something like device insurance. If you say yes nobody will think twice about it. A lot of people do it.</p>
<p>I do have a thought or two about the whole thing. I think it&apos;s insane to charge customers an insurance premium on a relatively "cheap" device and then charge them if they need to use it. If you break the screen on your Pixel Watch, you&apos;re paying $89 for the insurance plus $49 to get a new watch, and unless you read about it somewhere, you might think your insurance covers the replacement. Remember when insurance did crazy things like that?</p>

<p>I do not like this system. Google could give you a total coverage amount like you see in car insurance policies and none of us would like it, but at least we would know exactly what we are paying for. Or Google could try to incorporate service costs into the price itself and nobody would be happy because the unit price goes up by $10.</p><p>Or, now hear me out: Google could build a device it could fix. You <em>could</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Google+Pixel+Watch+Screen+Replacement/160350?srsltid=AfmBOorpfJ0ZnLxuO7dJeYszykgti9YlB6ITiDewTE2oAiNtkOTSMhTn">fix the display on the first Pixel Watch</a> if you could find one and you were careful, even though Google said it wasn&apos;t possible. If a random dude on Reddit can do it, surely Google could manage it. Heck, they could hire the random dude from Reddit.</p>
<p>"Unfixable" devices are a thing because tech companies are convinced that everything needs to be thin, light, and waterproof. Maybe they are right, and that&apos;s what is best for the people buying them.</p><p>However, companies have found ways to make phones thinner than ever while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pbkreviews-teardown-for-samsung-galaxy-s24">making them more repairable</a>, so it is possible. This might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ6Q7JqtiA0">trickle down to wearables</a> as the techniques used to assemble them are refined. Technology works like that; not all the engineering goes into product design, and <em>how</em> things are built is important, too.</p><p>In any case, be sure you know you can&apos;t get your Pixel Watch 3 fixed, and even if you spend the money on "GoogleCare," you&apos;ll still have to pay to get it replaced. Let&apos;s hope that the Pixel Watch 3 is built tough enough so that things like broken screens aren&apos;t very common.</p>

<ul><li>A new datasheet leak reveals the specs of the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 SoC.</li><li>The flagship chipset will likely sport two variants with SM8750 and SM8750P model numbers.</li><li>The latter is expected to be performance-oriented compared to the regular one.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm is probably gearing up for its next flagship SoC through its Snapdragon Summit in a couple of months. Here, we expect to see the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, which is already confirmed to sport an all-new Oryon CPU.</p><p>After seeing a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-early-benchmarks">benchmark leaks</a>, a new datasheet (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/snapdragon-8-gen-4-datasheet-leak-reveals-efficiency-focus-ai-breakthroughs/">SmartPrix</a>) has leaked, revealing some of the critical specifications of the upcoming chipset. The interesting one in the lot is perhaps the two model numbers of the same chip bearing SM8750 and SM8750P. This means we might see two variants of Qualcomm&apos;s flagship SoC.</p>
<p>The "P" in the latter is presumably for the performance aspect of the chipset, which should likely be a tad bit better than the standard model, which will power most of the powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> starting from Q4 2024.</p><p>Aside from the model numbers, the latest data sheet confirms that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> is built on a 3nm process aiming for superior performance and power efficiency. It could possibly be done through the Oryon CPU, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">was confirmed</a> earlier by Qualcomm&apos;s chief marketing officer, Don McGuire, at MWC early this year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:728px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.51%;"><img id="mjVG3yYtzdAvTk3qFcQerc" name="snapdragon-8-gen-4-specs-leak.jpg" alt="Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 specs leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjVG3yYtzdAvTk3qFcQerc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="728" height="375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SmartPrix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The upcoming flagship chipset would incorporate the Adreno 8-series GPU, which promises the highest graphic performance and power efficiency. The new 8-series ISP will also improve photo and video experiences. The data sheet also confirms the existence of mmWave and Sub-6 bands since it&apos;s a 5G-powered SoC, after all.</p><p>Other key elements of the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 include Low-Power AI (LPAI) subsystem paired with dedication DSP and AI accelerator (eNPU) coupled with Qualcomm Sensing Hub (QSH), which should likely bring improvements to AI. The chipset further supports FastConnect 7900 modem next to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-FI 7</a> and Bluetooth 5.4. Users can expect LPDDR5X RAM and UWB support as well.</p><p>While these specs of the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 look promising, it is just a matter of a couple of months before we see the chipset in action. Qualcomm has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/company/events/snapdragon-summit">announced the dates</a> of this year&apos;s Snapdragon Summit, which is happening on Oct 21-24 in Hawaii. It will be interesting to see what the chipset maker brings to the table with its next flagship SoC. Also, Xiaomi <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-may-launch-first-snapdragon-8-gen-4-phone">will likely be</a> the first OEM to incorporate the flagship chipset on Android smartphones by the end of this year.</p>
