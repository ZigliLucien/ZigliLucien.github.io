<hr>
<p>A global wave of disruptions is crippling essential services due to a widespread Microsoft Windows malfunction causing the dreaded "Blue Screen of Death" (BSOD) errors.</p><p>Critical sectors like financial institutions, air travel, media, retail, rail services, and emergency response networks, including the US 911 system and Australia&apos;s government calls for emergency meetings, are severely impacted, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/spectatorindex/status/1814240906612191737" target="_blank">The Spectator Index</a>.</p><p>The global disruption is due to a botched update from CrowdStrike, causing Windows PCs and servers to get stuck in a reboot loop, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/19/microsoft-windows-outage-blue-screen-bsod/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> reports. Many businesses worldwide rely on CrowdStrike for managing the security of their Windows PCs and servers.</p><p>Microsoft said it recognizes the ongoing disruption and expects a quick fix, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/mitigation-actions-microsoft-cloudstrike-outages" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>. However, it&apos;s up to CrowdStrike to resolve the issue.</p><p>In response to the global outage, George Kurtz, CEO of CrowdStrike, released a statement acknowledging the disruption and confirming that they are working with customers to restore systems.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts.

<p>"CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts," Kurtz wrote in a post on X. "Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted."</p><p>Kurtz emphasized that this incident is not a security breach or cyberattack. Fortunately, CrowdStrike quickly identified the problematic update and implemented a rollback. The company has also provided a temporary solution for those experiencing system disruptions:</p>
<ol><li>"Boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment</li><li>"Navigate to the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike directory</li><li>"Locate the file matching 'C-0000029*.sys', and delete it.</li><li>"Boot the host normally."</li></ol>
<p>That said, with machines affected globally, fixing this issue will take a lot of time, even though a solution is available.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-this-outage-impact-your-android-phone-2">How does this outage impact your Android phone?</h2>
<p>CrowdStrike&apos;s security tools, like CrowdStrike Falcon, help organizations see threats in real-time. This lets the firm act quickly to put strong security measures in place, giving it a big advantage in the constantly changing world of cybersecurity.</p><p>The current outage only affects CrowdStrike on Windows systems. Other tools, like Falcon for Mobile, are still fully operational. It&apos;s designed to spot threats on iOS and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, offer real-time insights, and close security gaps that could lead to breaches.</p><p>CrowdStrike&apos;s flawed update only affects Windows PCs, but since many businesses run on Windows, it could cause problems today. You might not be able to board your flight or pay for your prescription at the pharmacy with your phone, which has become pretty standard.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google quickly followed up the Pixel 9 Pro teaser with a new video for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</li><li>The teaser reveals a unique dual-level rear camera design, sparking curiosity about its features.</li><li>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is showcased in a Porcelain finish, with more vibrant color options expected later.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google released a new teaser video for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold shortly after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-official-teaser-gemini">officially teasing the Pixel 9 Pro</a>. Even with all the unofficial leaks recently circulating online, Google&apos;s official teaser puts all the rumors to rest, confirming the design and name of its upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable Android smartphone</a>.</p><p>The teaser gives us a sneak peek at the Pixel 9 Pro Fold’s rear camera system, which ditches the usual single-tier setup for a dual-level design. This unique twist sparks curiosity about what new features this innovative design might bring.</p><p>Google also shows off the phone&apos;s external display and its hinge mechanism when the phone is unfolded.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NC_A3EHFKF4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The phone&apos;s rear camera module is set in a unique, rounded rectangular housing. Plus, quick shots of the unfolded device suggest it has an impressively thin profile.</p><p>In the teaser video, Google shows off the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in a sleek Porcelain finish. Fans can probably look forward to some more vibrant options when the device sees the light of day.</p><p>Interestingly, the teaser skips over showing the rumored top-right corner hole-punch front camera. This omission has everyone speculating about how Google plans to handle the Pixel 9 Pro Fold&apos;s selfie camera.</p><p>Even before Google officially revealed the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, details were not hard to come by, despite its efforts to keep things under wraps. For instance, a Taiwanese regulatory agency accidentally spilled the beans, posting images of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold along with the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> lineup (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-ncc-3461263/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>We still don&apos;t have the technical specs or details on how it stacks up against the first Pixel Fold. But mark your calendars for August 13—<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">Google&apos;s big hardware event will reveal the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Pixel 9 Pro, and possibly some other surprise devices</a>.</p>

<p>Nothing&apos;s in the groove to produce new products; it has only been ten days since the company announced its CMF series—<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-cmf-phone-1-could-be-way-cheaper-than-nothings-budget-phones">Phone 1</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/cmf-watch-pro-2-launch">Watch Pro 2</a>, and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/nothing-cmf-buds-pro-2-announced"> Buds Pro 2</a>. And today (July 18), it took X to tease its upcoming device—the Phone 2a Plus. </p><p>Nothing in the tweet stated,  "Plus. More. Extra. Get ready for Phone (2a) Plus." In the tech world, "Plus" usually means a larger phone with a bigger screen and potentially better specs. However, the teaser hasn&apos;t gotten into the nitty gritty of what those upgrades could look like. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>WhatsApp's new status update layout, similar to iOS, is available for select beta testers using version 2.24.15.11, with some early access possible for previous versions.</li><li>The new design focuses on essential options like muting or reporting status updates, making the interface cleaner and viewing smoother.</li><li>Meanwhile, the "AI Studio" feature offers various chatbots from Meta and other developers, available to select beta testers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is testing two new features for beta users, including personalized chatbots from Meta and third-party developers and a revamped status update interface on Android.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-15-11-whats-new/" target="_blank">WABetaInfo</a> spotted a major change in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> status bar, adding strategically placed buttons to make interacting with status updates easier and more efficient.</p><p>The outlet reports that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-status-updates-tray">new status update interface</a> on Android is available to select beta testers using WhatsApp beta version 2.24.15.11, and some users with the previous update might also get early access.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:355px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:211.27%;"><img id="kwjNpTbXKwndpdQhgaM6qN" name="whatsapp-status-update-interface.jpg" alt="whatsapp redesigned status update interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwjNpTbXKwndpdQhgaM6qN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="355" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The current status update design has an overflow menu with options for calls and messages. While useful at times, it often gets in the way of simply viewing status updates.</p><p>To make things a bit less cluttered, WhatsApp is simplifying the overflow menu. Now, it focuses on key options like muting or reporting status updates but still lets you access contact information if needed. This keeps the interface clean and makes viewing status updates smoother.</p><p>WhatsApp has also added a dedicated button to close the status update screen, alongside the existing swipe-down gesture. This gives users easy and intuitive ways to exit the status update interface.</p>

<p>In a separate report, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-15-10-whats-new/" target="_blank">WABetaInfo</a> has discovered another exciting feature in the WhatsApp beta for Android called "AI Studio." This new feature, available to select testers, offers a variety of chatbots created by Meta and other developers.</p><p>WhatsApp&apos;s slow rollout suggests big changes ahead. By letting third-party developers join in, WhatsApp is setting up a whole ecosystem of AI chatbots to meet all sorts of user requirements.</p><p>If you&apos;re excited to try AI Studio, it&apos;s available for beta testers with WhatsApp beta for Android version 2.24.15.10 from the Google Play Store. Some users might also be able to use the feature with the previous update.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-the-next-amazon-prime-day-2">When is the next Amazon Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Amazon generally holds its Prime Day sale every year in July, but don&apos;t be surprised if the retailer launches a similar sitewide sale event this October (under a different name, of course). </p>
<h2 id="when-was-prime-day-2024-2">When was Prime Day 2024?</h2>
<p>Prime Day 2024 ran from July 16th at 12:01am PDT through July 17th at 11:59p PDT.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-find-the-best-smartwatch-deals-during-prime-day-2">How can I find the best smartwatch deals during Prime Day?</h2>
<p>If you&apos;re hoping to invest in some Android tech this Prime Day, we recommend keeping an eye on our site for the latest deals and news. For everything else, consider signing up for one of Amazon&apos;s newsletters or use a website like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/"><strong>Camelcamelcamel.com</strong></a> to see some live price tracking. </p>
<h2 id="do-you-have-to-have-amazon-prime-to-get-prime-day-deals-2">Do you have to have Amazon Prime to get Prime Day deals?</h2>
<p>Prime Day was specifically designed to benefit paying Prime subscribers, so you&apos;ll need to be a member to enjoy the vast majority of deals during the sale. If you haven&apos;t signed up yet, it&apos;s worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon offers a 30-day free trial</strong></a> that lets you explore all of the benefits of a Prime subscription without paying a dime. After the 30 days wrap up, Prime memberships start at $14.99 per month.</p>

You don&apos;t even need to be a Prime member. </p>

<p>Prime Day has come to an end, but you can still save an excellent $100 on the Motorola Razr Plus (2024) if you preorder the phone unlocked before its July 24th release date. It's the kind of <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-android-phone-deals-2024">leftover Prime Day deal</a> we always hope for but never receive — until now. </p>
<p>As we stated in <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>, the Razr Plus (2024) might be the "perfect flip phone", coming packed with an efficient Snapdragon chipset, durable folding hinge, and a 4-inch pOLED cover display that should give Samsung a run for its money. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-razr-Unlocked-Camera-Midnight/dp/B0D23P28XX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="81339b5c-3d87-4c69-bfba-5e8aa221b80f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Motorola Razr Plus (2024) 256GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Motorola Razr Plus (2024) 256GB: $999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want the best Motorola flip phone ever built; you like to buy your phones unlocked; you prioritize camera quality in your devices.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;d rather explore Samsung&apos;s newest lineup of foldable phones; you can get a good trade-in deal through your wireless carrier.</p><p>If you&apos;re already a fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a>, you&apos;re pretty much guaranteed to enjoy the Razr Plus (2024) immensely. Right out of the box you&apos;ll see a sophisticated clamshell device with a vegan leather and glass construction, two vibrant pOLED 165Hz displays, and a versatile folding hinge. Things are just as impressive under the hood, as the Razr Plus (2024) boasts the flagship-quality Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, 12GB of RAM, and some new Hello UX software. </p><p>Some folks may prefer the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, and that&apos;s a totally legitimate opinion; but with this leftover Prime Day deal carving $100 off the Razr Plus, it&apos;s hard to justify spending a full $200 more for a Samsung phone that offers a largely similar foldable phone experience. That&apos;s just my two cents, but I think we can all agree that this deal presents a great opportunity for anyone who has had their eye on the new Razr Plus (2024). </p>

<p>With a week to go until the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Pairs, France, Google is alerting consumers about some interesting happenings.</p><p>According to a Keyword <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/google-nbcu-team-usa-partnership-paris-games/">blog post</a>, Google has partnered with Team USA and NBCUniversal, which is where the games will be broadcast this summer.

<p>As two of most popular names in the consumer technology space, Samsung and OnePlus have a lot of products competing against each other. Sure, the smartphone segment is (and always has been) where majority of the action happens, but the two companies also make everything from true wireless earbuds to smartwatches.</p><p>Speaking of the latter, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra was unveiled recently, while the OnePlus Watch 2 has already been out for a few months at this point. Both wearables are packed with features and share quite a few similarities, while also having some differences. But the real question is, which one of them deserves a place on your wrist? Let&apos;s take a comparative look at the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. OnePlus Watch 2 and find out.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-oneplus-watch-2-design-display-and-hardware-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. OnePlus Watch 2: Design, display, and hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uBzqRwhzSP4toKXDMtUob9" name="oneplus-watch-2-9.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 in use" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uBzqRwhzSP4toKXDMtUob9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From a visual standpoint, the two smartwatches couldn&apos;t be more different. The Galaxy Watch Ultra comes with a &apos;cushion design&apos; that Samsung claims allows for improved protection. Made with titanium, the squircle-shaped case also features a new &apos;Dynamic Lug System&apos; that should make swapping out bands a bit easier. On the other hand, the OnePlus Watch 2 is made from stainless steel and has a good ol&apos; rounded case. And thanks to the standard lug width of 22mm, you have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-oneplus-watch-2-bands" target="_blank">a wide range of bands</a> to pick from.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra doesn&apos;t have a digital crown, but you do get the &apos;Home&apos; and &apos;Back&apos; buttons, as well as an Orange &apos;Quick Button&apos; on the right side that you can customize to perform different actions like starting/pausing workouts or sounding off an emergency alarm. As for the OnePlus Watch 2, it has an interesting-looking flat right side with a customizable action button, as well as a digital crown that&apos;s just there for aesthetics and doesn&apos;t actually do anything. Both smartwatches are IP68-certified and comply with the MIL-STD-810H standard, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> has twice the water resistance of the OnePlus Watch 2.</p>
<p>Even though the 1.47-inch display of the Galaxy Watch Ultra is slightly bigger than the 1.43-inch screen of the OnePlus Watch 2, they&apos;re both gorgeous circular AMOLED panels with near-identical pixel density and Sapphire Crystal protection. The OnePlus Watch 2&apos;s design also looks quite cohesive, as the display and the case have the same shape. Conversely, the Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s screen and case shape don&apos;t match up at all, thus resulting in an awkward design that makes it look like a poor imitation of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review" target="_blank">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, which the former is clearly &apos;inspired&apos; by.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PUsajgSD5ofKAfwciTmohF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-analog-watch-face-02.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsajgSD5ofKAfwciTmohF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra features a 3nm Exynos W1000 chipset that should be a bit more efficient (at least on paper) than the 4nm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a> SoC of the OnePlus Watch 2. However, the OnePlus Watch 2 is a hybrid smartwatch that comes with a secondary BES2700 processor for handling lightweight tasks, which is also the reason it has an astounding battery life. Whether or not the Galaxy Watch Ultra can top that is a question we&apos;ll only be able to answer once we review it. That being said, you do get 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage on both wearables, so multitasking and app installations shouldn&apos;t be an issue on either.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vaYZeCsUThPK9Bg86qGJBR" name="oneplus-watch-2-17.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vaYZeCsUThPK9Bg86qGJBR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Crammed with all kinds of sensors, the Galaxy Watch Ultra and the OnePlus Watch 2 seem to have everything they need to go against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness" target="_blank">best fitness smartwatches</a> in the market. The two wearables can keep track of your sleep quality, calories burned, heart rate, as well as automatically log numerous workouts and exercises. However, hardware specifications and actual performance are two different things. You can check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">Galaxy Watch Ultra fitness test</a> to see how it fares.</p><p>As noted by Android Central&apos;s Harish Jonnalagadda in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review" target="_blank">his review</a>, the OnePlus Watch 2 is extremely unreliable at tracking just about every fitness metric out there, with the logged information being way off the actual numbers. Again, you&apos;ll have to wait until we put the Galaxy Watch Ultra through its paces to know if it&apos;s any better. By the way, both smartwatches come with dual-band GPS, which means they can do a pretty great job of tracking your outdoor runs.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-oneplus-watch-2-software-other-features-and-battery-life-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. OnePlus Watch 2: Software, other features, and battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P3s9JuYiQ7FyAuhBm8zyG3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-apps-grid.jpg" alt="Apps on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P3s9JuYiQ7FyAuhBm8zyG3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5" target="_blank">Wear OS 5</a>, which is the latest version of Google&apos;s wearable-oriented software platform. While Wear OS 5 itself primarily focuses on battery life optimizations and under-the-hood improvements, Samsung&apos;s One UI 6 Watch overlay notably brings &apos;Galaxy AI&apos; to its newest wearable(s). Just like on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24" target="_blank">Galaxy S24 series</a>, Galaxy AI is all about making sense of the on-device information. It analyzes all the personal wellness data collected by the smartwatch and turns it into your &apos;Energy Score.&apos; This score is supposed to give you an overall idea about your fitness so that you can act upon that information and make the necessary changes to your lifestyle.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 2 does run the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a> at the moment, but in addition to that, it also comes with a proprietary version of RTOS (Real Time Operating System) for handling lightweight tasks like notifications. The OnePlus Watch 2 is set to receive two major OS updates, which means it&apos;ll go up to Wear OS 6. The Galaxy Watch Ultra already runs the newest Wear OS version, and if Samsung&apos;s industry-leading update policy for its smartphones is any indication, we&apos;re sure it&apos;ll go even further.</p>
<p>Both wearables have you covered in terms of connectivity basics (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and NFC), but while the Galaxy Watch Ultra is only available with LTE, the OnePlus doesn&apos;t have it even as an option. All things considered, these are still two of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch" target="_blank">best Wear OS smartwatches</a> that you can get right now.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the OnePlus Watch 2 comes with an incredible battery endurance. This is primarily because of the smartwatch&apos;s dual-OS architecture, which smartly handles its two processors to ensure that the 500mAh battery can go up to three days on a full charge. Not only that, but the proprietary charging puck can also fully juice up the wearable in about an hour. Then there&apos;s the Galaxy Watch Ultra, which has a big 590mAh battery that should last quite a while (up to 100 hours in energy-saving mode), given the energy-efficient hardware. You also get support for fast wireless charging.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KzmyLJeos9ShaWka8erhqF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-orange-buttons-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KzmyLJeos9ShaWka8erhqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s pretty clear that the Galaxy Watch Ultra and the OnePlus Watch 2 are two of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch" target="_blank">best Android smartwatches</a> currently available out there. They have top-of-the-line hardware, great build quality, and a lot more. However, these wearables are aimed at different types of users. The Galaxy Watch Ultra is a premium wearable that comes with several features (e.g., emergency siren, track back) that make it ideal for adventure lovers and outdoor sports enthusiasts. On the other hand, the OnePlus Watch 2 is a well-made smartwatch that offers amazing battery life for everyday users. There&apos;s no wrong choice here, so which one should you go for?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="R3c6ejWK5GY2yhoa8HCfgN" name="OnePlus-Watch-2-fitness-ring-watch-face.jpg" alt="The fitness circles watchface for the OnePlus Watch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R3c6ejWK5GY2yhoa8HCfgN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The answer basically depends on your use case, your budget, and perhaps most importantly, the shortcomings you can ignore. The Galaxy Watch Ultra is a great option if you love exploring nature and taking part in endurance sports. If you want a durable smartwatch that can do everything and money is no object, go for it. Conversely, if you want a well-made smartwatch that can go on for days on a single charge, get the OnePlus Watch 2. Sure, the activity tracking isn&apos;t exactly the most reliable, but given the (relatively) affordable price, it probably doesn&apos;t even matter.</p>

<hr>
<p>HMD&apos;s next phone launch is here and lends its capabilities to the Gen Z audience looking to document their life through the camera.</p><p>HMD claims its Skyline smartphone is "more than just a pretty face" in its announcement <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_int/press/hmd-skyline-more-than-a-pretty-face">blog post</a>. The HMD Skyline struts its stuff with a sharp, rectangular shape and matte finish. Greeting consumers will be a 6.5-inch pOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate.</p><p>The screen is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and offers a 20:9 aspect ratio.</p><p>HMD plugged Qualcomm&apos;s 2023 midrange <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 7s Gen 2</a> SoC into the phone. Aside from that, Skyline&apos;s focus is on the camera and the features users will experience. Users will find a 50MP selfie camera, and HMD states that&apos;s where its Gen Z focus comes into play. With such strength, the front-facing lens includes autofocus and eye-tracking software to aid in capturing sharper pictures. </p><p>For ease, the company states content creators won&apos;t need to press the shutter manually. The Skyline includes built-in "selfie gestures." Users can make the classic peace sign with their hands, which is reportedly one of three other hand signals one can make to snap a photo.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.97%;"><img id="Pfpr4BnsHVZP3b95sVi3L3" name="hmd-skyline-neon-pink-in-hand.jpg" alt="The HMD Skyline in Neon Pink held in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pfpr4BnsHVZP3b95sVi3L3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1072" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HMD)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The matte back panel features a vertical triple camera array, which features a 108MP main sensor, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 50MP telephoto lens with Capture Fusion Technology. The main camera comes equipped with a 50mm lens to give your portrait shots that lovely bokeh (blurry background) effect.</p><p>Additionally, users utilize the 4x zoom capability for up-close, crisp photos.</p><p>The HMD Skyline continues the European brand&apos;s stance on self-repairability. With that, the device makes repairs simple as it&apos;s the first to utilize HMD&apos;s second-generation tech. Essentially, users will find a 65% reduction in the steps it takes to pop out parts and snap in new ones.</p><p>The post states consumers will find a "screw-driven camshaft" to help speed up the disassembly process. After several screws and the display cable, users can remove the Skyline&apos;s screen and slot in a new one if the old one received damage.</p><p>Elsewhere, HMD highlights its "dumbphone" functionality, also known as "Detox Mode." Enabling this setting will block apps and contacts from disturbing a user whenever they need to unwind.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:805px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.53%;"><img id="yMtH5HXu49FtVsUk8E5vDX" name="hmd-skyline-repairability-explained.jpg" alt="The HMD Skyline in Neon Pink being taken apart for repair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yMtH5HXu49FtVsUk8E5vDX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="805" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HMD)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a lot to do, which is why the HMD Skyline features a 4,600mAh battery that is estimated to last 48 hours between charges. The Skyline is also the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins">Qi2-capable Android phone</a>, as HMD states users can charge wirelessly at 15W. The company states that the battery should retain 80% of its maximum capacity through at least 800 full charge cycles. If something goes wrong, the Skyline&apos;s Gen 2 repairability is said to make it easy to replace the battery.</p><p>Holding your photos will be up to 256GB of internal storage, paired with up to 12GB of RAM. Users looking for extra space can grab a MicroSD card of up to 512GB.</p><p>Users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_us/hmd-skyline/buy?sku=HQ50200043EE0">can grab the HMD Skyline</a> off the official page for a $500 starting price in the U.S. in August. The device offers two colorways: Neon Pink and Twisted Black.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-32">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Android 15 Beta 4 marks a big step towards the final release, focusing on productivity, privacy, and security.</li><li>Beta 4 switches from PNG to vector emojis, ensuring they scale perfectly on any screen.</li><li>The stable build is expected to debut with the Pixel 9 series on August 13.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google rolled out Android 15 Beta 4 today, taking a big step towards the final release. This latest version mainly sharpens productivity features, boosts user privacy, and ramps up security measures.</p><p>Android 15 Beta 4, as the second platform stability release, intentionally lacks major changes. There aren&apos;t any standout features in this update; instead, Google is fine-tuning and polishing the latest version of its mobile OS.</p><p>It&apos;s tempting to try the latest software, but don&apos;t install the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> beta on your primary device due to potential bugs. For adventurous Pixel users, it offers an exciting peek into the future of Android.</p><p>The fourth Android 15 beta introduces a key change: switching from PNG-based emoji fonts to a vector format. This upgrade allows emojis to scale without losing quality, ensuring they look great on any screen size or resolution.</p><p>This builds on Android 13&apos;s introduction of vector emojis. This ensures perfect scaling and optimal rendering, completing the transition to a future-proof format.</p><p>Android 15 also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-space-full-details">introduces Private Space</a>, a secure area on your device accessible only by passcode or biometrics. It acts as a digital vault for your sensitive apps, like finance, communication, and social media, keeping them hidden and private.</p><p>Beyond the key feature of Private Space, Android 15 Beta 4 brings an important update to app activity management. This update improves resource allocation by keeping apps active only when launched or interacted with by the user.</p><p>The fourth Android 15 beta marks a crucial point for developers with finalized APIs and app behaviors. This pre-release helps developers ensure their apps run smoothly when Android 15 officially launches.</p><p>Google is keeping the exact launch date for Android 15&apos;s stable release under wraps, but evidence points to an imminent unveiling. The platform&apos;s current stability suggests it will debut alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series on August 13. This timing strongly hints that Android 15 will launch with Google&apos;s next flagship smartphone.</p><p>While Android 15 Beta 4 allows for final tweaks, it&apos;s also Google&apos;s last push to motivate app developers to prepare their apps.</p>
