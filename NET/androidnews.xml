While several brands rely on USB&apos;s standard Power Delivery, Chinese manufacturers use their own tech instead, delivering significantly higher charging speeds on their phones.</p><p>OPPO&apos;s SuperVOOC is the industry leader in this area, with the brand able to push battery charging to as much as 240W. That&apos;s an outlier, but on most OnePlus and OPPO phones available today, you&apos;ll see 65W and 100W charging as standard, allowing these devices to fully charge their batteries in under 30 minutes.</p><p>To put that into context, Samsung uses 45W charging on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, but the device takes over 60 minutes to charge the battery — more than twice as long as the OnePlus 12. The best part is that you don&apos;t get any downsides to 100W fast charging; I used OnePlus and OPPO devices based on the 100W tech for three years now, and long-term battery degradation is in line with other phones.</p><p>So here&apos;s everything you need to know about the SuperVOOC charging standard — how it evolved over the years, how it works in the latest devices, and how it&apos;s different to other fast charging solutions.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-evolution-of-fast-charging"><span>Evolution of fast charging</span></h3>

<p>OPPO introduced its VOOC charging tech back in 2014, and if you&apos;re curious, it is an abbreviation of Voltage Open Loop Multi-step Constant-Current Charging. VOLMCCC doesn&apos;t quite have the same allure, so OPPO shortened it to VOOC. In the early days, the standard went up to 20W (5V/4A), allowing devices at the time — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-6t-review-six-months">OnePlus 6T</a> — to charge up to 60% in just 35 minutes, a sizeable achievement.</p><p>Then came SuperVOOC in 2006, going up to 50W by pushing 10V at 5A, but not many devices used this standard. The biggest upgrade came in 2019 with the debut of VOOC 3.0, which made 30W charging standard across most OnePlus and OPPO devices. The tech switched to 5V/6A to deliver faster charging, with devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-7t-review">OnePlus 7T</a> going up to a 70% charge in just 30 minutes.</p><p>The next evolution occurred in 2020 with SuperVOOC 2.0, which introduced the 65W standard that&apos;s still in use today. It moved the charging tech to deliver 10V over 6.5A, introducing the ability to fully charge devices in under 40 minutes. When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-8t-review">tested the OnePlus 8T</a> that year, I saw that the battery charged in just 38 minutes, a record at the time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PWEWReVRD6GBcwAbT9oSHo" name="warp-charge-1.jpg" alt="Warp Charge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWEWReVRD6GBcwAbT9oSHo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus used OPPO&apos;s charging tech from the very beginning, but because it was set up as a standalone entity, it changed the moniker. The 20W standard was called Dash Charge, and with the switch to 30W came Warp Charge. And when 65W charging became available, the manufacturer went with Warp Charge 65.</p><p>There was a derivative of this — dubbed the 65T — on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-2022">OnePlus 9 Pro</a>, which allowed the device to maintain a sustained voltage for an extended duration, and it unlocked a full charge in under 30 minutes. The biggest advantage to the SuperVOOC standard is that it doesn&apos;t overheat your device; that&apos;s because most of the charging circuitry is built into the wall unit.</p><p>This is why you can only get the quoted charging speeds only when you use a SuperVOOC charger; while USB PD also has 65W charging, the voltages are different, so you don&apos;t get the same benefits.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-does-supervooc-work"><span>How does SuperVOOC work?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zjY4VD6kHAZUFb2iDhHeV" name="vooc-50w-4.jpg" alt="OPPO 50W mini SuperVOOC charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zjY4VD6kHAZUFb2iDhHeV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A standard smartphone battery is highly reactive, which is why phone companies have several safeguards built into the charging circuitry. Lithium-Ion batteries are able to take in more power initially, tapering out as the charge builds. It is on this principle that fast charging works.</p><p>Qualcomm&apos;s Quick Charge technology delivers a higher voltage to the battery to expedite charging time. Quick Charge 5.0 is fully compliant with the USB-C Power Delivery (PD) spec, and while some manufacturers like ASUS use Qualcomm&apos;s solution, most brands have switched over to USB PD instead.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vjgsruLQUtYCb8dkYdQJKH" name="OnePlus-Nord-N30-5G-super-vooc-charging-02.jpg" alt="Charging a OnePlus Nord N30 5G with the red cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vjgsruLQUtYCb8dkYdQJKH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung, for instance, switched to USB Power Delivery&apos;s Programmable Power Supply (PPS) spec starting with the Galaxy Note 10 series, offering 45W charging. This is still the case on its latest devices, but most of its mid-range phones still use a 25W standard.</p><p>SuperVOOC&apos;s differentiation comes by way of using a dual-cell battery; the OnePlus 12 has a 5400mAh battery, but it is made up of two 2700mAh cells. This way, the 100W charge is split over both batteries at the same time, allowing the device to charge in under 30 minutes.</p><p>The key difference between SuperVOOC and other charging standards is that while USB PD uses higher voltages to charge batteries, OPPO instead focuses on delivering a higher amperage. For instance, USB PD pushes 20V at 3.25A to send 65W to devices, whereas SuperVOOC delivers 10V at 6.5A to attain 65W. But because all the associated circuitry is in the wall unit, you&apos;ll get all the advantages of fast charging without any of the downsides (overheating).</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-supervooc-100w-charging-your-phone-in-30-minutes"><span>SuperVOOC 100W: Charging your phone in 30 minutes</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="idULYP7YsgEfrRmJhvUaGK" name="oneplus-12-31.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 next to OnePlus 9, OnePlus 10, and OnePlus 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/idULYP7YsgEfrRmJhvUaGK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the main benefits of SuperVOOC is its ability to keep temperatures low while charging. The fast charging option allows you to watch videos or play games while the phone is charging, with no net drop in speeds. That isn&apos;t the case with other charging solutions, as the higher voltages invariably lead to the phone reverting to normal speeds to prevent overheating.</p><p>With SuperVOOC 100W, you can easily charge a phone battery in under 30 minutes, and it is a proven technology by this point — I used it on dozens of phones. There&apos;s also a SuperVOOC 150W standard, but that was available on just a few devices, and while OPPO showcased SuperVOOC 240W as well, it isn&apos;t practical on its flagships.</p><p>Like other charging standards, SuperVOOC takes more than twice as long to go from 50% to a full charge, and that&apos;s to prevent damage to the battery (and more importantly, you), with the wall charger limiting output after hitting 70% and going even lower after reaching 80%. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, the phone goes up to 72% in just 15 minutes, but takes an additional 15 minutes to go the rest of the 28%.</p><p>The dedicated microcontroller unit inside the phone constantly monitors the charge level to determine the desired amperage to be delivered. This is a good thing, because it ensures that everything doesn&apos;t burn down when you plug your phone in overnight. Of course, the main downside is that you&apos;ll need to use OnePlus and OPPO&apos;s bundled chargers to get the full charging potential.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Q9TmqfkQgaSaymw3FWzGQ" name="Anker-Prime-battery-plugged-in.jpg" alt="An Anker Prime 27500mAh battery pack charging up multiple devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Q9TmqfkQgaSaymw3FWzGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, OPPO has licensed the technology to third-party vendors like Anker, and the charging brand is delivering SuperVOOC 65W on select power banks and chargers, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG">Prime 27,650mAh power bank</a> that goes up to 250W. This is a huge deal, as it allows you to get all the advantages of the charging tech on the go.</p><p>An additional thing to mention here is that while you get 100W charging in most regions, OnePlus limits the chargers to 80W in North America. This has to do with voltages again, so if you&apos;re using the OnePlus 12 in the region, you&apos;ll only be able to use 80W. In real-world use, that means the device will take roughly eight additional minutes to charge.</p><p>A key update introduced in 2022 is the ability to increase battery longevity. Even with SuperVOOC 100W, OPPO is guaranteeing 1600 charge cycles before battery degradation, and that&apos;s a huge achievement. Also, the best part about using the SuperVOOC 100W charger is that it doubles as a USB PD charger as well, going up to 65W. So if you have other devices that leverage PD, you can charge those easily.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-airvooc-50"><span>What is AIRVOOC 50?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="xnWKmULGTxijyaohXXXwb3" name="oneplus-8-pro-warp-wireless-charging-notification.jpg" alt="OnePlus Warp Charge 30 Wireless Charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xnWKmULGTxijyaohXXXwb3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-8-pro-review-second-opinion">OnePlus 8 Pro</a> became the first device from the manufacturer (globally) to offer wireless charging, and in usual OnePlus fashion the company outfitted the phone with 30W wireless charging. AIRVOOC 30 — also called dubbed Warp Charge 30 Wireless on OnePlus devices — could deliver up to a 50% charge in just 30 minutes, allowing it to become a standout option in the wireless charging segment.</p><p>To deliver sustained 30W wireless charging, OnePlus used two charge pumps and clever charging tech. The charger coil itself sends 20V at 1.5A (netting 30W) to the first charge pump, which then halves the voltage to 10W while boosting the amperage to 3A (once again creating 30W). The second charge pump halves the voltage yet again to 5V, with the amperage doubled to 6A. That 5V at 6A charge leads to 30W, and it&apos;s this charge that&apos;s sent to the charging coil on the back of the phone.</p><p>OPPO is using this technique because there&apos;s no way to safely deliver a 6A charge directly from the induction coil on the wireless charger to the one on the phone. That would create a lot of heat and inevitably burn things down, so it&apos;s instead relying on two charge pumps. The technology is very interesting, and it continues to be one of the best wireless charging solutions around.</p><p>With the OnePlus 9 series, OnePlus introduced 50W wireless charging, and this is still the same tech that&apos;s used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a>. It is called AIRVOOC 50, and the tech is able to charge a device in under 45 minutes, but you&apos;ll need to use the dedicated wireless charger, and that&apos;s no longer available in most markets.</p>
<hr>
<p>OPPO continues to lead the way with its charging tech, and SuperVOOC 100W allows you to easily charge your phone in under 30 minutes — and do so safely. With the Find X8 and OnePlus 13 set to launch soon, it is interesting to see how the charging tech will evolve in the coming years.</p>

It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hifigo.com/products/fiio-sr11">retails for $109</a>, and that&apos;s quite decent when you consider what&apos;s on offer — the SR11 is meant to be a network streamer that can be easily connected to existing audio gear. As such, there&apos;s no built-in DAC, and you will need to pair it with another device. In this instance, I used it with the brand&apos;s excellent K11 R2R DAC — a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k11-review">variant of the K11</a>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Z7naaJdAjfK87HNngMAtuW" name="fiio-sr11-1.jpg" alt="Fiio SR11 network streamer with RGB logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z7naaJdAjfK87HNngMAtuW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While network streamers are still in their infancy, WiiM has an early lead in this segment on the back of terrific launches. I&apos;m a huge fan of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/wiim-amp-review">WiiM Amp</a>; it is an all-in-one device with the ability to power passive speakers, and all the connectivity you could ask for. While the Amp is costlier at $299, the WiiM Mini goes up against what Fiio is offering, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Mini-Multiroom-Preamplifier-Assistants/dp/B09HC5GRKY/">coming in at $89</a>, it is an even better value — and you get a built-in DAC.</p><p>Where the SR11 is aiming to differentiate itself is Roon integration. I previously talked about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/roon-has-transformed-how-i-listen-to-music">Roon transformed my music library</a>, and if you use the service and need a reliable way to connect a stereo or other audio gear to your network, the SR11 is a great starting point.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sxVZsTsBqY4yzPsxutgZtY" name="fiio-sr11-8.jpg" alt="Fiio SR11 design showcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sxVZsTsBqY4yzPsxutgZtY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As always, let&apos;s start with the design. Fiio is known to reuse the same design where it makes sense — we&apos;ve seen that extensively in the past with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k5-pro-review">K5 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k7-review">K7 DACs</a> — and the brand went the same route with the SR11. The network streamer uses the same chassis as the K11 DAC, so you get the same squat profile with an LED panel at the front, and the dimensions are identical.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BxovDHPWYR5ZKjnFPGY7AY" name="fiio-sr11-6.jpg" alt="Fiio SR11 volume and control knob" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BxovDHPWYR5ZKjnFPGY7AY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The SR11 uses an aluminum chassis as well, and that&apos;s good to see in an affordable device. The build quality is just as great as the K11, and the Fiio logo at the top lights up — this can be disabled if you&apos;re not keen on RGB lighting. There&apos;s a control knob at the front that can be used to adjust the volume, and it is the default way to navigate the settings. It is a bit finicky as you have short and long-press controls, but if you&apos;ve used a Fiio DAC in the past, you will be familiar with the system.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ufh82JNjH2MYqjkcAFzevX" name="fiio-sr11-5.jpg" alt="Fiio SR11 panel showing real-time connectivity status" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ufh82JNjH2MYqjkcAFzevX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically, the SR11 combined with the K11 R2R creates an affordable stack that rivals significantly costlier products, and it is a terrific combination. Setting up the SR11 is a bit of a bother as it lacks Bluetooth, so you can&apos;t just pair it with your phone and use Fiio Control to connect it with your home network. I&apos;d recommend going the Ethernet route; that&apos;s how I usually connect any network-enabled streamer, and it is significantly easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YFbYTUyaQh4qHaGZekJ5LZ" name="fiio-sr11-12.jpg" alt="Fiio SR11 with iPhone 16 Pro Max next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YFbYTUyaQh4qHaGZekJ5LZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you set up the SR11, using it is relatively straightforward; it immediately showed up as an AirPlay device on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in streaming songs to it — whether that&apos;s in Spotify, Tidal, or Apple Music. While it&apos;s good to see AirPlay, it doesn&apos;t include AirPlay 2 integration, and it misses out on Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect.</p><p>You don&apos;t get any Chromecast integration either, and that makes the SR11 effectively useless with Android phones — unless you have Roon. It shows up as a Roon endpoint, and you can use your Android device to cast music to the streamer this way. Otherwise, this isn&apos;t the device to get — you should consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Pro-Chromecast-Multiroom-Compatible/dp/B0BJDY6D1W">$149 WiiM Pro instead</a>; it has much better connectivity, but you don&apos;t get Roon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7vBFGVVfuCtQUSEQxRoZVX" name="fiio-sr11-3.jpg" alt="Fiio SR11 back view showing connectivity" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7vBFGVVfuCtQUSEQxRoZVX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another feature that&apos;s missing is DLNA; Fiio is limiting that to test builds, and I don&apos;t really understand why that&apos;s the case. Essentially, you&apos;re not getting as much in the way of connectivity, with the device aimed to be used with iPhones, or if you have Roon.</p><p>Because there&apos;s no built-in DAC, the SR11 doesn&apos;t need much in the way of power, and it is powered over USB-C. There&apos;s a wall plug bundled in the box, but you can use it with any source as long as it delivers 10W of power. You also get USB-C and USB-A out, as well as optical and coaxial. There&apos;s an antenna that does a good job delivering a strong signal, and of course, you get Ethernet.</p>

<p>I like the fact that Fiio bundled a remote with the device; it makes it much more convenient to use than the control knob. This is what I do with the K19 DAC as well, and I&apos;m glad to see the remote included on a budget product. Connecting to another DAC via USB is as straightforward as it gets, and you can use just about any device.</p><p>The SR11 goes up to 768kHz/32-bit when using Roon (over USB), and AirPlay is limited to 44kHz/16-bit. I didn&apos;t see any issues in either mode, and the SR11 does a good job as a network streamer; it recreates the sound without adding any unwanted dynamics, and that&apos;s what you need in such a device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3DtgQSS3xHoY3LWdw3T3xZ" name="fiio-sr11-13.jpg" alt="Fiio SR11 and K11 R2R DAC with audio connected" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3DtgQSS3xHoY3LWdw3T3xZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When paired with the K11 R2R DAC and Beyerdynamic&apos;s excellent DT990 Pro, the SR11 is able to deliver its full potential. You get an energetic bass with neutral mid-range and a vibrant treble, and as a source, the SR11 does what it needs to — get out of the way.</p><p>I don&apos;t have any problems recommending the SR11, but it has its limitations. There isn&apos;t an easy way to set it up, it misses out on Chromecast connectivity, and you don&apos;t get Spotify Connect. But if you have an iPhone or use Roon and want an affordable streamer to connect to an existing stereo system, this is a great choice.</p>

<ul><li>Google detailed its October security patch arriving for its entire Pixel portfolio during its Android 15 rollout.</li><li>The patch fixes battery/charging issues, camera stability, face unlock stability, and a Bluetooth problem.</li><li>The update is seemingly arriving alongside the Android 15 update, so users may see these fixes merged with that larger download.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amidst Google&apos;s flurry of updates for its Pixel devices, the company&apos;s security update almost went unnoticed.</p><p>Google started pushing its October 2024 security patch to Pixel devices alongside its rollout of Android 15. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/302047881/google-pixel-update-october-2024?hl=en&sjid=17912587102205814339-NA">its patch notes</a>, the patch is arriving on phones ranging from the Pixel 6 to the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a>. All eligible devices will download version <strong>AP3A.241005.015</strong>. Devices under Google Fi are receiving it, too; however, those will find the software with an "<strong>A2</strong>" tag.</p><p>The October patch fixes a lot for Pixel phones, beginning with battery issues plaguing the Pixel 6 series. Google states this fix aims to solve those devices "occasionally" rebooting. Moreover, charging enhancements and battery usage updates have arrived for the Pixel 7, Pixel 8, and Pixel 9 series.</p><p>The Pixel 9, Pro, Pro XL, and Pixel Tablet suffered from a  biometric (face unlock) stability issue. Google says a fix is included with the October patch.</p><p>A Bluetooth fix between a Pixel phone and another device rolls in. Additionally, a camera stability fix for phones "under certain conditions" was highlighted.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> gained the spotlight for an issue with its inner display. Reports stated the device suffered from a "gray shade" under specific circumstances. The patch notes include a fix for this, so Fold users should look out for it.</p><p>The remainder of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Fix for issue occasionally preventing apps to access media files</li><li>Fix for system stability and performance in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for Adaptive Connectivity Services stability and performance in certain conditions</li><li>General improvements for network connection stability and performance in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue causing incorrect Android icons are displayed in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with Assistant launch animation on the lock screen</li><li>Fix for issue with home button stops responding in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with incoming call notifications in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with layouts and animations during transitions in certain conditions</li></ul>

<p>Pixel devices across the board pick up fixes for UI transitions and animations in October. Google eludes to better stability, meaning scrolling, swiping, and other gestures should appear smoother.</p><p>The company reiterated that its Pixel phones running Android 14 are eligible for the Android 15 upgrade. This October security patch is likely included with the major OS rollout.</p><p>Google and Pixel users have a lot to celebrate this month as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-now-makes-pixel-phones-a-fortress-against-thieves-and-fraudsters">Android 15 officially went live</a> yesterday (Oct 15). The software upgrade isn&apos;t as flashy as previous updates; however, Google focused on improving Android&apos;s security and privacy features. Pixels picked up three features under the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">Theft Protection</a>" banner to assist in safeguarding your data if your phone is stolen.</p><p>Things don&apos;t end there as Google rolled out its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">Pixel feature drop</a> alongside Android 15. The update had much to unpack for the Pixel 9 series like a Gemini Extension for Pixel Screenshots, underwater photography/video capabilities, and updates for the "Object Temperature Sensor." A slew of Google&apos;s past-gen Pixel phones picked up some new-age goodies alongside the Pixel Buds, Watch, and Tablet.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>With a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">new version of Android rolling out</a>, many people will find their phones telling them that it&apos;s time for a software update. Undoubtably, a good many people will not want to do it even though they should.</p><p>Updating your software can be a pain. Some phones just do it quietly and tell you to restart when they&apos;re done, and others <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-spent-hours-updating-my-old-phone-only-to-make-it-worse">seem to take forever</a> and prevent you from using your phone while it&apos;s all happening. The latter is a big reason why people aren&apos;t thrilled with the idea of updating, I think.</p><p>Either way, there are three excellent reasons why you should click the button to download and install the update waiting for you: security, functionality, and compatibility.</p>
<h2 id="security-2">Security</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.46%;"><img id="vokUu4hn6MjEvQZ7eUUPXe" name="Lollipop-encryption-2.jpg" alt="Phone Security" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vokUu4hn6MjEvQZ7eUUPXe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1361" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The software on your phone is riddled with flaws and potential security exploits, regardless of the brand or operating system. All software is this way, and it always will be.</p><p>Almost all of these problems will never make their way to the surface, and nobody ever realizes they are there. <em>Almost</em> all. Enough of them pop up that mobile software security has become big business, and it&apos;s fairly common to hear about some hack or exploit that bypasses the security built into your phone&apos;s software.</p><p>A lot of people are looking, too. Unsavory people. The kind of people who know how to get into your stuff and profit from it. Anytime there is profit to be made plenty of folks will try to be part of it.</p><p>You will probably never get hacked unless you do something you shouldn&apos;t, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/stop-clicking-random-short-url-links">click random links</a> or try to use cracked apps from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/third-party-app-store-aptoide-just-suffered-massive-hack-details-20-million-users-turn-online">dodgy sources</a>. But updating your phone will kill a lot of the ways people are doing it right now, forcing them to spend time looking for a new way instead of exploiting unsuspecting people.</p><p>Remember, your phone is connected to a network, which means it&apos;s connected to billions of other phones. Protecting yourself also protects everyone else.</p>
<h2 id="functionality-2">Functionality</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="q9VoGU7tQ4pVHno35tVMEf" name="samsung-good-lock-23.jpg" alt="Samsung Good Lock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q9VoGU7tQ4pVHno35tVMEf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Every major version update of your phone&apos;s software comes with new features and unless you accept it, you&apos;re not going to be able to use them.</p><p>Some of these features probably seem dumb to you. Others also seem like something you would want to have so updating means you get both the good and the bad. Nobody says you ever need to use the dumb ones, though.</p><p>More importantly, each version update also improves functionality in other ways. Remember how I reminded you that your phone&apos;s software was riddled with flaws? Plenty of those flaws affect how your phone works, too. Updates almost always fix bugs and glitches on your phone, even the ones that might drive you crazy.</p><p>Additionally, bugs get patched out, too. Things like battery safety issues or connectivity problems are often found buried inside a version update. Even if you aren&apos;t interested in the new features you read about, you really want things like this.</p><p>A lot of people think a software update will slow your phone down, and that might be true. Your phone can only do so much, and if you try to force it to do more, it can get laggy and slow. Hopefully, the company that made your phone understands that it will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-series-full-specifications-leak">have to hold some of these new user-facing features back</a> on older or budget phones. It&apos;s always better to not get a new thing than it is to ruin what used to work.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-2">Compatibility</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:768px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.82%;"><img id="hruHHe3FpJQu6r5ZQVgc4k" name="play-services.jpg" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hruHHe3FpJQu6r5ZQVgc4k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="768" height="613" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Updates often provide changes your network provider needs and those are important. Your phone isn&apos;t very useful unless it can connect to the outside world.</p><p>But both Android and iOS tie features of third-party apps to the version of the operating system you&apos;re using, and that makes accepting an update more important than you may realize.</p><p>With Android, each platform version introduces a new set of APIs (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-embraces-future-ultra-wideband-apis-android">Application Programming Interface</a>) and those are how apps can work with your phone&apos;s OS and hardware. Most of these APIs go unchanged from version to version, but often we see new ones and changes that make prior versions obsolete.</p><p>Usually, Google does a good job maintaining backward compatibility so things won&apos;t immediately break but sometimes this isn&apos;t the case. Failing to take an update may cause your existing apps to stop working, mean you can&apos;t update the apps themselves, or make it so you can&apos;t install a new app.</p><p>Google tries to prevent this using what&apos;s called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-services">Google Play Services</a> for the things it likes to fiddle with, but with Play Store changes becoming a real possibility over antitrust concerns, who knows how this will work in the future?</p><p>Your best bet is to accept the software update when it becomes available for your phone.</p>

<p>Ultimately, only you get to decide whether to install an update or not. It&apos;s your phone and nobody else gets to tell you what to do with it. You might even have a good reason to stay a version or two behind.</p><p>For most of us though, installing the update is a good idea. It&apos;s the best way to stay safe, stay compatible, and enjoy new features without buying something new.</p>

<p>Following the launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> on Pixel devices, ASUS is opening the doors to its beta program for its recent gaming phone.</p><p>The Taiwanese company highlighted the start of its Android 15 Preview Program in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://zentalk.asus.com/t5/rog-phone-8/rog-phone-8-join-the-android-15-preview-program/td-p/447128">ZenTalk post</a>. ASUS states users with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-review">ROG Phone 8</a> can start enrolling in the test for the next major Android OS. The post adds that users can experience the next release at its "first stage" and report any bugs discovered throughout the test.</p><p>To sign up, ASUS states users must head into their <strong>Settings > System > System Updates > Gear Icon (top right)</strong>. Users can tap on "Enroll in Android Preview Program" and agree to the privacy policy&apos;s terms. The post states users are required to sign up for an ASUS member account and fill out the necessary application form.</p><p>The Preview Program is in the recruitment stage, which is why the application form exists. ASUS states that you can always opt out of the program while recruiting is active.</p><p>If you&apos;ve been selected to join, the company will send an email. This email will likely contain further instructions that testers must know before joining the program. More importantly, if you do get in, everything in the Preview Program is confidential. ASUS states testers cannot post anything online about what they&apos;ve seen.</p><p>Those willing to share and discuss can do so via a new ZenTalk board, the ASUS forums, which will become available to selected users.</p>

<p>Android 15 is this week&apos;s highlight as Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-now-makes-pixel-phones-a-fortress-against-thieves-and-fraudsters">its arrival for Pixel users</a>. The latest OS release isn&apos;t quite as flashy as some might&apos;ve hoped; however, Google has implemented several enhancements below the surface. A highlight of the update is its strong emphasis on user security and safety. Android 15 brings in one-touch passkeys and advanced theft protection.</p><p>Among these safety features is "Private Spaces," a secluded area on your device where users can safeguard apps with sensitive information. Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">theft protection features</a> enter via "Theft Detection Lock," "Remote Lock," and "Offline Lock."</p><p>It remains to be seen what features ASUS has planned for its ROG Phone 8 users once the recruitment period is over. What&apos;s clear is that interested parties should sign up as soon as possible before the spots fill up.</p>

<ul><li>Google Messages app's latest beta version teardown has revealed some interesting changes coming to Profile discovery feature.</li><li>Users will be able to hide their name and profile picture from their contacts, or show them only to people whom they chat with.</li><li>The Profile discovery feature was first introduced by Google last November on the messaging platform.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Back in November, Google Messages <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-gain-one-billion-active-rcs-users">launched</a> the long-awaited "Profiles" feature on the messaging platform in beta. While it seemingly hasn&apos;t been rolled out to everyone yet, new evidence shows new features may already be on the way to help users better take control over their privacy.</p><p>This comes from folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-profile-discovery-privacy-apk-teardown-3490456/">Android Authority</a>, who have discovered additional privacy features in their APK teardown of the latest Google Messages <strong>v20241010</strong> beta version of the app.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="oH5ocYnBN3GEEr5pGm7Usf" name="Google-Messages-Profile-discovery-privacy-options-01.jpg" alt="Google Messages Profile discovery privacy options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oH5ocYnBN3GEEr5pGm7Usf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="7c4ndg73Swy8smGmWEVq2g" name="Google-Messages-Profile-discovery-privacy-options-02.jpg" alt="Google Messages Profile discovery privacy options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7c4ndg73Swy8smGmWEVq2g.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Users have to keep in mind that these options were found in the Google Messages app&apos;s setup screen. Currently, Messages allows users to turn on or off the Profile discovery feature and simultaneously see how they want their names showcased, including full name, short name, or initials.</p><p>However, new findings from the teardown give users some privacy options, like the ability to show their name and profile picture to People you message, only your contacts, or no one.</p>
<p>These new privacy options appear self-explanatory, giving users a bit more control over who gets to see their profile information. As such, you can enable the feature for your contacts so they can see your name and profile image based on your profile details, or you can hide it completely, and the person you&apos;re messaging will just have to rely on manually entered details on their end.</p><p>It is encouraging to see Google providing such options for its messaging platform, which has been constantly seeing nifty improvements and adding new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-messages-wear-os-rcs-full-support-spotted">features on Wear OS</a>. </p><p>Also, these profile privacy features might be new to Google Messages, but they have been around for a while in several other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging apps</a> on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Privacy features, like the ability to hide stories, statuses, etc., are incorporated even deeper into them.</p>
<p>The publication also notes that Google Messages users still cannot set their preferred profile picture but rather stick to what they put to their Google/Gmail account. It is possible that we might see the ability in future updates on Google Messages.</p><p>Now that the privacy options have surfaced in the latest Google Messages beta app, the feature will likely be officially released soon since they appear to already be available on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/14357725?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmanage-profile-sharing">Google Messages support page</a>, unless the search giant has other plans.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Amazon Kindle Scribe was very clearly a first-gen device when it launched in late 2022, with hardware flaws and limited productivity software. Amazon patched it over the next year with useful fixes, but the fundamental problems remained. Now, the Kindle Scribe 2024 fixes nearly every complaint I had with its predecessor. </p><p>Amazon announced four new Kindles on Wednesday, including its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-colorsoft-signature-edition-launch-details">first color e-ink Kindle</a>. But its newest Scribe stands out for me thanks to one feature: Active Canvas. Essentially, you can now write directly on e-books and have the notes stay attached to the text, even if you resize the font or change the layout.</p><p>In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review" target="_blank">Kindle Scribe (2022) review</a>, I complained that the only way to annotate e-books was to tap next to a word to create a little footnote icon and then write your notes in a pop-out box. Those notes weren&apos;t visible unless you expanded them, and they covered up half of the screen. </p><p>Compared to underlining and marking up your school textbooks and novels in the margins, it felt extremely limited. At the time, I wished Amazon would let us lock an e-book into PDF format to enable notes.</p><p>It turns out Amazon took this criticism and enacted a much smarter solution with Active Canvas. As you can see in the photo above, you can write a note that reflows the book text itself and resizes it if you change the font size, so it&apos;s always anchored to that part of the text. </p><p>You can also underline and highlight text using the pen for the first time, which is a simple necessity for me. Plus, you can open a collapsable marginal column on any page and take full-sized notes, then hide the column — though this feature won&apos;t go live until 2025, according to Amazon. It&apos;s not quite as natural as writing in the margins, but it also gives you more space, so I won&apos;t complain.</p>

<p>Amazon wants the Kindle Scribe to be a note-taking tablet for students and professionals. The second-gen Kindle Scribe is "AI-powered," letting you "quickly summarize pages and pages of notes into concise bullets in a script font that can be easily shared—directly within the notebook tab."</p><p>I personally would prefer a standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> for note-taking; I like working directly in app suites like Google Drive or Microsoft Office instead of having to export notes. But Amazon&apos;s smarts revamp is a welcome one regardless. I complained about the 1st-gen Scribe&apos;s "slow response time" for most tasks, and this AI boost gives me hope that the next version is a bit faster.</p><p>Plus, the Kindle Scribe 2024 design looks more attractive. I complained about the "massive bezel" on the first Scribe, but this design has shrunk it to a more manageable size that&apos;ll be easier to grip while adding new white borders along the edge that give it a distinct appearance from other Kindles.</p><p>The 300 ppi display and 16GB to 64GB of storage are the same, but it comes with a Premium Pen by default, and the Scribe has new fun color options to give it more personality. Unfortunately, it also costs more than the original Scribe—$399.99 and up—but now it feels like it <em>earns</em> that higher price tag.</p><p>Over Prime Day, I wrote about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/my-fiancee-stole-my-kindle-scribe-so-im-buying-one-during-prime-day-for-25-percent-off">my fiancee stole my Kindle Scribe</a> to read e-books on a larger screen and that I wanted to buy a new one for myself despite its failings. Now, I&apos;m ready to return that Scribe and shell out full price for the Amazon Kindle Scribe (2024) once it arrives on December 4. It could very well be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">best e-ink tablets</a> we&apos;ve seen.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amazon is finally upgrading its Kindle e-reader line with a worthy addition that brings color to your reading life.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/kindle-color-specs-price-announce">press release</a>, Amazon stated that the new Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is ready with a 7-inch "colorsoft" display. The screen is this device&apos;s standout feature as the company highlights its soft visuals to the eye. The post states this display forgoes the typical backlighting on a regular screen.</p><p>Moreover, to improve the Colorsoft Signature Edition&apos;s colors, Amazon worked on a light guide to minimize "stray light." The tablet&apos;s display also has additional custom coatings to enhance colors and improve its optical performance. The post states users can also choose between "standard" and "vibrant" color styles. All of this was done on an oxide backplane, which Amazon says provides better color contrast, quicker response to page-turning, and upgraded image quality.</p><p>Since reading and note-taking go hand-in-hand, Amazon provides a way to do so in more colors. Users looking to highlight text for rediscovery can do so in yellow, orange, blue, and pink. Amazon adds that the Colorsoft Signature Edition features a pinch-to-zoom function, and the tablet can reportedly zoom into images "without worrying about pixelation."</p>

<p>Users with a lot in their Kindle Library can find solace with 32GB of storage. Additionally, Amazon estimates readers can get roughly eight weeks of battery life off a single full charge. The tablet can be charged via a USB-C cord, but Amazon states users have a wireless charging option. However, the "Amazon Wireless Charging Dock" is sold separately.</p><p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-review">Kindle Paperwhite</a>, the Colorsoft Signature Edition is waterproof with an IPX8 rating. This tablet offers no writing functions as that&apos;s reserved for the Kindle Scribe. Users will find Audible support, Parental Controls, and the chance to (separately) purchase a six-month Amazon Kids Plus Subscription.</p><p>Amazon&apos;s first color e-reader, the Colorsoft Signature Edition starts at $279. The post states users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?ref=ods_surl_se_us">can pre-order the device</a> ahead of its October 30 shipping date.</p>

<p>The Colorsoft may be the new kid on the block, but Amazon announced a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-kindle-color-scribe-paperwhite-entry"> series of next-gen tablets</a>, like the 2024 Kindle Scribe. Like its predecessor, the newer model features a 10.2-inch; however, Amazon added white borders around its display. The company states it took strides to make its screen smoother and more "paper-like" to bring its writing experience closer to the real deal.</p><p>AI is another highlight for the 2024 Scribe as the post states can utilize its software to summarize pages and your notes into "concise" bullet points. Amazon says the AI will transform notes into a legible script font to be shared from the notebook.</p><p>Amazon teased that "soon," users can hide their notes in the Scribe&apos;s sidebar. The 2024 Kindle Scribe is available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=kindle-release-24-20&linkId=d933d9e9a0bc3cbab1af4de705aaecae&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">for pre-order</a>, starting at $399.

With a boosted "contrast ratio," Amazon says text and images in stories should spring off the page. Hardware-wise, the next-gen Kindle Paperwhite is said to be 25% faster, meaning its response to your digital page turns is snappier.</p><p>Elsewhere, the company states the device pairs its speed with a thinner frame. Amazon touts the tablet as its thinnest Kindle to date. While the base Paperwhite features 16GB of storage, the all-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPP8C33?ref=ods_surl_sas_us">Paperwhite Signature Edition</a> arrives with 32GB.</p><p>The Kindle Paperwhite can be pre-ordered for $159 while its Signature Edition is up for $199. There&apos;s also an upgraded Paperwhite Kids with a $179 starting price.</p>

If you&apos;re treating yourself to this powerhouse of an Android tablet, you need a good Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra case to go with it. The best Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra cases are cost-effective, functional, and protective.</p><p>You don&apos;t have to break the bank to get a decent protective cover for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>.

<p>At 14.6 inches, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is an absolute unit. This gigantic and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">awesome Android tablet</a> has loads of screen real estate and plenty of power. Owing to the massive size of the tablet, you need a good quality case to make sure it doesn&apos;t get damaged from bumps or falls.</p><p>I always gravitate towards Spigen because the brand never falters. I have never had a bad experience with Spigen; they are reliable. Thus, the Spigen Rugged Armor Pro for Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is the best overall case you can get. It costs about $35, which is pretty good for such a big tablet cover. On top of being a rugged case, it has everything you could want from a Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra case. There&apos;s an S Pen slot, a sturdy kickstand, and a protective folio.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking to kill two birds with one stone, the SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Pro for Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra comes with a built-in screen guard as well as a stand integrated on its backside. It&apos;s just as rugged as the Spigen case and costs exactly the same, so it really just boils down to your personal needs and preferences.</p>
