<hr>
<p>Today (Apr. 15), Instagram is rolling out a feature just in time for the next leg of Coachella in partnership with a popular K-pop group.</p><p>According to Instagram, as part of its collaboration with K-pop girl group LE SSERAFIM, the platform is rolling out "Frames" for Stories. The feature is stated to let users turn their photos into polaroids with a single tap. Photos saved to your camera roll can be given this new Story sticker.</p><p>Instagram adds that those wanting to see your photo will have to "shake their phone to reveal the content inside."</p><p>To get started, users can initiate Story creation on Instagram and then tap the "sticker" icon. Tapping the "Frames" sticker option will open your phone&apos;s gallery to select which image you&apos;d like to use. Instagram states that only one image can be framed at a time using the Polaroid Frame.</p><p>After deciding, users can throw in a caption. The company states this will automatically imprint the date and timestamp for when the photo was originally taken.</p><p>When using the Polaroid Frame, others will see a "shake to reveal" option at the bottom of your Story. This will "develop" the image (how a real-life Polaroid works), revealing the photo users want to share.</p>

<p>Instagram is rolling out "Frames" today (Apr. 15), so users can start utilizing it through Coachella&apos;s part two. The musical event will run once more from April 19 to April 21 at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California.</p><p>This is the second update to reach Instagram recently as, last week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-cutouts-notes-additions-detailed">the platform rolled out</a> "Cutouts" and teased more for Notes. The former was touted as a feature that lets users turn themselves into unique, usable stickers in Instagram Stories. Cutouts could also be used in Reels. However, users could grab their videos and turn them into animated stickers.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-cutouts-notes-additions-detailed">Notes</a> are getting a few upgrades, such as "Prompts" and more visibility in Instagram profiles. Prompts are an interable variant of Notes that lets others interact and respond with emojis, quick blurbs, and more.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Pixel 9 Tensor G4 may debut a new Samsung Modem 5400.</li><li>The modem will support 5G non-terrestrial networks (NTN), bringing satellite connectivity to the next Google flagships.</li><li>A new 5G tablet is reportedly in the works, along with the same SoC and modem.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Pixel 9 is Google&apos;s highly anticipated flagship series, which will likely be launched this fall. Ahead of the launch, the devices are tipped to bring satellite connectivity, which could help popularize the feature on Android after Apple launched it on the iPhone.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-sos-satellite-connectivity-3433498/">Android Authority</a>, which has gathered information from a Google insider, the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series will see some essential modem upgrades, likely bringing satellite connectivity to both flagship models.</p>
<p>The publication notes that the new modem will also make its way to the next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> and an unknown 5G tablet from the search giant — the details of which are yet to be determined. </p><p>While we already figure that the Tensor G4 will power the Pixel 9 series and the Pixel Fold 2, it will feature this new satellite-enabled modem dubbed Samsung Modem 5400. For now, apart from the moniker, very little is known about the new modem, and it is expected to be significantly faster and more power-efficient than the current iteration, the Samsung Modem 5300, which is seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3</a> chipset.</p><p>However, the new modem supports 3GPP Rel. 17, which translates to support for 5G non-terrestrial networks (NTN), bringing satellite connectivity. </p>

<p>The latest findings come in conjunction with an alternative satellite messaging service, which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-satellite-based-text-messaging-spotted">recently spotted</a> in Android 14 beta and is likely to be included in Android 15, which presumably debuts with the Pixel 9 series out of the box. We have also seen proof that Google Messages is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-pixel-feature-spotted">preparing to support satellite messaging</a>.</p><p>It is encouraging to see satellite connectivity possibly arriving on upcoming flagship Android phones after Apple debuted the feature on its latest iPhones. While satellite communication isn&apos;t likely the defining factor of the Pixel 9 series for users who want to buy them, it is still a welcome addition.</p><p>As for the unknown tablet from Google, Android Authority states that it is still in the early stages of development and is codenamed "clementine." It is believed to have the identical Tensor G4 next to the aforementioned new 5G modem. The launch timeline of the Android tablet also needs to be determined.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Android tablets have come a long way in the last two years, and there are plenty of decent choices if you want a budget option that excels at the basics. I used Xiaomi&apos;s Pad 6 for the better part of a year, and its large 11-inch screen served as the ideal dashboard for monitoring smart home devices in my house.</p><p>So when Honor said it was launching a budget tablet with an even larger 12.1-inch screen, I was interested. The Pad 9 doesn&apos;t look like a budget tablet at a first glance; it has a metallic chassis and a thin profile that belies its price tag, and the IPS panel gets plenty bright.</p><p>The hardware isn&apos;t the best you&apos;ll find in this segment, but I didn&apos;t see any issues in daily use, and the Pad 9 is particularly well-suited as an entertainment device. So if you need a good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">budget Android tablet</a>, here&apos;s why the Pad 9 may just be the ideal option.</p>

<p>Honor launched the Pad 9 globally on December 21, 2023, and the tablet is available in select regions. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HONOR-12-1-inch-Protection-Display-Speakers/dp/B0CST8ZHBC">selling for £249 ($311) in the U.K.</a> for the 8GB/256GB version, which is £50 less than its usual retail price.</p><p>The Pad 9 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Bluetooth-Keyboard-12-1-Inch-Extended-Snapdragon/dp/B0CY2QL1JR">available for ₹24,999 ($300) on Amazon India</a>, and you get the 8GB/256GB variant as standard. What makes the Pad 9 a particularly good choice in India is that it comes with the Bluetooth keyboard bundled with the package, which is an optional extra that costs £100 ($124) in the U.K.</p>

<p>Honor knew what it was doing with the design of the Pad 9, and the tablet&apos;s aluminum chassis gives it a premium look. The thin 7mm profile also makes a difference in this regard, and you don&apos;t get the feeling that you&apos;re using a budget tablet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KGuo2sAxX8YTubdE4JwcPE" name="honor-pad-9-5.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KGuo2sAxX8YTubdE4JwcPE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The metallic grey color option looks good, and while the tablet is on the heavier side at 555g — mostly down to the metallic chassis — it has good weight distribution, and it doesn&apos;t feel heavy. By contrast, my iPad Pro 12.9 is noticeably heavier at 682g. The back doesn&apos;t get smudged, and there&apos;s enough room to hold the tablet with ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FZ9H6Vew3yXBMbwjJxmRHF" name="honor-pad-9-9.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FZ9H6Vew3yXBMbwjJxmRHF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the Pad 9 has uniform bezels around the screen, with the camera located on the longer edge, ideally positioned when you need to make video calls. The screen is the star of the show here, and the 12.1-inch IPS LCD display has good color vibrancy. The panel has an anti-glare coating that makes it ideal for watching movies and TV shows, and I didn&apos;t notice any issues with brightness levels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rtMrvTaZrMPn69d6j6zheD" name="honor-pad-9-2.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rtMrvTaZrMPn69d6j6zheD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pad 9 has a resolution of 2560 x 1600, and again, that&apos;s decent enough in daily use. What I like the most about the panel is that it has 120Hz refresh rate; this gives the Pad 9 a distinct edge over the likes of Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Tab A9+. Colors and contrast levels are good in general, and there are no issues with the panel while streaming content or playing games.</p>

<p>Onboard sound is pretty good too, and that&apos;s down to the eight drivers located around the tablet. It is more than adequate if you&apos;re just streaming the occasional video on YouTube, but I&apos;d suggest using earbuds if you&apos;re watching a movie.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Zo6Nn3HJpteAzuC8Ny6vjG" name="honor-pad-9-17.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zo6Nn3HJpteAzuC8Ny6vjG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With Honor offering 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage as standard, there&apos;s more than enough memory for multitasking, and you&apos;re not likely to run out of storage. Honor did a good job optimizing the hardware, and the tablet has plenty of fluidity while navigating the interface and scrolling in Chrome — I didn&apos;t see any problems in this particular area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ty3qzcPCn4ZYmUThFu2eDE" name="honor-pad-9-4.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ty3qzcPCn4ZYmUThFu2eDE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a lot to like on the battery front as well, with the Pad 9 featuring a 8300mAh battery that lasts up to eight hours of use consisting of video playback and web browsing. Honor bundles a 35W charger in the box, and it takes the Pad 9 just under two hours to fully charge the battery. That&apos;s on par with the best Android tablets, and considering the battery life on offer, you won&apos;t need to plug it in before the end of the day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HHCtTfs7CpxicBx5MCzirE" name="honor-pad-9-7.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HHCtTfs7CpxicBx5MCzirE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Pad 9 is geared toward entertainment, it has a few productivity features that come in handy. Launching multi-window mode is about as easy as it gets, and you get the option to have three windows active on the screen at once. MagicOS needs a polish, but on the whole, there are customized software extras that make a difference in daily use.</p>

<p>Oh, and talking about productivity, Honor&apos;s bundled keyboard is terrific; it connects via Bluetooth, and the keys have good travel. It&apos;s not as good as the Magic Keyboard, but then again, it doesn&apos;t cost anywhere as much. The case that includes the keyboard has decent protection as well.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-pad-9-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Honor Pad 9: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gDCKQKqFDf3RF8M4MgncnF" name="honor-pad-9-11.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gDCKQKqFDf3RF8M4MgncnF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hardware is the clearest indicator that the Pad 9 is aimed at the budget segment. The tablet is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 6 Gen 1, and it doesn&apos;t have the requisite power to run demanding games. Sure, it is adequate for mundane tasks that include browsing the web and playing casual games, but it has its limitations when it comes to heavy workloads.</p>
<p>The tablet misses out on Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, a 3.5mm jack, and MicroSD slot. Of course, most phones don&apos;t have a 3.5mm jack or MicroSD slot either, but it&apos;s just easier to add these features into a tablet, where there&apos;s considerably more real estate. On that note, you don&apos;t get a fingerprint sensor either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="v63CPNkaj9MmymLbiK3sbF" name="honor-pad-9-10.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v63CPNkaj9MmymLbiK3sbF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the biggest issue is the software; as of April 2024, the Pad 9 still runs Magic OS 7.2 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a>, and that just isn&apos;t good enough. Most brands do a good job delivering timely updates to their phones, but tablets are still a distinct afterthought, and that needs to change.</p>
<p>On the subject of change, Honor says it will deliver just one platform update to the Pad 9 along with three years of security updates; that means the only update rolling out to the Pad 9 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, which it should have launched with.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-pad-9-the-competition"><span>Honor Pad 9: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HzdkqeGetZqioR3886tezH" name="honor-pad-9-24.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HzdkqeGetZqioR3886tezH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like Xiaomi&apos;s Pad 6, and it also has a large screen and a metallic chassis that&apos;s built to last. It is significantly faster in daily use, has a larger battery, and has better onboard audio. That said, coming in at £399, the Pad 6 is noticeably costlier than the Pad 9. The cost differential isn&apos;t as high in India — where the Pad 6 costs ₹26,999 — but you don&apos;t get a keyboard in the box.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-pad-9-should-you-buy-it"><span>Honor Pad 9: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gt7tr7Bmyf6c8uBog3ioUD" name="honor-pad-9-1.jpg" alt="Honor Pad 9 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gt7tr7Bmyf6c8uBog3ioUD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need an Android tablet to stream content</li><li>You want a large screen that gets bright</li><li>You want a tablet with great battery life</li><li>You need good onboard sound</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a tablet for gaming</li><li>You want biometric authentication</li><li>You want great onboard sound</li><li>You need long-term updates</li></ul>
<p>On the whole, the Pad 9 brings a lot to the table. You get a larger screen than most budget tablets, and the panel itself has good colors and adequate brightness levels. I understand why budget tablets use LCD panels in lieu of AMOLED, and to Honor&apos;s credit, the brand did a good job with the screen. The pixel density isn&apos;t the best you&apos;ll find, but it holds up incredibly well for streaming content.</p><p>The battery life is also among the best of any budget tablet, and you get a charger in the box. I like the productivity features in MagicOS, but the UI is in need of a fresh coat of paint, and Honor needs to do better with updates — the Pad 9 is still on Android 13 in Q2 2024. And the fact that it will only get one platform update will be a deal-breaker to many.</p><p>The hardware isn&apos;t designed for gaming either; the Pad 9 does a good job in casual titles, but it struggles in demanding games. That said, there are no issues with entertainment, and the tablet is one of the best around if you&apos;re interested in a budget option that lets you stream your Netflix library.</p><p>Ultimately, that&apos;s the biggest differentiator for the Pad 9. The tablet manages to deliver a better design, battery life, and larger screen than its rivals, and that makes it a decent choice in this category — in spite of the update situation — particularly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HONOR-12-1-inch-Protection-Display-Speakers/dp/B0CST8ZHBC">considering it costs £249</a>. </p>

<ul><li>Android users can manage their location-sharing settings in each app that supports them right now, but that might be changing soon. </li><li>A recent Google Play Services update revealed a new Google Location Sharing page in the settings app, which requires manual activation.</li><li>This menu will house all settings related to Google's location-sharing offerings, including six apps. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Location sharing is used in a handful of Google apps, but managing location permissions is currently done on a per-app basis. However, it looks like Google is preparing to add all these location-sharing settings to a new menu called <strong>Google Location Sharing</strong> in the settings app. Android leaker AssembleDebug revealed the unreleased page to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/13/google-location-sharing-revamp/" target="_blank">PiunikaWeb</a>, which became available for manual activation after the latest Google Play Services update.</p><p>Version <strong>24.15.14 </strong>of Google Play Services introduces the settings menu, which is behind the <strong>Location Services</strong> tab. For now, if a user navigates to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Location</strong> > <strong>Location Services</strong> > <strong>Google Location Sharing</strong>, they will only be able to follow a link to a webpage that manages these shares with approved people. Of course, this is after the page is activated. Presumably, there will eventually be toggles and options related to location shares directly on this page at some point. </p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-share-your-location-in-google-maps">location sharing</a>, Android users can let people they trust view their real-time location information. However, there are multiple apps where users can start sharing their location (or their device&apos;s location) with others. They include Google Maps, Personal Safety, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-google-find-my-device-network-works-why-you-should-care">Find My Device</a>. As such, if a user wants to rescind location-sharing permission, they&apos;ll need to remember which app was used to initiate the share.</p><p>The Google Location Sharing menu would eliminate this necessity. As the company explains in the blank settings page, Android users will be able to "manage any existing location shares regardless of which app they were created in."</p>

<p>AssembleDebug poked around in the Google Play Services update and found a list of six apps, encoded in base64, that are whitelisted to appear in the Google Location Sharing menu. The known apps are Google Maps, Find My Device and Personal Safety. However, there are reportedly six total apps that will be supported, and there&apos;s a good chance the Family Link app will be one of those. </p><p>Google is clearly testing this new menu, but we don&apos;t know when it&apos;ll be publicly released for Android users.

<ul><li>Approximately 576,000 Roku accounts were accessed through a credential stuffing attack, the company confirmed in an April 12 statement.</li><li>The latest attack comes a month after about 15,000 Roku accounts were breached through the same method of attack. </li><li>While the hackers couldn't access "sensitive user information or full credit card information," they successfully made purchases within Roku using fewer than 400 breached accounts. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/roku-tv-to-gain-new-enhancements-in-the-coming-months">Roku</a> suffered a limited security incident last month that left roughly 15,000 user accounts vulnerable, and now, another 576,000 have been impacted by a second attack. The company announced that over half a million accounts were fraudulently accessed through credential stuffing in an April 12 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roku.com/blog/protecting-your-roku-account" target="_blank">statement</a>. While hackers were unable to access sensitive information, they were able to make purchases using a very limited number of Roku accounts. </p><p>Credential stuffing is a method of attack in which hackers use previously leaked login credentials on popular sites. That&apos;s why cybersecurity experts warn against using the same password on two different websites. If the password to one account is leaked in a hack, bad actors can try to use that same username and password combination to log in to another. Roku says that since this was a credential-stuffing attack, it was not the source of the login credentials used to breach the 576,000 accounts.</p><p>"There is no indication that Roku was the source of the account credentials used in these attacks or that Roku’s systems were compromised in either incident," the company explained in the statement. "Rather, it is likely that login credentials used in these attacks were taken from another source, like another online account, where the affected users may have used the same credentials."</p><p>Roku says that the hackers did not access sensitive information or full credit card information. However, in less than 400 incidents, the bad actors were able to purchase Roku hardware or subscribe to streaming services. In those cases, Roku refunds the users or reverses the transactions. </p>

<p>Roku will notify customers directly if they&apos;ve been impacted by either account breach. Moving forward, the company will make two-factor authentication mandatory on all accounts to try to nix credential stuffing. After logging into Roku next, users will be prompted to verify their login with a link sent via email.</p><p>Since the company has 80 million active users, this breach is fairly small in the grand scheme of things. Still, if you have a Roku account, it&apos;s worth checking to see if you were affected. However, Roku automatically resets account passwords for affected users. Even if your account wasn&apos;t affected, be sure to practice good online security habits and use different passwords for each account you create. To make it less of a hassle, you can start using one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-password-managers-android">best password managers</a>.</p>

<ul><li>While lawmakers ponder the making of the proposed Journalism Preservation Act law, Google is previewing the consequences of that decision in a limited test.</li><li>Google is removing links to California news sites for a limited number of users due to the proposed law, which would require the company to pay publishers for links and aggregated content from news articles.</li><li>Additionally, Google is pausing investments in the California news ecosystem due to a lack of "clarity on California's regulatory environment."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Much like Canada&apos;s<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/pl/charter-charte/c18_1.html"> Bill-C 18</a>, which surprised Google, California might also get this fair share of link tax. Google has consistently opposed calls for a "link tax" that would require the company to pay publishers for linked and aggregated content appearing in search results. While the California state legislature ponders the California Journalism Preservation Act (CJPA), which will do just that, Google is starting to remove links to California news sites. The company announced this move in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/news/california-journalism-preservation-act-puts-news-ecosystem-at-risk/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on April 12, and although it&apos;s only a test for now, this change could become permanent if the bill becomes law.</p><p>"If passed, CJPA may result in significant changes to the services we can offer Californians and the traffic we can provide to California publishers," said Jaffer Zaidi, Google&apos;s vice president of Global News Partnerships. "If enacted, CJPA in its current form would create a level of business uncertainty that no company could accept."</p><p>Essentially, instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-paying-news-publishers-to-publish-ai-content">paying publishers for their content</a> as would be required by the JCPA, Google plans to stop linking to news sites that would be covered by the law. The company has outlined plans for similar laws and jurisdictions, such as Canada. To prepare for the implications of the JCPA, Google says it is conducting a limited test that removes links to California news sites. </p><p>Google also will pause investments in the California news ecosystem "until there&apos;s clarity on California&apos;s regulatory environment."</p><p>The bill&apos;s supporters want to help news publishers survive at a time when their content is often aggregated in search results or shared on social media. In these cases, news outlets may receive little or no compensation for their work. The JCPA would shift this model, forcing companies like Google and Meta to pay for links to certain news outlets.</p><p>“Google’s suppression today of California news demonstrates exactly why the California Legislature needs to pass legislation to rein in the tech colossus," said Charles Champion, the president and CEO of the California News Publishers Association, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/CNPAservices/status/1778910785651228701" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter). "The fact that one company can shut down the means by which 90% of the public find online content in order to achieve their own political and business ends show just how much policymakers need to act, and act now."</p><p>Champion urged California lawmakers to look to examples of similar situations in Australia in Canada. Despite pushback, legislators in both countries proceeded with "link tax" laws, and Champion says "journalism jobs surged as a result."</p><p>Google uses information from news outlets and other sites in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-testing-four-featured-snippets">"featured snippets,"</a> which summarize the sites&apos; contents and disincentivize users from clicking through to the original source. In turn, this can cut out opportunities for news sites to earn through ad revenue. While we don&apos;t know exactly how much Google makes due to these practices, one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24129986/paying-for-news.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> estimated the company owes publishers $10-12 billion annually. </p>

The first public beta of Android 15 is now available, and you can install the update on your Pixel if you&apos;re interested in taking an early look at all the features that are coming to Android this year. </p>
<p>But before you install the beta, there are a few things to be aware of. The first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> beta is still very buggy, so I wouldn&apos;t advice installing it on your daily driver. </p><p>If you&apos;ve got a spare Pixel lying around and want to take a look at Android 15 as it is today, then sure, scroll down below for instructions on how to install the beta. </p><p>Things should stabilize with Beta 2 or Beta 3 as Google works out the kinks, and I&apos;ll update this post after those builds go live. Google&apos;s beta release timeline hasn&apos;t changed, so the next build will be showing up in May. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="skASRE5PwdHQGoTTr98rLg" name="android-15-logo-hand.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/skASRE5PwdHQGoTTr98rLg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> was an iterative upgrade that didn&apos;t actually introduce a lot of new features, things are different with Android 15. Google is rolling out a ton of user-facing changes this time around, and that alone is cause for excitement. </p><p>Granted, most of these features are yet to go live, with Google instead focusing its attention on under-the-hood changes and other additions coming to Android 15. That said, if you&apos;re using Android 14 right now, there is a lot to like in Android 15. </p><p>With that out of the way, here&apos;s how to install the Android 15 beta.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-which-phones-can-download-the-android-15-beta"><span>Which phones can download the Android 15 Beta?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g9Bi4RbHqqdWBpSRdhqiWg" name="android-15-logo-devices.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g9Bi4RbHqqdWBpSRdhqiWg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this moment, the Android 15 beta is limited to Pixel devices starting from the Pixel 6. The list includes 10 devices in total: </p>
<ul><li>Pixel 6</li><li>Pixel 6 Pro</li><li>Pixel 6a</li><li>Pixel 7</li><li>Pixel 7 Pro</li><li>Pixel 7a</li><li>Pixel 8</li><li>Pixel 8 Pro</li><li>Pixel Fold</li><li>Pixel Tablet</li></ul>
<p>The Pixel 5 and 5a miss out on the beta, and for now, you can only install Android 15 on Google&apos;s own devices. That will change very soon as Google allows the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> to get in on the action, and we&apos;re likely to see OPPO, Vivo, Realme, OnePlus, ASUS, and others join in on the action. We&apos;ll know more at I/O in May. </p>

<p>The easiest and simplest way to get the Android 15 beta is to enroll in the <strong>Android Beta Program</strong>.</p>
<p>Simply visit the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">Android Beta portal</a>, where you&apos;ll be able to view all the devices eligible for the Android 15 beta. You can then opt-in to the beta, which will then prompt Google to send your phone or tablet an over-the-air update. You should then be able to install the update and restart your phone to make the switch to Android 15. </p>
<p>1. Head to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"><strong>Android Beta program portal</strong></a> on your Pixel phone.</p><p>2. Sign in to the <strong>Google account</strong> associated with that phone.</p><p>3. Scroll down to <strong>Your eligible devices</strong>.</p><p>4. Find the device you want to enroll in the <strong>Beta program</strong> and tap <strong>Opt-in</strong>.</p><p>5. Follow the prompts on your phone to accept the <strong>over-the-air download</strong>.</p>

<p>You can easily opt out of the beta program by going to the same Android Beta portal as you did to enroll, scrolling down to your device, and selecting <strong>Opt out</strong>. But be warned; doing so will get rid of all the data on your phone.</p>

<p>You can also use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://flash.android.com">Android Flash Tool</a>, a web-based version of the ADB developer tool, to install the Android 15 beta onto your phone.</p>
<p>1. Head to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://flash.android.com"><strong>Android Flash Tool site</strong></a>.</p><p>2. Allow the site to <strong>access ADB</strong> in your browser.</p><p>3. Enable <strong>Developer Mode</strong> on your phone (tap Android build seven times).</p><p>4. <strong>Enable USB Debugging</strong> in the Developer Settings.</p><p>5. <strong>Enable OEM Unlocking</strong> on your device.</p><p>6. Plug in your phone to a <strong>USB port</strong> on your computer.</p><p>7. Select the device from the pop-up and <strong>follow the instructions</strong> to install the beta.</p>

<p>If you want to try Android 15 on your Pixel manually, you&apos;ll have to flash the OTA onto your Pixel. But before we get started, know that this method will involve deleting all data on your phone; if you don&apos;t want to do that, use the Flash Tool above and sideload the Android 15 beta instead.  </p><p>Before you start doing this, make sure that no OTA updates are yet to be installed on your Pixel. Go to <strong>Settings > About phone > System updates</strong> and see no pending updates. Also, ensure that you have <strong>USB debugging</strong> enabled on your phone.</p>
<p>To get started, head to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/download-ota">Android 15 OTA images page</a>, and download the relevant build for your Pixel. To sideload the build onto your Pixel, you&apos;ll need to use ADB — I&apos;m a fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://adb.clockworkmod.com/">Universal ADB Drivers</a>. Once installed on your Windows machine and the OTA image has been downloaded, you can start sideloading the build.</p>
<p>You&apos;ll first need to put your phone in recovery mode. You can power off and then <strong>hold the Power button</strong> along with the <strong>Volume Down</strong> button for a few seconds to enter the bootloader menu and select the recovery option using the <strong>Volume Down</strong> button.</p>
<p>Here, you should see the Android mascot face down with an exclamation mark over it. Hold down the <strong>Power button</strong> and press <strong>Volume Up</strong> once to enter recovery mode. Next, navigate to the option that says <strong>Apply update from ADB</strong> by using the <strong>Volume Up</strong> button and confirm the selection by pressing the <strong>Power button</strong> once.</p>
<p>Now you are ready to sideload the OTA image. Confirm that your phone can connect to your computer and is detectable. For this, plug your Pixel into your computer and run this command:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code>adb devices</code></pre>
<p>You should see your phone&apos;s serial number and <strong>sideload</strong> next to it. Now we can get to flashing the OTA build; just run this in CMD:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code>adb sideload ota_file.zip</code></pre>
<p>Here, you will need to switch out <strong>ota_file.zip</strong> with the filename of the OTA build for your particular device. I&apos;m installing Android 15 on a Pixel 8, so I entered the following: <strong>shiba_beta-ota-ap31.240322.018-236bea75.zip</strong> into CMD. For this to work, make sure that the OTA file is in the same directory as the CMD path.</p>
<p>Once the OTA file is transferred to your phone, it should go back to the recovery menu. Navigate to <strong>Reboot system now</strong> and confirm with the <strong>Power</strong> button to restart your phone. The OTA update will be installed and your phone will switch to Android 15 without losing any data.</p>

<p>We&apos;re just getting started with Android 15, and we should see more feature additions as we get closer to the stable build. Like previous years, the Android 15 beta program will include four beta builds, with the second rolling out shortly in May. The June build — Android 15 Beta 3 — should be stable as Google rolls out a slew of bug fixes based on feedback from earlier beta versions. </p>

<p>The ROG Phone 8 Pro is an incredible gaming phone, but it doesn't have the same aggressive design that sets earlier devices apart. You instead have a much more streamlined design that looks good in its own right, but ASUS didn't omit any of the gaming extras. If you need a phone to play games on Android, the ROG Phone 8 Pro is the best of the lot. </p></p>

<p>The ROG Phone 7 Ultimate is still an outstanding gaming phone, featuring a large AMOLED screen that goes up to an insane 165Hz, liquid-cooled hardware that's phenomenal, and a 6000mAh battery. The phone has bold styling, a second screen at the back that can be customized with various effects, ultrasonic triggers on the sides that you can use with in-game actions, and a side-mounted USB-C port.</p></p>

It is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 9000+, and it has a vent that opens to allow cool air to flow into the chassis. It comes with ASUS's AeroActive Cooler bundled in the box, and while it isn't officially available in North America, you can get it in other global markets.</p></p>

<p>With ASUS now focusing on two distinct product lines, it doesn&apos;t make as many phones as it used to. That said, this condensed strategy is working well for the brand, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a> is a great overall product that nails the basics. It isn&apos;t a small phone like its predecessors, but it has the right balance between hardware optimization and clean software, and the larger size allows it to stand out. </p><p>Of course, if you need a small phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10</a> is still the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best small phone</a> you can get today. Right now, there isn&apos;t another device that has the same caliber of hardware as the Zenfone 10 in such a small size, and that alone makes it worthy of consideration. </p>
<p>If you want something aimed at gaming, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-review">ROG Phone 8 Pro</a> delivers outstanding hardware backed by a whole suite of gaming-focused features. The phone isn&apos;t as aggressive when it comes to styling, and that is a smart move by ASUS as it allows the device to be much more palatable by a mainstream audience. That said, you don&apos;t miss out on any of the gaming extras, and it is a real joy to use. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>UWB is short for ultra-wideband, a wireless technology that relies on radio waves to accurately gauge distance between objects. Samsung started offering the radio on its flagships with the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, and all subsequent models have the feature as standard. UWB can be used as a virtual car key for select BMW models, and the tech sits at the heart of Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-review">SmartTag+</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ultra-wideband-2">What is ultra-wideband?</h2>
<p>Think of ultra-wideband (UWB) as a turbocharged verison of Bluetooth. The Bluetooth LE (low energy) standard isn&apos;t ideal for location sensing because of the latency — which is usually over 3ms — but with UWB, that is brought down to under 1ms. UWB also has over three times the range of Bluetooth, and can transmit over 20 times the amount of data.</p>
<p>UWB has significant advantages over Bluetooth because it works at a higher frequency — the pulse-based technology uses spectrum from 3.1GHz to 10.6GHz. It also uses wider 500MHz channels to transmit data (Bluetooth is usually limited to 20MHz) and this allows the standard to send or receive a burst of data in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>UWB is an emerging standard, and as such it is limited to flagships. Apple, Google, and Samsung are the three brands that offer it on their flagships, so if you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, you will be able to use the radio to unlock additional features. </p><p>Auto manufacturers are embracing the standard as an easy way to unlock cars, with the likes of BMW, Audi, Ford, and others rolling out UWB compatibility to their latest models. So if you have a phone with UWB, you can use it to unlock your car. </p>
<p>Samsung&apos;s SmartTag+ is a UWB-based tracker that delivers much better range and accuracy than the standard SmartTag, which still relies on Bluetooth. </p>
<h2 id="which-samsung-phones-have-uwb-2">Which Samsung phones have UWB?</h2>
<p>Samsung started integrating UWB into its flagships with the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra back in 2020, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> include the feature as standard. </p>
<p>That said, Samsung is picky about what models get UWB connectivity; the standard model in its Galaxy S series misses out on the feature, and it is limited to the Plus and Ultra models. </p>

<p>In addition to phones, UWB tech is slowly making its way to connected devices and earbuds, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Galaxy Buds Pro 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a> featuring the tech.

OnePlus isn&apos;t making too many changes with the Nord CE4; the phone has the same 120Hz screen, but it has a bit more power thanks to the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, a larger battery with 100W charging, and a new 50MP camera at the back.</p><p>However, the Nord CE4 has inherent limitations; the phone will get just two Android platform updates, there&apos;s no alert slider, and the cameras don&apos;t do a passable job when it comes to shooting videos. With Nothing setting the bar high in this segment thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a>, OnePlus had to deliver the best possible device to be able to measure up.</p><p>But it hasn&apos;t done that. The Chinese manufacturer instead focused on iterative upgrades without addressing key shortcomings of the Nord CE series, and in doing so, it made the CE4 a poor overall choice in this segment.</p>

<p>OnePlus unveiled the Nord CE4 in India on April 1, and the phone is now available for sale in the country. The phone is sold in Celadon Marble (the model I&apos;m using) and Dark Chrome color variants, and it retails for ₹24,999 ($300). That&apos;s for the variant that has 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and if you need more storage, there&apos;s an 8GB/256GB version that&apos;s available for ₹26,999 ($324).</p><p>OnePlus has a few launch incentives that discount the phone by up to ₹1,500 ($18) with select cards, and you can get an additional ₹2,500 ($30) off by exchanging your current phone.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UKWfx9eVakmvogkVAE4g5Q" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-5.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UKWfx9eVakmvogkVAE4g5Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus likes to switch up the design of Nord CE phones with every generation, and that&apos;s the case with the CE4 as well. The phone doesn&apos;t have many similarities to the Nord CE3, with OnePlus now offering an oblong camera housing that looks a lot cleaner.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4YzwYwTmS8garg7EfRVZHQ" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-11.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4YzwYwTmS8garg7EfRVZHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The choice of color is interesting as well; the Celadon Marble variant has a distinctive pattern at the back that stands out, and while the hue isn&apos;t as vibrant, it evokes similarities to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-marble-odyssey-hands-on">OnePlus 11 Marble Odyssey</a> and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>. The back has a glossy finish and is prone to picking up smudges, and it has a subtle curve where the back meets the mid-frame.</p>
<p>The back and mid-frame are made out of polycarbonate, and I have no problems with that. The phone has flat sides, but you get beveled edges that make holding and using it a little easier. There&apos;s also an IR blaster and MicroSD slot, so if you need to extend storage the old-fashioned way, you can do that with ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dXsVFueir4J5T4YTWgAU6T" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-8.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dXsVFueir4J5T4YTWgAU6T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think the design looks fresh and elegant — particularly with the Celadon Marble version — and the addition of IP54 ingress protection makes the Nord CE4 that much more resilient to the elements. Another intriguing feature that made its way from the OnePlus 12/12R is the Aqua Touch tech that lets you use the device with wet fingers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TbzQWbBRyrmta6ehXswvVR" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-16.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TbzQWbBRyrmta6ehXswvVR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the panel, the Nord CE4 has the same 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED screen as last year, and it is serviceable. You can set the refresh rate to 60Hz or 120Hz, and there&apos;s an auto mode that changes it on the fly. OnePlus is using a custom Panda Glass solution instead of the standard Gorilla Glass over the screen, and while the manufacturer says the phone is able to withstand a tumble from 1.5 meters, I didn&apos;t put that to the test.</p>

<p>As for the hardware, the Nord CE4 is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 7 Gen 3; it uses the new Cortex A715 and A510 cores and is built on a 4nm node. You get 8GB of RAM as standard, and the base model has 128GB of UFS 3.1 storage, with the 256GB variant also offering UFS 3.1. The Nord CE3 had 12GB of RAM with the 256GB model, but the CE4 is limited to 8GB across the board. That said, more RAM doesn&apos;t really make a difference, and 8GB is adequate in this scenario.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EcD6TfdEwQx8n2urHrjbmR" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-14.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EcD6TfdEwQx8n2urHrjbmR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone doesn&apos;t have noticeable lag in daily use, and it does a decent enough job when it comes to gaming — provided you stick to casual games. I didn&apos;t see any issues with overheating or while making calls and in general daily usage situations, and the Nord CE4 proved to be reliable. The device has Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.4, and the usual AptX HD codec.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7p2yaLfppCSLBESYT6bAiS" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-6.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7p2yaLfppCSLBESYT6bAiS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest change with the Nord CE4 is the battery — the phone now has a 5500mAh battery, and there&apos;s 100W charging. It takes just over 30 minutes to fully charge the battery, and there really isn&apos;t another device in this segment that comes close to the Nord CE4 in this regard. Battery life is outstanding as well, and I easily got a day and a half between charges.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="o768fGrxpEGfgJQNNXLcQS" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-9.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o768fGrxpEGfgJQNNXLcQS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Cameras continue to be a big differentiator in this category, and the Nord CE4 uses a new 50MP Sony LYT600 sensor with OIS. That&apos;s joined by an 8MP wide-angle lens that features the Sony IMX355, and at the front, you get a 16MP module.</p>

<p>The camera takes good photos in most situations, and I don&apos;t have any problems in this regard. Daylight photos have good detail rendition and dynamic range, and the device is able to lock in on a subject with ease, and maintain focus. The camera does a decent job in low-light scenarios as well, and while there is some noise, you get good details and colors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6HAsriMVv4HH2ejG8G9PVQ" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-17.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6HAsriMVv4HH2ejG8G9PVQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the software side of things, you get the same ColorOS 14 interface based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> as other OnePlus phones, and there isn&apos;t much to talk about. The UI is modern and has a few Material You-based options that allow you to customize accent colors to your preferences, and there is no shortage of customizability.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-nord-ce4-what-i-don-t-like"><span>OnePlus Nord CE4: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZujpyJZfrAEuaWwgwc9tST" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-7.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZujpyJZfrAEuaWwgwc9tST.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the design is good, the Nord CE4 doesn&apos;t quite have the same in-hand feel as other devices in this segment; the edges tend to dig into the palm, and that makes using the phone without a case mildly annoying. Then there&apos;s the fact that you miss out on the alert slider — even OPPO phones now have the slider, so I don&apos;t understand why OnePlus can&apos;t be bothered to add the feature to its devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="inBYhd3NhttZpjcKig7hfQ" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-13.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/inBYhd3NhttZpjcKig7hfQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are issues with the screen as well; colors have a distinct cooler tone that is evident when streaming videos on the device. Switching to the Natural mode makes a difference, but even then the color balance isn&apos;t dialed in, and I had to adjust the slider all the way to the warm end of the scale to get realistic colors. I didn&apos;t see issues with brightness, but the phone doesn&apos;t get as bright as its rivals — the Phone 2a was much better in outdoor use.</p>
<p>All games are locked to 60fps, and this is a limitation within ColorOS, so regardless of what OnePlus device you&apos;re using, you won&apos;t be able to play high refresh rate titles. So even though you get playable framerates in casual titles, the Adreno 720 isn&apos;t able to handle demanding games, and there is noticeable jitter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PzFD5UCzTWzpQPbrh5B86S" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PzFD5UCzTWzpQPbrh5B86S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Phone 2a does a much better job in this area, and even though it doesn&apos;t have hardware that&apos;s significantly more powerful than what you&apos;re getting here, Nothing&apos;s optimization makes all the difference. And on the subject of hardware, you don&apos;t get NFC; I still don&apos;t get why phone manufacturers omit the feature on their devices, but if you need the radio, you&apos;ll need to get the Nord 3.</p>
<p>It&apos;s good to see OnePlus not bothering with useless sensors like the 2MP macro lens that was a mainstay on its devices, but the downside is that it doesn&apos;t offer a way to shoot macro photos at all. Most brands let you use the main camera or the wide-angle lens to shoot macro shots, but OnePlus hasn&apos;t bothered to do so here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BSQxeF3wKswpdDHAYY3EtQ" name="oneplus-nord-ce4-12.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord CE4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BSQxeF3wKswpdDHAYY3EtQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the wide-angle lens isn&apos;t anywhere as good as the main camera, and it barely delivers passable shots in low-light situations. Video recording is similarly hobbled, and videos taken in daylight are grainy and don&apos;t have much in the way of detail.</p>
<p>But the biggest limitation with the Nord CE4 is the software. OnePlus guarantees just two platform updates with the phone, and that is not enough in 2024. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a> get four updates as standard, and other devices in this segment now offer three Android OS updates, and that puts the Nord CE4 on the backfoot.</p>

<p>If you want the best phone that this segment has to offer, you need to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a>. The device has a much more interesting design with LED lights at the back, the software is clean, uncluttered, fluid, and doesn&apos;t have any bloatware. You also get more software updates, the hardware is optimized like no other budget phone, and there are two usable cameras at the back.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x6-pro-review">POCO X6 Pro</a> is a great choice if you want the best hardware. I like the design of the X6 Pro — particularly in yellow — the panel gets brighter, you get UFS 4.0 storage, NFC, and the Dimensity 8300 Ultra is great at playing demanding games. The software isn&apos;t uncluttered, but it is fluid, and you get three platform updates.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a phone with 100W charging</li><li>You need a MicroSD card slot</li><li>You want a good camera at the back</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a budget phone with the best hardware</li><li>You need clean software</li><li>You want long-term software updates</li><li>You need usable auxiliary cameras</li></ul>
<p>The Nord CE4 has a few things going for it; the phone has the best battery life of any budget phone I tested this year, and the camera holds its own against its rivals. But the rest of the package is lackluster to say the least. OnePlus should have put in more effort to differentiate the phone, because as it stands, I don&apos;t see any reason to recommend it.</p><p>The hardware isn&apos;t the best in this segment, the lack of NFC is irksome, the wide-angle camera doesn&apos;t measure up to the main lens, and there&apos;s no alert slider. But it&apos;s the update policy that ultimately hinders the Nord CE4 — two platform updates are just not good enough anymore, particularly when immediate rivals like the Phone 2a and X6 Pro guarantee three updates as standard.</p><p>OnePlus says the Nord CE series is all about delivering the core essentials that users need, and if that is indeed the case, the company should have thought of adding features that its customers actually care about, like long-term updates and optimized hardware.</p>
