<p>Google Maps is gearing up for the holidays with new features to save your sanity during travel chaos and those inevitable last-minute gift runs.</p><p>Announced in a blog post today, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/15-best-google-maps-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Maps</a> is rolling out a feature that lets you hunt down specific items at nearby stores. Just type what you’re looking for into the search bar, and it’ll show you local spots that have it, along with directions for easy pickup. This handy update covers everything from groceries and home goods to electronics and clothing.</p><p>Google also wants to help you tackle winter commutes with a new feature that gives real-time updates on transit delays due to weather. Drawing information from users and local agencies, Maps lets you see issues like unplowed roads, low visibility, or flooding. Plus, you can pitch in by reporting these disruptions.</p>

<p>Maps' new update is also designed to help you beat the winter blues <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-update-automatically-starts-google-maps-navigation">with a little help from Gemini</a>. Just type in something like “fun winter activities in NYC” and let the ideas roll in. Once you find a spot that catches your eye, you can check for perks like free parking and get the lowdown from user reviews summarized with Gemini.</p><p>Furthermore, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-google-maps-immersive-view">Immersive View</a> will take your travel game up a notch by giving you a clear picture of your route, so you can check out tricky turns, traffic, and even parking spots before you hit the road.</p>

<p>If you're hauling holiday gifts with a trailer, Maps has you covered. Just input your cargo’s size, and it’ll show you routes that avoid low bridges and tunnels. Right now, this feature works on 2024 Chevy Tahoe, Suburban, and GMC Yukon models, with more vehicles getting it soon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2248px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.47%;"><img id="vPFKoEpHAkPmsvPJCQKMgU" name="Google-Maps-trailering-route" alt="trailering route in google maps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vPFKoEpHAkPmsvPJCQKMgU.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2248" height="1112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, EV drivers can now make travel planning a breeze with Maps. Simply use the app on your phone to plan routes with charging stops, then transfer the plan to your car’s built-in Maps. And by adding your vehicle’s make and model, the app will automatically find charging stations that match your car’s plug type.</p><p>To help you beat the holiday traffic, Google is rolling out insights into peak travel trends. By checking traffic patterns, you can find the best times to hit the road and dodge the crowds.</p>

<p>Back in August, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-to-become-smarter-with-gemini-help#xenforo-comments-1070913">announced</a> new AI-powered developments coming to Google Home to enhance the user experience. The search giant is finally rolling out the integration of Gemini AI into the platform.</p><p>Up until now, Google's Nest Cameras and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> have offered functionalities like the ability to recognize people and their motions next to receiving package notifications. With the latest AI integration, the cameras can now understand and comprehend the context of what's actually happening.</p>

The primary features of the latest development are AI descriptions and search camera history. While the former allows you to add descriptions to your recorded camera clips, the latter will enable you to search the history with phrases like "Did the kids play in the backyard this afternoon?" or "Was a delivery truck here today?"</p><p>These new AI features will first roll out to select Nest Aware Plus users who signed up through the Home app and are part of the Public Preview. For now, they're available in English for U.S. users.</p>

<p>Google's popular script editor for Google Home also integrates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> with a new "Help me create" feature. The aim is to improve home automation skills, making it more accessible. Here are some examples that Google cites that you can create with the upcoming AI feature:</p>
<h2 id="security-2">Security</h2>
<ul><li>Remember to lock up at night</li><li>Make it seem like someone's home</li></ul>
<h2 id="health-and-wellness-2">Health and Wellness</h2>
<ul><li>Help me sleep better</li><li>Set up morning workouts</li></ul>
<h2 id="convenience-at-home-2">Convenience at Home</h2>
<ul><li>Announce dinner time</li></ul>
<h2 id="getting-things-done-2">Getting Things Done</h2>
<ul><li>Remind me to take out the trash</li><li>Help me remember to pick up packages</li></ul>
<p>If you're not sure what automation to set up, Google Home will offer suggestions based on the devices you typically use. This feature will be available to Nest Aware Plus subscribers and is in Public Preview, with plans to roll out later this year.</p><p>The new update also brings a Google Home extension for the Gemini app, letting users control their smart devices directly from the app on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p><p>Pixel Watch owners can also get their Nest Cam and Doorbell feed on their smartwatches, allowing users to talk to people while seeing the live feed on their wrists. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> is believed to be the first device to receive this interesting feature.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> owners can now interact with their Nest Doorbell notifications on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>. A new clock, dubbed the dream clock, turns your tablet into a clock when it is sitting idle, and users can choose to see the clock in either digital or analog format.</p><p>The tablet is also gaining a new Home panel screen saver that lets you control smart home devices. With the latest update, a similar home panel is also venturing into Google TVs, which adds the convenience of controlling your smart home without pausing your favorite show or movie.</p>

<p>The year 2024 is nearly coming to a close and it's amazing to see that flagship smartphone launches are still going strong. In an effort to be one of the first out there with the most powerful processor on an Android phone, the OnePlus 13 has already launched in China. The new phone comes with a host of upgrades, built on the strengths of the OnePlus 12. We should expect the global launch to be sometime in January, if not sooner.</p><p>One of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best flagships</a> of 2024 is easily the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. This $1,000+ smartphone is now a bit cheaper than when it launched and should be good competition to the OnePlus 13. It might not look it, but both phones have roughly the same screen size and share many features. If it's the OnePlus 13 vs. Galaxy S24 UItra, which flagship do you choose?</p>

<p>OnePlus is finally breaking away from its typical design language for its flagships and is embracing the flat-frame mania. We now have a flat aluminium frame running along the sides of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, with a 2.5D curve for the back and front panels. We haven't held the phone yet, but it looks like it should be a comfortable fit. There's a new blue colour which looks striking, especially against the silver camera dial. This shade is said to have a vegan-leather back panel. The black variant is supposed to have a wood-grain texture on the glass, while the white has a smooth glass finish.</p><p>Going by the specs of the Chinese model, the blue variant of the OnePlus 13 is 8.9mm thick and weighs 210g, while the glass variants are 8.5mm thick and weigh 213g. Both variants are actually slimmer and lighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> and match the S24 Ultra in thickness.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9qKXtbtAV6H5ijMbkftky9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-all-colors-02.jpg" alt="All four retail colors of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9qKXtbtAV6H5ijMbkftky9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> is noticeably heavier at 232g, and appears larger due to the almost rectangular design with sharper corners. The display is completely flat though, which some might prefer over a slight curve along the edges. The Ultra is also a bit wider than the OnePlus 13 as it stores the S Pen stylus within the body. The Ultra comes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-galaxy-s24-ultra-should-you-buy">more colors</a> than the 13, including three exclusive shades if you buy it via Samsung's website.</p><p>The S24 Ultra has a distinctive design for sure, and there's no mistaking it for any other phone (other than its predecessor perhaps). Similarly, the OnePlus 13 is unmistakably a OnePlus phone with its massive camera dial on the back.</p><p>Both phones have the same display size. The OnePlus 13 has similar display specs as the 12, which includes a 6.82-inch QHD+ AMOLED display with an adaptive 1Hz to 120Hz refresh rate. It has a typical brightness level of 800 nits, but can go up to 4,500 nits (peak). The display can do Dolby Vision HDR playback and is said to be DisplayMate A++ certified. The 13 uses DC dimming at all brightness levels, which should make it more pleasant to view for those who are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM flicker-sensitive</a>.</p>

<p>We've said in our review of the S24 Ultra that is has the best display in any Samsung phone to date. The new anti-glare screen coating is a game-changer and it makes a huge difference when using the phone under the sun, outdoors. The 6.82-inch AMOLED panel has 2,600 nits of peak brightness and 120Hz LTPO refresh rate tech. It uses PWM dimming but the rate is high enough to not be an issue if you have sensitivity issues.</p><p>Most flagships in 2024 topped out with an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, the S24 Ultra included. The OnePlus 13 though features a dual IP68/IP69 rating, which helps protect it against jets of water (both hot and cold). This is quite impressive and we should be seeing many more flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-takes-things-to-a-whole-new-level-with-the-x200-series">Vivo X200 series</a>, also follow suit.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k8uq6C3DgSNoTTnwmaav7V" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-Google-Circle-to-Search-01.jpg" alt="Using Google Circle to Search on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k8uq6C3DgSNoTTnwmaav7V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As of publishing this article, the OnePlus 13 hasn't launched globally yet and is only available in China. We're using the specs of the Chinese variant in this comparison as it should be similar to what we'll get with the global variant too, with the exception of the OS and some storage variants. Doing a direct conversion of the Chinese pricing, the 13 costs roughly $630 for the 12GB/256GB variant. The 12GB and 16GB RAM variants, both with 512GB of storage, cost a converted $688 and $744 respectively. The top-end variant with 24GB RAM and 1TB storage will most likely be a China-exclusive yet again, and this costs roughly $842.</p><p>Considering the global variants have generally cost $100 more than the China pricing, we could be looking at a higher starting price of around $750 or more for the global variant in the U.S.. I'm sure OnePlus will have exchange offers at launch to offset this price increase, so that would be a good time to get the 13 at a cheaper price.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's official starting price is $1,299.99, although you can find it for a bit less in places like Amazon. The 512GB variant costs $1,419.99 and the 1TB variant costs $1,659.99. All variants come with 12GB of RAM. Even with the 13's price increase, it's still going to be cheaper than the S24 Ultra. You'll even be getting plenty more RAM in the higher variants.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of the OnePlus 13 is the new Qualcomm SoC. It's the recently announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> which promises huge gains across performance, power efficiency, and AI processing. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15">Xiaomi 15</a> is the other phone sporting this new chip, which is slated for a global launch before the year ends. In terms of benchmark numbers and certain real-world usage scenarios, the OnePlus 13 should be able to outperform the Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>The Ultra is no slouch though as the custom 'Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy' SoC it uses can still run laps around even Google's latest Tensor G4 chip when it comes to sustained performance. In our review, the phone didn't break a sweat ploughing through even the most graphically demanding games.</p><p>Battery life is another strong point of the S24 Ultra, as we consistently managed two full days on a single charge even with the brightness set to 100% most of the time. It is highly possible though that the OnePlus 13 could comfortably beat the Ultra's marathon run thanks to its larger 6,000mAh capacity and more efficient 3nm processor. Given the OnePlus 12's amazing battery life, we're sure the 13 is going to be just as great, if not better.</p><p>OnePlus still rules when it comes to charging speeds, and the fact that you get the charger in the box is a massive bonus. The 13 supports 100W wired charging and 50W wireless charging. This is miles ahead compared to the paltry 45W wired and 15W wireless for the S24 Ultra.</p>

<p>Finally, the cameras are going to be a major differentiating factor between the OnePlus 13 and Galaxy S24 Ultra. The 13 uses the same 50MP main sensor as the OnePlus 12, but the telephoto and ultrawide cameras also get 50MP sensors. The telephoto still has 3x optical zoom and the same aperture, but with a slightly longer focal length. The ultrawide has a wider field of view, a wider aperture for more light capture, and retains autofocus for macro photography. OnePlus says it has improved the Hassleblad tunning for all its cameras on the 13.</p><p>One feature that the company is highlighting is the phone's incredibly fast shutter speed of 1/10,000 of a second which is supposed to let you capture really fast motion with great clarity. We'll definitely be putting this to the test once we get our hands on the OnePlus 13. This is also one area where Samsung has typically struggled with, capturing fast-moving subjects without blurring.</p><p>Samsung flagships have typically had reliable cameras and apart from the shutter lag issue, all the cameras are highly serviceable. The Ultra model has been known for its incredible zoom performance, and that holds true for the S24 Ultra too. You can go up to 100x with it, although sharpness and details take a massive hit at this extreme. The Ultra even has autofocus for its 12MP selfie camera which should be able to deliver better depth in photos compared to the 13's 32MP camera.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra currently runs One UI 6.1.1 which is based on Android 14. This should soon change early next year when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">One UI 7</a> rolls out, which is based on Android 15. This new version is expected to get a host of new features, including an AI-driven notification summary feature similar to Apple Intelligence on iPhones. We can also expect more Galaxy AI and parental features too, going by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">recent leak</a>. If this is your first time with One UI, then there would be a small learning curve, especially given the amount of gestures, shortcuts, and features that Samsung packs in it.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 will ship with OxygenOS 15 which is based on Android 15. If you're curious to know what you can expect, then we're happy to say that it's mostly positive so far. We <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">used OxygenOS 15 for a week</a> and came away impressed with some of the new additions, especially the AI features. Tools like AI Unblur, AI Detail Boost, and Reflection Eraser did a good job in our limited testing, and were on par in some cases with Pixel's AI features.</p><p>One thing that remains to be seen is whether OnePlus will match Samsung's seven-year commitment to OS upgrades. The OnePlus 12 is promised four years, so we should expect the 13 to have that too at the very least.</p>

<p>Everything points to the OnePlus 13 being yet another banger of a flagship, and it's priced very well (going by our estimation) compared to the Samsung S24 Ultra. I would recommend the 13 over the Ultra once it launches globally, provided you are okay with paying the full price upfront and don't really need a stylus. Compared to the Ultra, you're getting a more powerful smartphone, better water-proofing, a larger battery and faster charging, the latest software on day one, and some impressive camera capabilities — all for well under $1,000.</p><p>The S24 Ultra will be succeeded by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> in early 2025, which is when it should hopefully get a permanent price cut. It's also more affordable if you buy it via a carrier, as you'll be paying a small monthly fee rather than the full price. Unlike the OnePlus 13, the S24 Ultra should also have better 5G compatibility with U.S. carriers, with support for mmWave 5G.</p>

<p>Even though the OnePlus 13 has yet to be launched in the United States, the dual IP68/IP69 rating is exciting for the Chinese model. Why? Well, the OnePlus 12 variants for the U.S. and China both have an IP65 rating. The OnePlus 13's IP68/IP69 rating for the Chinese model gives U.S. users hope that the U.S. variant will also have that rating.</p><p>The official listing for the U.S. model is unavailable yet, but hopefully, you won't have to wait too long. With that rating, you're looking at a phone with a rating superior to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://proof.vanilla.tools/androidcentral/articles/edit/aBXQefYdivSPLetPsa4CA7" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p>An IP68 rating means the OnePlus 13 can be submerged in 1.5 meters of water for 30 minutes.  IP stands for ingress protection, a grading system from the International Electrotechnical Commission that certifies how well a device is protected from dust and water.</p><p>The six in the IP68 rating means the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> is dust-tight and well-protected against dust particles. Six is the highest number you'll see, and zero is the lowest, meaning it has zero dust protection. However, if you see an X instead of a zero, the company did not test the device for dust resistance, but it does not necessarily mean it has none.</p><p>The second number indicates how well a device is protected against water. X means the phone has not been tested, and zero indicates no protection. The highest water resistance number on the scale is 9, which means it can withstand high-pressure water jets and is highly protected against steam cleaning and high-pressure liquids at a close range.</p><p>Despite having an excellent rating, you should be cautious about exposing your phone to harsh chemicals such as cleaning products, sugary drinks, or highly chlorinated pools. If you accidentally spill any harsh chemicals on your phone, immediately rinse it and dry it with a clean microfiber cloth.</p><p>A device with an IP69 rating undergoes additional testing compared to those with an IP68. Additionally, unlike a device with an IP68 rating, it isn't meant for submerging. You might think you could submerge it more with a higher rating, but that is false.</p><p>An IP69 rating is usually found in areas where intense cleaning is standard, such as medical equipment, food processing, and specific industrial settings.</p>
<h2 id="can-the-ip68-ip69-rating-deteriorate-over-time-2">Can the IP68/IP69 rating deteriorate over time?</h2>
<p>Yes! When you take the phone out of the box, it's at its highest level of protection. However, this rating can decrease over time if it is not properly maintained.</p><p>For example, exposing your phone to extreme temperatures or dropping it can damage the seals over time.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The smartphone design pendulum is once again swinging in the direction of ultra-thin devices. The latest rumors indicate that Apple and Samsung are both exploring a premium flagship that prioritizes thinness, and they could debut as part of the iPhone 17 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S25 series</a>. However, for the past decade, phone manufacturers pressed pause on their quest for thinness, instead focusing on things like battery life, camera quality, and performance.</p><p>That's why many iOS and Android fans are probably scoffing at the idea of sacrificing key features in the name of thinness. I don't blame anyone for holding that viewpoint — the last time OEMs tried to make the thinnest phone possible, it didn't end well. Anyone remember the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which were so thin they would literally bend during normal use, resulting in the infamous "bendgate" saga?</p><p>Quite a lot has changed since the iPhone 6 series debuted back in 2014, and a thin phone today doesn't have to come with the same compromises that it did a decade ago. Apple, Google, and Samsung have all released products over the last few months that demonstrate their ability to make thin and capable devices at the same time. If those concepts were applied to the smartphone, I'd snap up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-slim-could-pack-a-serious-camera-punch-despite-its-thin-profile">the rumored Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim</a> in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>I've spent the last few months using three impressively thin devices, and they've convinced me that there's value in thinness. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> is 5.1mm "thick" when unfolded, and the 11-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-oled-m4-2024">M4 iPad Pro</a> is 5.3mm thick. These two products have been my go-to foldable and tablet, and their form factors are a big reason why. You don't realize how the heft and thickness of traditional flagship phones affect the way you use them — until you try alternatives.</p><p>So, what's the third device? Ironically, it's the seventh-generation iPod Nano from 2012, measuring 5.4mm. It was the thinnest device Apple ever made until it was usurped by the M4 iPad Pro this year. I've found myself using it again in 2024 as a way to listen to music on runs. It has Bluetooth, is more reliable than a smartwatch for music listening, and is way thinner and lighter than a smartphone. I can't bear the thought of throwing an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> in my pocket, but the iPod Nano is just fine.</p><p>That anecdote is precisely why the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim is appealing. A phone between 5mm and 6mm thick would be thin enough to go places that current flagships can't. To understand why, think about what it's like to hold your phone above your face while lying in bed. Or, consider how tricky it can be to hold a phone, your keys, wallet, or a beverage at the same time. A thin (and hopefully <em>lighter</em>) Galaxy 25 Slim would address all of these (admittedly first-world) problems.</p>

<p>The aforementioned Pixel 9 Pro Fold and M4 iPad Pro are proof that you don't have to make massive compromises to make a thinner device. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold still has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip and solid battery life, and I could say the same about the iPad Pro with its desktop-class M4 system-on-a-chip and 10-hour battery life. Outside of North America, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-6-might-be-flopping-in-the-us-but-its-special-edition-is-winning-in-korea">Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim</a> has a 200MP camera despite being the thinnest Samsung foldable ever.</p><p>There could be more compromises with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Slim</a> since it'll be more compact than both the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the M4 iPad Pro. However, early indications are that Samsung might have found a way to include a powerful camera system in a small package. Reliable Samsung leaker IceUniverse on X (formerly Twitter) claims that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-slim-could-pack-a-serious-camera-punch-despite-its-thin-profile">this model has an "Ultra" camera</a>, perhaps matching the performance of the rest of the Galaxy S25 series.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: The Galaxy S25 Slim is equipped with an “Ultra” camera.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1854367791438336189">November 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Even if there are minor hits to battery life and camera quality, I think I can live with that. My screen-on time is above average, usually about 10 hours daily. With intermittent charging at my desk, in the car, and overnight, I easily get through a full day of usage. When I can't, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">portable chargers and battery banks</a> fill the gap. Now that fast charging is the norm, maybe gigantic batteries and long battery life aren't as crucial as they once were.</p><p>As for camera quality, I think there's value in having large and powerful camera sensors, but it's not necessary. Wearing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> for a year proved that tiny sensors can still be extremely impressive.</p>
<h2 id="use-a-protective-or-stylish-case-you-ll-love-thin-phones-even-more-2">Use a protective or stylish case? You'll love thin phones even more</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qWBpR7s4kom62fdxLHge7" name="iPad-Pro-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold" alt="An iPad Pro M4 and a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold in cases." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qWBpR7s4kom62fdxLHge7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Every time I review a smartphone and comment on the device's fit and finish, I'm reminded by readers that most people will never see it. The vast majority of users put a case on their phone on day one, and that's the biggest reason why I'd buy a thin phone. I typically use my phones caseless because I'm not willing to add the extra bulk that comes with using a protective case. However, if the Galaxy S25 Slim shaves a millimeter or two off the phone's thickness, it would benefit case users the most.</p><p>In that scenario, the thickness of a Galaxy S25 Slim with a case installed could match the typical thickness of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> <em>without</em> a case. You could have the best of both worlds — the protection and style points that come with using a case while retaining the typical thinness of a caseless phone.</p><p>This has been the best thing about daily driving the M4 iPad Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The difference of a few millimeters doesn't impact daily use much when using the devices without a case. The last-generation iPad Pro would probably be thin enough for most people, until they try to pair it with a Magic Keyboard. That keyboard case quickly doubles the thickness of the iPad Pro, making it the entire package thicker than a MacBook Air.</p><p>However, pair the M4 iPad Pro with a Magic Keyboard, and the entire package feels thinner thanks to the iPad's slimmer form factor. The same goes for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which I use with the Mous Super Thin 2.0 case. I didn't use the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> with a case; the foldable phone became too thick. I'm confident that the Galaxy S25 Slim would bring similar benefits.</p>
<h2 id="a-longer-wait-for-the-thin-phone-of-my-dreams-2">A longer wait for the thin phone of my dreams</h2>
<p>Max Jambor at AllAboutSamsung seems confident that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim does exist. However, it's not likely that we'll see it in January with the rest of the Galaxy S25 series. Samsung could follow a similar timeline to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 series, which started with the regular Fold 6 in July, with the Fold 6 Slim debuting in October.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim exists behind closed doors, but if it’s set to launch at some point, it won’t be released alongside the rest of the S25 lineup. pic.twitter.com/ktinMzERUc<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1854564202142183922">November 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>When (or if) the Galaxy S25 Slim debuts, I'll be ready to open up my wallet — provided it's thin enough. The recent releases of the M4 iPad Pro, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim prove that you can make an excellent device that's impossibly thin. I'm expecting the Galaxy S25 Slim to make waves in the same way those three devices already have.</p>

<p>Amazon is set to shut down Freevee as part of efforts to streamline its streaming lineup and make Prime Video the go-to entertainment hub.</p><p>Deadline <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/freevee-shut-down-amazon-prime-video-1236172644/" target="_blank">reports</a> that Amazon is moving Freevee’s content straight over to Prime Video. Consequently, non-Prime members will be able to watch new episodes of original series that were once only available on Freevee.</p><p>Freevee’s gradual shutdown is set to wrap up in the next few weeks, impacting viewers in the U.S., UK, Germany, and Austria. After the transition, Freevee’s content will be available on Prime Video’s "Watch for Free" section.</p><p>Although Freevee has been a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">popular free streaming option</a>, rumors of its shutdown started swirling after Prime Video launched its ad-supported tier in January. The move left many wondering what Amazon’s game plan really was.</p><p>Regular Freevee users might be bummed by this change, as the platform offers a clean, easy-to-use interface just for free content. It saved you from having to sift through the vast Prime Video library to find what you wanted.</p><p>You’ll still be able to access the content, but logging in will be required. It seems Amazon’s plan is to get more people hooked on Prime Video, with free content now mixed in with the paid shows and movies. The entry-level ad-supported tier is priced at $9 a month.</p><p>Bringing Freevee into Prime Video might make things a bit trickier for non-subscribers. Having to navigate paid options or deal with subscription prompts could take away from the simple, focused experience that Freevee used to offer on its own.</p><p>Launched as IMDb Freedive in 2019 under Amazon's IMDb brand, the platform quickly rebranded to IMDb TV and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazons-imdb-tv-streaming-service-is-getting-a-ridiculous-rebrand">then became Freevee in 2022</a>.</p><p>This news follows months of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/amazon-sunset-freevee/" target="_blank">rumors</a> about Amazon planning to shut down Freevee and roll its content into Prime Video. Amazon had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2024/02/amazon-insists-no-changes-to-freevee-despite-reports-of-shutdown-streaming-1235832878/" target="_blank">brushed off</a> these claims before, insisting no changes were coming.</p><p>Amazon’s choice to shut down Freevee and move its content to Prime Video is probably due to the growing similarities between the two platforms. With the ad-supported tier now in place, Prime Video and Freevee have become much more alike, making the latter’s unique appeal less necessary.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Great quality doesn’t have to come at a high price; a mantra 1More continues to perpetuate each time it releases new headphones or wireless earbuds. What makes this all the more compelling is that the company doesn’t skimp out along the way.</p><p>The SonoFlow Pro HQ51 are a prime example of that. It's a pair of over-ear headphones following up on the previous SonoFlow, which proved themselves as serious upstarts in their own right as one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones-under-100">best headphones under $100</a>. You do make sacrifices when paying less than $100 but you stretch out every dollar here toward some real value each time you use them.</p><p>The company already had a strong foundation to work with from the previous SonoFlow, which explains why the Pro HQ51 bears such a strong resemblance. Aside from color variances, everything else is in the same place, from the hinges to button placement. They fold up exactly the same way, though these prove easier to lay into the included case because there are no indents inside. There’s more room for cables, too.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pShfeoEwbe4CZM5a3ZXrSC" name="1More-SonoFlow-HQ51-open-case" alt="1More SonoFlow Pro HQ51 folded up in their carrying case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pShfeoEwbe4CZM5a3ZXrSC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the headphones themselves, 1More uses what feels like the same leather for the ear cushions and headband. This is a good idea, given how soft and comfortable it was the first time around. The memory foam inside also feels plush without constraining your head over longer listening sessions. It also helps that the headphones are lightweight, with good hinges for the ear cups. Fit is so subjective, but these should feel great.</p><p>Granted, they may not come off as all that exciting just looking at them. The company chose not to make any aesthetic changes apart from the black and blue color variants. The SonoFlow Pro HQ51 aren't flashy, though that hardly makes them ugly. They just don't have a particular design trademark, unless you count the Louboutin-style red inner ear fabric a nice touch.</p>

<p>I will say, off the bat, that I would be careful about using these headphones for runs or workouts. They don't have an IP rating, so without any official water resistance, you're taking a chance every time you sweat while wearing them.</p><p>If you're willing to do that, you may like that there are physical buttons for all controls here. The NC button cycles between active noise cancelation (ANC), transparency, and turning both off. Volume buttons do the obvious, but you can also hold Vol+ to go back a track or Vol– to skip one. Press the power button once to play/pause or answer/hang up a call. Double-press it, and your phone's voice assistant will wake up.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oDa3Rp6mah7Csg5kSBe2Vh" name="1More-SonoFlow-HQ51-wearing" alt="Wearing the 1More SonoFlow Pro HQ51 over-ear headphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oDa3Rp6mah7Csg5kSBe2Vh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I found it interesting that 1More went into launching these headphones with some boastful claims. Merely suggesting that a pair of sub-$100 cans could deliver lower total harmonic distortion than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">Sony's WH-1000XM5</a> is a reach. The general idea for any pair of headphones is higher THD means more distortion in the audio signal, which affects sound quality.</p><p>Slight variances are hard to measure for most ears, so don't look into that too much here. I have no real way of verifying 1More's claim other than testing both headphones and coming to the conclusion that I can't detect any audible difference when it comes to distortion levels, specifically.</p><p>This claim comes mainly from the new 40mm diamond-like carbon drivers 1More put in the SonoFlow Pro HQ51. It also has something to do with the fact they support the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">LDAC hi-res Bluetooth codec</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="uSCuXf2UgsZdPJVrnZSy8F" name="1More-SonoFlow-HQ51-screenshots-1" alt="1More app screenshots showing ways to control and customize SonoFlow Pro HQ51 headphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uSCuXf2UgsZdPJVrnZSy8F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, sound quality is superb—better than the previous SonoFlow. The biggest difference to my ears is the mids, reflecting a balance that does right by the solid bass and treble you get from the Pro HQ51. You'll hear this just a little more with hi-res tracks from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android" target="_blank">streaming services</a> like Tidal, Amazon Music, and Qobuz, though you'll also catch the improvement with more compressed audio from Spotify and other sources.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">LDAC</a> support isn't there by default since you need to turn it on in the app under the Shortcuts menu. Note that doing so means you can't have spatial audio on, so you're forced to choose between them each time.</p><p>Despite throwing some shade at Sony, 1More's best move is delivering the kind of sound many will probably agree with. Resonant, with good bass and crisp highs, their performance out of the box still doesn't tell the full story.</p><p>As before, the 1More app gives you an EQ with 12 presets plus the option to create your own. The Studio preset is a flat curve, which represents 1More's default tuning for these headphones. You can get pretty creative here because it's a 10-band EQ for more precise tuning adjustments — something not typical for cheaper headphones. Testing both the presets and your own custom ones is worth your time because they can really change what kind of sound you get.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>As before, the 1More app gives you an EQ with 12 presets plus the option to create your own.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>ANC and transparency have a role to play here as well. You may find that turning both off (in a quiet place) allows a little more of the mids and highs to come out. I didn't notice right away but my ears sensed a difference. Not that using noise-cancelation is bad. Audio sounds great with it engaged.</p><p>As for the act of actually canceling background noise, don't expect Sony or Bose-level silence here. That wouldn't be a fair expectation anyway but I can tell you these do a solid job dealing with low-frequency sounds. Nothing groundbreaking, mind you, just better than you might expect for headphones in this price range.</p><p>It's actually the passive isolation you get from the snug fit that helps a lot. ANC augments that and makes for a nice combination when you're trying not to hear what's going on around you. Transparency is fine when you do, even if there's nothing all that surprising about it compared to the previous SonoFlow headphones.</p>
<h2 id="calls-and-other-features-2">Calls and other features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bKM2dPSovay6ys24Rt5iHF" name="1More-SonoFlow-HQ51-wearing-side-view" alt="Side profile view wearing the 1More SonoFlow Pro HQ51 headphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bKM2dPSovay6ys24Rt5iHF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wired playback is an option if you need it. 1More includes a 2.5mm-to-3.5mm cable for such a purpose. You lose out on the ancillary features when you do, and you may have to raise the volume more often while listening that way. It feels like a miss given that other budget-friendly headphones have managed to at least leave some access.</p><p>For phone calls, you can use the headphones either way because the cable has an inline microphone. Again, you'll need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-pair-bluetooth-headphones-your-android-phone">stick to Bluetooth</a> if you want extras while talking, like the onboard mics drowning out some of the background noise to hear callers better. In my tests, callers didn't point out any major issues, though they also didn't lavish praise on call quality, for what that's worth.</p><p>The SonoFlow Pro HQ51 support multipoint connections to stay paired with two devices simultaneously. Here, too, you'll need to enable the feature first under the "Experimental Features" menu under Settings. Toggling it on reboots the headphones, so keep that in mind when you need it.</p>
<h2 id="unbelievable-battery-life-2">Unbelievable battery life</h2>
<p>The SonoFlow Pro HQ51 are rated at up to 100 hours with ANC off. Leave ANC on, and you can go up to 65 hours. Both figures are just ridiculous in a good way. While they are based on default volume levels and without some other notable elements thrown in, like LDAC or spatial audio, you can rest assured these cans will play for a long time before you hear a low battery warning.</p><p>I had them for weeks before writing this review and only had to charge them once. I could listen for hours and barely see the battery percentage drop. Regardless of what features you use or volume you prefer, power consumption isn't something you need to worry about here.</p><p>And if you do, a five-minute quick charge can give you up to 10 hours of playback (ANC off), which feels kind of mind-boggling.</p>
<h2 id="headphones-worth-every-dollar-2">Headphones worth every dollar</h2>

<p>The 1More SonoFlow Pro HQ51 feel like a bargain, plain and simple. For $100 (or less, given 1More's routine discounts), you get over-ear headphones that not only outperform their price but also serve notice against some that cost double the price. You're not getting over-ears capable of unseating the flagships among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a>, but that's not the point.</p><p>These headphones are a big value proposition in that they deliver more than you might otherwise expect. Great sound complements the solid feature set and seemingly endless battery life. When you're simply looking to get the basics right, the SonoFlow Pro HQ51 will give you all those and more.</p>

<ul><li>A discovery within Prime Video's recent build may indicate Amazon's development of a multiview mode like YouTube TV.</li><li>The code suggests users can "set up" their multiview alongside various inabilities regarding rewinding and pausing.</li><li>YouTube TV recently rolled out "build a multiview" for users just before the 2024 NFL season, as well as a basic version for mobile.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amazon could upgrade its Prime Video streaming service with a feature YouTube TV subscribers will recognize.</p><p>Per an APK dive by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/amazon-prime-video-multiview-apk-teardown-3499139/">Android Authority</a>, the Prime Video app's latest build holds signs pointing toward a "multiview." Diving into version 3.0.389 showcased strings in the code like "exit_multiview_text." From the discovered code, it seems Amazon plans for a multiview experience that lets users "set up" their ideal content.</p><p>Another piece of code seemingly ties the multiview button to mobile — specifically, Android. Moreover, the code highlights multiview's warnings to users about the inability to rewind, pause, or skip ahead.</p><p>Other strings reference the "Android_Player" on its own, potentially indicating that Amazon may roll this out for TVs <em>alongside </em>mobile devices. Unfortunately, the publication discovery was cut short as more detailed information was reportedly unavailable. We're still left wondering how many screens or "views" Amazon's version of multiview will contain.</p><p>In mid-2023, YouTube TV started a test for a limited number of users that enabled multiview mode for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tv-multiview-streams-additional-content">more than sports games</a>. However, using the mode to watch games from the NFL, WNBA, and College Basketball games was what users typically activated multiview for. Earlier this year, YouTube TV pushed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tv-multiview-mobile-rollout">basic version of multiview to mobile devices</a>, beginning with Apple's iPhone. The mode made a few "pre-determined" options available for users to watch on the go.</p><p>Users were unable to choose which pieces of content they wanted to view, which was a function TV sets picked up in January. YouTube TV rolled the feature out as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-build-a-multiview-spotted">build a multiview</a>." The customization option debuted right in time for March Madness, letting users pick and choose which games they wanted. This custom multiview <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-fantasy-custom-multiview-nfl-sunday-ticket">arrived for NFL Sunday Ticket holders</a> just before the 2024 season kicked off.</p><p>YouTube TV lets users design a multiview with up to four screens (four streams) on game day. It remains to be seen if Amazon's version for Prime Video remains similar or more limited. Additionally, the publication highlighted the company's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-nba-wnba-streaming-deal">11-year partnership</a> with the NBA and WNBA for games, which might be a strong catalyst behind this multiview venture.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus (2024)</a> impressed us this year with its sophisticated design, upgraded camera tech, and a Snapdragon chip that easily holds its own against Samsung&apos;s popular Galaxy Z Flip 6. The phone also boasts two gorgeous pOLED displays with a vegan leather finish so it&apos;s nice and grippy to hold, plus you get a durable folding hinge that feels much more flexible than the rather-stiff Z Flip 6. As senior editor Derrek Lee put it, "Samsung should really be taking notes". </p>

<p>As part of its early <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-sale-top-android-deals-2024">Black Friday sale</a>, Best Buy is slashing a whopping $250 off the unlocked Motorola Razr Plus (2024). Activate the phone today and you'll score an additional $100 in savings.  </p>
<p>One of our favorite <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> released this year, the Razr Plus (2024) features two glorious pOLED screens with a Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 processor, Moto AI software features, and one of the best folding hinges that we've ever used. </p>

<p>I&apos;ve been waiting for the right time to try the clamshell device myself, and thanks to this Black Friday deal, I&apos;m about ready to place the order. Of course, the big question is this: will the Razr Plus get even cheaper as we approach November 29th? It&apos;s hard to know for sure, but if you use a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel, you&apos;ll see that the current discount totally smashes Amazon&apos;s record low price from last month. It&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-motorola-deals-2024-historic-razr-savings-usd150-off-moto-g-stylus-and-more">best Black Friday Motorola deals</a> we&apos;ve seen so far this year, and that&apos;s saying a lot. </p><p>Best Buy will also give you an additional $100 off if you activate the phone with a carrier, and you might even be eligible to receive some trade-in credit if you send in an old or broken device. Will the deal improve in a few weeks? Only time will tell, but this early Black Friday discount is good enough for me. </p>
