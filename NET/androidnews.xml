                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There is something liberating about simply getting into your car, turning it on, and having Android Auto launch right after Even more so when you don&apos;t have to plug the phone into any of the vehicle&apos;s USB ports to make it happen. </p><p>Wireless adapters continue to usher in a convenient way to take the cable out of the equation and leave your phone free. Carsifi does this while adding a unique element in enabling drivers to share the connection with others in the vehicle. However, uncertainty over app and product support cast a shadow over an otherwise effective device.</p>
<p>To start, Carsifi first started out as a crowdfunded device before it became available to anyone in the U.S., Canada, and Australia in 2022. The initial $110 price has since dropped to around $90, making it more competitive against other Android Auto adapters like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/motorola-ma1-review">Motorola MA1</a>. The one catch is that the device seems to only be available through Carsifi&apos;s website.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wXiF8vm8jhCTGVbzw2DgXA" name="Carsifi-wireless-Android-Auto-hand.jpg" alt="Carsifi Android Auto adapter in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wXiF8vm8jhCTGVbzw2DgXA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wireless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-auto-accessories">Android Auto adapters</a> come in different types, mostly aiming to perform one task, which is to ensure a stable wireless connection between an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> and a vehicle infotainment system. I&apos;ve tested several of them, and Carsifi is among the smallest adapters I&apos;ve seen thus far. Smaller in length and height than a credit card (though naturally thicker), its lightweight build and diminutive frame mean it won&apos;t feel cumbersome in the car.</p><p>Carsifi also includes two short cables, one with a USB-C port and the other with USB-A, thereby covering vehicles that might have one or the other. There&apos;s also a two-sided 3M adhesive strip in the box to mount it on the dash, or anywhere you prefer in the car within reach. It&apos;s also easy enough to use your own longer cable if you prefer something else for placement. In my case, I used the adhesive from the Motorola MA1, which I thought might hold the Carsifi better (it didn&apos;t), but ultimately tucked it away in a basin in front of the shifter.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It's possible to pair the Carsifi with other phones as well, allowing a passenger to run their Android Auto connection instead.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Setting up the Carsifi was one of the easiest processes I&apos;ve experienced thus far. Plug the device into your vehicle&apos;s USB port, and it goes into pairing mode right away. Simply pairing it with an Android phone is enough to get it up and running, and the Android Auto interface appears onscreen within 30 seconds. </p><p>Other adapters or dongles sometimes require extra steps, be it setting up a Wi-Fi Direct connection or in some cases, using a dedicated app to establish everything. Carsifi is as plug-and-play as it gets, which is great for those looking for something less technical. The included instructions are barebones, so it is best to check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.carsifi.com/support/home">full support page</a> to learn more about what it can do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vEt3FjxMprzsBWPPH6B2k9" name="Carsifi-wireless-Android-Auto-front.jpg" alt="Carsifi Android Auto adapter next to Android Auto screen front view." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vEt3FjxMprzsBWPPH6B2k9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, there is so much that works well with Carsifi that the app situation just feels downright confusing. The brand hasn&apos;t updated its Android app to work with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> — much less <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. I reached out to the media relations staff and didn&apos;t get a response about software support, so I went to tech support, who told me they weren&apos;t updating it because of "Play Store rules," whatever that means. Instead, they suggested downloading an APK file of the previous app, which is easy enough to download and install but not a practical solution.</p><p>Mind you, the app doesn&apos;t do much anyway, and you don&apos;t need it to set up the device because settings are stored on the Carsifi itself rather than your phone. The problem is it&apos;s the only method available to update the firmware. Again, this is not something you see with every adapter, including the Motorola MA1, so it would just be more convenient for everyone to download an app from the Play Store and take it from there.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-the-connection-with-others-2">Sharing the connection with others</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sewCJdYuNTMNb9sTLm9GJ9" name="Carsifi-wireless-Android-Auto-connected.jpg" alt="Carsifi Android Auto adapter connected loose on car seat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sewCJdYuNTMNb9sTLm9GJ9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s possible to pair the Carsifi with other phones as well, allowing a passenger to run their Android Auto connection instead. While this might not seem useful at first glance, I think it makes a lot of sense because it all works wirelessly.</p><p>Double-click the Carsifi button, and it switches over to the other phone, eventually displaying that user&apos;s Android Auto setup. In cases where a passenger wants to listen to their music, contact people, or navigate maps, it makes things much easier. For example, if you, as the driver, have a Spotify account, but the passenger is on Apple Music, Tidal, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>, switching phones negates any cumbersome account changes on the road.</p><p>You have to be careful with double-clicking because a single click pauses Android Auto, a feature that I still can&apos;t find much use for. Also, you have to exercise some patience because it can take a good 10 seconds before the adapter switches to the other phone, leaving a brief period of silence during which the "Is it working?" questions start to arise. After a while, though, you recognize these nuances, and it becomes old hat.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>More good news is that Carsifi works just fine in both factory and aftermarket systems.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Also, bear in mind that the adapter remembers the last phone it connected to, so there is no "master" device here. That&apos;s why you might want to double-click the button in case Android Auto doesn&apos;t appear for you or you forgot which phone might have been the last one.</p><p>The good news is that Carsifi works just fine in both factory and aftermarket systems. My Pioneer aftermarket head unit has no issues at all, and even better, steering wheel controls work like a charm, which doesn&apos;t always happen with all adapters.</p>
<h2 id="reliable-yet-with-tough-competition-2">Reliable, yet with tough competition</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wXtG5io2vZ3Z3YvB3d8BAA" name="Carsifi-wireless-Android-Auto-close-up.jpg" alt="Carsifi Android Auto adapter close-up stuck to dash." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wXtG5io2vZ3Z3YvB3d8BAA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The clunky support behind the product gives me pause. On the plus side, tech support was highly responsive, so if you have issues, someone should get back to you, but I can&apos;t be absolutely sure it will be the same for everyone, given the strange refusal to update the app.</p><p>That said, there are plenty of Android Auto dongles and adapters out there, many of which create wireless connectivity under similar conditions. Certain nuances or functional points put some distance between them, like how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/aawireless-review">AAWireless</a> has a dedicated app and technical features that others don&apos;t. The Motorola MA1 comes from a recognizable brand, though it doesn&apos;t feel as seamless to me. Plus, it may have a successor model coming sometime this year.</p><p>Carlinkit and Ottocast are two others that continue to produce Android Auto adapters, though make sure to read any fine print about incompatibilities. They may not work with certain automotive brands or aftermarket head units. Carsifi wades through a lot of that in ways that make it appealing as a plug-and-play product.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Once you go wireless with Android Auto, it's hard to go back.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Ultimately, once you go wireless with Android Auto, it&apos;s hard to go back. Even more so if you have a wireless charger in the car. Carsifi accomplishes the key task of making the transition feel simple and painless, establishing a connection in little time, and ensuring it stays that way. Out of all the adapters I&apos;ve tested, this one felt more stable than the others.</p><p>As I noted, the weird lack of support at the app level is hard to understand, and it&apos;s still only available through direct sale from Carsifi, so not something you will readily find from other online retailers. For the price, though, you do get something that works as advertised, taking away the kind of frustration you don&apos;t want to deal with on the road.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A follow-up to the first OnePlus Pad is anticipated, likely launching later than its predecessor.</li><li>A reliable tipster suggests a late 2024 debut for the OnePlus Pad 2, but details remain scarce.</li><li>While specific specs are unknown, hints about the OPPO Pad 3 suggest a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, possibly indicating similar features for the OnePlus Pad 2.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like OnePlus is working on the next-generation version of last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a>, and there&apos;s word on when we might see it hit the market.</p><p>The first OnePlus Pad is tipped to be getting a follow-up, and it&apos;s expected to launch a bit later than when the inaugural version was released to the market. However, details on its exact release date or any specs and features are still under wraps for now.</p><p>That said, Max Jambor, a notable tipster on X (previously Twitter), suggested that the OnePlus Pad 2 is set to debut in the latter part of 2024. Yet, there&apos;s a lack of additional information about the tablet from this leaker.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OnePlus Pad2 will be launched in the second half of 2024<a href="https://twitter.com/MaxJmb/status/1778688197041504646">April 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>As a quick rewind, the original OnePlus Pad hit store shelves in China as the OPPO Pad 2 just a month after its global launch. Now, the big question is whether we&apos;ll see a similar move with the OnePlus Pad 2.</p><p>Fingers crossed that the OnePlus Pad 2 steps up its game in areas where the first one fell short, especially in processing power and overall productivity experience.</p><p>Though concrete specs are still under wraps, there&apos;s one potential hint floating around for the OPPO Pad 3. This matters because, remember, the OnePlus Pad is essentially the global version of the China-exclusive OPPO Pad 2.</p><p>So, if the OnePlus Pad 2 follows suit with the OPPO Pad 3, there&apos;s a chance it could rock a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, as per leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/O8UhjzV9n#comment" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-could-be-months-away-but-it-might-be-a-very-powerful-upgrade" target="_blank">TechRadar</a>).</p><p>Waiting until fall or winter for a follow-up to a device unveiled back in February 2023 and released just two months later might be a bit of a bummer. However, it&apos;s reassuring to know that OnePlus isn&apos;t giving up on the tablet market or slowing down its efforts to rival some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">beloved Android tablets</a> for the long haul.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>This week saw the debut of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fcc-broadband-nutrition-labels">broadband "nutrition labels</a>" to help you understand what you&apos;re paying for when you buy into a high-speed internet plan. You can find them posted in stores or online from companies like T-Mobile or Comcast, and any wired or wireless provider with over 100,000 customers is required to post them.</p><p>This got me thinking about the state of high-speed internet in North America — specifically how some of the biggest issues are still the same as they were years ago. </p>
<p>There are two real problems: unavailability and overcrowding. I&apos;m sure industry experts have fancy names for them, but in the end, many people have limited or no access to high-speed internet because of these issues.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-and-other-carriers-still-havent-covered-rural-areas-regardless-what-they-say">In rural areas</a>, there just isn&apos;t enough to go around. It costs a lot of money to bring service to an area, and service providers are reluctant to make it happen without enough customers to pay for it (and then provide huge profits). You have to remember that businesses are in it to get rich, not provide a service.</p>
<p>The flip side is in places where there are too many people. Fast, reliable service has a user cap, and when it&apos;s exceeded, the quality starts to go downhill. Usually, it&apos;s just an inconvenience at certain times of the day or on certain days, but internet providers are like airlines and will sell, sell, sell, regardless of actual capacity.</p><p>Nutrition labels aren&apos;t going to fix this. Maybe nothing can fix this. We can&apos;t let that stop us from demanding more from the companies that send us a hefty bill every month, though.</p>
<h2 id="rural-areas-are-still-screwed-2">Rural areas are still screwed</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HUEaDifMmt53L4aJk49MJP" name="rural-broadband.jpg" alt="Rural broadband speeds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HUEaDifMmt53L4aJk49MJP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In rural parts of North America, there are two types of internet service — poor and none. In 2024, it&apos;s almost impossible to take advantage of the technology age or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">latest new phone</a> when internet is in the state it&apos;s in.</p><p>It is getting better, but just barely. Take where I live, for example. I&apos;m in one of those weird areas where rural isn&apos;t really rural — I live in the mountains 43 miles from Washington, DC. It&apos;s a cool place to live but it used to be the place where the internet went to die.</p>
<p>Up until a few years ago, "high-speed" just wasn&apos;t a thing. In 2012, the Obama administration <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/13/we-can-t-wait-president-obama-signs-executive-order-make-broadband-const">started an initiative</a> to make high-speed internet access along all federal highways feasible. That has trickled away from the highway, and now I have 5G wireless and fiber internet at the same address that I had to pay for Comcast to bring cable to in 2007. </p><p>Not everyone, especially those away from any major city, is so lucky. There are areas with no internet service of any kind, but those are few and far between. The issue becomes clear when you look for high-speed coverage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:742px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.34%;"><img id="A29W5onipSs32WG9EsUNjU" name="verizon-5g-2024.png" alt="Verizon 5G service in 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A29W5onipSs32WG9EsUNjU.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="742" height="559" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhistleOut)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/starlink-home-internet-review">Starlink make things better</a>, but Starlink is expensive and requires a lot of maintenance. It&apos;s not like DirecTV, where it just works. </p><p>I understand the problem — there just aren&apos;t enough people to justify it. But this is not what we were led to believe high-speed wireless would be like in 2024.</p>
<h2 id="too-many-people-can-be-just-as-bad-2">Too many people can be just as bad</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4h78XuaD9ax7nMUyySH3L4" name="dupont-circle.jpg" alt="Dupont Circle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4h78XuaD9ax7nMUyySH3L4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everyone has heard stories about how bad connectivity is at a place like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O</a> or a New York Giants football game. When you cram that many people into one place at one time, it&apos;s very difficult to provide service to them all.</p><p>The thing is, it doesn&apos;t take a major tech conference or football game to make service bad. All it takes is just one user beyond what the total capacity can handle.</p>
<p>I&apos;ll use another anecdotal example here. I have some friends who live in DC, and at lunchtime through the week and all day Saturday and Sunday, their service slows to a crawl. This happens because everyone checks their phone at lunch and on the weekend a million extra people are in DC to see the sights. </p><p>AT&T provided the infrastructure based on the people who actually live there. Quadruple that number, and things get bad. This can made better using portable cell towers for things like ball games or during DC&apos;s Cherry Blossom Festival when the crowds are huge, so more infrastructure is the fix.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nutrition labels are fine for telling how the service we&apos;re paying for is supposed to work. The only way to fix anything is to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairwoman-rosenworcel-proposes-new-5g-fund-rules">throw money at the problem</a>, though. </p><p>You probably don&apos;t see these issues — I admit they are fringe cases. However, they are the same fringe cases that have affected the same users for a decade. Before we move on to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/6g">6G</a>, they must be addressed, or North America will fall further behind when it comes to high-speed connectivity.</p>

<ul><li>Google has overhauled the Fitbit app since it officially acquired the company in 2021, making it fit in line with Material You design language.</li><li>In an interview published to the Google Design website, the Fitbit UX team explained how it decided to adapt the Fitbit app to integrate it with Google platforms. </li><li>The designers share the thought process behind the transition, which has spanned two years and is still ongoing. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google officially closed its deal to acquire Fitbit roughly three years ago, and it is still working to integrate Fitbit into its health portfolio and larger devices and services ecosystem. We can see the effects of this project in a few ways, like the Fitbit app redesign matching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Material You design language</a>. However, we just got a rare look at the thought process behind Google&apos;s visual redo of the Fitbit app through an interview with the Fitbit UX team posted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://design.google/library/the-goal-behind-the-goal" target="_blank">Google Design website</a>.</p><p>While it&apos;s obvious that the new Fitbit app — which has been rolled out in parts starting last year — fits the Material You theme, designers had to start working on the project before it was finalized. They started work two years ago and leaned into the Light and Space art movement that originated in Google&apos;s home state of California in the late 1960s. </p><p>"We knew there was momentum around the concept of &apos;form follows feeling,&apos; we knew it was about personalization, and we knew it was all about you — that worked really well for celebrating the best of Google with Fitbit," said Mat Helme, a Fitbit product and brand design lead. </p><p>This approach towards design is how we got the Fitbit app as it appears today, with light backgrounds, rich colors, and multiple pastel shades. We can see the effects of Google and Fitbit&apos;s design preferences still directing app updates, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-app-sleep-view-redesign">just-released Fitbit Sleep revamp</a>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AnFkmxWvKxTJkdmRtEJzBQ" name="Fitbit-Sleep-Redesign-2.jpg" alt="A Fitbit app image edited with a gradient background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AnFkmxWvKxTJkdmRtEJzBQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Having Fitbit lean into rounded forms and softer colors feels fairly unique, and the circular form factor is a big part of how we design for that uplifting and compassionate feeling," said Judy Zhao, who is a leader of the Fitbit visual motion and systems team. "We&apos;re able to do this because we&apos;re combining multiple worlds into one holistic health journey experience."</p><p>However, it&apos;s about more than just design. The designers at Fitbit also wanted to make health and fitness metrics available in a way that was easy to digest. </p><p>"We&apos;re on a journey as a product team to become less about data collection and more about giving you insight and actionable information to take charge of your health journey," said Fitbit UX Design Lead Sarah Wilson. In practice, Wilson says that this entails using charts and text to explain all the fitness and health jargon that might not be naturally understood by everyone. Going a step further, Fitbit wants to make it easier for users to take recorded data and apply it to make the right fitness and lifestyle changes.</p><p>That leads us back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Google Pixel Watch 2</a>, which has the circular form factor to match Fitbit&apos;s rounded design preferences. It also includes the sensors required to provide the data Google wants to share in a simple way. So, it stands to reason that the Pixel Watch — and its circular form factor — is a big part of the Fitbit strategy moving forward. </p>

<ul><li>Samsung declared a new "Samsung Smart Wearable" in the Bluetooth SIG database on Friday, April 12.</li><li>The model number, SM-L305U, matches the leaked model number of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 7.</li><li>According to the listing, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 will feature Bluetooth 5.3 support, just like the current Galaxy Watch 6. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We&apos;re likely only a few months away from Samsung debuting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 series</a>, which may coincide with a new Wear OS upgrade. Leaks are starting to intensify ahead of that impending launch, but a new listing in the Bluetooth SIG database looks to be a rare confirmation of the Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s model number and specs.</p><p>The official declaration matches the model number reported in prior Galaxy Watch 7 leaks, providing more evidence that listing is indeed referring to the upcoming smartwatch. </p><p>The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) certifies products that are licensed to use the Bluetooth specification, and devices that complete the Bluetooth Qualification Process appear in the Bluetooth SIG&apos;s database. This occasionally gives us a look at products before they are released, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/walmart-might-launch-pro-variant-of-its-google-tv-competitor">Walmart&apos;s upcoming Google TV device</a> from a few days prior. A listing in the Bluetooth SIG database dated Friday, April 12, concerns a "Samsung Smart Wearable (Smart Watch)," but doesn&apos;t clarify further (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-7-bluetooth-june-2024-launch/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). </p><p>However, the listing does state that the model number for this smartwatch is SM-L305U, and that is familiar. Late last month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-could-double-the-amount-of-onboard-storage-with-the-galaxy-watch-7">a prior Galaxy Watch 7 leak</a> revealed the suspected model numbers for up to three potential smartwatches in the upcoming lineup.  SM-L300 and SM-L305 were tied to one model, SM-L310 and SM-L315 represented another, and the premium model uses SM-L700 and SM-L705. The new entry in the Bluetooth SIG database confirms this report to be accurate. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q4VWhTuQwUTcSNBztxvfs7" name="Galaxy-Watch-7-Bluetooth-SIG.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Watch 7 listing in the Bluetooth SIG database." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q4VWhTuQwUTcSNBztxvfs7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bluetooth SIG)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the model number, all the Bluetooth SIG listing tells us is that the Galaxy Watch 7 will feature Bluetooth 5.3 support. This was also the case for last year&apos;s lineup, so there is no change in terms of Bluetooth connectivity coming this year. </p><p>Still, there are a lot of rumored features related to the Galaxy Watch 7 series that are still up in the air. There will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-chip-performance-rumors">reportedly be three models this year</a> instead of two, and rumors suggest Samsung is exploring a rectangular design. It&apos;s unclear whether a fresh design might make its way to the Galaxy Watch 7, though. What&apos;s more likely is that the new lineup will feature increased on-device storage space, getting a boost to 32GB. </p><p>Samsung usually holds a Galaxy Unpacked event in the summer of each year, so that&apos;s when we expect to see the Galaxy Watch 7 officially revealed. </p>

<ul><li>TCL is releasing an AI-generated movie called Next Stop Paris, and a trailer just dropped for it on YouTube. </li><li>The short film features an original script and human voice actors, but uses generative artificial intelligence for animation. </li><li>Next Stop Paris will appear on TCLtv+, the free streaming service offered by TCL, and is the company's first foray into original content. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TCL, the company we know for budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">Android TVs</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android smartphones</a>, is now diving into original content creation. Its new content will appear on its free streaming service, TCLtv+, and there will be one short movie to start. However, these aren&apos;t just any movies: the newly-created TCLtv+ Studios will be making animated films using generative artificial intelligence. </p><p>Generative AI has been used in a number of mainstream applications, including text generation, image generation, and even custom animations. However, the technology is still maturing, and AI hasn&apos;t been used by a major company for full-length video animation just yet. That changes with Next Stop Paris, which TCL calls an "AI-generated special." It&apos;s a short romance film written by human writers and voice actors, with contributions from human artists as well. However, the bulk of the animation is handled by artificial intelligence.</p><p>TCL hasn&apos;t made any major breakthroughs in generative AI animation if the Next Stop Paris trailer is any indication. It looks as if the company used an AI image generator to create stills and then added some motion to them. It&apos;s very apparent that the trailer was made with artificial intelligence, as you can see abnormalities, especially in the characters&apos; faces. The voice track doesn&apos;t seem to line up perfectly with moving lips either, creating a viewing experience that can only be described as awkward. </p><p>You can see for yourself what TCL&apos;s animated romance movie will look like from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhQnnISdDIU" target="_blank">YouTube trailer</a>: </p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KhQnnISdDIU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Again, it isn&apos;t as bad as past examples of AI animation have been — you might recall the viral videos of Will Smith eating spaghetti — but it certainly isn&apos;t good either. People at the helm of TCL want to push boundaries with this AI-generated film and see whether viewers enjoy it. While it isn&apos;t explicitly stated, there are obvious cost benefits to TCL making original content that leverages AI rather than using human animators or a live-action format. </p><p>"Story will be at the heart of everything we do," says Chris Regina, chief content officer of TCL. "We are empowering creators and storytellers to use this new technology so the human experience is enriched, and we believe that Creatives with limitless imagination will drive endless innovation. We view &apos;Next Stop Paris&apos; as an early experiment and we&apos;re excited to see how it&apos;s received in the town square."</p><p>TCL says that Next Stop Paris will be released this summer, both online and through the TCLtv+ app.</p>

<ul><li>Google is working on a "Manage Subscriptions" page for the Gmail app, which will help users reduce excessive emails.</li><li>The page will let users find which companies are sending far too many emails "per quarter" alongside a convenient unsubscribe button.</li><li>Google started rolling out an unsubscribe button beside a sender's name in Gmail back in January.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like Google is developing a new manager for Gmail users to help cut down on subscriptions that are clogging their inboxes.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/12/gmail-manage-subscriptions-android/">PunikaWeb</a>, Google plans to implement a new "Manage Subscriptions" section for the Gmail app (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/12/gmail-subscriptions-manager-prep/">9to5Google</a>). Discovered in the latest version of Gmail (v2024.04.07.62), the new management option is now appearing in the sidebar, accessible via the hamburger menu icon.</p><p>Diving into the code reveals how this will work. Tapping the option will take users to a dedicated "Subscriptions" page.</p><p>Several newly added strings of code state that users will find a "button to unsubscribe from the mailing list." Other strings are speculated to be filters as they show a specific number of "subscribed" emails a user has received "per quarter." The number of emails varies from 10 to a maximum of 20.</p><p>If a company falls within one of these parameters, the publication states users should see that company&apos;s logo alongside a button to let them easily unsubscribe from those emails.</p><p>Additionally, a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GMail/comments/1bythzn/gmail_going_to_introduce_manage_subscriptions_in/">users on Reddit</a> have seen alerts in the Gmail app informing them about the new subscriptions page. The alert says the new page lets users "see all your mailing lists and unsubscribe from unwanted messages."</p><p>The problem is that the feature isn&apos;t <em>actually </em>there. Users are unable to find it in the sidebar, and tapping on "try now" puts the app in a loading loop.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this "management" page seems like an expansion of Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/unsubscribing-from-mailing-lists-in-gmail-for-android-just-got-a-lot-easier">previous update</a> for subscriptions in Gmail. In January, the company rolled out an option for Gmail that placed a convenient "unsubscribe" button beside the sender&apos;s name when reading an email.

<hr>
<p>Motorola is ramping up its teasers for its upcoming Edge 50 Ultra by fueling the hype around its charging speed.</p><p>As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Moto/status/1778754950568239145">post on X</a>, Motorola states the upcoming Edge 50 Ultra will feature 125W TurboPower fast charging once it launches. The post accompanies a short video highlighting all the pieces required to build the new device.</p><p>More importantly, Motorola states the Edge 50 Ultra will launch on April 16, 2024.</p>

<p>With this confirmation, the Edge 50 Ultra will match the charging speed of the previously revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-pro-launching-on-april-3-2024">Edge 50 Pro</a>. The Pro model launched in India on April 3, bringing a 4,500mAh battery with the same 125W TurboPower charging capability. This is also the same charging speed as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-40-pro-launch">Edge 40 Pro</a> from 2023.</p><p>It&apos;s still unclear what the battery capacity will be on the Ultra variant. Rumors in March suggested the device could sport a 4,700mAh battery, but that remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Motorola then teased changes to the Edge 50 Ultra&apos;s back panel, which are said to be "bold" and with "textures." This seemingly confirms what we&apos;ve seen in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-ultra-leak">previous leaks</a> from early April. Renders showed that Motorola supposedly opted for a textured back panel for the 2024 flagship. Those renders suggest the device will offer a slightly curved front display with "minimal bezels."</p><p>The leak added that the Edge 50 Ultra could arrive with a triple camera array consisting of a 50MP primary lens. The housing may feature a periscopic lens, a secondary camera, and a rumored laser autofocus between its sensors.</p><p>Internally, the phone is rumored to be powered by Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a> Soc, which sports power slightly below the flagship SD 8 Gen 3.</p><p>Right now, the Edge 50 Ultra&apos;s availability (especially in the U.S.) is unknown. However, we&apos;re not far from the company&apos;s official reveal of the Ultra model.</p>

<ul><li>Google is revamping Chrome for businesses with Chrome Enterprise Premium, offering advanced security features for a monthly fee.</li><li>Chrome Enterprise Premium offers both a paid and free version. The paid version emphasizes enhanced security features such as data loss prevention and deep malware scans.</li><li>Chrome Enterprise Premium employs context-aware access controls to identify and mitigate potential data leaks, even from unauthorized apps.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is giving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Chrome</a> a security makeover for businesses. Called Chrome Enterprise Premium, it adds a bunch of advanced security features for those willing to pay monthly.</p><p>Google has been using enterprise Chrome for a while, allowing IT admins to control things like browser settings and the apps enterprise users use. Chrome Enterprise also offers data protection, malware guards, and phishing protection.</p><p>At $6 a month per user, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromeenterprise.google/products/chrome-enterprise-premium/" target="_blank">Chrome Enterprise Premium</a> beefs up security even more, recognizing that browsers are now where the big work goes down.</p><p>As users worldwide tap into Chrome on their phones and work devices and deal with various software versions and platforms, Google&apos;s got their back. Chrome Enterprise Premium offers a bunch of tools to keep things locked down tight at every step.</p><p>Chrome Enterprise Premium comes in two flavors: Core, which is free, and Premium. Google is pitching this version as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a> that doubles down on online safety, performing deep malware scanning, stopping data leaks in their tracks, and even letting you filter URLs based on what kind of websites they are.</p><p>However, the paid and free Chrome Enterprise versions have some big differences. The Premium tier provides data loss prevention and deep malware scans, but the Core (free) doesn&apos;t. But even with Core, you still get basic stuff like phishing and malware protection.</p><p>There&apos;s some sort of AI magic in there, too, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-chrome-enterprise-premium" target="_blank">Google saying</a> it&apos;s using artificial intelligence to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-remove-malware-from-phone">tackle malware</a> and phishing head-on.</p><p>Chrome Enterprise Premium doesn&apos;t stop there—it kicks Zero Trust up a notch with context-aware access controls. This means it can sniff out potential data leaks, whether from approved apps or ones that IT didn&apos;t give the green light to.</p><p>Google is adding even more controls, too, giving admins the power to implement policies and keep software up-to-date through automatic updates to squash any new bugs that pop up.</p><p>This Chrome edition is also built to stop shady add-ons, making sure hackers can&apos;t sneak in through any cracks. Plus, it plays nice with other Google and third-party security tools to cover all your bases.</p>

<p>Samsung has confirmed that several of its older devices from 2021 and 2022 will receive Galaxy AI features in "early May."</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-s/s22-one-ui-6-1-5%EC%9B%94%EC%B4%88%EC%98%88%EC%A0%95/td-p/26442659">community post</a>, Samsung is preparing to roll out its One UI 6.1 update, packed with Galaxy AI a few devices launched between 2021 and 2022. The company states that while these devices will receive AI tools, some items will be missing.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-review">Galaxy S22</a> series, Flip 4, Fold 4, and the Tab S8 series will receive the same Galaxy AI features as the S23 FE. This means that the devices will gain everything <em>except </em>for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-confirms-galaxy-ai-slow-mo-feature-past-gen">Instant Slow-mo</a> as Samsung notably left the recent FE series out during its confirmation in February.</p><p>The Galaxy S21 series, the Flip 3, and Fold 3 are in the crosshairs of only two Galaxy AI features: Google&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a>" and Chat Assist.</p><p>Aside from the "early May" rollout window, Samsung did not give a more concrete date. However, One UI 6.1 on these older devices may arrive alongside the company&apos;s typical monthly security patch.</p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s confirmation of Galaxy AI&apos;s arrival on several more past-gen devices comes a day after it revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-more-language-support-announced">more language support</a> for the software. Samsung teased that more devices would pick up its AI, and the Galaxy S22 was one of the series on our minds. The company&apos;s head of mobile, TM Roh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-galaxy-ai-support-potential">stated in March</a> that Samsung was exploring the possibility of Galaxy AI on the two-year-old series.</p><p>The primary issue was hardware, as Galaxy AI heavily relies on that area. That reason alone is likely the reason behind the lack of Instant Slow-mo and the missing features of the Galaxy S21, Flip 3, and Fold 3.</p><p>More recent phones, like the Galaxy S23 series and last year&apos;s foldables, picked up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-ai-announcement">One UI 6.1 update</a> at the end of March. The patch brought Live Translate, Samsung&apos;s Generative Edit, and more to owners of eligible devices.</p>
