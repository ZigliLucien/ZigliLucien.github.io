<p>Rugged smartphone maker DOOGEE has just launched its latest model, the S200. This tough little device isn’t just built to last; it's also the first 5G smartphone in the DOOGEE S lineup.</p><p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-rugged-android-phones">leading rugged smartphones</a> on the market, the DOOGEE S200 is built to handle harsh conditions. With its tough components and aerospace-grade aluminum body, it’s earned the MIL-STD-810H certification and IP69/IP69K ratings, making it resistant to water, dust, sand, and impacts. This means the phone has been put through rigorous drop tests to prove it can withstand just about anything.</p><p>The S200 sports a 6.72-inch 120Hz main display and a handy 1.32-inch rear screen that quietly shows you the time and other quick info. Its rear camera setup includes a 100MP sensor boosted by AI and Morpho Imaging tech, plus a 20MP night vision mode and the ability to shoot 4K video.</p><p>Doogee claims this rugged phone can take photos underwater at depths of up to 5 feet (1.5 meters), making it perfect for your aquatic escapades. Plus, with its AI doing all the heavy lifting on the settings, you can just point and shoot and pretend you're a professional photographer.</p><p>Armed with the MediaTek Dimensity 7050 processor, the S200 delivers performance that won’t make you want to throw it against the wall in frustration (though it can probably take that beating since it's a rugged device, after all).</p><p>It’s got Wi-Fi 6 for those who need speed and up to 32GB of RAM with 256GB of storage, so multitasking is as easy as pie. Its gigantic 10,100mAh battery supports 33W fast charging and reverse charging, meaning you can keep your phone alive all day.</p><p>The S200 is rocking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, so you know it’s got performance, stability, and energy efficiency on lock. It also comes with some privacy features like fingerprint recognition.</p><p>The device retails for £260 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DCSKGG6X?&linkCode=sl1&tag=tablet022-21" target="_blank">Amazon UK</a>, and DOOGEE is currently offering a sweet £70 discount. This deal is expected to make its way to Amazon.com by the end of October. You’ll also be able to snag it from the DOOGEE website and AliExpress.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Google TV Home panel is now available on more devices from various brands  like TCL and Hisense.</li><li>You can control your smart home devices right from your TV, adjusting lights, thermostats, and security cameras with just the remote.</li><li>Make sure to set up your compatible smart devices in the Google Home app to use the new Home panel.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google TV Home panel, first launched on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a>, is apparently now available on a wider range of Google TV devices from various brands.</p><p>Google’s long-awaited TV Streamer went on sale last month, along with some useful upgrades for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a>. The big changes include easier smart home control, AI-created custom screensavers, and a new way to organize your content.</p><p>The new Home panel, in particular, lets you control <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-home-compatible-devices">smart home devices</a> right from your TV. You can adjust lights, tweak the thermostat, and check security cameras with just your remote. Plus, it gives you notifications from smart doorbells and lets you manage locks, plugs, and speakers—all without lifting a finger.</p><p>Basically, the Home panel gives you full control of all your smart home devices on the Google TV Streamer, but you can't assign these functions to specific buttons.</p><p>Alongside the market launch of its new streaming device, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-updates-control-center-entertainment-smart-home">confirmed that the Home panel would roll out</a> to existing Google TV devices. Chromecast with Google TV recently got it through a public preview, and now more Google TV devices from brands like TCL, Hisense, Xiaomi, and others are picking up the feature too (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/19/google-tv-home-panel-widely-available/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/15158065#:~:text=Set%20up%20devices%20in%20the%20Google%20Home%20app" target="_blank">support page</a>, users need to set up their compatible smart devices through the Google Home app before they can use the new Home panel on their TV.</p><p>The Home panel appears in the upper right corner of the screen, giving users a clear snapshot of their smart home tech. From this panel, you can get a full view of your devices and dive into individual settings to make changes.</p><p>If the Home panel isn't showing up on your Google TV, try checking for updates to the Google TV Home app in the Play Store. To see if the Home panel is already operational, just hold the home button on your remote to pull up the quick settings, then look for the Google Home tile.</p>

<hr>
<p>Qualcomm is hosting its annual Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii and Chinese OEM Xiaomi announced important news concerning its next flagship.</p><p>During <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/0e5zpV0NS50">the keynote</a>, the SVP and president of Xiaomi, Adam Zeng, arrived on stage to discuss what consumers can expect in the future. The major highlight of Zeng's onstage presence was that the Xiaomi 15 series will feature Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. Zeng states the phones will be "the first" devices to rock the new chip "globally."</p><p>The company SVP added that the user experience "is the most important." Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite will be paired with Xiaomi's HyperCore. Zeng states this technology covers four areas: performance, graphics, networking, and security.</p><p>Together, Zeng says consumers grabbing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15">Xiaomi 15</a> will experience "full-frame performance" during intensive games. Both HyperCore and the Snapdragon 8 Elite are said to drop the phone's power consumption by 29.7%. Moreover, the Xiaomi 15 series may stay cooler as peak internal temperatures are "three degrees lower" (Celsius) compared to Qualcomm's previous gen.</p><p>Lastly, Zeng announced that the Xiaomi 15 series will launch "at the end of October." Xiaomi's William Lu added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/content/dam/qcomm-martech/dm-assets/images/company/news-media/media-center/press-kits/snapdragon-summit-2024/day-1/documents/PartnerQuoteSheet.pdf">in separate statement</a> that the 8 Elite will usher in "a new era of on-device generative AI with the support of on-device multi-modal generative AI applications." </p><p>Other news from Xiaomi during the keynote touted its continued presence in the #3 spot of the top smartphone brands globally. What's more, the Chinese OEM reportedly accounts for 22.1% of "total shipments" in 2024.</p>

<p>Qualcomm announced its newest SoC, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">the Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> during its Summit 2024 event in Maui. The chip is built off the 3nm, TSMC process with two prime cores, clocking out at 4.32GHz prime cores. The chip's internal structure continues with six 3.53GHz performance cores and 5.3Gbps LPDDR5X memory.</p><p>Qualcomm states the Snapdragon 8 Elite reaches a 45% boost in single and multi-core performance over its predecessor. Additionally, the chip should deliver a 44% increase in phone efficiency.

The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7, our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatch</a> that money can buy today, just scored a whopping 18% discount at Amazon, knocking the price down to its lowest point EVER. No fine print, no strings attached — just good old-fashioned savings. </p><p>We&apos;ll have to hold off for a few more weeks to see most of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">Black Friday discounts</a> go live, but in the meantime, this deal is quite the treat. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> is our favorite smartwatch on the market right now, not because it's the most powerful, but because it balances innovative features and premium specs with a price tag that's accessible for most folks. Buy the 40mm watch from Amazon today and you'll get even more bang for your buck, as the retailer is currently carving a historic 18% off for a limited time.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-watch7-aluminum-smartwatch-40mm-bt-cream/6585114.p">Best Buy - $259.99</a> | <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Galaxy-Watch7-40mm-Cream-Bluetooth/6214656451">Walmart - $244.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1YNVD88" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="301bfea2-0edc-4feb-9b6f-ec6e2d07abf2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299.99" data-dimension48="$299.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>If you&apos;re familiar with past <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung watches</a>, you&apos;ll notice that the Galaxy Watch 7 is more about careful refinement than reinventing the wheel. While the Watch 7 retains the vibrant, scratch-resistant AMOLED display, most of the watch&apos;s upgrades can be found under the hood. You get a snappy Exynos processer for smooth app performance, plus 40 hours of battery life, 13 heart rate LEDs for super-accurate monitoring, and a ton of new Galaxy AI software features. There&apos;s also 32GB of storage and 2GB of RAM, and the four years of guaranteed OS updates means you could be using this watch through 2028 before it starts to feel even remotely dated. </p><p>Like we already mentioned, the Galaxy Watch 7 doesn&apos;t look that different from its predecessor, so it probably won&apos;t be particularly impressive in the style department (although using replacement <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">Galaxy Watch 7 bands</a> can help). We were also disappointed to see that Samsung got rid of the Wireless Power Share feature that let you juice up your smartwatch using another device. </p><p>In the grand scheme of things, these flaws are pretty minor, so if you were hoping to find a great smartwatch at a discount before the holiday madness begins, don&apos;t let this early Black Friday deal from Amazon pass you by. </p>

<ul><li>Honor showcased Autopilot AI at Qualcomm's annual summit, with the on-device AI agent coming to the Magic 7 series. </li><li>The Magic 7 series is powered by Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite platform. </li><li>Honor will unveil the devices in China on October 30. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor is set to unveil the Magic 7 series in China on October 30, but it isn&apos;t waiting until then to showcase the phone&apos;s AI features. The Chinese manufacturer took to the stage at Qualcomm&apos;s annual summit in Hawaii to announce Autopilot AI, and on-device AI agent that can be used to automate mundane tasks.</p><p>Honor says the on-device AI can assist with "travel planning, ticket booking, calendar scheduling, notification management, cross-app file transfer," and it also has the ability to get rid of unwanted subscriptions. It sounds similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">Large Action Model (LAM)</a> Motorola showed off at Lenovo Tech World 2024, but that was just a proof of concept, and Honor&apos;s Autopilot AI will actually be available on the company&apos;s next flagship series. All of that sounds great, but I&apos;ll wait until I get my hands on the Magic 7 to see how it actually holds up in real-world testing.</p><p>It&apos;s clear that Honor wants AI to be a key talking point on its phones; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-magicos-80-with-android-14-and-a-generous-serving-of-ai">MagicOS 8.0</a> introduced the Magic Portal last year, delivering intent-based AI use cases. While its usability was limited, Honor teamed up with Google to bring a slate of new features to its devices later in the year, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Magic V3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-battery-life">Magic 6 Pro</a> continue to be great in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1913px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.39%;"><img id="owr5Ew97kcwvHsEStSziN7" name="magic-7-2.jpg" alt="Honor's Magic 7 on-device AI showcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/owr5Ew97kcwvHsEStSziN7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1913" height="964" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The on-device AI agent will debut in MagicOS 9.0, which is what the Magic 7 series will run out of the box. In addition to an AI assistant, Honor is bringing generative AI to gaming, noting that its on-device AI rendering engine will reduce the load on the GPU, delivering better image fidelity and thermals.</p><p>With Qualcomm highlighting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> at its summit, Honor becomes one of the first brands to confirm the use of the next-gen platform on its devices. With the Magic 7 series set to debut on October 30, we don&apos;t have to wait too long to know more about what these devices bring to the table.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-deals"><span>Google Pixel 9 deals</span></h3>
<p>The base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> starts at $799 for the 128GB version and $899 for the 256GB phone. Both configurations boast 12GB of RAM straight out of the box, plus you'll enjoy the efficiency of the new Tensor G4 chipset alongside an improved 4,700mAh battery and loads of AI-powered software features. </p>

<p>For the first time ever, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> is the same size as the base model Google Pixel 9 — but fear not, things still look quite different under the hood. The Google Pixel 9 Pro boasts the Tensor G4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, plus you get an improved 42 MP front camera system and a telephoto lens (another first for Google devices). The Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 for the 128GB version, and there's also a more-expensive 1TB version if you need additional storage.</p>

<ul><li>Google is pushing an update to Workspace customers that includes Gemini-backed summaries for unread conversations.</li><li>A "summarize" button will appear when hovering over conversations and interacting with it produces a bulleted list of "important" information.</li><li>Earlier in October, Google Chat picked up video messaging, an extension of its earlier voice messages update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an update for its Chat app that&apos;ll tell you everything you need to know <em>before </em>opening a thread.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/10/gemini-summaries-google-chat.html">Workspace post</a>, Google highlighted the beginning of its "Gemini in Chat" update that brings AI-backed summaries to busy conversations. The company states users will soon find a bulleted list of "important" points from an unread chat thread in the app. Google states the feature may help users "focus" and find what&apos;s important before tackling other tasks.</p><p>Users opening Chat&apos;s "Home" page on the web will find Gemini&apos;s typical starry "summarize" button when hovering over an unread conversation. Clicking it will expand the single line like a drop-down menu. From there, users will see a "Summary" banner with the key points Gemini feels are important. Google states this is intended to be a "synopsis" of the conversation.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini&apos;s</a> chat summaries are rolling out for mobile users, too. However, to surface them, users on mobile must long-press an unread chat thread. Gemini&apos;s summaries will appear automatically above the app&apos;s typical list of thread options.</p><p>Of course, Google includes its typical AI tagline that it could "get things wrong." Users may want to hop in and check things out just to be safe. Additionally, the post states users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10079371">can turn this off</a> if they don&apos;t want Gemini going through for synopsis purposes.</p><p>The update is rolling out for web, Android, and iOS users today (Oct 21) on rapid and scheduled release domains. Google Workspace customers with the following add-ons are eligible: Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, Education Premium, and AI & Messaging.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s been upgrading Chat throughout 2024, with its most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-gets-video-messages-feature">hitting users earlier in October</a>. The update brought video messaging similar to what you&apos;d experience in WhatsApp. Google gives users a way to record three-minute-long videos in the Chat app. These video messages can be sent in direct messages (one-on-one), group DMs, and spaces.</p><p>What&apos;s more, this update is essentially an add-on to Google&apos;s earlier update from March <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-voice-messages-mobile-rollout">added voice messages to Chat</a>. Users can tap the microphone icon to begin recording their voice instead of typing a text in a DM or group DM. Unfortunately, voice messages are restricted to Enterprise customers.</p>

<ul><li>The latest beta version of WhatsApp has a new Chat memory feature for Meta AI.</li><li>It allows the chatbot to save users' preferences and personal details in order to give users a more personalized response.</li><li>The feature is seen testing in beta and is likely to debut soon in future updates.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta AI integration is widely popular as Meta owns quite a few notable apps, such as Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, that integrate its chatbot. With WhatsApp, it looks like a new feature for Meta AI is in development, which has been spotted in the latest beta version of the app.</p><p>According to folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-22-9-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>, the WhatsApp beta for Android (version <strong>2.24.22.9</strong>, appears to have a new feature under development that adds Chat memory for Meta AI. The new feature aims to make the chatbot's experience more personalized.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:772px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:77.72%;"><img id="pBBrT6TbCjP2hAAbM5SDAb" name="whatsapp-meta-ai-chatbot-new-feature.jpg" alt="Chat memory for Meta AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pBBrT6TbCjP2hAAbM5SDAb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="772" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In what appears to be a future update, Meta AI will be able to automatically remember some details shared with the chatbot. Utilizing the chat memory, users can get more relevant and customized responses when chatting with Meta AI. </p><p>Users can access this setting by opening the Meta AI chat, tapping the profile at the top, and tapping the new "Memory" tab right under the Notifications and Media visibility sections. WABetaInfo further notes that Meta AI can retain many users' details, such as their diet preferences, birthdays, allergies, books, and what kind of podcasts they like.</p>
<p>The chatbot's responses after the update will be based on the details stored in the Meta AI. Despite storing all such data, users are believed to have full control over the data they choose to share with the chatbot. This data can also be deleted at any time, which users need to be aware of whenever they want to share their personal preferences. </p><p>Having a more personal chatbot based on your interests could make Meta AI more useful than getting more generic responses. The latest feature is currently in the works since it is in beta and can be downloaded through the Google Play Beta Program. General users will be able to see the update once the rollout begins, which should likely be sooner rather than later.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors state the Pixel 9a's dimensions could arrive as: 154.7 x 73.2 x 8.9mm.</li><li>Speculation states the Pixel 9a's display could rise from the Pixel 8a's 6.1-inch display to 6.2 or 6.3 inches.</li><li>A host of alleged Pixel 9a renders surfaced recently, suggesting the phone could forgo an iconic aspect of the Pixel lineup.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new leak claims to have narrowed down the dimensions of the upcoming budget Pixel from Google.</p><p>The leaks stem from known X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1847298428906127770">OnLeaks</a>, who states they&apos;ve received "updated data" about the Pixel 9a&apos;s dimensions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/10/google-pixel-9a-dimensions.html">Android Headlines</a>). According to the rumors, the next A-series Pixel could sport the following measurements: 154.7 x 73.2 x 8.9mm. The tipster adds that the final measurement rises to "9.4mm" when the rear camera housing is accounted for.</p><p>These measurements suggest a slightly higher (taller) and wider device than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a&apos;s</a> 152.1 x 72.7 x 8.9mm measurements.</p><p>Rumors about the device&apos;s display remain relatively uncertain. However, the publication theorizes that the slight changes in the Pixel 9a&apos;s dimensions could produce a small display increase. The publication speculates the Pixel 9a could greet users with a 6.2 to 6.3-inch display, which would put it up against the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 9</a>. </p><p>Moreover, as the publication adds, the A-series Pixel often boasts larger bezels than the flagship line. With that in mind, this slight dimension change may not matter much. The Pixel 9a could end up featuring <em>even more </em>noticeable bezels than we may want.</p><p>This is speculation at this point, so take this in with caution.</p>

<p>There&apos;s still some time before a Pixel 9a reveal, but that&apos;s not stopping a slew of renderings from surfacing. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">alleged imagery</a> suggests the Pixel 9a will mirror the flagship Pixel 9 series&apos; design but with one major change: a lack of a camera visor. Rumors claim the phone will drop the massive camera bump in favor of an array flush to the rear panel.</p><p>Google stood by its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">large and proud camera bump</a> on the Pixel 9 in August. However, the company cited consumer interest in photography as the catalyst for the bump. Google&apos;s Director of Design for Pixel phones, Claude Zellweger said that an interest in wanting sharper, clearer photos requires beefier sensors and lenses — thus the big bump.</p><p>How this rumored change affects the Pixel 9a&apos;s camera performance remains to be seen.</p><p>In other news, the Pixel 9a is rumored to grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9a-modem-tensor-g4-rumored-changes">strange Tensor G4 change</a>.

We&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-7a-tensor-g2-alleged-packaging">seen this happen</a> with the Pixel 7a, so it seems history is repeating itself.</p><p>The Pixel 9a is rumored to debut in Q2 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon 8 Elite, a 3nm TSMC-made SoC, at its annual summit on Monday.</li><li>It has two 4.32GHz prime cores and six 3.53GHz performance cores, along with 5.3Gbps LPDDR5X memory.</li><li>Qualcomm promises its new Oryon CPU offers a 45% single- and multi-core performance boost with a 44% efficiency boost over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</li><li>Its GPU and NPU performance have also improved by 40% and 45%, respectively.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you find Qualcomm's naming scheme for its chips confusing, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is named to make things obvious: This is its fastest system-on-a-chip (SoC) yet, built to make flagship Android phones more powerful than ever.</p><p>Announced at the Qualcomm Summit 2024 in Maui, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is the first to use a custom Oryon CPU instead of the usual ARM Cortex cores. Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, it won't have any low-clocked efficiency chips, either: its six performance cores hit 3.53GHz, which is faster than the 3.3GHz Cortex-X4 found in the last-gen SoC. And its two prime cores will hit a blazing 4.32GHz.</p><p>As you'd expect, this leads to a 45% boost in single- and multi-core performance over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it's 44% more efficient at hitting the same top benchmarks. We'll have to see how the Snapdragon 8 Elite does for low-power efficiency, but Qualcomm implied during a media session that its performance cores would have no trouble on that front.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg" name="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-8-Elite-clock-speeds-memory" alt="A graphic showing the Snapdragon 8 Elite's 2 power cores (4.32GHz) and six performance cores (3.53GHz), plus the SoC's cache (24MB L2) and memory (5.3GHz LPDDR5x)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Qualcomm emphasizes the Snapdragon 8 Elite's AI boosts over the last generation as well: a 45% faster NPU and 45% better performance per watt. It'll enable popular LMMs like Llama and Gemini to integrate "directly" onto phones for speedy multi-modal AI generation.</p>

<p>Qualcomm promises that these AI enhancements will help specifically for better 5G connectivity. The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-x80-mwc-2024">Snapdragon X80</a> pairs with the AI Suite Gen 3 that's meant to improve power handling, coverage, latency, QoS, mmWave beam management, and GNSS location, with a specific 30% location accuracy boost "even in parking structures."</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite jumps to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/now-available-new-version-of-the-bluetooth-core-specification/">Bluetooth 6.0</a>, which was only announced this September and offers some key upgrades to security and "distance awareness." And it directly integrates Ultra Wideband for precision finding and digital key tech.</p><p>Qualcomm didn't specify which Adreno GPU will be in the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but it did promise a 40% performance speed boost, 40% power savings, and 35% increased ray tracing performance. It has three GPU slices clocked at 1.1GHz and 12MB graphics memory.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2561px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.92%;"><img id="ckgZ4CjqYiqqF37KCtHThh" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Night-Photo" alt="A Qualcomm photo showing a hand holding a smartphone with a photo taken at night on screen, with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ckgZ4CjqYiqqF37KCtHThh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2561" height="1637" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for other subtle changes, the Snapdragon 8 Elite supports QHD+ resolution up to 240Hz refresh rates, which could offer some incredibly smooth gaming experiences to go with the graphics boost. And we could begin to see 320MP camera sensors for the first time.</p><p>Even though everyone assumed the Snapdragon 8 Elite would be called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>, Qualcomm decided to give it the same "Elite" moniker as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite</a> that it built for PCs.</p><p>Aside from saying it "deserves a new name" because of its custom CPU, Qualcomm wouldn't clarify whether future "Elite" SoCs would keep the "Gen X" label or if non-Elite Snapdragon flagship chips with Arm cores would continue, saying it wouldn't talk about its future roadmap.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Infographic" alt="The final Qualcomm infographic for the Snapdragon 8 Elite showing its overall performance gains compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Earlier this month, MediaTek revealed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400 SoC</a> with one 3.62GHz Cortex core, three 3.3GHz performance cores, and four 2.4GHz efficiency cores, all built on the same TSMC N3E process.</p><p>Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-launch">Dimensity 9300</a>, its performance gap—35% and 28% faster single- and multi-core performance with 40% better efficiency, plus 41% improved GPU power—isn't that far off from the gains Qualcomm got with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, even though the clock speeds have a significant gap.</p><p>MediaTek says the Dimensity 9400 hit 3,055/9,600 for a Geekbench 6.2 test or 2.8 million for AnTuTu. Qualcomm says the Snapdragon 8 Elite hits 3,222 / 10,444 on Geekbench 6.3 or 3 million for AnTuTu.</p><p>Qualcomm wins the benchmark battle, and it does so with its own Oryon cores instead of paying for Arm's. But you might be surprised that the gap isn't <em>wider</em>, given just how high the 8 Elite clock speed is. We'll have to get ahold of phones using both chips and see how they perform in the real world before we can judge for certain.</p>
