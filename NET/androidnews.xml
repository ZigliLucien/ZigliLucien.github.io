<p>Once known as the Oculus Quest 2, the Meta Quest 2 is still the most used VR headset in the world and this new low price makes it hard to pass up for a first-time VR gamer. Word on the street is that Meta has been steadily lowering the price of the headset to flush out old inventory to make room for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3 Lite</a>, a new budget-priced headset that&apos;s been rumored for release in the near future.</p><p>As such, it&apos;s worth noting that this Meta Quest 2 deal is probably best for someone looking to casually play VR, or just to get a second VR headset in the house. There&apos;s already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/townsmen-vr-meta-quest-3-exclusive">one Meta Quest 3-exclusive game</a> and another developer recently announced an upcoming Quest 3 exclusive, so it&apos;s likely that more games will continue to edge out Quest 2 support going forward.</p><p>Still, the Quest 2 will likely continue to see plenty of new games as it&apos;s the most-used VR headset in the world. Meta guarantees updates for a few more years, even if it stops selling the headset outright. The Quest 2 is also a great PCVR headset when playing wirelessly with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/virtual-desktop-adreno-motion-engine-update">apps like Virtual Desktop</a>, so this is a great buy if you&apos;re looking at picking up a new PCVR headset.</p>

No doubt, my rival was looking over the same waters on the other side, plotting the demise of who would become one of history&apos;s most fearsome pirate queens.</p>

<p>But this story wouldn&apos;t be nearly as intriguing if it weren&apos;t presented the right way. There&apos;s no denying the importance and influence of a person like Cheng Shih, who helped push women&apos;s rights forward in her own unique way, but this story, among others in page after page of a boring history book, simply wouldn&apos;t hold the same weight — it certainly never did for me when I was in school!</p><p>That&apos;s why Meta Quest games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5420468924659233/">The Pirate Queen</a> are the future of education. The story of Cheng Shih in The Pirate Queen is one of historical significance, and the main plot points in the game are based on known events. What takes place in between is classic historical fiction, but that&apos;s what made me love the title so much.</p><p>The difference between a historical fiction book — my favorite genre, by the way — and a game like this is being able to experience these events for myself. That first-hand experience not only made them feel real, it made them memorable. That, in and of itself, is the key to why this sort of experience is so important for education.</p>

<h2 id="a-paradigm-shift-2">A paradigm shift</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6kmVDTPWM9UFFusy9A8j2f" name="the-pirate-queen-official-screenshot-shrine.jpg" alt="Official screenshots from The Pirate Queen running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6kmVDTPWM9UFFusy9A8j2f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Singer Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My life experience has often been one with little discrimination or hardship. While I consider myself a compassionate individual, there&apos;s only <em>so much</em> I can do to truly empathize with stories of humans who have struggled throughout history. But VR can at least help me do better by putting me in the shoes of a person and having me live out at least a small portion of their life.</p><p>In 2019, Felix & Paul Studios published an immersive film called Traveling While Black. You can watch it for free on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/1931356740318898">Meta Quest TV app</a>, along with plenty of other films, and it&apos;ll take less than 20 minutes of your time.</p><p>This film was the first time I experienced the feelings that come with first-person immersion into another person&apos;s story. Yet, it&apos;s still mainly told from the perspective of a person sitting and talking to another person. I imagine it would have been an even more powerful story if I had actually seen it through the eyes of one of the people.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HlT7173b9o0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The Pirate Queen is immersive in a different way, but it still attempts to tell the story of discrimination against a group of people. Women&apos;s rights were nary a concern among the men who ran society at the time, and even among lawless pirates, it doesn&apos;t seem many were convinced that a woman could be in charge of a fleet of hundreds of ships.</p><p>The game takes around two hours to beat and focuses solely on the night that Cheng Shih came to power. As the developers have openly stated, this is more of a narrative adventure designed for people who appreciate immersive narratives. It&apos;s not a game that&apos;s going to appeal to someone looking for nonstop action or addictive gameplay loops.</p><p>As such, I&apos;d recommend taking your time in each of the game&apos;s thirteen chapters. Walk and look around each room and pick up the objects on the shelves and in the cabinets. Take a moment to listen to Lucy Liu&apos;s brilliant narration of the tale. If you do, I promise you&apos;ll learn something you&apos;ve never known.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>This is essentially a feature-length film packaged in an interactive way.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It&apos;s these moments that really make the adventure shine, and it&apos;s important to know what you&apos;re getting. This is essentially a feature-length film packaged in an interactive way. You&apos;ll not only be learning about Cheng Shih&apos;s story — a woman also known as Zheng Yi Sao, which means "Wife of Zheng Yi" — but about Chinese history and the women who may have gone unnoticed during that time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hi9RxtUUyd7BeVZ2MHQame" name="the-pirate-queen-official-screenshot-shrine-outside.jpg" alt="Official screenshots from The Pirate Queen running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hi9RxtUUyd7BeVZ2MHQame.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Singer Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, I knew about the horrific practice of bound feet but never quite grasped how small one of these boots was until I played the game. Picking one up from the table, I originally thought it might be a tea cup or something similar. Imagine the horror when I found out a woman&apos;s feet might have to fit inside.</p><p>So many objects scattered throughout the story have substantial meaning that delivers an important historical narrative and context that I might otherwise not appreciate if I weren&apos;t holding them in my hands. Surprisingly, the impact of these stories wasn&apos;t reduced despite the lackluster visual quality.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I enjoyed the escape room-style puzzles and the subtle hints when I got stuck.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I also appreciated the light escape room-style gameplay design here. I&apos;m a person who <em>loves</em> puzzle games and jumps at the chance to enjoy one whenever I can. Most of the rooms were simple, and I often solved the puzzles before Ms. Liu&apos;s narrative finished, but there were a few times when I wasn&apos;t sure how to progress, and the game gently nudged me to the right item.</p><p>These cleverly placed whisps of smoke or rattling doors felt like they fit well into the narrative instead of providing a giant glowing arrow to help me brainlessly meander to the next room.</p><p>After all, a game like The Pirate Queen isn&apos;t designed to be finished quickly. It&apos;s designed to be savored and appreciated.</p>

<p>Many parents who were forced to enroll in virtual school during COVID will tell you that hands-on education is generally better than staring at a laptop for hours on end. Virtual school works quite well for some students but is a very poor choice for others when done on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>.</p><p>But if more kids had access to quality VR curriculum, I believe the idea of virtual schooling could be turned on its head. Just as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/why-are-chores-more-fun-in-vr">gamification of chores</a> makes them more fun, the gamification of education — providing incentives to encourage progression — is probably the best way to make it enjoyable.</p><p>I had a chat with Garrett Smiley, CEO of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://soraschools.com/">Sora Schools</a>, who talked to me briefly about how the school is working to implement a VR curriculum into its virtual-only school structure.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BTfMDxqTJs8SobZv5C9GpU" name="sora-schools-vr-curriculum.jpg" alt="Sora schools' VR education apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BTfMDxqTJs8SobZv5C9GpU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sora schools)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I&apos;m not sure the school is currently allowing students to play through interactive narratives like The Pirate Queen, the examples I was given seem far more convincing than watching someone teach through a Zoom meeting on a flat display.</p><p>Smiley was quick to note that most of his school&apos;s VR curriculum was optional and supplemental but nonetheless intriguing and truly interesting.</p><p>"At Sora, we&apos;re super excited about how VR and AR are shaking things up in the world of learning," Smiley told me in the interview. "In the next few years, this technology will no longer be a dream but an everyday reality. These gadgets are getting cheaper and more powerful, so they will be accessible to more people.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re on a continuous mission to make learning interesting. Imagine diving into our Sora Catalog of Expeditions and feeling like you&apos;re there. Whether you&apos;re learning from historical characters, diving deep into the ocean, or even walking on Mars, we&apos;re all about making it fun, interactive, and igniting curiosity in students."</p>

<p>Thankfully, those of us with VR headsets don&apos;t have to wait to experience great content that can <em>also</em> be educational. My very first room-scale VR experience was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/pcvr/984294025016007/">the Blu</a> by WEVR. I played it on an HTC Vive at IFA 2015 in Belin and was blown away at the true size of a blue whale that swam over my head. You can play it today with a decent gaming PC capable of VR.</p><p>Games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/7146257325418969">Terra Alia</a> take the gamification of education in a literal sense, dropping you into an RPG that teaches you a new language. This one is also a bit short, but the developers are working on updates and more content that&apos;ll be added free of charge.</p><p>Thankfully, the multiplayer beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TerraAlia/comments/1biu38c/get_ready_to_level_up_your_language_skills_with/"><em>just launched</em></a>, showing that the developers are serious about keeping the game updated and relevant.</p><p>Seeing is believing, and being able to hold something in your hands makes it even more memorable and personal. Titles like these help people learn better, feel more empathetic toward historical figures and events, and make education fun. It&apos;s a win-win for everyone involved, and I encourage you to give these titles a try!</p>

<ul><li>New sales figures reveal that Google Pixel's market share is nearing 5% in the US.</li><li>This is despite an overall drop in sales of almost 14%.</li><li>Google was the only major Android device manufacturer to grow market share in the US in 2023.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While Google’s Pixel devices are consistently among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> available, they have struggled to compete with Apple and Samsung for market share. However, a new report suggests that Google’s perseverance might be beginning to pay off.</p><p>We’ve previously noted how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-devices-represented-3-of-phones-shipped-in-north-america-last-quarter">Pixel phones represented 3% of phones shipped in Q4 of 2023</a>, building on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-saw-the-biggest-smartphone-market-growth-in-north-america-during-q1-2022">impressive growth</a> from previous generations of the Pixel range. Now, new figures indicate that despite a challenging market, Google has continued to grow its market share in the US.</p>
<p>The figures from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/IDC/status/1770227567192109259">International Data Corporation (IDC)</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/20/google-pixel-us-market-share-2023/">9to5 Google</a>) tell us that in 2023, Google Pixel devices claimed 4.6% of the US market. This is an increase from 3.6% in 2022, which means that Google now has the fourth largest market share in the country. </p><p>This comes despite what is a challenging market. In 2023, overall phone shipments were down 6.9% to 130.6 million. Google sold 13.6% fewer devices than in 2022, while Samsung – currently second in market share – saw a decline of 19% over the same period. In fact, of all the major phone manufacturers, Google was the only Android brand to increase its market share. At the same time, Apple was the only other company to grow its already dominant position, from 47.6% to 51.9%.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hdedsB4PZWkQMnN5zqMfie" name="Pixel-phones-us-market-share-2023.jpg" alt="Pie chart showing market share for mobile phones in the US in 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hdedsB4PZWkQMnN5zqMfie.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: IDC)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google appears to be doing particularly well in unlocked handset sales, for which it accounts for 9% of total sales. This compares with Lenovo at 34%, Samsung at 20%, and Apple at 19%. But despite these encouraging figures, it’s clear that Google still has a long way to go to compete with Apple and Samsung.</p><p>According to Anthony Scarsella, Research Director at IDC, “Apple and Samsung continue strengthening their hold on the US smartphone market, with the two vendors combining for 74.2% of the market. This represents an all-time high market share for the two vendors.”</p>
<p>In other words, Google should be encouraged by the growth in its market share. But, the fact it saw a significant drop in total phone sales, coupled with Apple’s growth when they are already so dominant, means Google still has plenty of work to do in order to close that gap. There are some reasons for optimism, however.</p><p>Firstly, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-leaked-display-upgrade">major Google Pixel 8a leak</a> suggests that Google’s more affordable phone may be almost as good as the Pixel 8. This could make it a compelling option for budget-conscious shoppers looking for a new device. Google also enjoyed significant growth in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-phone-shipments-rose-by-over-500-in-japan-in-2023">market share in Japan in 2023</a>, making it the third largest brand in that market, and the only one to grow its market share over that period. And finally, the anticipated release of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> later this year could well see Google continue its upward trajectory. </p>

<p>A decade ago, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-decade-moto-x">Moto X</a> redefined what a smartphone could be and how it could look. Even if the experiment was short-lived thanks to Google&apos;s penchant for killing off projects if they don&apos;t immediately thrive — Google-owned Motorola at that point in time — a phone with a wood or leather back became more commonplace after Motorola popularized it.</p><p>But it wasn&apos;t long until we saw leather and wood disappear as options on most phones. The official line was that glass was needed for features like wireless charging and water resistance, but today&apos;s phones have figured out how to get around that hurdle.</p><p>This isn&apos;t the first time Motorola has offered vegan leather on its phones, with the finish appearing on high-end devices like last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus</a>. But what&apos;s interesting now is that the company is bringing the finish to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheaper Android phones</a>.</p><p>Motorola tells me it chose to bring vegan leather to other devices in its portfolio for a few reasons. "First and foremost, we always strive to bring premium features to more accessible price points, and the addition of vegan leather gives our devices a more stylish and premium finish, appealing to design-focused consumers."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Motorola is bringing back a trend that it started back with the Moto X, and you don't even have to buy the premium models to get it.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The choice of specific materials is extremely important here. Animal leather tends to rip or scratch easily and it&apos;s not typically the best choice for water resistance. Wood can also face the same issue with water resistance as improperly sealed wood will expand and warp when it gets wet.</p><p>But artificial leathers and engineered wood can make up for these deficiencies while still offering the look and feel of these premium materials. If I had the choice between glass and one of these other alternative materials, I&apos;d choose the alternative every time.</p><p>Glass has its deficiencies as well. It&apos;s slippery by nature and breaks easily. Companies like OnePlus and Google started applying finishes to the glass on the backs of phones a few years ago to help make up for this, but the problem is that it&apos;s still glass, and it still breaks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gvvWMtjhaKwpuriSCzuw8Z" name="Moto-G-5G-2024-back-close-01.jpg" alt="The back of the vegan leather Moto G 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gvvWMtjhaKwpuriSCzuw8Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G 5G 2024 that I&apos;ve been using for the past week is clad in vegan leather, and I couldn&apos;t be happier with the look and feel. The leather doesn&apos;t scratch when I take my fingernail to it, and it feels far more premium than plastic does on other phones at the price point. That said, Android Central&apos;s Derrek Lee notices that his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G Power 5G 2024</a> gets scuffed somewhat easily, so your mileage may vary.</p><p>While the front will still break if I drop it the wrong way, I don&apos;t have to worry about the back seeing any real damage unless I go out of my way to try to damage it. That&apos;s some excellent peace of mind.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Vegan leather and wood options look more premium and, yet, don't eliminate features that people love like wireless charging.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Motorola also adds that "vegan leather offers practical benefits, being easy to grip and soft to the touch, while remaining durable, stain resistant and free from fading." The company says it works closely with supplier partners to source quality vegan leather materials to help it bring more stylish devices without compromising on specs or performance.</p><p>Vegan leather, in particular, makes a phone look <em>incredibly</em> suave and sleek. It&apos;s a far more premium look than glass could ever pull off, and phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x6-pro-review">Oppo Find X6</a> prove this. Notably, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a> also offers a fascinating vegan leather option with an alternate texture to bolster the look and offer more grip.</p>

<p>More than that, phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and its vegan leather option help it feel more like a notebook that you can unfold and use. It&apos;s just a shame that the phone doesn&apos;t ship with a stylus. It really would perfectly complement the whole package!</p><p>I hope we&apos;ll continue to see more phones offer alternative finish options, making it easier to go caseless without the fear of fumbling a slippery piece of glass and metal. Whether we see a Samsung, Apple, or Google phone getting these fantastic style options is anyone&apos;s best guess. But at the very least, it&apos;ll help differentiate other phones from the boring slabs of the biggest companies.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, Motorola has switched up its design language this year, which is evident when you look at both the new Moto G Power 5G and the lower-end Moto G 5G 2024. Instead of the plastic build we&apos;ve seen on previous Moto G phones, the company went with a vegan leather back for this year&apos;s models. This is the same texture you&apos;d normally find on some of the company&apos;s higher-end flagship models, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a>.</p><p>The new texture gives the phone a bit of a warmer, more comfortable feel in my hand, especially compared to glass or plastic, which is good because the back is completely flat. And while the new feel is a nice departure from the plastic build of previous phone models, I quite liked the look and feel of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-review">Moto G Power 5G 2023</a>. I couldn&apos;t say which has a better design, but they both have very distinct looks. The only downside is that the material can get scuffed easily, making the phone appear kind of dirty.</p><p>The phone comes in two colors, and the one I got is called "Midnight Blue," even though this phone is as dark as Seattle in December.</p><p>Meanwhile, the frame is still plastic, and the display still has fairly large bezels and a noticeable chin, so the phone doesn&apos;t exactly scream "flagship" from the front."</p>

<p>The display is still an LCD panel, which is not too surprising at this price, even if it&apos;s a little disappointing. Colors and contrast aren&apos;t as good as what you&apos;ll find on an OLED panel, but the FHD+ display is plenty sharp, and color reproduction isn&apos;t bad, even while I kept the phone in Natural display mode (I prefer this over the Saturated mode). The 120Hz refresh rate is nice, and the MediaTek chipset seems to be able to keep up. The only issue with the display is that it doesn&apos;t get exceptionally bright and can be hard to see outdoors.</p><p>Speaking of the chipset, the phone uses a MediaTek Dimensity 7020, which is essentially a rebranded Dimensity 930, the very chip used to power last year&apos;s Moto G Power 5G. It&apos;s a quite capable chip that&apos;s great at handling regular use, and rarely did I notice it stutter. The 8GB of RAM also seemed to help a lot, and RAM Boost provides up to 8GB of additional virtual RAM, although I never found this necessary to use. That said, I did have some issues with performance in one particular area, which I&apos;ll get to later.</p>

<p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, which is nice to see, even as other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a> wait to receive the update. Motorola&apos;s take on Android is very minimal, so it feels like you&apos;re using a Pixel until you get into some of the settings. Personalization, gestures, and even the update screen all have the Motorola touch. Lock screen notifications also got a bit of an update, with Motorola offering three different looks. I personally love the Bubbles style, which separates different apps into icons that you can tap to view their notifications. The Chip style is similar, but it will put all apps into the same list instead of separating them by icons. </p>

<p>Keeping the lights on is a 5,000mAh battery, which lasts all day and then some. On average, I get roughly 8 hours of screen-on time per charge, which is pretty good considering I&apos;m on my phone pretty much all the time. I would&apos;ve liked to see Motorola put a larger battery into this phone so it could really live up to the "Power" name, but the consolation here is that the company has given its charging specs a huge boost.</p><p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 supports 30W wired charging, which is double that of last year&apos;s model and even faster than the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> (25W). That said, you&apos;ll need your own adapter to reach those speeds since one isn&apos;t available in the box (although some carriers may include a slower adapter). Additionally, the phone also supports wireless charging (15W), which is rare to see on a phone at this price point.</p>

<p>Another nice thing to see on this phone? NFC. When it comes to the Moto G lineup, Motorola usually reserves this basic feature for the Stylus phones, so to see it on the Power was a nice surprise as it finally lets you take advantage of contactless payments with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a>.</p>

<p>As noted before, performance is pretty decent if you&apos;re scrolling through menus, using apps, taking photos, etc. Essentially, you can get away with the basic stuff without noticing any slowdowns. That said, don&apos;t expect much from this phone if you like to play games.</p><p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 struggles to run some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">best Android games</a> like Honkai: Star Rail, which it can barely handle on medium settings (the default settings for this phone). Doing things like walking around will result in a noticeable amount of dropped frames, which is frustrating. Some less demanding games like Gyee and Hogwarts Mystery also struggle to run on this phone.</p><p>Performance could also be better when it comes to the camera. You can probably manage a decent photo in good lighting, but this phone demands a bit of patience, especially since it feels like there&apos;s very minimal processing going on behind the scenes. Photos are lacking in much detail, the color science between the primary and ultrawide cameras seems to be a bit off, and low-light images are particularly troubling for this phone. </p><p>It&apos;s nice to see Motorola continuing to rid the unnecessary macro and depth sensors, and the ultrawide camera doubles as a macro sensor, meaning you can get a wider photo or very close to your subject. Still, the 8MP camera won&apos;t produce the most attractive images, but it&apos;s still fun to use if you wanna get a close-up of a flower or Google&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/new-android-the-bot-mascot-figurine-for-sale">The Bot</a>."</p>

<p>Ingress protection (IP) is another area that&apos;s lacking on the Moto G Power 5G 2024, given that there is no actual IP rating for this phone. As is often the case with Motorola&apos;s lower-end phones, the device features a water-repellent design, meaning it can only withstand "moderate exposure to water such as accidental spills, splashes, or light rain." I live in Seattle, which is often wet, so no IP rating is a little problematic for me.</p><p>As for the software, it&apos;s nice that Motorola lets you opt out of much of its bloatware when setting up the phone, but the inclusion of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-backed-glance-might-soon-bring-ads-to-your-android-lock-screen">Glance</a> is a questionable one, throwing content like news headlines onto your lock screen. It just feels a little intrusive and superfluous when Google&apos;s Discover panel is accessible from your home screen. And even when Glance is turned off, a wrong swipe from your lock screen will open a full-screen prompt to enable Glance, which has annoyed me on more than one occasion.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zGeZGZBBSVSp9ftcBJwoP6" name="Moto-G-Power-5G-2024-review-12.jpg" alt="Glance on the Moto G Power 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGeZGZBBSVSp9ftcBJwoP6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, it&apos;s great that the phone runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, but Motorola isn&apos;t known for having the most stellar track record with updates, particularly on low-end devices. The company hasn&apos;t told us how many updates to expect on the Moto G Power 5G 2024, but based on the trends of Motorola&apos;s lower-end phones, we can probably expect one major OS upgrade and three years of security patches. That&apos;s not terrible for a $300 phone, but it still pales in comparison to Samsung&apos;s promise of three OS upgrades and four years of updates.</p>

<p>The market for budget phones in North America isn&apos;t exactly robust with big names and is mostly dominated by Motorola. That said, there are some other options for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300">Android phones under $300</a> that are worth looking into. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-galaxy-a25-launch">Galaxy A25</a> is a great phone with a great design, a bright FHD+ AMOLED display, a 5,000mAh battery, and Samsung&apos;s multi-year update promise. It also has a pretty performant Exynos 1380 chipset, and it matches the higher-end S24 with 25W wired charging. That said, there&apos;s no wireless charging onboard, it has less RAM than the Moto G Power 5G 2024, and it still has an old-school notch on the display.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">OnePlus Nord N30</a> is also a good phone under $300, and despite its older Snapdragon chipset, overall performance is pretty decent. You won&apos;t find great gaming performance here, but the phone comes with a 108MP primary camera, a flagship design, and great battery life with 50W wired charging. Unfortunately, the camera is fairly limited with no ultrawide sensor, instead opting for depth and macro cameras.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're looking for a cheap phone.</li><li>You want wireless charging.</li><li>You want long battery life and fast charging.</li><li>You want expandable storage.</li></ul>

<p>It&apos;s easy to get complacent with a yearly upgrade, especially if it&apos;s a lower-end phone. With the Moto G Power 5G 2024, Motorola went a little beyond expectations with its new design and upgraded specs. The vegan leather texture on the back is a nice touch, while the inclusion of 30W wired charging and 15W wireless charging see the affordable phone tiptoeing into flagship territory, punching way above its price tag.</p><p>Gaming performance may be lacking and the camera output could be better at times, but you really can&apos;t expect to have it all in a phone that costs just $299. Still, despite its shortcomings, Motorola made some surprising changes and additions (NFC, anyone?) that add even more value to an already wallet-friendly phone. I wouldn&apos;t have much problem recommending this to anyone not willing to spend an arm and a leg on a new phone.</p>

<hr>
<p>Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3 Mobile Platform is the latest expansion to the company&apos;s midrange Snapdragon 7 series. Announced by the tech company on Thursday (Mar. 21), this innovation brings with it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device generative AI</a> capabilities, a 15% boost in CPU performance, and a 45% boost in GPU performance. </p><p>According to the company, the newest Snapdragon Mobile Platform will support a range of AI, large language models, and large vision models, including Baichuan-7B, Llama 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Nano</a>, and Zhipu ChatGLM, allowing users to take advantage of features like AI chatbots and creation tools. Perhaps most noteworthy is the capability for multi-language translation, a key hallmark of AI capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The latest WhatsApp beta on Android brings in a handy new voice note transcribe feature.</li><li>The update will likely roll out soon for Android, as it is already available for iOS.</li><li>Users who'd like to use the feature would have to install an additional 150MB of app data to enable the feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is working on yet another nifty feature for Android devices, which will finally bring the ability to transcribe voice messages. The feature was introduced earlier for WhatsApp on iOS and might soon be included in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones.</a></p><p>Tipster AssembleDebug has spotted the feature (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/Whatsapp-Voice-Message-Transcription-Android.html?m=1">TheSpAndroid</a>) in the Meta-owned messaging platform&apos;s latest beta (WhatsApp version <strong>2.24.7.7</strong>). The APK teardown has revealed some strings regarding the feature, indicating the Android device&apos;s requirements to enable transcripts on WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Per the strings, enabling transcripts should become accessible. However, users who want to test the new feature must download 150MB of new app data. After allowing, users will then get to read the transcripts before they listen to the voice messages they receive.</p><p>"WhatsApp uses your device&apos;s speech recognition to provide end-to-end encrypted transcripts. Learn more," the string further explains.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-7-8-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a> further shares some insights about the new feature alongside the screenshot of the feature in the works through the WhatsApp beta <strong>2.24.7.8</strong> version, available through the Google Play Beta program. The feature is believed to be "designed to enhance accessibility and convenience for users who prefer reading text over listening to voice notes," notes WBI. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="BhXLYMZyA3ruqFQEHJR8Po" name="whatsapp-android-voice-note-transcribe.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Voice Note Transcribe" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BhXLYMZyA3ruqFQEHJR8Po.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The strings from the aforementioned APK teardown can clearly be seen in the screenshot shared by WBI. It is presumably the end user interface that WhatsApp users can expect before enabling the feature when the update rolls out officially soon. </p><p>The upcoming feature utilizing on-device speech recognition and not just relying solely on the voice note audio is a win-win, as the transcription doesn&apos;t leave the device and is simultaneously end-to-end encrypted.</p><p>As the feature is expected to roll out soon, users will be able to see the voice transcriptions right under the voice note bubble in the conversation pane of any individual chat or group. As of now, the feature is currently in development and still in beta and is expected to come in an official rollout soon.</p>

<ul><li>Google has been making small tweaks to many of its first-party apps, and Google Contacts is the latest one to get a slight redesign.</li><li>Google Contacts no longer features a navigation drawer, and it is now replaced with a singular dropdown menu, a label picker, and a filtering button. </li><li>Separately, there's a new page for creating and managing custom ringtones under the "Fix & manage" tab. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is making visual user-interface changes to the Google Contacts app on Android, removing the navigation drawer and adding a new page for custom ringtones. The minor redesign makes it easier to sort, label, and filter contacts in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-google-contacts-tips-tricks">Google Contacts app</a>. It&apos;s available now with <strong>version 4.27.26</strong> of the app, but you may need to restart the app in order for the redesign to take effect. </p><p>Navigation drawers are on the way out across many of Google&apos;s first-party apps, and now that includes Google Contacts. Instead of the drawer, there are three main toggles available. There&apos;s a dropdown menu under the search bar that lets you change views. You can see all your contacts at once, view contacts tied to a specific Google account, or create custom views. </p><p>To the left of the new dropdown menu are two toggles. There&apos;s a label picker that lets you create new labels or select existing ones, and a filtering button that makes it possible to separate phone contacts, email contacts, and companies. Generally, the functionality here isn&apos;t new, it&apos;s just in a different place. Instead of the hamburger menu icon, there&apos;s a search icon at the top of Google Contacts&apos; main tab. </p>

<p>Separately, Google is introducing a new page for creating and managing custom ringtones in the Google Contacts app. It&apos;s found in the <strong>Fix and manage</strong> tab, under the <strong>Other tools</strong> section. After tapping the <strong>Contact ringtones</strong> option in the list, you&apos;ll be greeted with the new page. You can use this tool to give each contact in the Google Contacts app its own unique ringtone. </p><p>"Add a custom ringtone to individual contacts to help you recognize who&apos;s calling," the page explains. "To manage the default ringtone for this device, visit Settings."</p>

<p>Both changes are rolling out now in the Google Contacts app following a server-side update. Make sure your Google Contacts app is <strong>version 4.27</strong> or higher for good measure, and then restart it to see the new changes. The redesign joins other recent updates to Google Contacts, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-app-live-location-sharing">live location for contacts</a>.</p>

Glancing at my neighbors&apos; nametags, I saw engineers from Tencent, Epic Games, and other notable devs and publishers, all crammed into uncomfortable chairs to see Google&apos;s AI-tinted vision of how Android games can get better.</p><p>I&apos;m used to people evangelizing doomed or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/concept-devices-are-going-too-far">premature concepts</a> at industry events like GDC. However, this hour-long talk, given by a carousel of Google engineers and execs, sounded more like a helpful warning to the industry that AI-backed games are <em>already</em> happening and that they&apos;d better get on board if they want to keep up. </p><p>Simon Tokumine, director of product management for Google AI, explained how game devs are using generative AIs like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> today for "ideation" when creating concept art, dialogue, and even early soundtrack treatments. </p><p>The next step, which Google thinks will arrive in the "next few years," is an influx of "living games." These games will have a similar model to live service games like Fortnite and Destiny 2, except that the updates will be "underpinned by generative AI," says Jack Buser, the director of games for Google Cloud.</p><p>What does this mean for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">Android games</a>? Can GenAI really usher in a new era of gaming on par with "CD-ROMs and 3D graphics," as Buser promises? I&apos;ll run through the highlights of Google&apos;s vision of the future. </p>

<p>Every game developer is looking for its next cash cow. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/business-wire/20240202198419/griffin-gaming-partners-and-rendered-vc-release-the-2023-game-development-report" target="_blank">2023 Game Development Report</a> shows that 65% of surveyed development studios make live service games, and 30% plan to jump on the bandwagon. However, that same survey suggests that most developers don&apos;t have the resources to <em>pull off</em> the live service games that shareholders want. </p><p>Google&apos;s solution is to shift focus to living games that constantly update and create new content self-sufficiently, without the same labor demands. </p><p>Buser described how living games would respond to players&apos; "implicit or explicit desires," adapting gameplay to address complaints or to emphasize popular features. He hinted that Google has "something coming very soon on that," possibly a new Gemini feature.</p><p>The panel also keyed in on GenAI-based non-playable characters (NPCs), something that other major tech companies like NVIDIA have focused on this week.</p>

<p>These tech companies, eager for a world where no one has to pay creatives like voice actors ever again, have begun showing off these futuristic tech demos that lip-sync to dialogue generated by large language models. </p><p>Buser says these "fully organic" NPCs, in the context of an MMO, will remember what past players asked and adjust their dialogue accordingly. They&apos;ll also be able to create LLM "chains" where an NPC can pull from other chatbots for information the player needs but doesn&apos;t have. </p><p>Dan Zaratsian, a Google AI/ML solutions architect, later described a vision of hundreds of thousands of GenAI-powered NPCs in a single world with individual character profiles, remembered player interactions, and dialogue with specific rulesets like the game&apos;s lore and history.</p><p>Without a trace of irony, Tokumine described how these computer-backed NPCs would make video game worlds "much more human, much more alive, and much more complete" than ever — despite the lack of actual people involved in making them.</p><p>Humans would need to be involved to ensure that the LLMs don&apos;t generate inappropriate or incoherent content, Google assured. But at the automated scale this LLM system describes, it&apos;s not entirely clear how any game could have enough editors to avoid any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-gemini-ai-image-generation-faults">GenAI controversies</a> or "financial issues."</p>

<p>Right now, Google uses its AI to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-using-ai-to-show-app-highlights-in-play-store-listings">auto-generate Play Store descriptions</a> and improve its game marketing to players. And with the recent launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-1-5-next-gen-ai-model">Gemini 1.5</a>, the generative AI can now handle up to one million tokens.</p><p>The Google team on stage described what this means for developers: You can now upload half an hour of video or three hours of audio to Gemini and "ask it what comes next." You can also upload 10,000 lines of raw code, plus a video of your engineers fixing errors, and have Gemini use that template to catch and fix other errors for you. </p><p>Lei Zhang, Google&apos;s director for Play Partnerships and Global GenAI, described how he uploaded "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" to Gemini 1.5 to create a Sherlock Holmes RPG with a story based on the detective&apos;s past adventures — something Zhang says the original Gemini 1.0 couldn&apos;t handle. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ysJQwTap6BN2hmBTieGpLE" name="Google-AI-Gemma.png" alt="Gemma launch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ysJQwTap6BN2hmBTieGpLE.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google )</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond Gemini, the panel brought up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-launches-gemma-open-model">Google Gemma</a>, the new open-source AI that developers can license commercially. Google wants smaller developers to use Gemma for "rapid prototyping," world-building, dialogue, and other applications that would normally require more resources to implement on a large scale. </p><p>Larger developers are already using Google&apos;s Vertex AI, which Buser says can be "tuned" so that its algorithm focuses on the devs&apos; own rules and data, with greater privacy and more powerful applications. </p>
<h2 id="the-problems-with-google-apos-s-genai-vision-2">The problems with Google&apos;s GenAI vision</h2>
<p>Right now, your favorite roguelikes use procedural generation to create randomized challenges and layouts from human-made templates. And, of course, games like No Man&apos;s Sky create vast galaxies of generated planets at a scale humans couldn&apos;t achieve by themselves.</p><p>If procedural generation expanded to include AI-based NPCs, that could make worlds feel more lived in than ever... but only if the LLMs backing them can become intelligent enough to work unsupervised and avoid hallucinations. </p><p>That also applies to "living games" that will change based on user feedback. Can future versions of Gemini actually be trusted to come up with updates that&apos;ll keep users engaged and on par with the customized, carefully conceived seasons and expansions that gamers have grown used to? Or is Google just taking creativity for granted as something their algorithm can eventually copy?</p><p>Google has hired musicians, artists, and lyricists to train its AI to spew out better results, but its AI almost certainly is trained off of unpaid artists&apos; and writers&apos; work found via Google Search. A public-domain Sherlock Holmes RPG is fine, but Google can&apos;t monitor if companies start feeding Gemini copyrighted material for "inspiration" that blurs the line with theft.</p>

<p>I couldn&apos;t say if the GDC 2024 attendees agreed with Google&apos;s vision or not. But like so many other gaming trends—like live service games—it seems like the kind of thing that executives will latch onto regardless of the problems due to the potential for profitable games without having to pay as much for labor.</p><p>Other major tech brands like Xbox and NVIDIA have their own AI panels coming up this week at GDC, so don&apos;t be surprised if AI becomes a regular fixture of gaming whether or not you want it. </p><p>With Google&apos;s partners specifically, don&apos;t be surprised if more and more Android games start using GenAI and LLMs to make randomized puzzles or new narrative NPCs at a regular cadence. This will give the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> more games to play, but the level of quality and originality will be another question entirely.</p>
