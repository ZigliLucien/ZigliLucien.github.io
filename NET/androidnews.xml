But if you need something a little bigger, you'll have to turn your attention to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/the-stormbox-blast-is-my-new-favorite-bluetooth-speaker/1000">StormBox Blast</a>; while this is still a portable speaker, it is considerably larger, and it puts out 90W of sound, making it an outstanding choice for parties. <br><br>I used the StormBox Blast for over a year, and it continues to be my favorite Bluetooth speaker. Tribit just rolled out a new model dubbed the Blast 2, and while it goes up to 200W, it is costlier as well, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-Bluetooth-StormBox-Subwoofer-Waterproof-dp-B0D9Y7N23T/dp/B0D9Y7N23T">coming in at $209</a>. Having used both, I think the original StormBox Blast is the better value, and with the Cyber Monday deal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Blast-Portable-Speaker/dp/B09PMYTJD2">bringing it down to $139</a>, now is the best time to buy it.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a powerful Bluetooth speaker with great sound and a bold design. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a speaker that's easy to carry anywhere.</p>
<p>The StormBox Blast has two 30W mid-woofers alongside dual 15W tweeters, and it produces 90W of sound. The sound quality is great out of the box, but if you need to tweak the bass or change the sound characteristics, you can easily do so with the Tribit app. Honestly, this thing gets loud enough to fill a medium-sized room, and there are zero issues when it comes to audio quality. <br><br>There's an XBass mode that cranks up the bass to a noticeable degree, and you don't get any distortion even with the volume all the way up. I averaged over 20 hours of music playback between charges, and I didn't have any problems with Bluetooth connectivity — it pairs over Bluetooth 5.3. <br><br>I also like the design quite a bit; it has 32 LEDs at the front, and they pulse according to the music. Interestingly, it has a power bank mode that lets you charge other devices with it, but it only goes up to 10W. There's IPX7 ingress protection as well, and you can easily use it outdoors or at the pool. The only quibble I have with it is that it takes too long to charge, but outside of that, the StormBox Blast is a phenomenal Bluetooth speaker, and you don't get anything that sounds as good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Blast-Portable-Speaker/dp/B09PMYTJD2">for $139 this Cyber Monday</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I exclusively use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/five-years-later-the-kindle-oasis-is-still-the-best-e-reader-ive-used-and-thats-a-problem">Kindle Oasis</a> to read books, but after five years of continuous use, the battery life on the e-reader is pitiful, and it only lasts a few days between charges. I had to travel recently, so instead of the Oasis, I took the Voyage. While the Voyage also has a similar-quality screen, the page turn buttons on the sides are woefully inadequate, and I hated using it. <br><br>That is the case with all new Kindles as well, with Amazon ditching physical page turn buttons altogether. Thankfully, DATAFY's accessory solves this problem; the accessory attaches to the side of the e-reader, and you can use the bundled remote control to physically turn pages on your Kindle. It's a novel solution, and it transforms how you use an e-reader. Best of all, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/DATAFY-Paperwhite-eReaders-Recording-Triggers/dp/B0CN6SSC17">just $15 right now</a>, so you're not spending too much cash either.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need a page turner button to use with your e-reader. <br><strong><br>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a button that goes to previous page as well as the next one.</p>
<p>The best part about the Oasis is the physical page-turn buttons; you just get much better tactility, and I got so used to the feature that I can't go back to a regular Kindle. It's annoying that Amazon doesn't sell the Oasis any longer, nor is there a new model that includes page turn buttons. The only alternative is to use an accessory like the DATAFY attachment, and to its credit, it does a great job. <br><br>The dongle attaches to the Kindle, and the page turning is by way of a remote that you hold in your hand. The remote uses an RF signal to connect to the dongle, and it doesn't need Bluetooth. Battery life is great, and it charges over USB-C. The only issue is that because it connects to one side, you can use it to go to the next page in a book; if you need to go back, you'll need to use the touch controls on the other side.</p>

If you want to take up on this offer, it&apos;s available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C7GGYS7M"><strong>Amazon for $139.99</strong></a>. For a wearable that usually costs about $200, that&apos;s an insanely good discount!</p><p>I just reviewed the Amazfit Balance and gave it a very good rating. What sets this watch apart is the AI features baked in, like Zepp Flow, Zepp Coach, and Zepp Aura. It uses AI to learn from your metrics and design strategies for you to hit your fitness goals smartly, based on the data collected.</p><p>The smartwatch also has plenty of watch faces, a solid companion app, and over 150 sports modes.

<p>The Amazfit Balance destroys every other smartwatch when it comes to battery life. A single full charge can last you two to three weeks easily, so you will never have battery anxiety again. Other than that, the Balance is extremely lightweight, boasts 5ATM waterproofing, and comes with over 150 sports modes. With 30% off this Cyber Monday, the watch is cheaper than it has ever been.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amazfit-balance-smartwatch-38mm-aluminum-alloy-black/6554708.p"><strong>$149.99 at Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Amazfit-Balance-Smartwatch-38mm-Aluminum-Alloy-W2287GL2N-Black/5209727653"><strong>$149.99 at Walmart</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C7GGYS7M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c380ce62-90da-455a-924f-59732d24badc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazfit Balance: $199.99" data-dimension48="Amazfit Balance: $199.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you hate charging your wearable, require NFC for payments, want Alexa onboard, and like to track your health and fitness metrics.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want access to a lot more third-party apps and need an accurate pedometer as a serious sportsperson.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in a full-length evaluation of the Amazfit Balance, you can read my in-depth review. What I can summarize for you is that this is an excellent budget smartwatch that works really well for everyday use. This smartwatch has Alexa onboard, a built-in speaker and mic combo, as well as GPS and NFC for payments.</p><p>I also love the fact that you can store music locally on your Amazfit Balance and pair your Bluetooth headphones or earbuds with it directly. And if you forgot your earbuds, it just plays the music out loud through the watch&apos;s speaker.</p><p>Although the Amazfit Balance doesn&apos;t support hundreds and thousands of apps like Wear OS, the current selection of apps is decent enough. You can respond to messages on the notification bar with a full QWERTY keyboard too, which was not an option on older Amazfit smartwatches. It&apos;s not as capable as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>, but still an excellent smart wearable for the price.</p>

Thankfully, Baseus came to the rescue with this retractable USB-C cable, and I haven't used anything else in the past year. Having a retractable cable makes a huge difference in regular use; I don't need to worry about cluttering up my desk, and it's a more elegant solution. <br><br>The best part is that Baseus's retractable cable charges at 100W, making it a great choice to use with phones, notebooks, and just about any accessory. The cable has four preset lengths and goes up to two meters when fully extended, and it tucks away neatly when not in use. It usually costs $18, but you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charging-4-Stage-Charger/dp/B0CZDJTRPZ">get it for $13 during Cyber Monday</a>, and that's a decent deal.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need a retractable cable that can deliver 100W of power over the USB PD standard.<br><strong><br>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You don't care about the retractable design.</p>
<p>I used this cable for over a year now, and it is still going strong. What I like the most about it is the preset lengths; I usually have my phone on a stand and run a cable via the charging station, and one of the preset lengths on the cable is the ideal distance. The actual cable itself is flat, and it didn't have any problems delivering 100W of power to my devices. <br><br>It's good when transferring data between devices as well; I switch between phones every ten days on average, and I only used this cable to do so in the last year. The retractable mechanism is smooth, the case is made out of a matte texture, and overall, this is one of the best cables I have in the house. If you need a clutter-free cable with a retractable design, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charging-4-Stage-Charger/dp/B0CZDJTRPZ">now get it for just $13</a> — it holds up just as well in the car.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>

<p>Pixel owners are facing a persistent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> Quick Phrases bug, leaving annoying toast notifications on their screens.</p><p>Quick Phrases are meant to simplify voice commands like stopping alarms or handling calls. However, multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1h0x4z2/qpr2_beta_anyone_getting_the_quick_phrases_answer/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a> are reporting about a lingering issue with Google Assistant’s 'Say Stop' prompt. Apparently, the notification refuses to disappear even after alarms or timers are turned off (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/29/pixel-quick-phrases-bug/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>In one instance, the bug has been spotted on a Pixel 8 running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. One user reported the 'Say Stop' prompt sticking around, even on the lock screen.</p><p>The issue isn’t tied to a specific device or software version, with users on both stable and beta Android 15 reporting the problem.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-say-answer-bug-fix-3504194/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has spotted a similar glitch on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> with the latest Android 15 update. When receiving a call, a toast notification popped up, asking users to "Say ‘Answer’".</p><p>While this notification was supposed to disappear once the call ends, it stuck around and locked up that area of the screen. Even worse, it covered the caller ID, making it hard to see who’s calling before you answer.</p><p>As 9to5Google pointed out, this ongoing issue seems to stem from the Google app, which powers both Gemini and Assistant. Until Google rolls out a fix, users might have to rely on temporary workarounds to deal with the annoying toast notification glitch.</p><p>Some users have found that restarting their device clears up the persistent bubble issue, while others have had luck disabling certain toggles in the Quick Phrases menu.</p><p>As a quick fix, Android Authority suggests force-closing and reopening the Google app (found in Settings > Apps > Google) to get rid of the persistent notification.</p><p>Alternatively, turning off the Quick Phrases feature can offer a more lasting solution, since force-stopping the Google app is just a temporary fix that might pop up again with future calls.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've lost count of the number of chargers I have in the house. I got everything from tiny 20W GaN chargers to gargantuan charging stations that go up to 300W, alongside the monstrosities that OnePlus and Vivo bundle with their phones. While it's obviously great to have choices, I only really use two chargers on a daily basis: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-200w-review">Nexode 200W charging station</a> is handy at charging up to six devices at once, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-pro-gan-chargers-launch">Nexode Pro 160W</a> is what I use in the bedroom to charge phones and smartwatches. <br><br>If you just want something that you can use on your desk, the Nexode 200W is a decent choice, and it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Nexode-200W-Desktop-Charger/dp/B09MGRNYHH">down to $97</a> now. But if you've also amassed a collection of chargers over the years and just want one that handles everything, you should pick up the Nexode Pro 160W. It usually costs $119, but the charger is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Pixelbook/dp/B0CCVPB4PC">down to $95 for Cyber Monday</a>, and while that's still quite a lot of cash to put toward an accessory, it is the best all-in-one GaN charger I've used, and it's worth the purchase.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need an all-in-one charger that doesn't take up much room and still manages to charge all of your tech. I used the Nexode Pro 160W for a year now, and it has been faultless. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't need 140W charging. If you want a 100W GaN charger instead, I recommend this Anker charger instead, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-GaNPrime-Compact-Foldable/dp/B09W2PNLX7">now available for $59</a>.</p>
<p>The Nexode Pro 160W is smaller than any of the other 140W GaN chargers I tested, and the foldable pins make it a great choice if you need to take it on the road. I used this charger every day throughout 2024, and didn't run into any issues whatsoever. I charged over a hundred different devices in that time — including 70 or so Android phones, a dozen tablets, my Steam Deck, and a smorgasbord of accessories. <br><br>It uses the USB PD 3.1 protocol to deliver 140W of power to the primary USB-C port, with the secondary USB-C port going up to 100W, and the third hitting 30W. When the two main USB-C ports are in use, you get 100W out of one and 60W out the other, and the 160W power budget should be ideal to charge a notebook and phone or any accessory like a Steam Deck, which only needs 35W. <br><br>With all ports in simultaneous use, you get a total power budget of 135W, with 65W each going to the primary USB-C ports, and 15W split evenly between the third USB-C and USB-A ports. Basically, you can charge a phone, notebook, smartwatch, and any other accessory just with a single charger. While there are dozens of products that do the same, the Nexode Pro 160W has been the most reliable in my testing, and with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Pixelbook/dp/B0CCVPB4PC">discount to $95</a>, it is a smidgen more affordable, and that's always a good thing.</p>

There are plenty of great options out there, like this large <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-cant-live-without-this-25-000mah-power-bank-and-now-its-cheaper-than-its-ever-been-for-black-friday">25,000mAh UGREEN power bank with 145W charging</a>. However, you always have to take size into consideration, and the more capacity a power bank has, the larger it'll be. That's why I love this Anker Nano Power Bank (30W), which is on sale for Black Friday/Cyber Monday with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9CJKCH3/">25% discount</a>.</p><p>The Anker Nano Power Bank (30W) normally sells for $39.99, which already isn't bad for what you get.

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a power bank with plenty of power and easy portability thanks to its small size and looping USB-C cord.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want something that charges faster than 30W and has a larger capacity than 10,000mAh.</p><p>There's a lot to like about the Anker Nano Power Bank. The 10,000mAh capacity means I can charge my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-motorola-razr-plus-2024-deal-is-wild">Razr Plus 2024</a> at least twice, making it more than enough for me on any given day, particularly when at conventions and such. Then there's the fact that it has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c" target="_blank">USB-C</a> and USB-A port since the former is the new standard, and the latter is still pretty common (just ask OnePlus).</p><p>The best part is that the attached USB-C cable loops into the device, making the power bank easy to carry around, whether that's just in your hand or looped onto your bag. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">portable chargers and power banks</a> go, it's incredibly convenient, as is the mini display on the side of the device that tells you how much time is left to charge your phone and how much capacity remains in the charger.</p><p>The 30W charging speed is also fast enough for some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ditch-your-boring-phone-for-the-galaxy-z-flip-6-now-more-than-usd300-off">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> (25W) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-amazon-black-friday-sale-has-finally-fixed-the-google-pixel-9s-price-problem">Pixel 9</a> (27W). My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> charges at 45W and would still top up pretty quickly with the Anker Nano Power Bank, which is why I would recommend it to anyone looking for a compact power bank.</p>

I'll start by saying that I was fully set on buying the Ultimate Ears (UE) Boom 4 during Black Friday/Cyber Monday. I have an older version of the speaker from many years ago, and it was always my favorite thing to bring around small gatherings. However, after reading the reviews, I changed my mind and decided to go for this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXKSCY1G/">Sony ULT Field 1 deal</a> instead.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-ult-field-1-review">Sony ULT Field 1</a> was released earlier this year and retails for just $130. That's already not bad, but I prefer to stick to speakers under $100 if I can help it. Fortunately, this Black Friday/Cyber Monday deal brings the price down to $98, which is right at the top of my self-imposed price range (I'm cheap, so what?).</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a portable speaker with great bass, long battery life, and a good design with support for high-quality audio codecs.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want the best sound experience and want the option to utilize a 3.5mm audio jack or USB-C connection for audio playback.</p><p>I'm by no means an audiophile, so I see no point in paying top dollar to have the absolute best sound. I was hoping the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVFKZ1LC">UE Boom 4</a> would satisfy my need for a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speaker</a> to have at get-togethers, as I remember really liking my older UE Boom. That said, Amazon warned me that the product is frequently returned, and upon reading reviews, many people noted that the speaker was pretty lacking when it comes to bass, which is something I <em>do</em> need (a guy's gotta twerk).</p><p>That's when I remembered our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-ult-field-1-review">Sony ULT Field 1 review</a>, which was done by Android Central contributor Tshaka Armstrong. I read through his review, as well as the reviews on Amazon, and decided this is exactly what I need. Granted, he is an audiophile, so his score is lower than the one on Amazon, but poor sound quality is not among his reasons. He notes a lack of USB-C audio and a 3.5mm audio jack as his main negatives.</p><p>As far as audio quality goes, Armstrong says the Sony ULT Field 1 sounds fine but a little flat if the UTL mode is turned off. However, he notes that "turning it on immediately imbues presence and depth to the sound, making the music fuller and more robust close-up and at greater distances like 50 feet." He even says the ULTE Field 1 is his new go-to take-along speaker.</p><p>Others in the Amazon reviews also note how it has good sound quality, with one review highlighting how the speaker is "<strong>LOUDDDDD as hell</strong>." That's all more than enough to convince me that this is the portable speaker that I need to buy.</p>

But it's expensive as hell, even with this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch-ultra/buy/galaxy-watch-ultra-47mm-titanium-gray-sm-l705udaaxaa/"><strong>$215-off Black Friday deal</strong></a>. Unless you have a good watch to trade in — which can cut the price another $300 — $434 is more than most of you will be willing to pay.</p><p>Looking strictly at Wear OS watches that beat the Galaxy Watch Ultra's 72-hour battery life, you have two main options with major Black Friday discounts: The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-100-Hour-Tracking-Sapphire-Dual-Engine/dp/B0CV5ZG5TC"><strong>OnePlus Watch 2 for $199 ($100 off)</strong></a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ticwatch-Pro-Enduro-Smartwatch-Compatible/dp/B0D179VBXY"><strong>TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro for $209 ($140 off)</strong></a> with the Amazon coupon.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> can last anywhere from 90 to 100 hours per charge thanks to some incredible hybrid efficiency, using its special OnePlus-brand coprocessor to power things while barely using battery life. With its RTOS-only mode, its battery jumps to <em>a week</em> while still showing calls and notifications, whereas other low-power modes only show the time.</p>

<p>Then you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>, which <em>starts</em> at 90 hours per charge but can last at least a <em>month</em> using its secondary, low-res screen, a trick unique to Mobvoi watches.

<p>If you want a detailed breakdown on how these two watches compare to Samsung's flagship watch, I wrote a guide on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro">Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>, while another colleague wrote how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-oneplus-watch-2">Watch Ultra and OnePlus Watch 2 compare</a>.</p><p>By and large, the Galaxy Watch Ultra <em>is</em> better. It beats the Enduro for faster software updates, Google Assistant support, built-in LTE, and brighter display. But the Enduro is more comfortable to wear and (again) costs so much less while offering most of the same Play Store apps.</p><p>As for the OnePlus Watch 2, it matches the Ultra with dual-band GPS, performance, and durability, while falling a bit short for health accuracy and lacking an LTE option. Neither watch has a working crown, so the TicWatch is your choice if you need one.</p><p>Again, the Galaxy Watch Ultra <em>is</em> better than both of these watches; it's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-best-premium-pick">best premium Android watch</a> thanks to its stylish, rugged titanium frame, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">accurate fitness data</a> backed by Samsung Health, and reliable battery life. The only question is whether you should pay another $250 for it, or if you can happily settle for a OnePlus or TicWatch. If I'm Black Friday deal-hunting, I'm choosing the cheaper option.</p>

I use a couple of ancient desktop PCs in a closet filled with hard drives, and everything is patched together, so I have somewhere to store all of my stuff.</p><p>I also realize I don't need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/this-black-friday-you-should-get-yourself-a-starter-nas">NAS designed for enterprise speed and multiple users</a> connecting to it at once, but I do need to save as much money as humanly possible. It's just my wife and me here, storing pictures or music along with the occasional document that can't get lost. A Raspberry Pi and a few hard drives are <strong>exactly</strong> what I need, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> is the time to get it all.</p>

<p>You'll need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a> to run everything. A model 4 can work, but the newer model 5 is a lot better. We don't need excessive speed, but nobody wants to make things slower on purpose. Unless you already have one up and running, buy a kit. It will come with the board itself, a power supply, a case with heat sinks and a fan, and extras like an SD card and cables. You're going to save some money this way.</p><p>This one has it all, and it's on sale for a great price.</p>

<p>Grab yourself a powered USB Type-A hub, too. A Raspberry Pi is tiny and doesn't have a robust power control circuit, so running everything from the Pi's internal USB power isn't a great idea. Using a powered hub means you're not going to see issues copying files back and forth because there isn't enough juice to go around.</p>

<p>Next is somewhere to put the storage. I'm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/this-creality-3d-printer-is-usd130-off-and-works-from-my-phone-so-im-buying-it">3D printing</a> an enclosure for everything and using individual SATA to USB cables, but a drive dock is a lot easier. You can connect multiple storage drives using one USB cable, which can add up to a ton of storage.</p><p>Buying something like this one from MAIWO means you can mix and match 2.5 and 3.5-inch drives, and there's even a built-in drive cloning feature for when you decide to go bigger.</p><p>When all is said and done you'll have this dock and your Raspberry Pi case beside it so you won't need much room for it all.</p>

<p>With room for four hard drives, you're going to need at least one. Most people choose spinning disk drives rather than solid-state drives for storage because they have higher capacities and cost less. Since you're not trying to run applications from the drive, speed isn't as important, and the cost-benefit makes it well worth the trade-off.</p><p>I already bought some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Performance-Gaming-Internal-Drive/dp/B07N8WTFBY">12TB drives </a>over the summer because I knew I was going to do this, but to get started these 6TB drives are great. The Black Friday sale price can't be beat, either.</p><p>Whether you spend $150 bucks on a Raspberry Pi and HDD dock or $500 on a NAS from a company like Synology you're going to have to buy the hard drives.</p>
<hr>
<p>Putting it together is easy. Follow <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html">an online guide</a> to get your Raspberry Pi up and running once you've put the kit together. Connect the USB hub to the Pi and a wall socket, connect the HDD bay to the Hub and a wall socket, plug in your drives, and turn it all on.</p><p>You don't need any special NAS software because everything you need to share a drive across your home network (or the internet!) is built into the Raspberry Pi's operating system.</p><p>Use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/articles/samba-file-server">online tutorial to set up Samba</a> for sharing, and make sure you mind your permissions. Once that's done, your files and folders stored on your homemade NAS will show up through the standard Windows, Mac, and iOS "files" application, and there are plenty of Android file apps that can connect to network-shared storage.</p><p>Of course, you can go a step further and set up something like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/plex">Plex</a> or a network-aware music player on the Raspberry Pi and do more than just store stuff. You can even install OMV, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.openmediavault.org/">a NAS operating system</a> on the Pi, and get all the features you'll find on expensive models, too.</p><p>Enjoy doing it yourself and saving a boatload of money. I do ☺️.</p>
