                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Stuffcool is India&apos;s leading charging brand, and I covered several of their products in the past. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/stuffcool-major-max-power-bank-review">Major Max</a> is a 20000mAh power bank that&apos;s ideally suited if you have a Samsung phone, and Stuffcool is rolling out a new model dubbed the Major Ultra, going up to 65W.</p><p>Obviously, the big differentiator is that the power bank now delivers 65W of power over the USB PD 3.0 protocol. Of course, that comes with the inevitable price hike, with the Major Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Stuffcool-Major-Ultra-Charging-Powerbank/dp/B0D5JKBJTQ/">retailing at ₹3,299 ($39) on Amazon India</a> — the Major Max <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Stuffcool-Major-Ultra-Charging-Powerbank/dp/B0D5JKBJTQ/">still costs ₹2,299 ($27)</a>. I think the Major Ultra is by far the better choice considering you get 65W charging as standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EJEH6pmGJqhhD6HMtYvPLj" name="stuffcool-major-ultra-9.jpg" alt="Stuffcool Major Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EJEH6pmGJqhhD6HMtYvPLj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the Major Ultra is a new variant of the Max, the design is identical. The power bank has a silver aesthetic that looks a little cleaner than the basic design of the Major Max, but there&apos;s a lot of obtrusive text and branding on the device that doesn&apos;t cater to my tastes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YhnRsU7S8LSrMrQMs4rhrj" name="stuffcool-major-ultra-8.jpg" alt="Stuffcool Major Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YhnRsU7S8LSrMrQMs4rhrj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Major Ultra has a rectangular design, and you get the same LED indicators that highlight remaining battery level. There&apos;s a power button on the right, and a Micro-USB port on the left; like the Major Max, you can use the Micro-USB port to charge the power bank at up to 18W. I don&apos;t get the utility of the Micro-USB port; if you&apos;re like me, you would&apos;ve switched over to USB-C by now, and it&apos;s unlikely that a majority of Stuffcool&apos;s intended userbase would have Micro-USB cables lying around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DpHvVXfnKgvmLYZWiYYVDi" name="stuffcool-major-ultra-5.jpg" alt="Stuffcool Major Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DpHvVXfnKgvmLYZWiYYVDi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I don&apos;t have any issues with the design itself, the build quality isn&apos;t quite on par with other power banks. The Major Ultra had one tumble in the month I used it, and the power button dislodged; it&apos;s titled to the side, and is unable to be activated. This isn&apos;t a big deal as the power button doesn&apos;t do much other than indicate remaining battery level, but it&apos;s still annoying.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="A9LWGB3yHVJRPUCDsBrM6h" name="stuffcool-major-ultra-3.jpg" alt="Stuffcool Major Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A9LWGB3yHVJRPUCDsBrM6h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Major Ultra comes with one USB-C port and two USB-A ports. The USB-C port is the one that goes up to 65W over the PD protocol, with the USB-A ports limited to 18W. Stuffcool obviously reused the same design as the Major Max, so it went with the same port configuration, but the brand should have offered two USB-C ports — all other 20000mAh power banks I tested in the last 15 months have at least two USB-C ports, and the Ultra is distinctly on the backfoot as a result.</p>

<p>The solitary USB-C port limits the versatility of the Major Ultra, but the power bank has a unique advantage in that it hits 65W over the USB PD PPS standard, making it a fantastic choice for use with Samsung devices. Yes, you get just a single USB-C port, but it delivers a reliable charge, and the ability to use it with Samsung devices is a big deal in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iDL5hamzhP6CN5yfBezvqi" name="stuffcool-major-ultra-6.jpg" alt="Stuffcool Major Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iDL5hamzhP6CN5yfBezvqi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What&apos;s also great is that the internal battery charges at 65W; it takes just over three hours to charge the 20000mAh battery, but it is much better than the Major Max. The Major Ultra uses standard USB PD 3.0 power profiles, and here&apos;s a quick rundown:</p>
<ul><li><strong>USB-C in/out (65W Max): </strong>5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/3.21A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-C PPS (65W Max):</strong> 3.3 - 13.5V/5A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-A1/A2 out (18W Max): </strong>5V/3A (15W), 9V/2A (18W), 12V/1.25A (18W)</li><li><strong>Micro-USB in (18W Max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/2A (18W)</li></ul>
<p>With two devices connected to the power bank, the USB-C port goes down to 45W, with either USB-A port limited to 15W, going up to a maximum of 65W. I used the Major Ultra over the course of a month to charge the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, Vivo X100 Ultra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, and a host of other devices, and I didn&apos;t see any problems with charging. The dual USB-A ports are better suited to charge accessories, and that&apos;s what I ended up using most of the time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xHZsEGB8f6hdRFsshAtZbj" name="stuffcool-major-ultra-7.jpg" alt="Stuffcool Major Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHZsEGB8f6hdRFsshAtZbj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Stuffcool also did a great job with the bundled cable this time around. It goes up to 100W and delivers 20V at 5A without breaking a sweat, and I was able to use it to charge notebooks and other devices with ease.</p><p>Overall, the Major Ultra is a decent upgrade over the Major Max, and it doesn&apos;t cost too much more. It continues to be one of the most affordable choices if you need a 20000mAh power bank with 65W PD charging, and the ability to maximize the charging potential of Samsung phones is an added bonus.</p>

<p>Apple and Google/Fitbit jumped onto the training load bandwagon in 2024, and it&apos;s long overdue. I credit my boosted VO2 Max directly to following my running watches&apos; training load guidance, especially Garmin&apos;s training load focus graph. But no brand does it perfectly, and I&apos;m more than happy to vent about their flaws.</p><p>Some leave their training load data too vague to understand. Some don&apos;t differentiate enough between different <em>types</em> of load. And some put too much weight on your heart rate average when deciding on load instead of your varied heart rates throughout a run.</p><p>I&apos;d love to combine training load elements from Garmin, Coros, Apple, and Fitbit into one ideal training tool that better reflects my <em>actual</em> training effort.</p>
<h2 id="the-training-load-tl-dr-2">The training load TL;DR</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="azXfWv3jcyT4i4cGt7sgWo" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-and-Coros-Vertix-2X-training-load-ratio.jpeg" alt="Training load acute/chronic ratio on the Garmin Forerunner 965 and suggested training load on the Coros Vertix 2S." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/azXfWv3jcyT4i4cGt7sgWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For people who have no idea what I&apos;m talking about, training load is an arbitrary number calculated by your minutes of activity multiplied by your heart rate effort level. </p><p>A 30-minute zone-2 or 3 run might net you 60 points of training load (aka 30 x 2), while a steady two-hour walk might only give you 40 points (120 x 0.33). A 15-minute track workout might net you 150–200 points, depending on your effort.</p><p>Different brands calculate load with similar methods but their own multipliers and unique heart rate zones. I ran a 10K wearing four watches today and got training load scores of 130, 140, 160, and 220 despite near-identical HR and GPS data. As I said, the number is arbitrary. </p><p>Why does it matter, then? Because they compare your acute load — your added-up score across a week of workouts — against your chronic load — four weeks of workouts — and see how they compare. You always want your recent acute load to match or beat your long-term chronic load. It doesn&apos;t matter if your load total is 200 or 1,000, only whether it&apos;s a better number than it was last week or month, without being <em>so</em> much higher that you hurt yourself overtraining.</p>

<p>Like other brands, Garmin tells you if your acute load is "optimal" to get fitter, with a training load ratio comparing your weekly total and monthly average. What I especially need, though, is "training load focus."</p><p>Under Training Status on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a>, I can find a graph that splits my four-week load into three categories: <strong>anaerobic</strong>, <strong>high aerobic</strong>, or <strong>low aerobic</strong> workouts. </p><p>Conventional running wisdom is that you can&apos;t <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">improve your VO2 Max</a> by running hard every time. You need "conversational pace" workouts in lower heart rate zones to improve base fitness (low aerobic), plus max-effort sprints where your body can&apos;t gain oxygen fast enough and burns muscular energy instead (anaerobic).</p><p>Garmin&apos;s graph yells at me every time I have a low aerobic or anaerobic "shortage," so I make a point of varying my training load types, whereas <em>other</em> brands might simply encourage you to gain as much load as possible. It&apos;s helped me improve my VO2 Max from 46 to 51 in the past year or so.</p>

Half of Coros' load went to its low-aerobic category. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My one (major) complaint with Garmin training load focus is that it puts <em>way</em> too much stock on heart rate <strong>average</strong>. If I run three miles in my zone 2 heart rate zone (HRZ), I usually get about 60 low-aerobic load. Today, I ran three miles in zone 2 and three miles in zones 3–4; in the end, <em>all</em> of that load went directly to high aerobic.</p><p>Every run "is analyzed from start to finish to determine the *primary* category into which it falls," the Garmin Forerunner team explained to me. They do "split the load within an activity into anaerobic and aerobic, but we will not further split it into high and low aerobic."</p><p>When I asked if they would "consider calculating and splitting up load focus based on mile splits or other criteria," I received the rather terse response, "We have considered it."</p><p>Their reply made me less than optimistic, but in an ideal world, Garmin <em>would</em> split up training load in smaller increments instead of focusing on the average. That way, I could jog for a few miles and then end with a high-aerobic mile for fun without worrying that it&apos;ll drag the average up enough to cancel out my earlier restraint.</p><p>I&apos;m also skeptical about how well Garmin&apos;s aerobic/anaerobic split works, for what it&apos;s worth. I ran a half marathon last month where I was mostly in zones 3/4 but consistently hit 90%+ my maximum heart rate for most of the last 30 minutes. I got <em>no</em> anaerobic training effect at the end, only high aerobic.</p>

<p>My ideal training load system would use the guts of the Garmin experience. I still love its training load focus and daily suggested workouts that adjust based on whether you need more anaerobic or low-aerobic load. I&apos;d just "borrow" some things from Coros, Apple, and Fitbit/Google.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:604px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.09%;"><img id="x4N9eTDV6zGdTsjyff23wW" name="coros-evolab-activity-training-load-breakdown.jpeg" alt="A weekly activity breakdown showing how much of a run was easy, medium, or hard." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4N9eTDV6zGdTsjyff23wW.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="604" height="369" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div></figure>
<p>With my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS Pace 3</a> or Vertix 2X, I don&apos;t have to worry about averages. Each run splits the training load into three categories: easy, medium, and hard. So, when you look at the four-week intensity distribution graph, you know it&apos;s accurate. You also get more specifics with the monthly Pace Zone Distribution graph, which splits exact load totals across each heart rate zone.</p><p>What holds me back from using COROS more often is the lack of guidance. I like how Garmin marks the "optimal" easy/hard training load I should have and adjusts workout suggestions accordingly, whereas COROS lets independent runners figure that out for themselves. I&apos;ll admit I need the extra help.</p>

<p>I can&apos;t talk specifics about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Fitbit Cardio Load</a>, the brand-new system being added to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> and other Fitbits, until I can review the watch. Talking <em>exclusively</em> about what Google revealed publicly at its Made by Google event, I <strong>love</strong> that Fitbit calculates load based on both "logged workouts" and "general activity."</p><p>Every other fitness watch brand only tracks training load if you&apos;re "training." But Fitbit doesn&apos;t distinguish; you can get training load any time your heart rate elevates above the norm, regardless of the activity. Some people might prefer having more control over training load, but others will like being validated for sweaty everyday tasks or walking their dog for 10 minutes. Little things add up.</p><p>As for Apple, I haven&apos;t had a chance to test its new 7- and 28-day training load graphs yet; they look promising and accessible for casual athletes, if a bit short on the numbers Garmin and Coros offer.</p><p>What I do like about Apple is how you can manually change your training load impact by rating the workout intensity from 1–10. I&apos;ve been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-phone-isnt-built-to-handle-hiking-and-im-sick-of-it">doing more hiking</a> recently, and Garmin tends to lowball my training load for hikes because my heart rate is fairly steady, even if my muscles are getting sore from the hills and valleys. I wouldn&apos;t mind being able to bump up (or down) my load numbers when I feel like the auto-generated number isn&apos;t perfect.</p>
<hr>
<p>No <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> gets things perfect with training load. Each has its strengths and disadvantages. And frankly, I&apos;d rather have an imperfect training load tool than no load at all! The fact that more brands are implementing it means that we&apos;ll see more innovation across the board as they, <em>ahem</em>, "borrow" from one another.</p><p>For now, I&apos;m going to keep using Garmin, but I&apos;ll have to keep using my workaround: End a run when I&apos;m done with one workout type, and then immediately start another run at high aerobic or anaerobic. Maybe one day, Garmin will let me relax on monitoring my HR average so closely.</p>

Samsung is one of the best brands in this category, and its T5 Evo SSD is a great choice if you need plenty of storage on the go. The 4TB T5 Evo is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDJXZ19/">down to just $199 on Amazon</a>, and that&apos;s a fantastic deal — the drive usually sells for over $300.</p><p>Now, the T5 Evo isn&apos;t the fastest SSD around, but with reads/writes of 460MB/s, it is magnitudes better than a regular HDD. The best reason to pick up the drive is the value; you&apos;re just shelling out $50/TB, and that&apos;s a downright bargain. If you need a faster SSD to use with your notebook, Samsung&apos;s T7 Shield is my recommendation, and right now, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-Photographers-MU-PE2T0R-AM/dp/B09VLJ7VBM/">2TB model is just $149 on Amazon</a>.</p><p>Want an SSD that&apos;s masquerading as a regular USB drive?

<p>The Tube T31 is a good choice if you want an external SSD to connect to a gaming console in addition to your notebook. It transfers data at 1,000MB/s , and the rugged design ensures long-term durability. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-1000MB-External-Compatible/dp/B0CQZCWHTQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b9255a2c-a9c4-4b0f-9341-a2c5a9a1bbf0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$79 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$79 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>You can&apos;t go wrong with any of these SSDs, and if you just want plenty of affordable storage, the T5 Evo is the go-to choice. It connects over the USB 3.2 Gen 1 standard, and while it excels at storage, it maxes out at 460MB/s, and that&apos;s less than half of what you get with most other external SSDs. It&apos;s still four times higher than mechanical drives, and the smaller size combined with 4TB of storage and rugged design makes it a strong contender — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDJXZ19">particularly at just $199</a>.</p><p>If you need blazing-fast transfers, you should just get the Samsung T7 Shield. The best-selling SSD uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2 protocol, and with transfers of 1,050MB/s, it is among the best in this category. You get a durable design with IP65 ingress protection, and you can connect the drive to your phone and transfer photos and any other data you want to back up with ease. Obviously, you don&apos;t get as good a value as the T5 Evo, but the 2TB model is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-Photographers-MU-PE2T0R-AM/dp/B09VLJ7VBM">still a great choice at $149</a>.</p><p>Lastly, the Tube T31 gets my vote because of the design and what it brings to the table. The SSD looks like a regular USB drive, but you still get transfers of up to 1,000MB/s, and it is also based on the USB 3.2 Gen 2 standard. It&apos;s the obvious choice if you want to use an external SSD with a gaming console alongside your notebook, but as there&apos;s just a USB-A port, there isn&apos;t a way to connect it to your phone. If your use case revolves around gaming and notebook use, the Tube T31 is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-1000MB-External-Compatible/dp/B0CQZCWHTQ">standout choice at $79</a>.</p>

For many going to college, this could be the first time they are responsible for themselves, while for others, learning a bit of independence while at home is an important part of high school. </p><p>Of course, the internet is filled with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/reviews">helpful articles</a> letting you know the best things you can get to make everything easier. Even if you don&apos;t think you need any help, they&apos;re worth a read because there is so much out there to choose from, and there&apos;s no way you&apos;ve seen all the choices. Having someone else do a bit of sifting through is a great way to make sure you&apos;re making the best choices.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web&apos;s longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div>
<p>You&apos;re probably most concerned about having the right hardware. You&apos;ll need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">laptop</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phone</a>, some cables, chargers, and a nice bag to keep it all in. Those choices are really important.</p><p>Some are purely personal choices; if you like one thing more than another, you should buy that. One exception may be the most expensive item on your list, the laptop you&apos;re going to use.</p>
<p>Before you decide which laptop to buy, you&apos;ll need to have an idea of what you plan to learn and what courses you&apos;ll take. It&apos;s tempting to buy a MacBook because it&apos;s trendy or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-i-work-chromebook" target="_blank">a Chromebook</a> because it offers insane value, but maybe you shouldn&apos;t.</p><p>Find out your course requirements, and you might find that you&apos;ll need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-book-s-now-available-preorder-999">Windows-powered laptop</a> to do your work. Many engineering and scientific programs only work with Windows or work best with Windows, and trying to load it on your MacBook or emulate it on your Chromebook is a level of complexity you don&apos;t need. There are great choices no matter what operating system you&apos;re using.</p>
<p>Outside of the hardware, you need to have a few other things that help you maintain the level of privacy and online security you want. Most of them are free and aren&apos;t hard to use but you need to know what to look for.</p>
<p><strong>Your passwords</strong>: You probably have a lot of these and maybe already have a way to keep track of them. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-password-managers-android">A password manager</a> is a good choice and one you can also use on your laptop is what you want. </p><p>If you&apos;re just winging it or using Post-it notes, you need to step things up. I recommend using a web browser with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fix-your-bad-passwords-one-tap-google-chrome-android" target="_blank">built-in password manager</a> in tandem with a standalone app. Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all offer great built-in solutions that can create and auto-fill passwords as needed. Copy these into a password manager on your phone so you always have them.</p>

<p><strong>A VPN</strong>: A VPN is helpful for both obscuring <em>and</em> verifying your identity. It&apos;s not the magic bullet many think it is, but a good VPN client and service will securely connect you so that what you see or say is only between you and the person or place you&apos;re interacting with. You&apos;ll be using public Wi-Fi in many places, and you should never trust it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-is-vpn">A VPN</a> is a tool you need.</p>
<p><strong>Office software:</strong> Like your laptop, there are some things to consider when you choose which platform to use here. If you&apos;re gearing yourself up for the corporate world once school is over, it&apos;s simple — use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-office-now-available-all-chromebooks">Microsoft Office</a> products because that&apos;s what powers the world&apos;s businesses. knowing how to use the software gives you a leg up when looking for your dream job.</p><p>If you aren&apos;t going into the enterprise both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-markup-feature">Google Docs</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">Libre Office</a> are free and come well recommended. Either will do you just fine.</p>
<p><strong>A backup solution</strong>: You&apos;re probably not going to be able to keep all your stuff on your devices and there will be some things you simply don&apos;t want to lose. Online backup is an easy solution. </p><p>There are several different providers to choose from, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> or Apple&apos;s iCloud, and they work mostly the same. Once you have something backed up, it&apos;s there until you delete it or the company hosting it, and it goes out of business.</p>
<p><strong>Some common sense</strong>: This should go without saying, but it&apos;s always worth talking about — the internet is forever.</p><p>The things you say and do online, or the things your friends post pictures of you doing online, will follow you for a long time. Be mindful that you don&apos;t end up with a social media presence that you regret later.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj" name="Google-Messages-iMessage-green-bubble.jpg" alt="Google Messages on an Android phone and iMessage on an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Secure messaging</strong>: The things you say to your family and friends are meant for them only. You probably have nothing to hide, but that doesn&apos;t mean you want to broadcast everything to everyone. This is easy to overlook, but you shouldn&apos;t.</p><p>Use a messaging platform that is known to be secure and private. There are plenty, and you probably already have one on your phone right now with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> or Apple iMessage. Other popular choices are WhatsApp, Signal, or Facebook Messenger because they are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-and-use-end-end-encryption-google-messages-app">end-to-end encrypted</a> in most cases.  </p>
<hr>
<p>This is the short list, and you&apos;ll end up using all sorts of software apps and tools throughout your time at school. Don&apos;t overlook these seemingly unimportant things because I promise you&apos;ll need to consider each and every one of them eventually. </p><p>If you&apos;re a parent, this list can help you help your child make good choices. Allowing them to have input also means it&apos;s more likely they&apos;ll pay attention and do the right thing to keep themselves safe.</p><p>You&apos;re the future and you&apos;re going to need all the help you can get. Now, get out there and learn something!</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-is-officially-launching-on-pixel-phones-near-you"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is here... sort of. Google announced on Tuesday, September 9, that the stable version of the software has been pushed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">AOSP</a>, meaning the launch is imminent. In fact, Google says that eligible Pixel owners can expect the stable software update to drop in the next few weeks.</p><p>So what are we getting? There are tons of small additions and improvements, but one of the big features is the Private Space, which will let users hide apps away from view. These apps are hidden behind another authentication layer, keeping them safe from prying eyes. There are also topography improvements for Japanese, Chinese, and Korean languages.</p><p>For foldable users, the ability to save slipt-screen app pairs should come in handy to take advantage of the screen real-estate. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">Flip phones</a> should also have improved app support on cover screens.</p>

Among them is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, which now has the ability to look up songs playing on your phone or in the background with the addition of a music icon. This isn&apos;t too different from the new music search feature on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>, just with fewer steps (although Pixel&apos;s already have Now Playing).</p><p>Android users throughout the United States will now have access to earthquake alerts, a feature that could save lives, while Wear OS users will now be able to access offline maps for added convenience.</p><p>There are also updates to TalkBack and Chrome, which are powered by AI. There&apos;s no set date for the availability of these features, but you should start noticing them as they become available, likely over the next few weeks.</p>

The foldable is incredibly thin, measuring just 9.2mm when folded (4.35mm unfolded). That&apos;s compared to 12.1mm for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, with both phones powered by pretty much the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset and the Magic V3 sporting a larger battery (with faster charging. Although to be fair, the V3 has a wider and taller body, but it&apos;s an impressive feat nonetheless, especially considering the company stuffed two 50MP cameras and a 40MP sensor on the back.</p><p>The phone comes in three different colors and is built to last with a hinge that supports 500,000 folding actions, IPX8 water resistance, and a body made with aerospace-grade fibers.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of this comes particularly cheap, with the phone priced at €1,999.

<hr>
<p>Nubia has unveiled the Nova, a fresh addition to the RedMagic lineup. Unlike earlier models, this is a gaming tablet that aims to take over your gaming needs on the go, featuring an overclocked Snapdragon chipset and an RGB fan.</p><p>The RedMagic Nova is set to make its global debut on September 27, following its successful domestic launch in China.</p><p>At the heart of the flagship tablet lies a souped-up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Qualcomm 8 Gen 3</a> chip, featuring an overclocked Cortex-X4 Prime core that reaches a 3.4GHz clock speed. With up to 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, you’ve got a tablet that flexes harder than your entire gaming rig, leaving the rest of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-gaming-tablets">favorite gaming tablets</a> in the dust.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2141px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.96%;"><img id="jWEaFmtVtUGovnGTiQ6PCU" name="RedMagic-nova-gaming-tablet-black-and-white.jpg" alt="Redmagic Nova in black and white" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jWEaFmtVtUGovnGTiQ6PCU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2141" height="1605" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nubia)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The RedMagic Nova’s 10.9-inch display is basically a visual feast with its 2K resolution and 144Hz refresh rate, so you’ll never see a stutter in your games. Gravity X2.0 and Redmagic’s Cube AI keep things running at top speed, while the 10,100mAh battery means you can game until your thumbs give out.</p><p>Moreover, the RedMagic Nova promises a killer battery life of up to 19 hours, giving you around 10 hours of non-stop gaming on a single charge. Plus, it’s got 120W flash charging, juicing up to 50% in just 15 minutes and a full charge in only 45 minutes, according to Nubia.</p><p>But the real game-changer is the 840Hz instant sampling rate. Tablets are usually a bit sluggish with touch input, but this one registers your moves almost instantly. So, you can nail those rapid jumps and shots without turning your expensive tablet into a stress ball.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:9000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="nwN2FY6QuZDTvobvKdS2wX" name="RedMagic-nova-gaming-tablet-RGB-fan.jpg" alt="RedMagic Nova cooling system" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwN2FY6QuZDTvobvKdS2wX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="9000" height="6000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nubia)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To keep your tablet from heating up during gaming marathons, Nubia has thrown in a 20,000 RPM fan, a 3D heat pipe, and fancy internal air ducts. Plus, it’s decked out with a 9,268 superconducting copper foil, a 29,400mm under-screen cooling alloy, and an 89,114m aluminum body that supposedly slashes core temps by 25°C—Nubia’s numbers, not ours. And there’s thermal conductive gel to top it all off.</p><p>The RedMagic Nova also flaunts a transparent glass panel made from lens-grade aluminum silicon, plus an aviation aluminum body and a sleek middle frame. It’s got a 45-degree anti-slip edge and an anodized back cover that adds to the look, while the RGB lights and ergonomic design make for a visually striking and comfy gaming experience.</p><p>On the software front, the gaming tablet comes with a custom <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> skin packed with AI tricks to make your gaming life easier. The USB-C port lets you beam the display to larger screens or VR headsets in 4K. It’s also got a proper desktop mode, not just lame screen-sharing, and it plays nice with popular controllers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5178px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.59%;"><img id="VtLP846J3LKuaDZYfMHUUc" name="RedMagic-nova-gaming-tablet-streaming.jpg" alt="Redmagic Nova game streaming" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VtLP846J3LKuaDZYfMHUUc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5178" height="4173" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nubia)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The device boasts a 50MP rear camera and a 20MP front-facing selfie snapper. Meanwhile, the 3D Explorer Edition rocks 13MP dual rear and 8MP dual front cameras. For audio, both models come with 4-channel speakers.</p><p>U.S. pricing and availability will be announced on September 27, but Nubia has already dropped the Chinese prices for the RedMagic Nova. It starts at ¥3,999 (approximately $565) for the 12GB+256GB model and climbs to ¥5,599 (around $790) for the 24GB+1TB configuration.</p>

<ul><li>Motorola has passed a new device through the HDR10+ certification database, which seems to be a new foldable dubbed the "Razr 50s."</li><li>Due to the listing, it seems the phone will support HDR10+ for its display, but any additional specifications weren't listed.</li><li>Motorola launched the Razr Plus 2024 and the base Razr 2024 this summer and the former provides a large, immersive 4-inch pOLED cover display.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Motorola has already launched two new foldables this year, but a discovery suggests there&apos;s another on the way.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/motorola-razr-50s-hdr10plus-certification/">MySmartPrice</a>, Motorola is passing another foldable through the certification hoops dubbed the "Razr 50s." The phone was reportedly spotted moving through the HDR10+ certification database, likely indicating its support for a 10-bit color display.</p><p>The most curious aspect of this new device is the "S" moniker attached to the number. Rumors suggest this could signify a shift in Motorola&apos;s targeted market. There&apos;s a chance this foldable could debut at a reduced price compared to its recent summer launch of flagship devices.</p><p>More information regarding its specifications wasn&apos;t available during the database discovery.</p><p>Elsewhere, those at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/moto-razr-50s-hdr-certification-3478859/">Android Authority</a> speculate that Motorola could debut a phone with a "similar package" to the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Razr from 2023</a>. That phone offered a small, 1.5-inch horizontal cover display, which offers quick looks at the time, notifications, and the like. The post purports that the company could take that design and offer a few iterative upgrades to differentiate the devices, but to ensure the costs remain low.</p><p>Another thing to consider is the potential name for the device overseas. Outside of the U.S., Motorola dubs its recent foldables the Razr 50 Ultra and Razr 50. In the States, those devices are sold as the Razr Plus 2024 and the Razr 2024. It&apos;ll be interesting to see which way we go with the name from here and if we&apos;re in for a "Razr S 2024" or "Razr Lite 2024" scenario.</p>

<p>How low Motorola could go with this next Razr is an object of discussion, especially considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review#section-motorola-razr-2024-should-you-buy-it">Razr 2024</a> launched at $699. Its competition (think the Galaxy Z Flip 6) is much closer to $1,000 than anything else. Moreover, in Android Central&apos;s review, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia Flip 5G</a> was mentioned as another <em>potential </em>competitor. The phone features a nice, intriguing design; however, it undercuts the Razr 2024 by a couple of hundred bucks.</p><p>While it may seem like $449 is the realm Motorola should shoot for, Nubia&apos;s clamshell sacrifices a lot. Nubia&apos;s foldable doesn&apos;t offer wireless charging, an IP rating, or highly polished software. With that in mind, Motorola might take a look at the purported "Razr 50s" and see how it can keep costs low but still offer what consumers expect.</p><p>On the flip side (no pun intended), we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, the pricier sibling with a more immersive display. Moto provided the phone with a large 4-inch pOLED cover display that takes viewing apps and notifications while closed to another level.</p>

<p>Samsung is expected to release its next wave of flagship tablets; however, users may find an upgraded accessory to go with it.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,145064.html">WinFuture</a> (German), Samsung is preparing to deliver a keyboard for its Galaxy Tab S10 series with quick access to its AI features. Rumors claim the company will implement a "Galaxy AI key" onto the new keyboard accessories for the next tablet series.</p><p>It&apos;s presently uncertain just what this button will surface/produce on the Tab S10 series when pressed. The publication anticipates that many of the new features hitting Galaxy devices through One UI 6.1.1 will be on the Tab S10. How this may look in practice is still unknown.</p><p>The post adds that the button may feature Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> logo, which is a made of four stars, all of varying sizes. The rendering is reportedly not official and is just a mockup of how Samsung could offer the accessory to consumers.</p><p>The publication states this "Galaxy AI key" may arrive on keyboard accessories and cases for the Tab S10 with an included keyboard. This information was supposedly "confirmed" to them by insiders close to the matter.</p>

<p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-galaxy-ai-same-design-leak">set of rumored renderings</a> of the Galaxy Tab S10 duo leaked in August, suggesting we&apos;re going <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-drops-basic-tab-s10-rumors">without a base model</a> this year. The imagery claimed that Samsung won&apos;t chase any new design languages with its tablets once again. The devices may still feature a vertical dual camera array on the back panel. The Ultra model will likely continue to feature a notch on the top of its display for the front-facing camera cutout.</p><p>That rumor also clued us into a Galaxy AI feature the tablet duo could receive. The image showed the devices automatically generating transcripts during audio recording. Considering the rumor we&apos;ve heard about a "Galaxy AI key," perhaps it could help surface this functionality quickly.</p><p>The Ultra model is rumored to feature a 14.6-inch display, potentially indicating the Plus version could begin at around 12 inches.</p><p>Speculation states Samsung could launch its next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-series-launch-month-rumors">tablet duo this fall</a>, potentially in October.

<ul><li>Google's recent Android 15 QPR1 Beta holds clues that point toward a major makeover for the system's notifications and quick settings panel.</li><li>Viewing notifications could produce a smaller panel that takes up less of your display while the full settings menu could hold smaller, circular icons.</li><li>The recent Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1.1 patch fixes a rebooting Pixel problem, but we're still waiting on the stable launch, which could happen in October.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Clues in Google&apos;s Android code suggest a makeover for its quick settings menu, which could impact the way notifications are displayed in future versions of Android.</p><p>A version of this quick settings revamp was discovered by Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-notifications-quick-settings-overhaul-3478974/">Android Authority</a>) when perusing a recent Android 15 QPR1 Beta. He noticed a major change in the menu&apos;s functionality: it takes two fingers to open fully. Rahman states that the new menu (after swiping down) only takes up "a quarter of your screen." </p><p>However, if you&apos;re interested in opening it fully, users will reportedly need to drag two fingers down their display.</p><p>The full quick settings menu offers much smaller, circular options for what we already have on Android today: flashlight, airplane mode, Google Home, and more. The code states users can "hold and drag to rearrange tiles." That&apos;s not anything new, but what is new is the design. Google may keep the top four Android options as larger, pill-shaped buttons, leaving the rest as circular icons. This design looks similar to what&apos;s on newer Motorola phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review#section-motorola-razr-plus-2024-software">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>.</p><p>More importantly, there&apos;s less information with the (quicker) quick settings menu only dropping partway in this early preview. Google&apos;s code teases that the initial swipe down will only show new notifications in a rounded corner area with the time, date, and battery information. This could be a welcome change as the proposed redesign lets users continue to see the app they&apos;re in instead of just a menu.</p><p>Rahman adds that this redesign could hit users during Android 16&apos;s rollout and not anytime soon. The post states that many aspects of this revamp are "unfinished."</p>

<p>Rahman states that the existence of "Flexi" or Flexiglass in his screenshots indicates Google&apos;s codename for its "restructured" System UI. Supposedly, this will allow the company to treat each piece of its UI as its own component called a "scene." Perhaps this will lead to more changes and redesigns down the road.</p><p>If true, the idea of Android 16 is (quite literally) a year away. For now, we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-1-1-minor-patch">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1.1</a> update. The latest beta brought Google&apos;s recent Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL to the testing grounds. The minor patch was light as the company was eager to fix a strange rebooting issue that cropped up on IssueTracker.</p><p>Elsewhere, Android 15 is seemingly poised to bring a change to its DND, known as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-priority-mode-qpr1-detailed">Priority Mode</a>." Early signs in the code suggest Google will let users customize their do-not-disturb experience alongside an option to "stay focused" while on their phones. The QPR beta is expected to be the December feature drop, but in the meantime, we&apos;re still waiting for Android 15&apos;s stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-android-15-update-release-3475495/">release in October</a>.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, Windows laptops have gotten a bit of a "glow-up," if you will. While Intel and AMD continue churning out chips that promise the best performance, Qualcomm might have just snuck ahead of them all with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite</a> series. </p><p>See, we&apos;ve been waiting for the day that Intel or AMD would release a chip that is capable of going toe-to-toe with Apple Silicon. To date, that has yet to come to fruition. </p><p>There&apos;s always some major compromise that we have to deal with, whether it be in the power department or battery life. Technically, you can get a laptop that&apos;s capable of matching or even surpassing Apple&apos;s M-series of chips in terms of raw power. But, good luck using the laptop for more than an hour or two before needing to find an outlet. </p><p>On the flip side, there are chips, even Arm SoCs, that provide endless hours of battery life. However, there&apos;s not enough performance to use more than a couple of apps at a time, and you&apos;re better suited to just get a tablet instead.</p><p>This problem isn&apos;t limited to just the Windows scene, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> also have their fair share of compromises. No, we aren&apos;t talking about the limitations of ChromeOS. But it&apos;s always a "pick your poison" situation, and there&apos;s yet to be an option that checks <em>all</em> of the boxes. </p><p>At the time, Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-competing-with-copilot-plus">Chromebook Plus</a> initiative seemed like a great idea, and it still is. Offer a base level of specs and features, and toss in a few extra goodies, all while <em>trying</em> to ease the decision-making process. Times are a-changin&apos;, and it&apos;s time for Chromebook OEMs to go back to the drawing board with the Snapdragon X Elite in tow. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="XsWQwguCiVAwk7xL4Atjm3" name="macbook-pro-14-microsoft-surface-pro-11-windows-central.jpg" alt="MacBook Pro 14 next to Surface Pro 11 on desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XsWQwguCiVAwk7xL4Atjm3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn&apos;t to say that you can&apos;t get both great performance <em>and</em> battery life out of a Chromebook. What I am saying, is that after spending some time with the latest Surface Pro 11, it can get even better. Furthermore, I&apos;m frankly shocked that we haven&apos;t seen any Chromebooks announced with the Snapdragon X Elite. </p><p>Further driving the point home, is that I&apos;m writing this during IFA 2024, at which point Qualcomm has announced more Snapdragon chips that will make their way into Windows laptops. More importantly, this upcoming crop of laptops will be much more affordable than the initial wave, with some priced as low as $700. </p><p>Maybe that&apos;s the answer as to why we have yet to see new Snapdragon-powered Chromebooks. Although $700 might be seen as affordable in the Windows space, that&apos;s not the case with Chromebooks. For that, you&apos;re looking at the higher-end Chromebook models, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-features-rolling-out">Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714</a>, ASUS Expertbook CX54 Chromebook Plus, and others. </p><p>Unfortunately, the real sweet spot for Chromebooks seems to be between the $300 to $500 price point. You might be able to stretch that to include the $600 bracket, but that&apos;s usually reserved for those higher-end options that are on sale for less.</p><p>Okay, so let&apos;s bring it back a bit. What is so special about the Snapdragon laptop chips that make me want one in a Chromebook? Well, at least in the case of the Surface Pro 11, it finally gives me both the performance and battery life that I look for in a laptop.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="sCg7SvA6CCjop2aBwy8b5L" name="acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-with-snapdragon-x-elite.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 714 (2023) with Snapdragon X Elite promo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sCg7SvA6CCjop2aBwy8b5L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1165" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Imagine a non-Apple world where your laptop can last for at least 10-12 hours, while also being capable of running a bunch of apps at the same time without so much as a stutter. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve been experiencing with my Surface Pro 11, which doesn&apos;t even feature the most "powerful" Snapdragon X Elite model there is. </p><p>More often than not, I&apos;m reaching for the Surface than the Spin 714 or even my own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/mac/macbook/macbook-pro-16-inch-2023-review-apple-does-it-again">M2 Max MacBook Pro</a>. Not because there&apos;s anything drastically different about Windows, but because I know that 9/10 times, it will still have plenty of battery left, even after sitting unused for a day or two.</p><p>Perhaps another reason why we&apos;ve yet to see anything of substance here is because of <em>how</em> Qualcomm is making this work. We&apos;ve seen Arm on Windows devices before, but it failed rather spectacularly, despite the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-qualcomms-not-making-special-chromebook-chip">Surface Pro X</a> being practically perfect from a design perspective. </p><p>The reason is that there just aren&apos;t very many developers that are willing (or able) to make their apps compatible with Arm CPUs. There are quite a few, with Adobe notably offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/adobe-confirms-when-premiere-pro-illustrator-indesign-and-after-effects-will-run-on-windows-11-on-arm-natively">Arm-compatible</a> versions of many of its Creative Cloud applications. But, what about indie developers or "one-man-band" developers that don&apos;t have the time or resources to do something like that? </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5vGeuXbbC9oCmbnKzk9LvA" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-3-external-display-work.jpg" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 multiple windows with external monitor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5vGeuXbbC9oCmbnKzk9LvA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is where the fun part comes in, Qualcomm relies on a transition layer, allowing x86_64 apps to run on Arm, which is essentially a mobile platform. There have been some growing pains, but this was to be expected, and honestly, it&apos;s been a much better experience than the first time that this was attempted in the Windows arena. </p><p>Which gives me a nice little segue into the obvious — ChromeOS has been there before, and it works just fine. Our favorite ChromeOS tablet, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-ideapad-chromebook-duet-3-review">Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3</a>, is powered by the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 SoC, a mobile-first chip. Aside from some bottlenecks with the 4GB version and the reliance on eMMC for storage, it works just fine. </p><p>No, you can&apos;t do <em>everything</em> with the Duet 3 as you can on one of the x86 Chromebooks. But, you <em>can</em> do much more than you might suspect, while still enjoying the fruits offered by the Play Store. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1726px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dgghcuEa4ubjgVmxA9yY27" name="google-intel-ifa-2024-chromeos.jpg" alt="Jim Johnson, Senior VP and GM, Client Business Group at Intel alongside John Solomon, VP and GM of ChromeOS & Education at IFA 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgghcuEa4ubjgVmxA9yY27.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1726" height="971" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another factor that may be playing a part in why we have yet to see the Snapdragon X Elite on a Chromebook is Google&apos;s partnership with Intel. At IFA 2024, Intel introduced its new lineup of Intel Core Ultra chips. During the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKK7ITG9wj8">presentation</a>, John Solomon, Vice President and General Manager of ChromeOS & Education was brought on stage by Intel&apos;s Jim Johnson, Senior VP and GM, Client Business Group.</p><p>The two spoke about the power of Intel processors, while also reinforcing the relationship between Intel and Google. A Gemini demo was also played in the background, showing off the upcoming Help Me Read feature, along with the excellent Magic Editor feature in Google Photos. More importantly, the point was driven home that all of the AI tasks were being performed on-device, without reliance on the cloud.</p><p>At first glance, it appears that Intel and Google&apos;s partnership isn&apos;t going away anytime soon. However, I couldn&apos;t help but feel as though the repeated mentions of "Chromebook Plus" was Google leaving the door open a bit. Not because there&apos;s anything wrong with the "Plus" moniker, but it could lead way to additional branding being added into the mix. </p>
<p>To me, pairing the Snapdragon X Elite with a Chromebook sounds like a match made in heaven. Dare I say that it would make for the perfect pairing for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-pixelbook-2">return of the Pixelbook</a>? I mean, with HP bowing out of the premium Chromebook space, things are lining up, yet again, for Google to make a big splash.</p>
