                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When we’re talking about open-ear earbuds, there are two categories of products: traditional speaker earbuds and bone-conduction headphones/earbuds. Shokz has long been one of the market leaders in the latter, but there are compromises with bone conduction headphones that Shokz has been working to overcome with their speaker technology, specifically TurboPitch.</p><p>The problem with the transducers Shokz used in the previous generation of OpenRun Pro was that they sat on your jaw and had very energetic vibrations, making TurboPitch a polarizing feature over pure bone conduction earbuds/headphones.</p><p>With the OpenRun Pro 2, Shokz introduced their DualPitch technology, which builds on the lessons learned with previous generation Shokz bone conduction products. I have to say, lesson learned! Let's get into that.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">The open-ear market segment has been expanding</a> over the last couple of years, and that’s a good thing! With that expansion comes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">greater consumer choice</a>, which forces companies to innovate to stay with or ahead of the competition. And that’s what Shokz has done with the OpenRun Pro 2.</p><p>They’re available for $180 from Shokz, Amazon, and many brick-and-mortar stores that cater to outdoor athletes in black or orange. The black colorway is easier to find in stores than the orange. Shokz also recently released<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shokz.com/products/openrunpro2" target="_blank"> </a>a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shokz.com/products/openrunpro2" target="_blank"><u> white collaboration with world-renowned Kenyan marathoner Eliud Kipchoge </u></a>, with glossy gradient orange and gold accents and trim.</p><p>When it comes to the TurboPitch technology and some of the things that come with it, I’m happy to report that this year’s OpenRun series has greatly improved in that area with the introduction of DualPitch technology. This adds new non-bone conduction speakers and compliments the bone conduction transducers by making the sound richer without excess vibrations on your face.</p><p>There is minimal perceptible vibration from the DualPitch air conduction driver units in the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2. Bass-heavy tracks with the volume cranked up occasionally give you some light vibration, but not to the extent of previous generation Shokz products with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/shokz-openrun-pro-review">TurboPitch technology</a>.</p><p>So, what is DualPitch, anyway? The simplest explanation is that bone conduction technology passes vibrations through your bones so that your auditory structures can pick them up, and you experience "sound." The problem with this conduction method is that almost no bass frequency is passed to you. To solve that problem, Shokz places a separate conventional driver unit inside the earbuds to add those low frequencies back into the mix. That additional unit is their "DualPitch."</p>

<p>So, that’s a little bit of background, but how do they sound? Really good! Bass heads won’t love the flatter sound signature, but products like these serve a very specific purpose, which I think makes up for that. I listened through multiple playlists while walking or running intervals on peaceful residential neighborhood backstreets and busy urban avenues.</p><p>The soundstage when listening to “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” isn’t expansive, but Ladysmith Black Mombazo’s a capella and Paul Simon’s vocals sound really good. Listening to Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’” shows just how solid the sound separation produced by the OpenRun Pro 2 is. The reproduction of instrumentation staged at various locations in the sound field is really good, considering some of the limitations of the technology, which DualPitch augments.</p><p>Listening to Skrillex’s “Mumbai Place,” you can hear how this setup handles bass and sub-bass. The bass is light but present, and the sub-bass gets compromised, but the vibrations present in previous generation Shokz TurboPitch-enabled devices aren’t present. The overall sound is robust enough for your triathlon training, training runs, and dynamic workouts. It's also solid for those who don’t like something sitting in their ear canals and are searching for an open-ear product.</p><p>I also watched some long-form content, specifically “Blue Eye Samurai,” and the movie’s dialogue and sound design were both enjoyable and immersive. Fight scenes with all of their foley and that surround sound design are well presented and immersive. Sound separation when listening to film content is solid, like music. Your podcasts and long-form TikToks or IG Reels will come through clear and full.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1919px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="nLKgfQ8ADd2NNqjFtoAhfb" name="shokz-openrun-pro-2-collab-wearing-wide" alt="Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 on the reviewer's head, showing how the wrap around neckband fits" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nLKgfQ8ADd2NNqjFtoAhfb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1919" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the primary reasons people like Shokz and their OpenRun series is their locked-in feel. That continues with the OpenRun Pro 2! Without feeling like you have your head in a vice, the wraparound neckband helps keep everything in place. Because of the thin wires connecting everything, the OpenRun 2 feels great when wearing a bicycle helmet, hat, or glasses.</p><p>The other aspect of Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 that I like is the companion app. Let’s be clear: it’s pretty basic, but that isn’t a bad thing. You get four EQ presets to customize the sound to your liking and the ability to customize the sound yourself with a 5-band EQ that you can name and save. You also get multipoint pairing in the app, which works quite well. You have to pause to play music or media on your second device when you’re listening to the first one, but that’s standard for multipoint setups. I’ve only used one that switches sources on its own seamlessly.</p><p>You should also know that call quality is solid for the most part. I tested call quality while out for a walk during rush hour traffic, and it sounded pretty good! I recorded some audio in my office, which also sounded pretty good. On one call, though, my wife said I sounded like I was in a tunnel.</p>
<h2 id="well-executed-controls-faster-charging-2">Well Executed Controls, Faster Charging</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="k8emw2ZV8bZsuco7qf55xd" name="shokz-openrun-pro-2-collab-buttons.JPG" alt="Shokz OpenRun Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k8emw2ZV8bZsuco7qf55xd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The controls are very easy to manipulate, even when your hands are sweaty wet. On the underside of one of the frames for the transducers is where you'll find the power and volume buttons. You'll find the multifunction button on the frame where the transducer lies, which controls device functions like play/pause, track skipping, calling, and more. It's clicky and tactile and large enough to activate easily and consistently.</p><p>You'll also find the USB-C charge port on the ear frame. It's a port protected by a flap that seals tightly enough that the inside stayed dry when I ran water over it. That part is an important update as older Shokz used magnetic charging ports, which were slower to charge you back up if you drained that battery. That would be an even tougher thing to do now that the battery is rated for 12 hours instead of eight.</p><p>The USB-C charge port is also a good thing because from dead, you'll get more than 50% charge in ten minutes of USB-C charging. Five minutes gets you roughly 2.5 hours of music playback.</p><p>The trade-off with the updated charging is decreased water resistance from the standard OpenRun product. I know this is a result of losing the magnetic charge port, but the OpenRun Pro 2 has decreased durability (IP55) from the OpenRun, which is IP67. That means you can withstand sweat and some light rain but get pushed into a swimming pool or try showering with them on and bye-bye earbuds.</p>
<h2 id="some-suggestions-for-the-openrun-pro-3-2">Some Suggestions For the OpenRun Pro 3</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N2NdF2UxyMzuQsPb6aKyBb" name="shokz-openrun-pro-2-black-multifunction-button" alt="Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 in black, showing the multifunction button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N2NdF2UxyMzuQsPb6aKyBb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All that glitters isn’t gold, so there are some items that I think could use some improvement. The power output is low, so you must crank the volume up on your listening source. I found this true with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>.</p><p>I’ve found that with open-ear products, having Hi-Res support does make a difference. The additional dynamic range of files with greater data transmission than the SBC and AAC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Bluetooth audio codecs</a> allow, which Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 doesn't support, often makes for audio that is a bit more audible at low volumes.</p><p>Another item I’d like to see in the next version of OpenRun Pro is the EQ settings being saved to the headset. When I switch between my Android and iOS devices, the EQ settings I have on Android aren’t shown in the iOS Shokz app. I want ubiquitous EQ configuration.</p>
<p>The only fit and comfort issue anyone will encounter will surface the first time they hit the iron. With the wrap-around headband, when you settle in for any bench work, bench press, dumbbell flys, etc., you’ll have to reposition the OpenRun 2 so they don’t get in the way.</p>
<h2 id="worthy-of-consideration-2">Worthy of Consideration</h2>

<p>Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 are their best bone-conduction headphones yet! They’re lightweight, supremely comfortable, and durable enough to meet their intended purpose. They are a wonderful improvement over the last generation, and most importantly, they provide solid sound for something that doesn’t sit inside your ear canal.</p><p>If you run, ride, or engage in really dynamic workouts and want something that feels like a 6.0-magnitude earthquake couldn’t knock them out of your ears, these should be at the top of your list.</p>

The Chinese manufacturer is aiming to build on that with the OnePlus 13, which was just introduced in China. </p><p>OnePlus made a lot of changes to the design, and the OnePlus 13 doesn&apos;t look like any other OnePlus device to date. You get the latest Qualcomm hardware, up to 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, and new cameras with better Hasselblad tuning. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4QEnsjhSowEc2TZM3xYjhY" name="oneplus-13-official" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4QEnsjhSowEc2TZM3xYjhY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus unveiled the OnePlus 13 at a launch event in China on October 30, and the phone is set to go on sale starting November 4 in the country. There&apos;s no mention of a global launch just yet, but if the OnePlus 12 was any indication, we should see the OnePlus 13 make its way outside China in the month of January. </p><p>That said, Xiaomi is making the Xiaomi 15 available globally earlier than usual, so it may just be that OnePlus decides to follow suit — I&apos;ll update the post once I have additional details. </p><p>While it&apos;s good to see the OnePlus 13 picking up so many upgrades, the phone is considerably costlier than last year: the base 12GB/256GB model starts at 4,499 Yuan ($630), the 12GB/512GB edition is 4,899 Yuan ($688), the 16GB/512GB version costs 5,299 Yuan ($744), and the 24GB/1TB model is 5,999 Yuan ($842). </p><p>We don&apos;t know what the OnePlus 13 will cost globally, but there&apos;s usually a $100 increase over what the device sells for in China, so we could be looking at a $750 or even $799 starting figure. Again, this is all conjecture, and we should have details in the coming weeks. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13-design-and-screen"><span>OnePlus 13: Design and screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="idULYP7YsgEfrRmJhvUaGK" name="oneplus-12-31.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 next to OnePlus 9, OnePlus 10, and OnePlus 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/idULYP7YsgEfrRmJhvUaGK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus used the same design aesthetic on its devices for a while now, but that&apos;s changing with the OnePlus 13. The phone switches to flat sides — like so many devices available today — and it has a bulkier look as a result. </p><p>The OnePlus 13 is available in white, blue, and black variants, and the blue model in particular looks gorgeous. I like that OnePlus always delivers at least one unique color variant each year; the Flowy Emerald OnePlus 12 was the definite star this year, and it looks like that mantle is taken up by the blue model in 2025.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.72%;"><img id="kXpp9EmL82wDhEaQqiutEo" name="op-13.jpg" alt="OnePlus 13 render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kXpp9EmL82wDhEaQqiutEo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1780" height="885" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What&apos;s also interesting is that the OnePlus 13 is available in a leather back. I&apos;m fond of the leather used on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, and it will be intriguing to see if the OnePlus 13 feels the same way in daily use. </p>
<p>Coming to the panel, OnePlus is once again using BOE as the manufacturer, and the OnePlus 13 retains the 6.82-inch AMOLED tech that we saw on the OnePlus 12. It has the same QHD+ resolution with 120Hz refresh, and goes up to the same 4500-nit brightness in HDR content and 1600 nits in regular use. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13-specs"><span>OnePlus 13: Specs</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U5MtwmSr9qimjcqt7e6jvE" name="oneplus-12-3.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U5MtwmSr9qimjcqt7e6jvE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 has one of the best hardware packages you&apos;ll get on any device. The phone is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, and it comes with up to 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. OnePlus didn&apos;t launch this model globally last year, so it is likely that we&apos;ll get the 16GB/512GB edition alongside the base 12GB/256GB model in most global markets. </p><p>The phone has the latest connectivity, USB-C over the USB 3.2 standard, NFC, and the usual set of audio codecs. What&apos;s good to see is that it has IP69 water resistance, which is a higher tier than the usual IP68 that we see in this category. IP69 protects devices against jets of water (both hot and cold) in addition to all the usual safeguards, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-takes-things-to-a-whole-new-level-with-the-x200-series">Vivo&apos;s X200 devices</a> have the same protection. </p><p>Another upgrade is around the battery, with the device now coming with a 6000mAh battery. OnePlus is using a silicon-carbon cell to increase density, and because of the leather back and higher-density battery, the OnePlus 13 is actually lighter than the OnePlus 12. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13-cameras"><span>OnePlus 13: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XfPqPpn49uJuEm37hjAqQF" name="oneplus-12-6.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 camera island with Hasselblad logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XfPqPpn49uJuEm37hjAqQF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 12 introduced a set of new sensors, allowing it to take much better photos than any other OnePlus phone to date. The OnePlus 13 uses the same 50MP Sony LYT-808 main sensor, but it is joined by a new 50MP zoom lens with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and a 50MP wide-angle lens. </p><p>The wide-angle camera on the OnePlus 12 was average, so it will be interesting to see how the OnePlus 13 holds up in this regard. Although the device is using the same main camera, OnePlus is making changes to its camera algorithms to eke out better photos, and with Hasselblad tuning intact, the device should deliver photos and videos with better details — I&apos;ll put this to the test once I get my hands on the device. </p>

<p>With the OnePlus 13 debuting in China, we don&apos;t have to wait long to know more about the device&apos;s global availability. It&apos;s likely the device will head outside China in January, but with manufacturers wanting to launch their phones earlier than usual, it&apos;s not unreasonable to assume the device will make its global debut in Q4 2024 itself.  </p>

<ul><li>According to recent reports, Gemini can be widely used in split-screen mode on large-screen Android devices.</li><li>The said devices can include foldable phones and large Android tablets.</li><li>The reports say the new window was seen on devices like Pixel Tablet, Pixel Fold, and Galaxy Tab series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Large-screen Android devices are primarily highlighted for their multitasking capabilities, which include split-screen views. Google's Gemini was one such app that supported split-screen views for Galaxy foldables earlier and is now expanding to many other such large-screen devices, per multiple reports.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/29/gemini-split-screen/">9to5Google</a>, the Gemini overlay window on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> now showcases a split screen button previously limited to Galaxy foldable phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p>

<p>Having Gemini in split screen view is particularly useful when you quickly want to research something on the other half of the screen while you might be reading, watching, or even hearing a podcast, for example. It lets you find out about something without leaving or juggling between apps, and it is super useful for large-screen devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> or other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/gemini-split-screen-mode-galaxy-tab/">SamMobile</a> also notes that Samsung's latest Galaxy Tab series also supports the split screen view for the Gemini app. When users trigger the AI assistant, they can now see an overlay window of the Gemini, which they normally do. However, the new button makes putting it in a floating window or split-screen view easier.</p>
<p>The latest addition comes after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assisant-actions-to-replace-gemini-extensions-on-android">recent transition</a> of Google Assistant actions, which are now run by Gemini. It would allow users to send texts on WhatsApp and Google Messages using Gemini — previously performed by Google Assistant actions.</p><p>Gemini integration has also been widely seen in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-ai-gemini-summaries-update">recent times</a> across several Google apps, such as the Chat app, which got a summarize button as part of the latest update. Similarly, Gemini's popular "Help me write" was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-gemini-ai-is-swooping-into-gmail-on-the-web-to-supercharge-your-email">recently ventured</a> into Gmail for the web, including a new "Polish" button.</p><p>Google is expected to roll out the next iteration of the underlying Gemini model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-2-dot-0-likely-to-launch-in-december-2024">in December</a>, according to reports. It will likely be dubbed Gemini 2.0 and become a successor to the current Gemini 1.5 Pro model.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced that it's bringing Google Wallet and tap-to-pay support to Family Link devices next year.</li><li>The functionality will let kids use cards and passes on their devices with parental supervision.</li><li>After first appearing on the Fitbit Ace LTE smartwatch, it'll soon come to Family Link Android devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is bringing a long-requested feature to Android phones managed with Family Link next year: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> for kids. The company told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/30/google-wallet-kids/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> that starting in 2025, kids will be able to download the Google Wallet app on supervised Family Link devices, making contactless payments possible. Of course, there will be a handful of tools and limitations that give parents control of their child's activity.</p><p>For starters, the version of Google Wallet making its way to kids won't include support for online payments. Kids can make in-store purchases using Google Wallet's tap-to-pay feature, but can't buy things online. Additionally, parents will have to approve a credit or debit card before it can be added to their child's Google Wallet app. Every time a kid wants to make a purchase, they'll need to authenticate the contactless payment — just like on the full Google Wallet app. </p><p>Google Wallet for kids became popularized with the release of the Fitbit Ace LTE earlier this year, a smartwatch designed for children. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a> supports contactless payments, and now, Google will bring a similar experience to more devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-create-google-account-your-kid-through-family-link">managed with Family Link</a>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="MqR97nhWDLouM2SmndZgF3" name="add-card-to-google-wallet-pixel-watch.jpg" alt="Add new card to Google Wallet on Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MqR97nhWDLouM2SmndZgF3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Parents won't have to manually approve every payment, but they will see a transaction history for their child's purchases. If something goes wrong, Family Link managers can remotely remove a Google Wallet card from their child's devices. In all, the experience will be similar to handing a child a credit or debit card — but with one less thing for them to lose. </p><p>Some functionality is limited; kids can't add IDs or use health cards, but they can use event passes. It'll also be a somewhat limited rollout initially, starting with the U.S. and select countries in 2025, with a wider expansion to follow. </p><p>“Following the positive response of tap-to-pay on Fitbit Ace LTE devices, we’re expanding tap-to-pay for kids to Google Wallet," Google said in a statement to 9to5Google. "The new experience is built with safety in mind, and will allow parents to supervise their kids’ usage – including approving new cards, easily removing cards and viewing transaction history.”</p>

<hr>
<p>Google highlights a few new updates web surfers can use in its Chrome browser.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-performance-controls-october-2024/">Keyword post</a>, Google is rolling out a "Performance Detection" tool that continuously seeks ways to improve your browsing experience. The company says this tool will appear as an "Issue Alert" near your account icon. When this alert appears, Chrome will state which tabs require attention.</p><p>Chrome will bring these alerts to your attention when it feels other tabs are soaking up too much memory.</p><p>Google states users can click "Fix now" and the browser will do the rest. Users can disable this tool by heading into their browser's Settings.</p><p>Elsewhere, the post states Chrome is receiving more personalization for its performance-focused features. Now, users can decide which websites should remain active (even when in the background). Indicators for inactive tabs and memory usage information when hovering can be disabled.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:731px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.46%;"><img id="g7v4gmEMgNQ7QoCCMg4RQJ" name="google-chrome-performance-issue-alert-example" alt="Google Chrome will soon show a "performance issue alert" for tabs that need to be deactivated." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g7v4gmEMgNQ7QoCCMg4RQJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="731" height="537" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regarding customization, Google highlighted three new modes for Chrome's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-active-inactive-tab-control-spotted">Memory Saver</a>." The memory-freeing feature picks up the following options: Moderate, Balanced, and Maximum. Each mode becomes more aggressive depending on how Chrome views the situation. Google states the "Moderate" mode will deactivate tabs based on your computer's needs.</p><p>The "Balanced" option will consider your computer's memory and your actions in Chrome while "Maximum" is much quicker on the draw to deactivate an idle tab.</p><p>Google has continued to focus on its browser's performance ever since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-performance-modes">Memory Saver debuted</a> in 2022. The feature was simple since it automatically drew memory used in other inactive tabs to those you were actively using. This was designed to improve the browser's performance <em>and </em>your computer as more available memory means your multitasking goes by without a hitch.</p><p>Additionally, the company introduced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-memory-consumption-per-tab">memory usage tab information</a> in 2023 to join its Memory Saver function. This gave users quick and easy to see which tabs were hogging up all their memory so they could discard them. The update Google is preparing to roll in for Chrome is likely one that removes visual clutter and helps users streamline their experience.</p>

Most of the time, this means a bunch of words and different numbers on a spec sheet without any benefits that we can actually see, but this time, it should be different. Some of these changes are going to make differences that consumers like us will notice.</p><p>Most of the changes are under the hood, and for things, we aren't interacting with. However, the companies making devices and the people building out software solutions are, and these should make a marked improvement in things like Bluetooth connection stability, data speeds, and overall device battery life. The one big change is called Channel Sounding, and it's all about providing true spatial awareness to Bluetooth.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-new-in-bluetooth-6-2">What's new in Bluetooth 6</h2>
<p>Bluetooth 6.0 brings six new sets of features to the specification:</p><p><strong>Bluetooth Channel Sounding</strong>: This brings real spatial and distance awareness to Bluetooth. This unlocks a whole host of enhancements and new capabilities. We'll have a look at this in its own section.</p><p><strong>Decision-Based Advertising Filtering: </strong>This isn't about advertisements like the ones you see on a website or social media. This is all about how signals and Bluetooth LE packets identify themselves to devices. This feature allows a device to use the contents of a data packet received on a primary device channel to decide if it needs to scan for related data packets on secondary channels. If that all sounds Greek to you, it's OK. What you need to know is this will cut back on data loss, and when a device doesn't have to fetch the same data twice, everything is faster.</p><p><strong>Monitoring Advertisers</strong>: Again, this has nothing to do with product advertising. This feature allows a device acting as an observer (the one receiving the data) to filter out duplicate data packets from the advertising device (the one doing the sending). It includes built-in protections to make sure a host device knows when another device moves out of range, which could be a problem if multiple packets are filtered out. This will save battery and improve Bluetooth latency.</p><p><strong>Isochronous Adaptation Layer Enhancement:</strong> This allows larger sets of data to be broken down into smaller data packets for faster transfer speeds. It also includes a new mode to reduce latency based on PDU framing. This is as technical as it sounds, but it means that latency for LE connections can be reduced, and data transfer can be improved.</p><p><strong>Frame Space update</strong>: Before Bluetooth 6, almost all data packets were spaced 150 microseconds apart. That sounds fast, but sometimes it was still slower than it needed to be, while other times it wasn't slow enough. With Bluetooth 6, the timing between data packets is negotiable and can be shorter or longer than 150 microseconds. This will improve connection stability</p><p>A lot of this sounds very technical and I've tried to trim it down to its simplest form. If you're interested in the core mechanics of any of these features, the Bluetooth SIG has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/core-specification-6-feature-overview/">a great resource paper</a> with all the details.</p>

<p>Bluetooth Channel Sounding allows Bluetooth to be much more precise when determining where two or more Bluetooth devices are in relation to each other. Simply put, it means that two devices supporting the new feature can find each other across a wider area and <em>within a centimeter</em> of accuracy.</p><p>How it works is fascinating. It uses two distance measuring methods: Phase-Based Ranging and Round Trip Timing. These can be used separately or together and can achieve extremely accurate measurements.</p><p><strong>Phase-Based Ranging</strong> (PBR) uses the relationship between the phase, frequency, and wavelength of a radio signal. All signals have this relationship and PBR exploits it to calculate a distance.</p><p>1. The initiating device transmits a signal to the reflecting device.</p><p>2. The reflecting device echoes the signal back to the transmitting device.</p><p>3. The initiating device measures the phase of the signal it receives.</p><p>4. The process is repeated with a new signal, which results in a new phase measurement.</p><p>Distance is then calculated using a formula built on the frequency difference, the phase difference, and the speed of light. This is extremely accurate to a distance of 150 meters using a 1MHz signal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1862px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:20.89%;"><img id="h4Nm36R5YqL652qb7Gzj6f" name="BT6-PBR-calculation" alt="Bluetooth 6.0 PBR calulcation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4Nm36R5YqL652qb7Gzj6f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1862" height="389" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bluetooth SIG)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Round Trip Timing </strong>(RTT) measures the time it takes for a signal to travel from a transmitting device to a receiving device and back to where it originated. It's more simple and has a longer range than PBR.</p><p>1. The initiating device sends a data packet and records the Time of Departure (ToD).</p><p>2. The receiving device receives the packet and then echoes it back after a pre-determined delay.</p><p>3. The transmitting device receives the packet back and records a second timestamp called the Time of Arrival (ToA).</p><p>4. The distance is calculated using the difference between ToD and ToA with the predetermined delay calculated into the formula, multiplied by the speed of light.</p><p><em><strong>N * 299792458 m/s = X</strong></em></p><p>It also takes time to calculate the sending, timing, and receiving of a signal, which is determined by the hardware and inserted into the result, giving an accurate measurement of distance. This is very close to the way a dedicated ToF sensor in a camera assembly works to measure focal distance.</p><p>RTT can provide 100% accurate distance measurement, but the device hardware is unable to be perfectly precise, so there will always be a very small range of errors.</p><p>This is just a high-level but (hopefully) simplified overview of the technology. To learn more about Bluetooth Channel Sounding, including the full technical details, see the white paper on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/channel-sounding-tech-overview/">Bluetooth SIG website</a>.</p>

<p>Bluetooth Channel Sounding also incorporates several strong security features that help prevent distance spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks. These include signal randomization, robust encryption, and the ability to cross-check signal path and distance between PBR and TFF measurements.</p><p>All of this makes Bluetooth 6 a much better solution for services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-google-find-my-device-network-works-why-you-should-care">Find My networks</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-locks">digital keys and smart locks</a>, and even your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-mice-chromebooks">Bluetooth mouse</a>.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-expect-bluetooth-6-devices-2">When to expect Bluetooth 6 devices</h2>
<p>As of the time of this writing, no Bluetooth 6-enabled devices have been announced. The new specification was released in August of 2024, and all device manufacturers have access to the full range of features. That said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> supports Bluetooth 6, so it may be only a matter of time before smartphone OEMs start incorporating it into their devices.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus unveiled its top-of-the-line Android phone in China early this year, breaking the December launch tradition. Now, the OnePlus 13 is already available for preorder in China, and it brings notable upgrades over its predecessor.</p><p>The company's 2025 flagship packs in the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, Qualcomm's flagship processor. The SoC introduces a new Oryon architecture built on a 3nm process with significant singing at improvements over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. It also makes the OnePlus 13 among the first phones to feature the latest silicon from Qualcomm, which was recently featured on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-and-15-pro-with-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-announced-in-china">Xiaomi 15 series</a>, also for the Chinese region.</p>

<p>Next to the chipset, the OnePlus 13 also has ample storage options with up to 24GB of RAM and 1TB of onboard storage. Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phone</a> from OnePlus also uses a new upgraded Vapor Cooling system that promises better thermal conductivity.</p><p>For better gaming, the OnePlus 13 also supports 120fps gameplay support for large-scale mobile games. OnePlus is also introducing a new Bionic Vibration Motor Turbo, which should give you notable haptic feedback while gaming and while performing relevant system-wide tasks.</p><p>While the OnePlus 13's screen size isn't much different from the previous iteration, it does utilize a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-display-sourced-by-boe-surfaces-online">2K Oriental screen</a> from BOE—the second-generation LTPO panel measuring 6.82 inches with 120Hz refresh rate support. It's a mostly flat display, although with <em>slight</em> curves on each side. Also, for the first time on a OnePlus phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-display-specs-and-other-essential-features-surface">ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</a> under the display is a new addition. Previous models relied on optical fingerprint sensors.</p>
<p>The Hasselblad camera integration is again present on the OnePlus 13, which has a triple camera setup featuring a 50MP Sony LYT-808 primary lens, aided by a 50MP periscope telephoto sensor and another 50MP ultra-wide-angle sensor. The device also relies on a 32MP selfie shooter on the front.</p><p>Keeping the lights on is a 6,000mAh battery, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery introduced</a> by the company in June. It supports OnePlus's super fast 100W wired charging and 50W wireless fast charging. The company is promising to juice up the higher battery capacity to full in a mere 36 minutes.</p>

<p>Lastly, the touch of AI is also seen on the OnePlus 13 across several departments, like the AI Assistant's ability to recognize what's on screen and answer your questions. There is also AI voice summary for calls, AI photo editing, and more. The device is shipping with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based ColorOS 15, which is, of course, confined to China, while the global variant will likely ship with OxygenOS 15.</p><p>The device also gets a nifty IP69 rating, alongside the conventional IP68 rating, which should now handle higher-temperature and higher-pressure water jets.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 starts at CNY 4499 ($632) for the 12GB+256GB variant and goes all the way up to CNY 5999 (~$843) for the larger 24GB+1TB storage variant. The device features three colorways: White Dew Dawn, Obsidian Sercrnet Realm, and Blues Hour (Translated). With the early China launch, we can expect the global launch of the OnePlus 13 to happen sooner rather than later.</p>

OpenAI states the AI will decide to scour the web "based on what you've asked;" however, the new button is there to force the model into an online search.</p><p>The backbone of this new ChatGPT Search feature is the company's interest in delivering "better answers" quickly.</p><p>The post states users can type to ChatGPT using "natural and conversational" speech. After asking a question, the AI will respond with information sourced from other websites. OpenAI highlights its partnership with news and data providers to ensure ChatGPT's answers include "up-to-date information."</p><p>ChatGPT Search also piggybacks off partner-provided data and<em> </em>information via third-party search engines and a "fine-tuned" variant of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">GPT-4o</a>.</p><p>OpenAI states its ChatGPT Search offers a button at the bottom of its response labeled "Sources." Initially, the pill-shaped icon will display a few icons from the sources it grabbed its information. Clicking on this button will produce a sidebar with the website names and article titles.</p><p>Users can click on these to learn more — and to fact-check the AI model.</p><p>Additionally, OpenAI states users can ask follow-up questions after ChatGPT delivers a response. The post claims the AI will take the "full context" of what you said to search for a "better answer."</p>

<p>ChatGPT Search will arrive for Enterprise and Edu users "in the next few weeks." Finally, free users are set to pick it up "over the coming months."</p><p>We've been expecting OpenAI's take on search with ChatGPT ever since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-search-engine-rumored">it was rumored</a> earlier this year. Those rumors were based on a discovery within OpenAI's certificate logs <em>and </em>comments by its CEO, Sam Altman. The company's head was on a podcast and reportedly discussed AI alongside search.</p><p>One thing for sure is that ChatGPT Search will sit opposite Google's AI model Gemini and its AI Overviews in Search. Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">AI Overviews</a> are closer to what OpenAI has done with ChatGPT Search. The company launched its quick, bite-sized boxes of information in Search during I/O 2024 in May. Google has upgraded its AI Overviews with backlinking to fact-check the AI's responses and a more "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-search-ads-video-function-update">organized</a>" view.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google detailed a series of Android SDK updates, including more for its Play Store and Gemini.</p><p>Google's updates kicked off by highlighting the future of its Android SDK. In a blog post, the company states it will bring "more frequent" SDK releases, beginning in 2025. Google states it will have a "major" release in Q2 that contains "behavior changes" for apps. This seems to be Android 16 as Google states developers should keep their eyes out for more information regarding its first preview. The company states app developers can prepare for the major Q2 2025 release by conducting the "annual compatibility testing" a few months sooner.</p><p>The minor SDK release in Q4 2025 will contain feature updates, optimizations, and bug fixes to clean up any issues with the intended major Q2 launch.</p><p>Q1 and Q3 2025 will be minor, offering "feature only" updates to developers, per Google's set timeline.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-in-android-studio-updates-2">Gemini in Android Studio Updates</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L" name="google-gemini-hero-banner-wide.jpg" alt="Google Gemini brings "custom Gems" to Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Following the debut of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-in-android-studio-debut">Gemini in Android Studio</a>" in April, Google's latest updates today (Oct 31) bring several more capabilities to the AI model. The company is pushing the boundaries of its AI by boosting its coding capabilities, allowing it to edit your work by "implementing common design patterns." Several of Gemini's new code editing features include the ability to "modify and refractor" code based on custom prompts.</p><p>A commit message generation feature lets the AI analyze your changes and propose its own set of alterations. "Rethink and rename" lets Gemini generate names for your coding classes, methods, and variables. "Prompt Library" enables the AI to "automatically" save and manage a user's most frequently used prompts for easy recall. Users can also generate documentation for a select chunk of code by right-clicking.</p><p>In the Android Studio, Gemini can now auto-generate "composable" previews and simplify the visualization process for your intended UI. Moreover, "coming soon," Google says Gemini in Android Studio will support image attachments.</p><p>As Gemini in Android Studio picks up a Ladybug feature drop, developers can weed out bugs quicker and (hopefully) see fewer crashes. Additional features include test scenarios using local code context, build/sync error insights, and app quality insights for suggested crash fixes.</p><p>The latest updates to the Android Studio can be downloaded via the Canary channel.</p>
<h2 id="play-store-updates-2">Play Store Updates</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7" name="Google-Play-Store-home-page.jpg" alt="Google Play Store home page on Android and Chrome OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2293" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a separate blog post, the company states it's changing how apps are displayed on its store. These new formats include a full-screen mode for portrait videos in an app store listing. Google states a more "prominent" install button should now be visible to users.</p><p>Google highlights the Play Store's "personalized" query recommendations. According to the post, users can find these recommended search queries via the "Search Home." This is available for English with support for additional languages set to arrive "soon this year."</p><p>Google's "interest picker" arrived to help the Play Store understand where your interests are for accurate recommendations. The company rolled out a similar tool <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/google-play-july-2024-new-updates/">for games in July</a>.</p><p>The post adds that the Play Store delivers a more robust security system when purchasing content. The company says users can now choose "on-device biometrics" when purchasing an app. This includes deciding between using your fingerprint or face to authenticate a purchase instead of inputting your account's password.</p>

<p>The final two updates for the Play Store involve boosting revenue for developers and their apps alongside Play Integrity API upgrades. Concerning the former, Google states that it has "proactively" encouraged users to assign a payment method on the Play Store and within the Android OS. This has reportedly "doubled the number of purchases" in 2024 and provided a nearly 3% increase in conversion rate.</p><p>Payment options have continued to expand as users find options like Paypal, Cash App, direct carrier billing, and more. Additionally, Google highlights its Play Store algorithm for pushing what content users might buy as additional content for their favorite apps.</p><p>Google also highlighted its "gentle nudge," an alert that reminds users of an item they've forgotten in their cart.</p><p>Google states, "in the coming months," developers can opt into improved Play Integrity API verdicts to bolster their app's defenses. What's more, Google's "app access risk" feature has exited beta. Developers can now "detect and respond" to apps that capture a user's screen or control their device to avoid security disasters.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Maps is getting smarter. Soon, it will serve up spot-on suggestions, bite-sized review summaries, and answers all your random questions about places.</p><p>Google announced today that Maps will be a lot handier with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>-curated inspiration. So, if you&apos;re planning a night out, you can simply type in “things to do with friends at night,” and get suggestions like live music.</p><p>You&apos;ll also be able to skim through quick review summaries to see what people love, and if you&apos;re curious about the vibe, just ask Maps directly.</p><p>These new features are rolling out on Android and iOS in the U.S. this week. Over the next few months, expect similar upgrades on Google Search, including AI-powered review summaries and the ability to ask about specific details of places.</p><p>Google is also shaking up AI with "grounding" in Maps, letting developers plug into a database of more than 250 million places. Now, AI content can be spot-on and up-to-date, staying real with the latest information.</p><p>Furthermore, the company is making road trips way easier. Just grab directions, tap “add stops,” and get a list of the best landmarks, scenic views, attractions, and food spots along the way.</p><p>Navigating through new areas with a mess of lanes and turns should no longer be a hassle, thanks to the service&apos;s upgraded maps lay out lanes, crosswalks, and road signs nice and clear. You can also forget those last-second merges; just stick to the blue lane markers, and you’re all set for a smooth ride.</p><p>A few months back, the navigation app started highlighting buildings in red as you near your destination. Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/15-best-google-maps-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Maps</a> has stepped it up—showing you nearby parking and even reminding you to save your spot so you don’t forget. Once you’re parked, you’ll get walking directions straight to the entrance, with Street View or AR to help you get oriented in no time.</p><p>This week, you can start exploring your route, check and report weather issues, and enjoy updated arrival guidance on Android and iOS everywhere. Plus, next month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/game-changing-google-maps-enhanced-navigation-update-arrives-next-month">Google is launching enhanced navigation</a> in over 30 metro areas, with plans to add even more spots down the line.</p><p>Additionally, Immersive View is expanding to 150 cities globally, including cool spots like Brussels, Kyoto, and Frankfurt.</p><p>Immersive View for routes is about to get even better. You’ll now find out where to park and get warnings for tricky turns, so you’re ready for anything. This update is rolling out this week on Android and iOS wherever you can use Immersive View for routes.</p>
