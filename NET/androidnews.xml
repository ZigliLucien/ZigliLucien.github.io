<p>We no longer need expensive accessories or dedicated cameras to capture stunning shots of the world as we see it. Even the simplest, most mundane of things can be made to look stunning when photographed properly.</p><p>Back in the day, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">mobile photographers</a> were laughed at, and understandably so. Technology wasn&apos;t at the point where lenses built into phones could dare to compete with the prowess of professional cameras.</p><p>However, rapid advancements in smartphone photography have made it possible for your average Joe to shoot some delightful pictures. Some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android flagships</a> can easily deliver professional-looking images. Powerful editing tools put the finishing touch. Even budget phones can get you unbelievably good photos — you just need to know the right angle.</p><p>Believe it or not, I use my phone for almost every single one of my review images. If you&apos;re looking to level up your mobile photography game, let me share a few simple tips and tricks that I have picked up over the years. This guide avoids jargon and long, complicated words such as bifocal length or aperture for the sake of simplicity and ease. You don&apos;t even need to use the pro mode, just follow some of these tips and see where it takes you.</p>
<h2 id="lighting-is-everything-2">Lighting is everything</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LmBSLmMxrfGrwJyWv9Li75" name="google-pixel-8-pro-display-outside.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 8 Pro's vibrant display outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LmBSLmMxrfGrwJyWv9Li75.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This one is fairly obvious, but it&apos;s the first rule of mobile photography. The light conditions can make or break your photo. Ideally, you want to capture images during the daytime with lots of natural light in the form of golden sunlight. This makes a world of difference and just makes it so easy to get a good shot.</p><p>Make sure that the light source is above your subject or in front of it. You don&apos;t want the light to be behind the subject because that casts ugly shadows which mess up the final image. This is why night photography is so tricky as opposed to the morning or afternoon, because the sun sheds light evenly across the land whereas the night has no natural light source save for the moon and man-made lamps.</p><p>At night or in poor low-light conditions, flash isn&apos;t always the way to go. Try to choose the constantly lit-up flash for a steady source of light. This can usually be done by tapping the flash option twice in the camera app. Even better, invest in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-ring-light">powerful ring light</a> to spread light evenly in the direction that you want. I prefer to use lights with customizable warmth, so I can see which temperature of white light looks best for my low-light shot.</p>
<h2 id="anything-looks-good-from-the-right-angle-2">Anything looks good from the right angle</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3724px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="pJ4zjoy544m6cYA3ELFpvQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-s23-s22-cameras.jpg" alt="Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S22 cameras side by side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pJ4zjoy544m6cYA3ELFpvQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3724" height="2094" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Pointing and shooting are not enough; you need to shoot from the right angle for a truly stunning shot. Don&apos;t just take a single picture or a couple of them. Try out different positions and angles. Move the subject around if you&apos;re not content. I also find that moving my phone around to find just the right angle helps a lot.</p><p>Choose a good focal point depending on what you like or what you&apos;re trying to highlight, and then tilt the phone and move it high or low to find the right placement. You never know which angle will deliver that perfect still!</p>
<h2 id="the-power-of-aspect-ratios-and-orientation-2">The power of aspect ratios and orientation</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="detZwD5aTj3g2xJ4Vjwv9J" name="OnePlus-Nord-N30-5G-cameras-01.jpg" alt="Taking a photo with the OnePlus Nord N30 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/detZwD5aTj3g2xJ4Vjwv9J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you whip out your phone and get ready to take a picture, think about the aspect ratio and orientation that will best suit the situation. Landscape images are more artistic and better suited for natural elements, whereas humans tend to look better in portrait images.</p><p>Selecting the aspect ratio can be a bit more challenging. Usually, the lens in use automatically changes based on the chosen aspect ratio. So, if you select a widescreen 16:9 ratio, the wide-angle lens will automatically be in use. Depending on the resolution of your phone&apos;s cameras, you might get a better or worse result.</p><p>In situations where your device has a terribly low-resolution lens, it is often smarter to capture the picture with the best lens and then crop it to your desired aspect ratio. For example, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap mid-range phone</a>&apos;s 2MP macro lens will most definitely give you garbage results. Instead, use the primary camera to get as close to the subject as possible and then crop it out. I can guarantee you will be much more pleased with the outcome.</p>
<h2 id="the-golden-ratio-and-rule-of-thirds-2">The golden ratio and rule of thirds</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="h6AQpeWJTGDxx9SacuHZMa" name="Google-Pixel-8-new-camera-ui.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Google Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h6AQpeWJTGDxx9SacuHZMa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Symmetrical photos might sound nice, but it is, in fact, the asymmetry of a scene that gives it such striking beauty. Placing your subject dead center isn&apos;t going to look as nice as a strategic, asymmetrical position. This is the basic thought behind what is known as the golden ratio in photography.</p><p>If you&apos;re an amateur photographer, you may or may not be familiar with the golden ratio. I&apos;m not going to give you an in-depth explanation of the Fibonacci sequence and where the ratio originates. That&apos;s why Google exists. All you need to know is that the spiral framework pictured below depicts the golden ratio. According to the golden ratio, your subject should be at the heart of the spiral for the optimal shot.</p><p>How can you ensure that your subject falls within the ideal spot when taking pictures with your phone? It&apos;s simple, just enable the grid option in your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-third-party-camera-app-android">camera app</a>. In some phones such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, you can can change the shape of the grid to the golden ratio within the camera app&apos;s settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2376px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.45%;"><img id="S3R7R7RrYxmyqeJhjz6xRA" name="camera-golden-ration-screenshot.jpg" alt="The golden ratio in the OnePlus 12R camera app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S3R7R7RrYxmyqeJhjz6xRA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2376" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just because the golden ratio exists, it doesn&apos;t strictly mean that you should only stick with that one spot of the frame. And that&apos;s where the rule of thirds steps in. If you split your image up into nine equal-sized sections, the ideal placement of your subject should be somewhere along the two-thirds bit. You can change the exact position according to the shot at hand.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2376px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.45%;"><img id="6RzZUVKomWTtdugn7ZSKLD" name="camera-grid-android-screenshot.jpeg" alt="The rule of thirds in the OnePlus 12R camera app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6RzZUVKomWTtdugn7ZSKLD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2376" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once again, using the grid makes it a lot easier to achieve this. Simply enable the option from your camera app and choose the standard option that splits your viewfinder into nine equal parts. Align your subject accordingly and voila! You have your photo.</p>
<h2 id="don-apos-t-underestimate-stability-and-level-2">Don&apos;t underestimate stability and level</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1425px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="TyxsY2YtvxsU2QJyNfoDVc" name="camera-level-gradienter-google-pixel-6-pro.jpg" alt="Camera level gradienter on the Google Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TyxsY2YtvxsU2QJyNfoDVc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1425" height="802" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A stable and steady hand will photograph a million times better than a shaky, tilted one. You want your shots to be perfectly horizontal or vertical in relation to the ground. There are several tricks for this. Any cheap selfie stick or stand can ensure steadiness. You can minimize shaking by using phone grips as well.</p><p>Another great idea is to enable the level gradienter in your camera app. You will see a line in the center of the camera viewfinder, as well as an angle usually. Sometimes, it might be depicted as a plus sign. The goal is to have a line that is completely flat and a zero-degree tilt angle, which means your camera is perfectly level.</p>
<h2 id="bright-contrasting-colors-and-color-theory-2">Bright contrasting colors and color theory</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sV8b4emBC3oKgvcGxsMhoK" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-17.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sV8b4emBC3oKgvcGxsMhoK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This mobile photography trick is usually applicable to inanimate objects like food and non-living things. However, it teaches an important lesson about colors and contrast which you could definitely apply across the board when taking pictures.</p><p>Let&apos;s say the subject is a dull, dreary object lacking any oomph or brightness. You can spice things up by using brightly contrasting colors. An example of this would be a black phone as your subject. Try using brightly colored backgrounds with color theory as your guide. Opposites attract, so pick colors that sit opposite to your subject&apos;s colors on the color wheel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="UfzoBGQLUfEJD2WkXTVkSC" name="canva-color-wheel-color-theory.jpg" alt="Color wheel on Canva" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UfzoBGQLUfEJD2WkXTVkSC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1896" height="1067" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Canva)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re unsure about complimentary colors, Canva offers a free color theory tool on its platform. Simply head to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/" rel="nofollow">Color wheel section on Canva</a>&apos;s website or app, enter your color, and select the complementary option. The tool will spit out the right hues to pick. You can even use the Canva color tool to create graphics and palettes for your photography projects.</p><p>Want to see the magic of color theory in action?

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I&apos;m very particular about what I need in a TV interface. I loathe recommendations in general and just want a minimal interface that offers easy access to the streaming services I use. It&apos;s no surprise, then, that I went all-in on Android TV. In the beginning, I just used the default Android TV implementation that came as standard on most TVs and projectors, and although the UI was lightweight, it was prone to lag.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>I realized a streaming device would solve the issue, and coincidentally, Xiaomi came out with an Android TV streaming box at the time, so I picked that up. While it was definitely a better experience than what most TVs offered, there was still an occasional lag, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-mi-box">Mi Box</a> would crash when playing high bitrate content.</p>
<p>So when NVIDIA introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review">Shield TV Pro</a> back in 2019, I bought a unit a few weeks after it went on sale. NVIDIA already had a great track record in this segment thanks to the 2015 and 2017 models of the Shield TV, and NVIDIA&apos;s insistence on rolling out timely updates was the deciding factor.</p>
<p>It took just a few days of use to realize that the Shield TV Pro was in a league of its own; the powerful hardware combined with the minimal Android TV interface made for a great pairing. NVIDIA also had a suite of exclusive features on the Shield TV Pro, including GameStream — which allowed local game streaming on the device — and AI upscaling, long before AI was a buzzword.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3aiKBJ35Kmd5QLGhiYzw5U" name="nvidia-shield-tv-pro-2.jpg" alt="NVIDIA Shield TV Pro against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3aiKBJ35Kmd5QLGhiYzw5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The AI-backed feature did a standout job upscaling SDR content, and it was a definite bonus. But where the Shield TV Pro truly came into its own was at Plex; it did a better job playing Plex content than any other device I&apos;d used up to that point. I liked the Shield TV Pro so much that I bought two additional units, and I use it throughout the house to this day. </p>
<p>Five years later, the Android TV ecosystem has fundamentally changed, but the Shield TV Pro continues to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">best streaming device</a>. As is its wont, Google decided to mess with Android TV, switching out the clean UI and introducing an ad-laden abomination in its stead that is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a>. Thankfully, none of my Shield TV Pro units have been updated to Google TV, and they&apos;re still running the older Android TV interface.</p>
<p>But where the Shield TV Pro truly stands out is its performance; after nearly five years of use, it is still just as fluid as the day I set it up. A big part of this is NVIDIA&apos;s continual update cadence that brings bug fixes and stability tweaks, and this is a rarity in the industry — I can&apos;t think of any other Android device that has gotten as many updates.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2aBaSEzPF8Lyx6K9LjRvNU" name="nvidia-shield-tv-pro-4.jpg" alt="NVIDIA Shield TV Pro against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2aBaSEzPF8Lyx6K9LjRvNU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, there have been a few issues over the years. One of the units is prone to freezing once a week, and Bluetooth pairing is wonky on another unit. NVIDIA moved away from GameStream, and while that&apos;s annoying, Moonlight is an alternative that works just as reliably, so it wasn&apos;t a big issue.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the underlying Tegra X1 hardware is still decent enough even though it is nine years old at this point, and honestly, there isn&apos;t another streaming device that is as good as the Shield TV Pro. Yes, there are things I would want to see in a 2024 variant of the device — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/av1-codec-video-format">AV1</a> decode, DLSS tech that&apos;s similar to what&apos;s on the latest NVIDIA video cards, and HDMI 2.1 connectivity.</p>
<p>A newer Shield TV Pro would be a killer device, but it doesn&apos;t look like that&apos;s a priority for NVIDIA at the moment. The chip vendor is making so much money via its AI business that it doesn&apos;t need to focus on any other product line, including the GeForce portfolio. The Shield TV is in the same boat, but if NVIDIA were to provide the hardware for Nintendo&apos;s Switch 2 (as leaks suggest), it isn&apos;t outlandish to assume the brand will introduce a next-gen Shield TV that uses the same platform.</p><p>We&apos;ll have to wait and see if that pans out, but if you&apos;re dissatisfied with your current streaming device and want something better, the Shield TV Pro is still the one I&apos;d recommend.</p>

<p>Meta is rolling out a new age verification process for all Meta Quest 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> users, ensuring that every user is equipped with an age-appropriate account setting. Over the next few days, Quest users will receive a prompt on their headset to input their birthday, followed by a quick setup to ensure privacy settings are appropriate.</p><p>Meta says users will have 30 days to enter their birthdate once this prompt is available. Users not following these steps after 30 days will block their accounts until the required information is entered. The company notes that birthdates are not public unless you specifically choose to make that information non-private in your account settings.</p><p>"On our app store, we want to make it easier for developers to better understand the ages of people who use their apps so they can provide age-appropriate experiences for preteens, teens, and adults. Parents, in turn, can trust that apps are providing the most age-appropriate experience and protections the app offers for their child’s age."</p>

<p>Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/new-meta-quest-age-requirements">lowered the age requirement</a> for using a Quest headset from 13 years old to 10 years old last Summer, adding in a new type of account that requires a parent to administrate. These preteen accounts, made for ages 10-12, have the most restrictive privacy and content settings, and parents can manage whether children are allowed to download and install apps, as well as block certain apps and games entirely.</p><p>Teen accounts are also set to private by default and can be managed by a parent but are initially less restrictive than a preteen account. Adult accounts can be set to private or public upon creation, but active status is set to public by default. Any of these settings can be changed after account setup, but Meta chooses specific defaults to ensure regulatory compliance and privacy.</p><p>Meta has a set of User Age Group APIs that developers can use to automatically change in-app settings based on the age of the user playing the game. This includes options for both content and data sharing, which is why Meta requires that all users have the right settings on their accounts.</p>

<p>AI is something that people hear a lot lately, with most smartphone companies leveraging the generative AI software and pushing it into every aspect of customers&apos; lives. While Google and Samsung have taken the help on the smartphone front, OnePlus is entering the game with its own AI feature, and it </p><p>On Wednesday, April 3, OnePlus announced that it will be rolling out a new generative AI feature dubbed "AI Eraser" to several of its smartphones. This feature allows users to edit or erase unwanted elements in a photo. </p><p>"AI Eraser represents the first step in our vision to liberate user creativity through AI and revolutionize the future of photo editing, empowering users to create remarkable photos with just a few touches," says Kinder Liu, president and COO of OnePlus.</p><p>Similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, which first debuted on Google Pixel phones, OnePlus users can manually select and remove unwanted objects from images in the Photo Gallery. Once the user highlights certain objects, such as pedestrians or imperfections in the image, the tool analyzes the selected area and automatically creates a replacement background that blends into the surrounding environment.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first AI feature we&apos;ve seen from OnePlus. Earlier this year, OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-12-receives-new-ai-features">rolled out an AI Call Summarizer</a> as part of an OxygenOS update, which listens to your phone call and summarizes it for your reference.  However, this feature was only available to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> users. The AI Call Summarizer could extract "times, places, action items and other key information" from your conversation, according to the changelog.</p><p>There&apos;s also Breeno Touch, allowing users to scan their screen for content and make suggestions for related services based on their search.</p><p>Nicole Zhang, general manager of AI products at OnePlus, says that "all OnePlus AI features are built from genuine user needs, and we will continue to invest heavily in developing more revolutionary AI-based features that move us closer to our vision for a more convenient future for all."</p><p>Liu also stated that OnePlus devices will gain more AI features that are set to make an appearance this year.</p><p>OnePlus will be rolling out the AI Eraser to the OnePlus 11, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-vs-oneplus-12-camera-review">OnePlus 12 and 12 R</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a> and even the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-ce-4-announced-in-india">Nord CE 4</a> across the globe.The company said that this feature will show up gradually in April to the above mentioned devices, however they have not specified an exact date.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A new report suggests that one of the upcoming Galaxy Watch models will feature a battery size similar to the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro.</li><li>The highest-tier Galaxy Watch 7 version is expected to have a battery capacity of 578mAh.</li><li>The names of the three versions of the Galaxy Watch 7 are still uncertain, but the addition of "Pro" could indicate enhanced battery life.</li></ul>

<p>Earlier rumors suggested that we could see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-chip-performance-rumors">three Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 models drop later this year</a>, and a fresh report says the Pro version might pack a hefty battery upgrade compared to previous models.</p><p>Since switching to Wear OS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung smartwatches</a> haven&apos;t lasted as long on a charge. The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro was a step up, but the company oddly went back to a smaller battery in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> series.</p><p>However, things might turn around with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> series, potentially bringing back better battery life, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-watch-7/" target="_blank">Galaxy Club</a>.</p><p>The outlet reports that one of the upcoming Galaxy Watch models seems to have a battery as big as the Watch 5 Pro, which lasted way longer on a charge than the Watch 6. The former has a 590mAh battery, while the latter only has a 425mAh one.</p><p>The battery expected for the highest-tier Galaxy Watch 7 version is said to be rated at 578mAh, potentially even slightly larger than the Watch 5 Pro&apos;s capacity. This means we&apos;re in for a significant leap from the watches released last year.</p><p>Our review of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> found it could last a whopping 80 hours on a single charge. With its hefty battery, the Watch 5 Pro boasts the largest battery of any Galaxy smartwatch, and it&apos;s the only one running Wear OS that can keep up with your busy life for that long.</p><p>We&apos;re still unsure about the names of the three versions of the Galaxy Watch 7. However, if one of them does get a "Pro" tag, having additional battery life could give it a competitive edge against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">top Android watches</a> on the market.</p><p>Recent rumors suggest that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-could-double-the-amount-of-onboard-storage-with-the-galaxy-watch-7">Samsung might also increase the watch&apos;s memory from 16GB to 32GB</a>. It could hold double the music and apps compared to the last one, which would be handy for folks who like to take their tunes on the go.</p><p>Don&apos;t hold your breath for the Galaxy Watch 7 series anytime soon, though. There&apos;s speculation that Samsung might hold a Galaxy Unpacked event in July, but it won&apos;t be available right away.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio had a busy 2023 on the back of several product releases, and the Chinese audio manufacturer has no signs of slowing down this year. What&apos;s interesting about Fiio&apos;s showing last year is that it entered a lot of new categories, and it&apos;s continuing that trend into 2024 with the introduction of the KB3, a mechanical keyboard that has a DAC built-in.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gaYXUt2jdxGRhQZVdN4xqG" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-15.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gaYXUt2jdxGRhQZVdN4xqG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The KB3 debuted at the end of last year, and joins the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft3-review">FT3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">FT5</a> headsets in building out Fiio&apos;s desktop portfolio. The mechanical keyboard market has never been stronger, and there are dozens of great choices if you want a gasket-mounted keyboard with plenty of customizability. By adding a DAC to the mix, Fiio is looking to differentiate the KB3 to a considerable degree.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="euagoRJNk624t3XpanwB2H" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-14.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/euagoRJNk624t3XpanwB2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio isn&apos;t the only brand that decided to go this route — Moondrop also rolled out a keyboard with a DAC last year. But Fiio operates at an entirely different scale, and the KB3 is aimed at the budget segment. The keyboard is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-HiFi-Mechanical-Keyboardwith-Wired/dp/B0CQYNXC37">available for $149 on Amazon</a>, and while that&apos;s a lot for a mechanical keyboard, the inclusion of the DAC turns this into a two-in-one that doesn&apos;t have many parallels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JfCGVPStE6XRvTTq4H96DF" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-7.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JfCGVPStE6XRvTTq4H96DF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before we get started, a word on the branding. The KB3 is sold under the Jade Audio label, much like the KA1, KA2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka3-portable-dac-review">KA3</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka5-review">KA5</a>, KA11, and KA13 DACs and JT1 headset. Jade Audio products are aimed at a younger audience, and the focus is to deliver a good value. I tested most of the products branded under the Jade Audio umbrella, and I&apos;m yet to run into one that I didn&apos;t recommend — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka11-review">$29 KA11 dongle DAC</a> in particular is outstanding. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QTZHnjYUhz3P5C7cYHSRDE" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-1.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QTZHnjYUhz3P5C7cYHSRDE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ll get to the DAC side of things shortly, but before that, let&apos;s look at how the KB3 holds up as a keyboard. My daily driver is Angry Miao&apos;s ridiculous Cyberboard R4; the keyboard has a unique design and costs $750. The KB3 has a much more subdued design, and it is on the smaller side considering you get a tenkeyless configuration.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RbC2KubzcLusz2JFdLkR4K" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-23.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RbC2KubzcLusz2JFdLkR4K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The top plate is fashioned out of aluminum and has the same brushed metal texture as the K9 Pro DAC and other high-end Fiio products. Like other gasket-mounted keyboards, the KB3 uses two layers of sound absorbing foam along with silicone gaskets and a dampening layer to reduce sound resonance within the chassis.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PnuuebrFUzZbRw4mdp59tK" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-26.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PnuuebrFUzZbRw4mdp59tK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The KB3 doesn&apos;t have anywhere quite the same level as bounciness that is a characteristic of the best gasket-mounted keyboards like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/accessories/keyboards/keychron-q1-pro-review">Keychron Q1 Pro</a>. If anything, it is just as rigid as a regular mechanical keyboard, and if Fiio didn&apos;t explicitly mention that it is using a gasket design, that fact wouldn&apos;t have been obvious.</p>

<p>Another quibble is the choice of materials; the KB3 uses a bottom case that&apos;s made out of plastic, and it doesn&apos;t quite have the same feel as other mechanical keyboards in this segment, which use all-metal designs. That said, I didn&apos;t see any issues with build quality whatsoever.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jMaH7Ze6iiYaafRj2MTDeG" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-13.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jMaH7Ze6iiYaafRj2MTDeG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio didn&apos;t go overboard with the design itself, and the KB3 has a minimalist aesthetic that looks great. The only design flair is the red-accented volume knob that&apos;s located on the right, and other than a small Fiio logo next to the F12 key, you don&apos;t get any branding.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aEr9L9iKYWRD6YgzJXpCuF" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-10.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aEr9L9iKYWRD6YgzJXpCuF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The keycaps are the definite star of the show, with Fiio offering a transparent design that brings the best out of the RGB lighting effects. The keycaps have a matte finish and are great to use, and if anything, I prefer these to the Glacier keycaps that come as standard on the Cyberboard. The keys use the standard OEM profile with markers on the F and J homing keys, and the see-through design is terrific at diffusing light.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="38YS2keUVBboXuw4M3N4dK" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-25.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/38YS2keUVBboXuw4M3N4dK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio bundles the KB3 with Gateron&apos;s G Pro 3.0 yellow switches, and they&apos;re an excellent pairing. The linear switches are delightful to use, and they have a high actuation point (50g) along with a 2mm pre-travel and 4mm total travel. Having used Gateron&apos;s Box Ink V2 Black and Oil King switches extensively over the course of the last 12 months, the G Pro 3.0 yellow definitely has a lot to offer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mKe8j5sREsRyZV9b47WNFJ" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-21.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mKe8j5sREsRyZV9b47WNFJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It doesn&apos;t quite have the same smooth tactility as the costlier Gateron switches, but it holds up incredibly well within the KB3. And if you don&apos;t like the feel of the linear switch or want to use something else, you can easily swap them out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QUYLugKuSKRt2pxZ8ASKbJ" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-20.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUYLugKuSKRt2pxZ8ASKbJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like other tenkeyless designs, the KB3 has a total of 81 keys; you don&apos;t get a dedicated number pad, and the navigation keys are limited to Insert, Delete, Page Up, and Page Down. While I was excited to see that the keyboard has VIA integration, it doesn&apos;t actually connect to the software. The keyboard shows up in the VIA device list, but it doesn&apos;t connect, so I wasn&apos;t able to customize the keys and tailor RGB lighting.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yrrixfkr3nJ3RccE7cjqQK" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-22.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yrrixfkr3nJ3RccE7cjqQK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the keyboard has a lot of preset RGB lighting effects out of the box, and you can adjust the brightness of the RGB LEDs or disable them entirely. Fiio did a good job with secondary legends, and you can change RGB effects via keys F1 through F4, and use F9 through F12 to adjust music playback.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SeYmc4KU5R4mm2chNqkwnE" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-4.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SeYmc4KU5R4mm2chNqkwnE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The keyboard connects via a detachable USB-C cable, and what I like is that you get two USB-A passthrough ports, so if you want to connect other accessories, you can do so with ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PMYnLy8LbLR6SPDR2dgiAH" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-16.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PMYnLy8LbLR6SPDR2dgiAH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the audio side of things, the KB3 has two ports on the left: single-ended 3.5mm and a balanced 4.4mm connector. It uses a Cirrus Logic CS43131 DAC chip combined with an SG Micro SGM8262 amp, and it handles up to 384kHz/32-bit over PCM and DSD256.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gaYXUt2jdxGRhQZVdN4xqG" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-15.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gaYXUt2jdxGRhQZVdN4xqG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s no shortage of power, with the DAC providing 170mW via the 3.5mm port at 32Ω, going up to 550mW over the balanced 4.4mm port at 32Ω. The KB3 is able to drive any IEM on the market as well as demanding headsets, and I used it with Fiio&apos;s own FT3 headset and JH5 monitors, and it held its own.</p>
<p>I tested all the DACs that Fiio released over the last 18 months, so I&apos;m aware of the brand&apos;s tuning and sound characteristics. The KB3 shares a lot of similarities to the KA13 in terms of the sound, and that isn&apos;t astonishing when you consider they share the same hardware. The DAC delivers a clean sound with a wide soundstage, and you get good dynamics overall.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NhXagw7NPwhiw3CsKnM2kH" name="fiio-keyboard-kb3-18.jpg" alt="Fiio KB3 keyboard and DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NhXagw7NPwhiw3CsKnM2kH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The KB3 tends to deliver a vibrant low-end that&apos;s delightful, and that&apos;s joined by natural mids and clear highs with no hint of sibilance. Overall, the bundled DAC is an excellent choice if you want something that can drive demanding headsets while delivering an engaging sound.</p><p>Ultimately, the KB3 is a unique offering that combines two niches into a single product. It is a decent mechanical keyboard in its own right, and the inclusion of a DAC makes it that much more desirable. As a two-in-one device, it is unchallenged in this category.</p>

<ul><li>Google appears to be working on a satellite messaging feature in Google Messages for Android 15. </li><li>A recent Google Messages beta gives us our best look at how satellite messaging in Google Messages will work. </li><li>The feature appears to be more useful than Apple's Emergency SOS via satellite, because Google wants to let you text anyone (and not just first responders and roadside assistance) — even if there isn't an emergency. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been working on satellite messaging for Android behind the scenes, and a new beta version of the Google Messages app revealed how the company might implement the feature in Android 15. In March, we learned that Google wants to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-satellite-based-text-messaging-spotted">let Android users message anyone via satellite</a> and does not plan to limit the features to emergency and roadside assistance calls. Now, the latest Google Messages beta provides further evidence that you&apos;ll soon be able to message anyone over satellite connectivity. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/02/google-messages-satellite-messaging/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> tore down the APK of the Google Messages beta, which has the version number <strong>20240329_01_RC00</strong>. The site reports that the following strings were uncovered in the APK related to satellite connectivity:</p>
<ul><li>To send and receive, stay outside with a clear view of the sky</li><li>Satellite messaging may take longer and can’t include photos & videos</li><li>You can message with anyone, including emergency services</li></ul>
<p>These strings outline what you can and can&apos;t do with satellite messaging in Google Messages. The company recommends that users stay outside to have the best chance of making a good connection with an overhead satellite. This follows similar guidance to other satellite-based features that have shipped in the past, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/how-to-use-apples-emergency-sos-with-satellite-on-iphone-14">Apple&apos;s Emergency SOS</a> via satellite. Additionally, Google says that you can&apos;t share photos and videos over satellite, which makes sense.</p><p>Notably, the strings explain that satellite messaging will let you "message with anyone." This is different from Emergency SOS via satellite because that iPhone feature only works in emergencies when users need to get in contact with emergency services, roadside assistance, and emergency contacts. </p>

<p>9to5Google also spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> system notifications that shed light on satellite connectivity. When cellular is not available, users will receive an "auto-connected to satellite" notification. This explains that users can "send and receive messages without a mobile or Wi-Fi network." The system notification can be interacted with through the <strong>Open Messages</strong> and <strong>How it works</strong> buttons. </p><p>There is still a lot we don&apos;t know about satellite connectivity in Android 15, such as which companies will help support the feature. Google has been linked to T-Mobile and Garmin for satellite connectivity services, but nothing is confirmed yet.</p>

<ul><li>Google rolled out its April 2024 security update starting on April 2, following the release of the Pixel Watch's April 2024 update.</li><li>The update includes 28 general security patches for Android and another 25 that are exclusively for Pixel devices. Google believes two vulnerabilities are actively being exploited. </li><li>There are also bug fixes related to the Pixel Camera app and biometrics included in the April 2024 update. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google announced that the April 2024 security update is rolling out as of April 2 in a Pixel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/267293711/google-pixel-update-april-2024?hl=en&sjid=7143197716003505187-NC" target="_blank">community post</a>, so you might start seeing it now on your Pixel device. Other Android phone makers, such as Samsung, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/some-samsung-devices-are-already-getting-the-april-update-with-camera-improvements">released their monthly security patches</a> as early as last week. The April 2024 update for Pixel phones came just after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-april-2024-update-rollout">update for Pixel Watches</a> was released earlier on Tuesday. </p><p>The security update is available for the following Pixel device models with the <strong>AP1A.240405.002</strong> build number (and the <strong>.A1</strong> version of the build for the Pixel Fold).</p>
<p>The April 2024 update will be available starting today on the Pixel 5a 5G and newer, but it could take a few weeks for it to appear, depending on your device, carrier, and region. </p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-04-01" target="_blank">explains</a> that there are eight general <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> security patches included in the April 2024 update. Eight of them are dated to the April 1 bulletin, while there are 20 more dated April 5. Google does not provide much information about these vulnerabilities but does attach a severity level to each one. The security flaws in the April 1 and April 5 bulletins have severities ranging from high to critical.</p><p>Aside from the security flaws in Android 14, there are 25 patches specifically for Pixel devices. These range from moderate to critical, and Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2024-04-01" target="_blank">says</a> that two of them "may be under limited, targeted exploitation." The two flaws have been assigned to CVE codes CVE-2024-29745 and CVE-2024-29748. The first affects the Pixel bootloader, while the second affects Pixel firmware. As of now, this is all we know about these flaws, but you&apos;ll want to update your phone ASAP to apply the patches. </p><p>Finally, the April 2024 update includes a few bug fixes for Pixel devices:</p>
<ul><li>The update fixes <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-exposure-bug">an exposure bug that we reported on last month</a> affecting the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro.</li><li>The update fixes an issue that caused black halo artifacts to show up in the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro viewfinder when switching from photo to video mode at standard 1x zoom.</li><li>Camera stability is improved when changing zoom levels on the Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 6a, Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 7a, Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Pixel Fold.</li><li>A bug that caused a black screen to show up when unlocking a Pixel 5a (5G) in certain situations has been fixed.</li></ul>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>TECNO has unveiled the Camon 30 series, which includes the Camon 30 Pro 5G, Camon 30 5G, and Camon 30, boasting impressive cameras and stylish design.</li><li>The cameras are enhanced with AI features, including Social Turbo for video calling apps, AI Erase for removing unwanted objects from photos, and Universal Tone for multi-skin tone imaging.</li><li>The Camon 30 Pro 5G introduces AIGC Portrait, allowing users to generate various portrait shots tailored to different occasions using AI.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Chinese phone maker TECNO has announced the Camon 30 series, including the Camon 30 Pro 5G, Camon 30 5G, and Camon 30. The latest mid-range models boast crazy good cameras and stunning design, promising to redefine what a phone in this range can do.</p><p>The new TECNO Camon 30 series decided to say goodbye to the angular rear panels seen in the older models. Instead, TECNO introduced a fresh look with "industry-first" marble-effect suede <em>Tech-Art Leather</em> finishes, available in various colors like Alps Snowy Silver, Emerald Lake Green, Iceland Basaltic Dark, Sahara Sand Brown, and Uyuni Salt White.</p><p>As you probably guessed, the standout feature here is the camera system, which has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">leading Android camera phones</a> in its sights. The Camon 30 series boasts a 50MP Sony IMX890 main camera.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vP3fmF3X8HKsk9UTf2McRN" name="Tecno-Camon-30-Pro-5G-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G on a tripod being used for selfies" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vP3fmF3X8HKsk9UTf2McRN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With AI-powered enhancements, these cameras promise to provide a top-notch photography experience. On the Pro models, you&apos;ll find additional cameras on the back: a 50MP wide-angle lens and a 2MP macro lens, perfect for capturing subjects as close as 2.5cm.</p><p>Up front, there&apos;s a 50MP selfie snapper with eye-tracking autofocus, supporting 4K60fps video recording. Both the Camon 30 5G and the Camon 30 sport the same front-facing camera hardware, though they don&apos;t match the same selfie video performance.</p>

<h2 id="ai-capabilities-2">AI capabilities</h2>
<p>Of course, no true 2024 Android phone would be complete without some talk of generative AI features. TECNO promises that the Camon 30 lineup will support a range of AI-powered functionalities. One of these is called Social Turbo, designed to enhance third-party video calling apps. Users can expect to be able to change their voice and backgrounds and apply beauty filters for a more fun and personalized experience.</p><p>Another cool feature to look out for is the<em> </em>AI Erase, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Erase in Google Pixels</a>. This allows you to easily remove unwanted objects from your photos. Additionally, the Camon 30 series supports Universal Tone, which TECNO claims to be the most advanced AI-powered multi-skin tone imaging technology available.</p><p>The Camon 30 Pro 5G adds a unique AI feature called AIGC Portrait. This means you can create a wide range of portrait shots tailored to different occasions or social media purposes, all thanks to AI. These shots may not be real photos, but AI-generated content based on your selfies.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oDPzt47wkxviza3y9M4w4M" name="Tecno-Camon-30-Pro-5G-camera.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Pro in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oDPzt47wkxviza3y9M4w4M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3200" height="1800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="run-of-the-mill-specs-2">Run-of-the-mill specs</h2>
<p>In terms of display, the Camon 30 Pro 5G is at the forefront, boasting a massive 6.78-inch 144Hz AMOLED screen and Dolby Atmos audio for an immersive experience. The series also includes Wet Hand Touch technology and holds an IP54 rating for added durability.</p><p>The Camon 30 runs on the Helio G99 chipset, while its 5G version upgrades to the Dimensity 7020 SoC. The 30 Pro takes it even further with the MediaTek Dimensity 8200 Ultimate chipset. However, the 30 Pro stands out as the only variant equipped with a 50MP OIS Steady Night Portrait main rear camera.</p><p>On the Pro models, you can enjoy up to 24GB of RAM (including 12GB of extended memory), along with up to 512GB of flash storage. Plus, there&apos;s a 9-layer "gaming-grade" cooling system to keep things running smoothly during intense gaming sessions.</p><p>With a massive 5000mAh battery and support for 70W charging, you can go from 0 to 50% in just 16 minutes. Tecno claims the battery is capable of enduring 1,600 charge cycles and will retain over 80% battery health for at least four years.</p>
<h2 id="limited-availability-2">Limited availability</h2>
<p>While these phones will begin shipping to buyers in a few weeks, there&apos;s some disappointing news for those who want to get their hands on one of them. The Camon 30 series won&apos;t be widely accessible right away. Initially, the three models will be sold in Africa, with plans to expand to more markets later on.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Camon 30 Premier 5G is set to debut later this month. These phones will reach over 70 territories in the upcoming months, though the US unfortunately won&apos;t be among them.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Camon 30 phones bring some exciting additions to this year&apos;s array of new Android devices, even if they&apos;re not easily accessible to everyone.</p><p>No pricing details have been disclosed for any of the four handsets, as they will vary depending on the region. For reference, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-camon-20-pro-and-camon-20-premier-review">Camon 20 Pro</a> 5G was launched at a retail price of $199, so it&apos;s likely that its successor will fall within a similar price range.</p>

<ul><li>Google introduces new features with the April 2024 update to the Pixel Watch.</li><li>It brings haptics to the current time when a user gestures on the watch face.</li><li>The update also brings improvements to auto brightness settings.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google announced today (Apr. 3) that its first-gen Pixel Watch will receive the April 2024 update. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/267278897/google-pixel-watch-update-apr-2024?hl=en&sjid=16971336777914090065-AP">announcement post</a>, the Pixel Watch support team shared the new update bearing the build number TWD9.240405.001. Its rollout has begun, and it is likely to reach all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> owners over the next week, per their carriers and device models.</p>
<p>The global firmware rollout “includes new features, numerous bug fixes, and performance updates for Pixel Watch users.” It additionally brings a Vibration Watch feature, and as the name suggests, users will notice the current time playing haptics whenever a Pixel Watch user utilizes gestures on the watch face.</p><p>Additionally, users can also experience improvements in auto brightness functionality on the Pixel Watch. With the new update, the relevant auto-brightness settings will improve, allowing “users to perceive the difference when switching levels easily.”</p><p>Pixel Watch owners can head over to their smartwatch’s <strong>Settings> System> System Updates</strong> and tap on the “Your watch is up to date” screen to check for the OTA update, per the rollout timeline, as mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>While it seems like a minor monthly update to the original Pixel Watch, it is still unclear whether it includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-could-gain-a-new-app-download-indicator">recently spotted</a> tracking app downloads feature. For the unaware, the Pixel Watch tested a new progress bar for app updates downloaded via Google Play Store, similar to what we see on Pixel phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>.</p><p>That said, the latest firmware release comes along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-devices-get-march-feature-drop">March feature drop</a>, which brought some noteworthy features to the original Pixel Watch. The notable ones included were pace training, heart zone training, and auto workout mode—all of which were previously exclusive to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>. Additionally, Pixel Watch owners also received the Fitbit Relax app as a guide to users’ breathing exercises.</p>
