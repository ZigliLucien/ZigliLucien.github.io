<ul><li>Songs are a key part of Instagram: they can be added to posts, stories, and Reels on the platform.</li><li>Now, when a user hears a song they like on Instagram, they can save it to their Spotify account with just a few tops.</li><li>For the time being, this integration only works with Spotify. TikTok, meanwhile, offers a similar feature that works with Spotify, Amazon Music, and Apple Music.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Music discovery happens differently today than it did a few decades ago. Instead of people finding their favorite songs on the radio or in movies, they're discovering the latest hits on social media sites like TikTok and Instagram.</p><p>Last year, TikTok added an <strong>Add to Music app</strong> feature that made it easier to save songs heard on the platform to a streaming service. Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram">Instagram</a> is catching up ‚Äî users will be able to save songs heard on posts, stories, and Reels to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify">Spotify</a> music library.</p><p>Without music-saving integration in social media apps, there can be friction in the music discovery process. Users hear a song they like and then have to click on the sound in the post, story, or Reel to learn more about it, like the song title and artist. Previously, they'd have to open the music streaming service of their choice manually, find the song they heard, and add it to their library. It was a cumbersome process, and people in a rush might have neglected to add a song they liked simply due to how many steps it required.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">find a song on Instagram ‚û°Ô∏è save to your @Spotify üéß pic.twitter.com/dP0ycYR3rI<a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1846947780008305075">October 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Now, the whole experience is streamlined. All you have to do is tap the song you heard in a post, story, or Reel to open up its song card in the Instagram app. From there, you'll see an <strong>Add</strong> button next to the scrubber with a Spotify logo. After you've tapped that button, it'll change to <strong>Added</strong>, and that's it ‚Äî the song will be in your <strong>Liked Songs </strong>playlist.</p><p>To use the feature, make sure both of your Instagram and Spotify apps are updated. You'll need to link your accounts the first time you add a song, but the experience will require only two taps afterward.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sZWCx7PCbnLqWCYegRx2ak" name="Instagram-Save-To-Spotify.jpg" alt="The Save to Spotify process in the Instagram app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sZWCx7PCbnLqWCYegRx2ak.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It'll be much easier to add Instagram songs to Spotify now that you don't have to leave the Instagram app to do it. Spotify is the largest music streaming service in the world, so many users will be able to take advantage of this feature. Unfortunately, no other music streaming services are supported. If you happen to use something like YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Apple Music, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify-vs-tidal">Tidal</a>, you will be out of luck.</p><p>TikTok added the similar <strong>Add to Music app</strong> feature about a year ago, and it does support more music streaming platforms. When it launched, TikTok supported Spotify, Amazon Music, or Apple Music. In that way, TikTok is still ahead in compatibility, and Amazon Music or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer">Apple Music</a> subscribers will still find the video-first platform better for music discovery.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While Vivo always delivered phones with great cameras, 2024 has been a breakout year for the brand, with its devices consistently delivering outstanding photos and videos. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a> set the groundwork at the start of the year, featuring upgraded cameras and a bigger battery. Vivo followed that up with the mid-range V30 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v30-pro-review">V30 Pro</a>, and then came the marquee launch of the year with the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">X Fold3 Pro</a>.</p><p>Along the way, Vivo also released the X100 Ultra, but unlike the rest of the models, it didn&apos;t make its way outside China. While Xiaomi and OPPO do this on a standard basis, Vivo has been consistent with bringing its entire portfolio to global markets, and I was particularly keen on the X100 Ultra, as it was positioned as Vivo&apos;s ultimate camera phone of 2024.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> have been really great this year, and I&apos;m glad to say that the X100 Ultra follows in a similar fashion. If anything, Vivo&apos;s Chinese-exclusive Origin OS software is better than what we usually get on the brand&apos;s global models, and while it wasn&apos;t the most straightforward to use out of the box, it became easier once I had the Play Store installed.</p><p>Vivo isn&apos;t waiting around either; it launched the V40 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v40-pro-review">V40 Pro</a> to take on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review">Xiaomi 14T Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-takes-things-to-a-whole-new-level-with-the-x200-series">X200 series</a> has made its debut in China and should be available globally sometime early next week. But the X100 Ultra continues to be my go-to choice, and if I can only pick one device as the best overall in 2024, then it would be this one ‚Äî so it&apos;s a shame, really, that you can&apos;t actually buy it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x100-ultra-pricing-and-availability"><span>Vivo X100 Ultra: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SWbxazRGVPGoqwYAWSjAtM" name="vivo-x100-ultra-7.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SWbxazRGVPGoqwYAWSjAtM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo unveiled the X100 Ultra at an event in China on May 13, and the phone went on sale in the country starting May 28. The device costs 7,099 RMB ($996) for the version with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, and it is also available in 12GB/256GB editions and a 16GB/1TB model, which is what I&apos;m using.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x100-ultra-design"><span>Vivo X100 Ultra: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xscbNXVRFLwPsofUqoymMM" name="vivo-x100-ultra-4.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xscbNXVRFLwPsofUqoymMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo has a distinct design language, and while the X100 Ultra shares similarities to the X100 Pro, it does a few things differently. The camera design at the back is much more distinctive; the X100 Ultra has an even larger island, and the groove that encircles it has greater definition, making it stand out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RSKGU5vw42daTzKo45vuqN" name="vivo-x100-ultra-15.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RSKGU5vw42daTzKo45vuqN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m using the white color variant, and it looks elegant in its own right ‚Äî even though it doesn&apos;t have the Find X7 Ultra&apos;s flamboyant leather designs. The silver-accented camera island along with the black around the individual modules create enough contrast to distinguish the design, and while it is one of the biggest camera modules on a phone today, there are no issues with usability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5rJv2doyopskL53qduVLiM" name="vivo-x100-ultra-11.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5rJv2doyopskL53qduVLiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the island extends to cover most of the width at the back, it essentially props up the device at a subtle angle when it&apos;s on a tablet, so you don&apos;t get any wobble. The X100 Ultra is also a little thicker around the sides than the X100 Pro, and this makes a sizeable difference in usability. Vivo thankfully isn&apos;t getting on the trend of boxy sides, and the X100 Ultra has smooth curves and rounded edges, and the matte aluminum mid-fame feels great to hold and use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TY7EhKCF7tDZqLzhj5be5N" name="vivo-x100-ultra-14.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TY7EhKCF7tDZqLzhj5be5N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The glass back is protected by Vivo&apos;s custom solution (instead of Gorilla Glass), and while the X100 Ultra has a satin texture at the back, the white color option does a good job hiding smudges, and while it is one of the heaviest phones around at 229g, you don&apos;t notice the heft ‚Äî it has excellent weight distribution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jvnAjxCXnM8EPDMifzAUHP" name="vivo-x100-ultra-13.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jvnAjxCXnM8EPDMifzAUHP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Cumulatively, the X100 Ultra has gotten over four months of use, all without a case. After a dozen tumbles ‚Äî some from nearly six feet ‚Äî the device is still pristine, and that should serve as a testament to Vivo&apos;s build quality. While the brand bundles a silicone case in the box, I didn&apos;t feel the need to use it, and given the long-term durability, I don&apos;t think you need one with this phone ‚Äî I can&apos;t say the same of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-was-wrong-about-the-pixel-9-pro-xl">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DvL26oz2csHzvt25MKemeN" name="vivo-x100-ultra-12.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DvL26oz2csHzvt25MKemeN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The X100 Ultra has IP68 ingress protection, and the device has no issues in this area. While the Xiaomi 14 and 14 Ultra have issues with condensation getting into the camera island, I didn&apos;t notice those problems on any other brands. Overall, the X100 Ultra has one of the best designs of 2024, and it has proven durability.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x100-ultra-display"><span>Vivo X100 Ultra: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6tKfbPbaXrvdFD4vHjCMJQ" name="vivo-x100-ultra-16.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6tKfbPbaXrvdFD4vHjCMJQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo didn&apos;t change the panel, and the X100 Ultra uses the same 6.78-inch LTPO OLED as the X100 Pro. The key difference is that you get increased resolution ‚Äî 3200 x 1440 ‚Äî but otherwise, it has the same 120Hz dynamic refresh, 1440Hz PWM dimming, and 3000-nit maximum brightness.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9sdxYrskxSzq5nSK6zWehS" name="vivo-x100-ultra-19.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9sdxYrskxSzq5nSK6zWehS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In real-world use, the X100 Ultra gets incredibly bright; in fact, only the Pixel 9 Pro XL gets brighter than the device in auto mode. There are absolutely no issues in this area, and the panel outshines its rivals with ease. It has Dolby Vision integration as well, and it does a great job with HDR content in general.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QbiT3UUsaAsZuisymdh6AR" name="vivo-x100-ultra-20.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QbiT3UUsaAsZuisymdh6AR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Colors are predictably vivid, and the subtle curves around the sides make it that much more immersive. I didn&apos;t have any problems while streaming content or playing games, and if you need a vibrant OLED panel that gets bright and is highly customizable, the X100 Ultra is an easy recommendation. Vivo did a good job with the built-in sound as well, and it gets as loud as the Xiaomi 14 Ultra ‚Äî no small feat.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nNY7Fmvh89SqLMChiXrTyP" name="vivo-x100-ultra-21.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nNY7Fmvh89SqLMChiXrTyP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Vivo went with Dimensity 9300 in the X100 series, the X100 Ultra uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. The variant I&apos;m using has 16GB of RAM and 1TB storage, and it is among the fastest devices I used this year. It is fluid in regular use, the interface is optimized to take advantage of the hardware, and there are no slowdowns.</p>
<p>It holds up incredible well at gaming as well, and there are no issues in demanding titles. The only problem is that it gets hotter than the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and the X100 Pro; I measured 44 degrees at the back of the unit after extended gaming sessions, and that&apos;s on the higher end of the scale.</p>

<p>In 3DMark&apos;s Solar Bay stress test, the device went up to 57 degrees, and I had to set it aside as it became too hot. The stability score of 71% is average, but it&apos;s clear that Vivo didn&apos;t set any aggressive thermal limits on the device ‚Äî as evidenced by the overheating.</p>
<p>I didn&apos;t see any problems in other areas; the X100 Ultra delivered a strong cellular and Wi-Fi signal, Bluetooth connectivity was rock-solid, and you get the full suite of AptX codecs. I dislike ultrasonic fingerprint sensors as they tend to be slow and not as easy to use as the optical modules, but Vivo does a great job with these modules, and that&apos;s no different on the X100 Ultra, with the device using Goodix&apos;s latest solution. The recognition area is suitably large, and it is fast to authenticate.</p>

<p>The X100 Ultra isn&apos;t the fastest-charging phone I used this year by any margin, but it has incredible battery life, and just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Magic V3</a>, it uses a silicon-carbon battery that increases density while ensuring the device isn&apos;t bulky. The result is that you get a 5500mAh battery, and the phone lasts a day and a half between charges.</p><p>I usually get better battery life when using phones with Chinese skins; they have more aggressive memory management, and the same is true of the X100 Ultra as well. As there&apos;s no global version of the phone, it comes with Vivo&apos;s China-only software, and the battery lasts longer than the Find X7 Ultra, Xiaomi 14 Ultra, and the X100 Pro.</p><p>Charging takes just over 50 minutes via the bundled 80W charger, and while this is slower than what you get on the likes of the OnePlus 12, it is much better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x100-ultra-cameras"><span>Vivo X100 Ultra: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RMAKcRXYPtVNThvfyaL6TN" name="vivo-x100-ultra-9.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RMAKcRXYPtVNThvfyaL6TN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The main reason to consider the X100 Ultra is the cameras; Vivo already did a great job with the camera package on the X100 Pro, but the X100 Ultra takes things to a whole new level. The phone uses the same 50MP Sony Lytia LYT-900 main camera with the massive 1/0.98-inch module and 1.6um pixels, and it gets Vivo&apos;s gimbal-based OIS.</p><p>It&apos;s joined by a 50MP Sony Lytia LYT-600 f/2.2 wide-angle with a modest 116-degree FoV, and the star of the show is the 200MP Samsung HP9 telephoto, which uses a 1/1.4-inch lens, goes up to 3.7x optical zoom, and has OIS. You get a 50MP camera at the front, and it has autofocus and the ability to shoot 4K60 video. In fact, all four cameras can shoot 4K60 video, and you even get the ability to do so at 10x zoom.</p><p>Vivo has Dolby Vision video at 4K60 as well with the rear cameras, and the device does an excellent job in this area. You get good stabilization even at a high zoom level, and if you don&apos;t need HDR video, you can go up to 4K120 and 8K30 on this device. Similar to Xiaomi with its Leica partnership, Vivo has a long-standing collaboration with Zeiss, and the X100 Ultra uses three styles ‚Äî Vivid, Textured, and Natural. The Natural style adds vignetting and creates moody shots, so I went with the Vivid option.</p><p>The Lytia LYT-900 module is a known quantity by this point, and it delivers outstanding photos in any scenario. The X100 Ultra delivers the same caliber of shots as the X100 Pro in daylight situations, with great color rendition and white balance. Because of the switch to Qualcomm, you get minute differences in image quality, and I prefer the shots taken with the X100 Ultra over the Pro model.</p>

<p>The main camera takes the best low-light shots of any device, with excellent detail retrieval and minimal noise. Like the X100 Pro, the Ultra tends to deliver overly-bright images with vibrant colors, and while not necessarily accurate, the resultant shots look great when shared on social media. The wide-angle lens does a great job in this area as well, and while I don&apos;t take as many wide-angle shots, I use this mode quite a lot with videos, and it is better than other phones I used this year.</p><p>But it&apos;s the telephoto lens that&apos;s been a revelation. It takes fabulous photos at up to 3.7x zoom, and you get usable shots at 10x ‚Äî if anything, it does a better job than the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Galaxy S24 Ultra in this regard. Where it truly shines is with portrait shots; the X100 Ultra takes the best portrait shots of any phone, and what&apos;s particularly great is that it does so across various focal lengths.</p>
<p>I thought the Find X7 Ultra would be unchallenged in this category, but the X100 Ultra consistently delivers better portrait shots, and it is in a league of its own ‚Äî no other flagship has the same consistency or detail. You also get terrific macro shots, and while I don&apos;t take many macros, it was fun to use the mode to shoot photos of artisan keys on my keyboards.</p><p>After taking thousands of photos and hundreds of videos, I can confidently say that the X100 Ultra is the best camera I used this year. It does a better job than the Pixel 9 Pro XL, Xiaomi 14 Ultra, Galaxy S24 Ultra, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Only the Find X7 Ultra comes close to the device, and it&apos;s annoying that two of the best camera phones of 2024 are limited to China.</p>

<p>I used dozens of phones with Vivo&apos;s Funtouch OS over the years, but the X100 Ultra comes with the brand&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>-based OriginOS instead, which it uses exclusively in China. There&apos;s quite a lot of differences between the two, and if anything, I think I prefer the OriginOS interface. It looks cleaner, and has an exhaustive feature-set.</p><p>The UI has better fluidity than Funtouch OS, and you get a great level of customizability. The notification pane is split into a Control Center and notification section, and there&apos;s no way to switch to a unified pane. The overview menu allows you to stack horizontally or vertically ‚Äî similar to MIUI ‚Äî and the app grid is somehow wider.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="p5kn8ufSt8Q3beN9o8DaTR" name="vivo-x100-ultra-23.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p5kn8ufSt8Q3beN9o8DaTR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like other Chinese-only devices, you don&apos;t get Google Play Services out of the box, but that can be easily addressed. Vivo has its own app store, and you can install the Play Store from there and go into the phone&apos;s settings to enable basic Google services. Doing so lets you sign in to the Play Store (you&apos;ll get a server issue otherwise), and then you can easily install apps just like any other device.</p><p>While there aren&apos;t many issues with OriginOS as a whole, notifications continue to be a problem. I guess this has something to do with the requisite Google hooks not being present, but all phones I use with Chinese skins have issues with notification management. I just don&apos;t get most notifications, and I have to manually go into an app to see whatever notifications I missed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ifSJQRWq5j9ZgXMG75n26S" name="vivo-x100-ultra-17.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ifSJQRWq5j9ZgXMG75n26S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The X100 Ultra is also constrained in this area, and while it isn&apos;t as limiting as the Find X7 Ultra, I had plenty of instances where video calls or even regular calls ‚Äî when using Google&apos;s Phone dialer ‚Äî would trigger a notification. It got to a point where I had to switch to the bundled Vivo dialer so I wouldn&apos;t miss phone calls, but WhatsApp calls were always an issue.</p><p>That said, changing background memory settings to unrestricted made a difference in this regard, and there was only the occasional video call that went awry. Other than that, using the phone is similar to the global build.</p><p>Vivo rolled out software updates consistently to the X100 Ultra (I counted four updates), and the device will pick up four Android OS updates along with six years of security patches. While that&apos;s not as much as what Google and Samsung provide, it is adequate.</p>

<p>The standard X100 Pro is pretty great in its own right, and I recommend getting this instead of the X100 Ultra; it has terrific cameras, and takes great photos and videos in challenging situations. The design is nearly identical, and you get powerful hardware with a long-lasting battery. I used the X100 Pro alongside the X100 Ultra, and while the latter ultimately wins out on the camera front, the software hassle makes the X100 Pro the better choice globally.</p><p>The phone that comes closest to the X100 Ultra is its BBK sibling, the Find X7 Ultra, with that device also featuring a stunning design and outstanding cameras. Annoyingly, that device is also limited to China, and you can&apos;t buy it outside the country.</p><p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra is also good, and while its cameras are amazing, there are inconsistencies with the resultant photos and videos that&apos;s making me reconsider my recommendation. This hasn&apos;t been an issue in previous years, but the 14 Ultra just doesn&apos;t have the same consistency as other devices in this category.</p>

The phone has a great design, one of the brightest OLED panels available today, and top-notch hardware. Battery life is among the best of any phone around, and 80W charging is reliable.</p><p>Where the X100 Ultra has an edge over other flagships is the cameras. The main camera is identical to what you get on the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, Find X7 Ultra, and the X100 Pro, but the resultant images are marginally better thanks to Vivo&apos;s tuning efforts. The portrait camera is the best around, and there isn&apos;t another phone today that matches the X100 Ultra in this regard.</p><p>While that&apos;s great, the biggest limitation with the X100 Ultra is that it isn&apos;t available globally. Vivo needs to change its strategy in 2025 and bring the Ultra model to global markets ‚Äî it&apos;s too good to be sold in just one country.</p>

<p>Rugged smartphone maker DOOGEE has just launched its latest model, the S200. This tough little device isn‚Äôt just built to last; it's also the first 5G smartphone in the DOOGEE S lineup.</p><p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-rugged-android-phones">leading rugged smartphones</a> on the market, the DOOGEE S200 is built to handle harsh conditions. With its tough components and aerospace-grade aluminum body, it‚Äôs earned the MIL-STD-810H certification and IP69/IP69K ratings, making it resistant to water, dust, sand, and impacts. This means the phone has been put through rigorous drop tests to prove it can withstand just about anything.</p><p>The S200 sports a 6.72-inch 120Hz main display and a handy 1.32-inch rear screen that quietly shows you the time and other quick info. Its rear camera setup includes a 100MP sensor boosted by AI and Morpho Imaging tech, plus a 20MP night vision mode and the ability to shoot 4K video.</p><p>Doogee claims this rugged phone can take photos underwater at depths of up to 5 feet (1.5 meters), making it perfect for your aquatic escapades. Plus, with its AI doing all the heavy lifting on the settings, you can just point and shoot and pretend you're a professional photographer.</p><p>Armed with the MediaTek Dimensity 7050 processor, the S200 delivers performance that won‚Äôt make you want to throw it against the wall in frustration (though it can probably take that beating since it's a rugged device, after all).</p><p>It‚Äôs got Wi-Fi 6 for those who need speed and up to 32GB of RAM with 256GB of storage, so multitasking is as easy as pie. Its gigantic 10,100mAh battery supports 33W fast charging and reverse charging, meaning you can keep your phone alive all day.</p><p>The S200 is rocking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, so you know it‚Äôs got performance, stability, and energy efficiency on lock. It also comes with some privacy features like fingerprint recognition.</p><p>The device retails for ¬£260 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DCSKGG6X?&linkCode=sl1&tag=tablet022-21" target="_blank">Amazon UK</a>, and DOOGEE is currently offering a sweet ¬£70 discount. This deal is expected to make its way to Amazon.com by the end of October. You‚Äôll also be able to snag it from the DOOGEE website and AliExpress.</p>

Plus, it gives you notifications from smart doorbells and lets you manage locks, plugs, and speakers‚Äîall without lifting a finger.</p><p>Basically, the Home panel gives you full control of all your smart home devices on the Google TV Streamer, but you can't assign these functions to specific buttons.</p><p>Alongside the market launch of its new streaming device, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-updates-control-center-entertainment-smart-home">confirmed that the Home panel would roll out</a> to existing Google TV devices. Chromecast with Google TV recently got it through a public preview, and now more Google TV devices from brands like TCL, Hisense, Xiaomi, and others are picking up the feature too (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/19/google-tv-home-panel-widely-available/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/15158065#:~:text=Set%20up%20devices%20in%20the%20Google%20Home%20app" target="_blank">support page</a>, users need to set up their compatible smart devices through the Google Home app before they can use the new Home panel on their TV.</p><p>The Home panel appears in the upper right corner of the screen, giving users a clear snapshot of their smart home tech. From this panel, you can get a full view of your devices and dive into individual settings to make changes.</p><p>If the Home panel isn't showing up on your Google TV, try checking for updates to the Google TV Home app in the Play Store. To see if the Home panel is already operational, just hold the home button on your remote to pull up the quick settings, then look for the Google Home tile.</p>

<hr>
<p>Qualcomm is hosting its annual Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii and Chinese OEM Xiaomi announced important news concerning its next flagship.</p><p>During <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/0e5zpV0NS50">the keynote</a>, the SVP and president of Xiaomi, Adam Zeng, arrived on stage to discuss what consumers can expect in the future. The major highlight of Zeng's onstage presence was that the Xiaomi 15 series will feature Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. Zeng states the phones will be "the first" devices to rock the new chip "globally."</p><p>The company SVP added that the user experience "is the most important." Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite will be paired with Xiaomi's HyperCore. Zeng states this technology covers four areas: performance, graphics, networking, and security.</p><p>Together, Zeng says consumers grabbing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15">Xiaomi 15</a> will experience "full-frame performance" during intensive games. Both HyperCore and the Snapdragon 8 Elite are said to drop the phone's power consumption by 29.7%. Moreover, the Xiaomi 15 series may stay cooler as peak internal temperatures are "three degrees lower" (Celsius) compared to Qualcomm's previous gen.</p><p>Lastly, Zeng announced that the Xiaomi 15 series will launch "at the end of October." Xiaomi's William Lu added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/content/dam/qcomm-martech/dm-assets/images/company/news-media/media-center/press-kits/snapdragon-summit-2024/day-1/documents/PartnerQuoteSheet.pdf">in separate statement</a> that the 8 Elite will usher in "a new era of on-device generative AI with the support of on-device multi-modal generative AI applications."¬†</p><p>Other news from Xiaomi during the keynote touted its continued presence in the #3 spot of the top smartphone brands globally. What's more, the Chinese OEM reportedly accounts for 22.1% of "total shipments" in 2024.</p>

<p>Qualcomm announced its newest SoC, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">the Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> during its Summit 2024 event in Maui. The chip is built off the 3nm, TSMC process with two prime cores, clocking out at 4.32GHz prime cores. The chip's internal structure continues with six 3.53GHz performance cores and 5.3Gbps LPDDR5X memory.</p><p>Qualcomm states the Snapdragon 8 Elite reaches a 45% boost in single and multi-core performance over its predecessor. Additionally, the chip should deliver a 44% increase in phone efficiency. AI was the name of the game for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">the SD 8 Gen 3</a> and that continues today. With 45% "better performance per watt," the 8 Elite should fall seamlessly in line with Google's Gemini for snappy on-device usage.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> is our favorite smartwatch on the market right now, not because it's the most powerful, but because it balances innovative features and premium specs with a price tag that's accessible for most folks. Buy the 40mm watch from Amazon today and you'll get even more bang for your buck, as the retailer is currently carving a historic 18% off for a limited time.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-watch7-aluminum-smartwatch-40mm-bt-cream/6585114.p">Best Buy - $259.99</a> | <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Galaxy-Watch7-40mm-Cream-Bluetooth/6214656451">Walmart - $244.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1YNVD88" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="301bfea2-0edc-4feb-9b6f-ec6e2d07abf2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299.99" data-dimension48="$299.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>If you&apos;re familiar with past <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung watches</a>, you&apos;ll notice that the Galaxy Watch 7 is more about careful refinement than reinventing the wheel. While the Watch 7 retains the vibrant, scratch-resistant AMOLED display, most of the watch&apos;s upgrades can be found under the hood. You get a snappy Exynos processer for smooth app performance, plus 40 hours of battery life, 13 heart rate LEDs for super-accurate monitoring, and a ton of new Galaxy AI software features. There&apos;s also 32GB of storage and 2GB of RAM, and the four years of guaranteed OS updates means you could be using this watch through 2028 before it starts to feel even remotely dated.¬†</p><p>Like we already mentioned, the Galaxy Watch 7 doesn&apos;t look that different from its predecessor, so it probably won&apos;t be particularly impressive in the style department (although using replacement <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">Galaxy Watch 7 bands</a> can help). We were also disappointed to see that Samsung got rid of the Wireless Power Share feature that let you juice up your smartwatch using another device.¬†</p><p>In the grand scheme of things, these flaws are pretty minor, so if you were hoping to find a great smartwatch at a discount before the holiday madness begins, don&apos;t let this early Black Friday deal from Amazon pass you by.¬†</p>

<hr>
<p>Honor is set to unveil the Magic 7 series in China on October 30, but it isn&apos;t waiting until then to showcase the phone&apos;s AI features. The Chinese manufacturer took to the stage at Qualcomm&apos;s annual summit in Hawaii to announce Autopilot AI, and on-device AI agent that can be used to automate mundane tasks.</p><p>Honor says the on-device AI can assist with "travel planning, ticket booking, calendar scheduling, notification management, cross-app file transfer," and it also has the ability to get rid of unwanted subscriptions. It sounds similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">Large Action Model (LAM)</a> Motorola showed off at Lenovo Tech World 2024, but that was just a proof of concept, and Honor&apos;s Autopilot AI will actually be available on the company&apos;s next flagship series. All of that sounds great, but I&apos;ll wait until I get my hands on the Magic 7 to see how it actually holds up in real-world testing.</p><p>It&apos;s clear that Honor wants AI to be a key talking point on its phones; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-magicos-80-with-android-14-and-a-generous-serving-of-ai">MagicOS 8.0</a> introduced the Magic Portal last year, delivering intent-based AI use cases. While its usability was limited, Honor teamed up with Google to bring a slate of new features to its devices later in the year, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Magic V3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-battery-life">Magic 6 Pro</a> continue to be great in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1913px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.39%;"><img id="owr5Ew97kcwvHsEStSziN7" name="magic-7-2.jpg" alt="Honor's Magic 7 on-device AI showcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/owr5Ew97kcwvHsEStSziN7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1913" height="964" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The on-device AI agent will debut in MagicOS 9.0, which is what the Magic 7 series will run out of the box. In addition to an AI assistant, Honor is bringing generative AI to gaming, noting that its on-device AI rendering engine will reduce the load on the GPU, delivering better image fidelity and thermals.</p><p>With Qualcomm highlighting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> at its summit, Honor becomes one of the first brands to confirm the use of the next-gen platform on its devices. With the Magic 7 series set to debut on October 30, we don&apos;t have to wait too long to know more about what these devices bring to the table.</p>

Whether you want the base model Pixel 9 or the beastly Pixel 9 Pro XL, you've come to the right place: I built this guide so you know exactly where to look when the Black Friday sales go live.</p><p>There aren't too many deals available just yet, but I expect that to change dramatically in the coming weeks.

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-pro-deals"><span>Google Pixel 9 Pro deals</span></h3>
<p>For the first time ever, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> is the same size as the base model Google Pixel 9 ‚Äî but fear not, things still look quite different under the hood. The Google Pixel 9 Pro boasts the Tensor G4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, plus you get an improved 42 MP front camera system and a telephoto lens (another first for Google devices). The Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 for the 128GB version, and there's also a more-expensive 1TB version if you need additional storage.</p>

<p>Probably the most surprising smartphone announced during Made by Google 2024, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL picks up where Google left off with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-xl-review">Pixel 4 XL</a> years ago. It's essentially a bigger version of the Pixel 9 Pro, with a 6.8-inch LTPO display, 16GB of RAM, and a slightly larger battery. The XL phone starts at $1,099 for the 128GB version, or you could go up to 1TB to get more storage.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an update for its Chat app that&apos;ll tell you everything you need to know <em>before </em>opening a thread.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/10/gemini-summaries-google-chat.html">Workspace post</a>, Google highlighted the beginning of its "Gemini in Chat" update that brings AI-backed summaries to busy conversations. The company states users will soon find a bulleted list of "important" points from an unread chat thread in the app. Google states the feature may help users "focus" and find what&apos;s important before tackling other tasks.</p><p>Users opening Chat&apos;s "Home" page on the web will find Gemini&apos;s typical starry "summarize" button when hovering over an unread conversation. Clicking it will expand the single line like a drop-down menu. From there, users will see a "Summary" banner with the key points Gemini feels are important. Google states this is intended to be a "synopsis" of the conversation.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini&apos;s</a> chat summaries are rolling out for mobile users, too. However, to surface them, users on mobile must long-press an unread chat thread. Gemini&apos;s summaries will appear automatically above the app&apos;s typical list of thread options.</p><p>Of course, Google includes its typical AI tagline that it could "get things wrong." Users may want to hop in and check things out just to be safe. Additionally, the post states users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10079371">can turn this off</a> if they don&apos;t want Gemini going through for synopsis purposes.</p><p>The update is rolling out for web, Android, and iOS users today (Oct 21) on rapid and scheduled release domains. Google Workspace customers with the following add-ons are eligible: Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, Education Premium, and AI & Messaging.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s been upgrading Chat throughout 2024, with its most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-gets-video-messages-feature">hitting users earlier in October</a>. The update brought video messaging similar to what you&apos;d experience in WhatsApp. Google gives users a way to record three-minute-long videos in the Chat app. These video messages can be sent in direct messages (one-on-one), group DMs, and spaces.</p><p>What&apos;s more, this update is essentially an add-on to Google&apos;s earlier update from March <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-voice-messages-mobile-rollout">added voice messages to Chat</a>. Users can tap the microphone icon to begin recording their voice instead of typing a text in a DM or group DM. Unfortunately, voice messages are restricted to Enterprise customers.</p>
