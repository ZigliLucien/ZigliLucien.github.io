<p>A recent report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-moves-forward-with-foldable-iphone?rc=bdqvyp">The Information</a> dropped in late July, indicating that Apple could release a foldable device as early as 2026. We’ve known about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-flip">potential Apple foldable</a> as early as 2021, with a more definitive rumor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/a-foldable-iphone-could-be-closer-than-ever-thanks-to-this-new-patent">circulating last year</a>. But even if the company releases one within the next couple of years, would people be interested in buying an Apple-made foldable?</p><p>I decided to speak with Victor Hoyos, a 32-year-old long-time iPhone user who recently switched over to the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, and ask whether he would switch back to Apple if it made a foldable. </p><p>“I’m not going to move,” Hoyos told me in an interview. </p><p>He believes that Apple is at a point of maturity with its iPhone and is now trying to shift gears to have another wow-factor moment with its Apple Vision Pro VR headset.  </p><p>“They know that their iPhone is mature enough, [and] their market is just not going to grow. And you can see it in their phones. They’re just very iterative,” he said, adding that he also thinks if Apple were to make a foldable, it would likely be in book form rather than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a>, and Apple would slap a $2,500 price tag on it.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>An Apple foldable will likely be priced at a premium, and that could deter potential buyers and even long-time iPhone users.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Hoyos recently posted on Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/razr/comments/1dznx6j/im_an_iphone_user_deep_in_their_ecosystem_but_the/">asking other long-time Apple users about </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/razr/comments/1dznx6j/im_an_iphone_user_deep_in_their_ecosystem_but_the/" target="_blank">their experience switching</a> to an Android-based phone and whether it was hard. Though relearning a new device and operating system was a challenge, he still said it was “very exciting.” </p><p>“It was pure nostalgia for me. I heard the word Razr and…it was the same level of awe and excitement for technology that I haven’t felt in years,” Hoyos said. “I think the last time I felt that excited was probably the iPhone 5s.</p>

<p>Hoyos isn’t the only person who feels this way about his iPhone. I also spoke with Shepherd Howe, a 16-year-old high school student who switched to an Android in 2020 despite living in an Apple-centric household. </p><p>In an interview, Howe said one of the main reasons for switching over was that he felt <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">Android phones</a> looked cooler. While he still has his iPhone, he felt that over time, his iPhone’s performance fell short of that of his Android device. </p><p>Like Hoyos, Howe also doesn’t think he’d switch back if Apple made a foldable device. </p><p>“I don’t think I would switch even though it would be cool to have a folding phone that was an iPhone,” he said. “But my final answer would be no.”</p>
<h2 id="apple-will-still-win-if-it-launches-a-foldable-xa0-2">Apple will still win if it launches a foldable </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj" name="Google-Messages-iMessage-green-bubble.jpg" alt="Google Messages on an Android phone and iMessage on an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite Hoyos and Howe both strongly stating they would not switch back to Apple if it created a foldable, there is still a large market of people who would still choose Apple.</p><p>Alex Mar is one of those people. In an interview with Derrek Lee, Android Central&apos;s managing editor, Mar, who is in his early 30s and lives in the Seattle area, said he switched to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> for reasons similar to Hoyos. He said it brought a nostalgic feeling, something that companies like Motorola have focused heavily on when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-feel-threatened-by-motorola">marketing their flip phones</a>.</p><p>He also revealed that he had a little bit of “iPhone fatigue.” However, after several months with the Flip, Mar eventually decided to switch back to his iPhone, ultimately because of the Apple ecosystem. </p><p>“In the United States, most people have iPhones here. If It were another country where everyone uses WhatsApp, WeChat, or they just use [a] regular [messaging service], I would have stuck with Android,” he said. </p><p>More importantly, Mar said he would “absolutely get an iPhone flip phone.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4132px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="noi6MWaEc9AzXzjiR2f4H9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-how-it-started-how-its-going-7.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/noi6MWaEc9AzXzjiR2f4H9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4132" height="2324" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Counterpoint Research <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/survey-28-of-us-smartphone-users-highly-likely-to-opt-for-a-foldable-as-next-purchase/">data from 2022</a> suggested that while 46% of people would buy a Samsung foldable phone, 39% would pick a potential Apple foldable over other foldables that are in the market. </p><p>“Foldables have performed better in controlling the shift from Android to iOS,” said Hanish Bhatia, associate director of North American research at Counterpoint Research. “However, we don’t expect foldables to become the dominant form factor anytime soon in the U.S.” </p><p>Despite the unavailability of an Apple foldable, the data shows “a lot of excitement among consumers for a foldable iPhone,” said Jeff Fieldhack, research director of North America at Counterpoint Research.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>There is a lot of excitement among consumers for a foldable iPhone.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I myself have been a foldable hater for a while now, although not because I don’t think the form factor is cool; it&apos;s mostly because I simply can’t stand the display crease. </p><p>But when Lee wrote his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review"><u>Motorola Razr Plus 2024 review</u></a>, I somehow became convinced that Android manufacturers have almost figured it out. As he writes, “the crease looks and feels even less noticeable than on the Razr Plus 2023, which is saying something.”</p><p>If Apple were to create a foldable phone, the crease would definitely be something the company would seriously need to work on perfecting. </p>
<h2 id="apple-isn-x2019-t-late-to-the-game-it-x2019-s-being-strategic-xa0-2">Apple isn’t late to the game; it’s being strategic </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MuCaSbRUb9nUjqD4WgGaii" name="nearby-share-neardrop-galaxy-z-fold-5-macbok-pro-iphone-15-pro-max.jpg" alt="Nearby Share on Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MuCaSbRUb9nUjqD4WgGaii.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, give credit where it’s due. While most people might think Apple is silly for not having a foldable in the market yet, there is a very smart reason why. The company wants to avoid putting out a shoddy and lackluster product. Maybe the new iPhones are iterative in nature, but I know that if Apple were to release a foldable, it’d be a quality phone. </p><p>Jiitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC&apos;s worldwide device tracker, agrees, indicating that “Apple often isn’t the first to the game, but it does tend to offer some of the best and well-thought solutions.”</p><p>Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Research, also added that Apple (and likely other manufacturers) consider many components before releasing a product. </p><p>“It’s a question of getting the product definition, positioning, durability, and experience right,” he said. “There are multiple factors, which Apple needs to consider before jumping into foldables to maintain the standardization and scale at a global level from silicon to software to devices.”</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Apple often isn’t the first to the game, but it does tend to offer some of the best and well-thought solutions.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>So, is Apple too late to the game, particularly when companies like Samsung are now in their 6th generation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>?</p><p>“Foldables, even in 2026, will only account for less than 3% of the global smartphone volumes (this is assuming only Android foldables exist). However, a folding iPhone would be a great way for Apple to further increase average selling prices and address an ultra-premium segment of the market that is currently being served by Android brands,” he said. </p><p>In the scenario where Apple decides to have a foldable device, it will likely be a premium phone and “not something that the average consumer would afford initially unless Apple continues to offer great trade-in programs or financing options like they currently do.”</p><p>Take the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/smart-glasses/apple-vision-pro-review">Apple Vision Pro</a>, for example. There are plenty of consumer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headsets</a> in the industry that do not cost an arm and leg, but Apple decided to launch a $3,500 headset for its first iteration of a new device in this category, priced well beyond what an average consumer might pay.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dNhxa3KRfjRfNt5ZJdBeb3" name="Apple-Vision-Pro-Viva-Tech-demo.jpg" alt="Using the Apple Vision Pro at Viva Tech 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dNhxa3KRfjRfNt5ZJdBeb3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, Hoyos, Howe, and Mar all make interesting points. While I am incredibly bored with the Apple ecosystem and its lack of ingenuity with newer phones, I am intrigued by Apple potentially releasing a foldable. </p><p>Still, I haven’t been excited about an iPhone for a while now, and I’ve asked myself the same question: would I switch if Apple released a foldable?</p><p>No. </p><p>Meanwhile, I have been <em>very </em>excited about the Android foldable ecosystem. So perhaps it’s time for me to officially switch over to Android-based devices permanently. I’ll leave that story for another time. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung has updated Quick Share for Galaxy devices, doubling the daily file-sharing limit for QR codes and links.</li><li>For remote sharing via web links or QR codes, the limit was 5GB per file and 5GB total per day, but this is now increased to 10GB per file and 10GB total per day.</li><li>The update improves user experience with clearer device names and total file size info in transfer pop-ups.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has rolled out a new update for the Quick Share app, doubling the daily file-sharing limit for the QR code and link options.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Quick Share is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-nearby-share-your-android-phone">handy app that makes it super easy to transfer files</a> between nearby Android devices and Windows computers. And there&apos;s no limit on how many files you can send or how big they are, giving you complete freedom to share as much as you need.</p><p>Meanwhile, if you need to send files to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> or Windows devices that aren&apos;t close by or in your contacts, Quick Share lets you do so via web links or QR codes. Keep in mind, though, that each file can&apos;t be bigger than 5GB, and you can only transfer up to 5GB in total per day using this method.</p><p>Starting this week, Samsung is doubling the daily transfer limit to 10GB and increasing the individual file size limit to 10GB. This update was first spotted and shared by @theonecid on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-quick-share-file-transfer-limit-increased-10gb/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p>

<p>This increase will definitely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-19-1pm-et-quick-share-becomes-a-true-airdrop-alternative-with-support-for-all-android-and-chrome-os-devices">make sharing large files easier and improve the overall user experience</a>. It&apos;s a game-changer, in particular, for anyone dealing with large files. It’s a big win for pros in graphic design, video editing, and photography, making their work much more efficient and convenient.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:868px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:86.41%;"><img id="JbEqhBZ6dpNY3x3nvuR4Ej" name="samsung-quick-share-update-log.jpg" alt="Quick Share update log" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JbEqhBZ6dpNY3x3nvuR4Ej.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="868" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @theonecid / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update further improves the user experience with clearer device identification, showing device names on two lines for nearby devices. Plus, the incoming file transfer pop-up now shows the total file size, so you know exactly what’s coming in.</p><p>The latest Quick Share update, version 13.6.51.13, is now live on the Galaxy Store. Samsung says it’s rolling out gradually but should be available to everyone in the next few days.</p>

<hr>
<p>The leaks keep pouring in for Google’s next Pixel lineup, and the latest one gives us a real-life look at the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>As Google’s big August 13 launch event gets closer, the mystery around its new products is pretty much gone. Tons of leaks have flooded in, giving us all the details about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series, including that long-rumored foldable phone.</p><p>Most recently, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has reportedly been seen in action at a Starbucks in Taiwan, and the sighting was shared with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-pro-fold-leak-starbucks-3467562/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. It seems the phone was in one of the official cases Google plans to release with it, sporting the familiar "G" logo that we&apos;ve come to associate with Pixel devices.</p><p>The person using the device had it propped up on a stand, showing off the rear panel to the camera. Even with the case on, the unique design of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was unmistakable, making it clear what device it was.</p><p>The device itself is dressed in a sleek Obsidian black, one of the expected color options for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The case, in contrast, sports a Porcelain finish. These color choices match the rumors we’ve been hearing.</p><p>As seen in the picture, the phone flaunts the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-confirms-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-real-in-official-tease">quirky camera setup and sleek curved front display we’ve seen in official teasers</a> and leaks, and it’s impressively slim. The camera bump isn&apos;t as noticeable as we thought, probably thanks to the case it&apos;s in.</p>

<p>The original Pixel Fold was a solid first try, but it had its hiccups like any new piece of hardware. Naturally, expectations for the next version are through the roof. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold could shake up the market, going head-to-head with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">leading foldable phones</a>.</p><p>We&apos;ll have to wait for the full reveal to make a final call, but from the looks of it, it&apos;s already shaping up to be a strong competitor.</p>

<ul><li>Telegram updates its in-app browser, brings a new bottom bar while browsing, and adds features like support to Web3.</li><li>The messaging platform further added a new "Apps" tab in search to find its popular mini apps.</li><li>Other nifty additions are also seen for the Stories feature as part of the new update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Telegram has rolled out a major update to its messaging platform that introduces several new features, such as an in-app browser with Web3 support and a mini app store.</p><p>New updates to the in-app browser include the ability to collapse and reopen with a new bottom bar. The goal is to make navigating the app as easy as possible while also preserving browser content. For example, if a user receives a notification while reading in the browser, they can respond without losing their place. The browser also supports features such as instant article viewing and bookmarking.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://telegram.org/file/400780400224/2/jqbHSFRXZfQ.7339277.mp4/b9a5db90c5ecf53405" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://telegram.org/file/400780400224/2/jqbHSFRXZfQ.7339277.mp4/b9a5db90c5ecf53405"></video></div>
<p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://telegram.org/blog/w3-browser-mini-app-store">announcement post</a>, the company notes that the browser will also support decentralized websites hosted on TON (The Open Network), an in-house developed open internet. It further makes Web3 accessible to around one billion monthly users on the messaging platform.</p><p>Another interesting feature of the new update is the Mini App Store. Telegram says that out of its 950 million users, at least 500 million interact with mini-apps every month. To complement them, Telegram is now adding a new "Apps" tab in the Search section, showcasing the list of apps users use alongside the popular apps available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging platform</a>. It further allows users to quickly access games and services, which is in addition to finding something new to play around with.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://telegram.org/file/400780400928/1/bb7CeIf11Es.6604686.mp4/ea45ba121b84766f1d" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://telegram.org/file/400780400928/1/bb7CeIf11Es.6604686.mp4/ea45ba121b84766f1d"></video></div>
<p>For app developers, Telegram allows them to upload "video demos and screenshots" of their mini-app previews to give platform users what to expect from the respective app. </p><p>"Mini apps can now generate custom story content—like AI-generated videos, achievements, or snapshots of leaderboards—for users to share as a Telegram Story right from the mini app."</p><p>Telegram Stars is another fun way to interact with friends on the messaging app. With this update, users will be able to gift stars to their contacts, with which the recipients can purchase digital goods in mini apps or have access to paid content in select channels. Users can head to Settings> My Stars to see their stars.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://telegram.org/file/400780400676/1/yDZoLCZ9bKQ.3403169.mp4/6e2b8eca9d3a23cc64" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://telegram.org/file/400780400676/1/yDZoLCZ9bKQ.3403169.mp4/6e2b8eca9d3a23cc64"></video></div>
<p>Suppose you often record video messages on the Telegram app. In that case, the messaging service will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://telegram.org/file/400780400798/1/VgYgplyJ3G4.6475691.mp4/be34647913f92219f7">allow users to use</a> their front flash. This means the display lights up with a white screen, giving users extra light when recording in the dark.</p><p>Lastly, other nifty additions in the latest update include adding a new weather widget in Telegram Stories and giving a thumbnail for a video story, which Telegram calls it cover photo.</p><p>Telegram says these new updates, along with the mobile, are also available on the Mac OS, especially the new browser next to games, mini-apps, instant view pages, and access to Web3.</p>

<p>This 65-inch Amazon Fire TV is $300 off at Amazon right now, offering a great QLED display at an overall 40% discount. While it only features a 60Hz refresh rate, it also includes Motion Rate 240 technology that's helpful for gaming and fast-paced movies. Plus, users of Alexa and other Fire tech will appreciate this smart TV's ease of use, and its built-in streaming and entertainment apps.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-65-Inch-Class-Smart-65U6HF/dp/B0CHJ87V95" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1bf3ad07-4645-42e4-ae29-bf6a1c05a92c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$749.99" data-dimension48="$749.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a midrange QLED TV; you want a TV with several different input ports; you like a TV designed with minimal bezel.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;d rather go with a TV that&apos;s even more affordable; you&apos;d prefer something other than a Fire TV.</p><p>This Hisense 65-inch ULED TV features a built-in Fire TV interface with easy access to Alexa, as well as streaming apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Max and more. QLED technology offers a richer, brighter, and higher-contrast look than some OLED TVs can offer, which is why some say they&apos;re becoming the top-tier tech in the industry. This particular TV features four HDMI ports, though since you can access streaming apps directly from the TV itself, this and all Fire TVs kind of negate the need for an extra streaming or cable box.</p><p>While some may find a 60Hz refresh rate to be one of the limitations of this TV, the useful Motion 240 feature keeps it looking smooth when gaming or watching fast-paced content. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/xiaomi-hisense-amazon-fire-tvs">Hisense also switched from Android TV to the Amazon Fire TV OS</a> a couple of years ago, which many Amazon smart home users appreciated.</p>

<p>No normal person would walk up to Noah Lyles or Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and challenge them to a grudge match. It&apos;s obvious how fast and talented Olympic track and field athletes are, even compared to dedicated amateur athletes. But I still decided to "race" Olympians at my local track, and I have no regrets.</p><p>No, I don&apos;t have delusions of grandeur like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/sports/table-tennis-anthony-edwards.html">people who challenge table tennis Olympians</a> to matches and can&apos;t win a single point. But the way they film track events somehow feels so removed from reality. The camera floats far enough away that it looks like runners are <em>gliding</em> down their lanes, their forms so effortless. And the superstars make the non-qualifying runners look much slower than they are.</p><p>My new tradition around every Olympics or World Athletics Championship is to challenge the best athletes in the world and see how long I last, with a healthy dose of cheating. It&apos;s my personal equivalent to Leslie Jones trying to match Simone Biles with her living room floor routine.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gotta clear space for that gold medal, baby! I’m coming for you, Paris. With a little help from @Google Gemini.  #Google_Ad pic.twitter.com/nveuW1Enrk<a href="https://twitter.com/Lesdoggg/status/1817757783485546973">July 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Here&apos;s a fun example: I couldn&apos;t jump hurdles when I was a fit high schooler and would die trying today. But could I beat McLaughlin in the 400m if they forgot to put hurdles in my lane? Hah, no: her world record is about 51 seconds. Even with my recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max sprint training</a>, my current lap ceiling is about 70 seconds. </p><p>I tried anyway! I went to my local track, did a quick warm-up, and pushed myself harder than I had in a long time. I ended up hitting my fastest lap time since my high school days.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCGzmLOEePE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>My fastest-ever marathon is about twice as slow as Eliud Kipchoge ran the 2021 Tokyo Marathon to win gold. But when the Paris Marathon starts on August 10, how long could I keep up with the future gold medalist? Assuming he runs it at Kipchoge&apos;s 2:08 standard, I&apos;d need to maintain a 4:55/mile pace. </p><p>So what did I do? I set up a workout on my Garmin Forerunner 965 with a 5:00/mile pace and an undetermined duration, and after warming up, I started sprinting around my local track, seeing how long I&apos;d last! I ended up lasting two laps before I had to stop.</p><p>Of course, I&apos;m not just focusing on household names and medalists. I like watching the Olympic trial events, waiting for the final time summary, and writing down the <em>slowest</em> runner&apos;s time. That runner failed to qualify and typically looks downright lethargic on TV compared to the medalists; then you try racing that inadequate time and realize how keeping pace with this failed Olympian would be an impossible nightmare after a couple of minutes.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hz9Z7A2UA68" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Still, I was particularly inspired on Friday watching fellow Californian Grant Fisher score bronze in an epic Men&apos;s 10,000m final at 26:43, within half a second of Cheptegei&apos;s Olympic record. </p><p>I already know that&apos;s not a time I could ever reasonably approach, short of living at altitude, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/tech-and-apps-i-used-to-lose-30-pounds">losing a bunch more weight</a>, and dedicating my life to running. But that&apos;s not the point of this little game of mine.</p><p>I haven&apos;t run at a 1:04-lap pace in over a decade, though I could at least keep it up for 200m. Then I paused my workout — I imagined yelling at Fisher to pause the race for a minute while the Parisian crowd booed me — before running the second lap leg. Eventually, I plan to maintain that pace for longer.</p>
<p>And <em>that&apos;s</em> the point of this aspirational, delusional Olympic training. Outside of paid races, running is a lonely sport, and it&apos;s hard to stay motivated when your only goal is to "run fast." But if I have a concrete goal like "keep up with Grant Fisher for just <strong>one</strong> lap out of 25 laps," that makes my weekly anaerobic workouts that much more enjoyable.</p><p>Most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> have robust workout-building tools and Track Run modes, so it should be easy for you to create a challenging run for yourself. Then let yourself pause the workout whenever you need to, and then push to beat* your favorite athlete at their own game.</p>

<p>I&apos;m hyper-fixated on running, not just because I run constantly but because it feels more accessible than most Olympic events. You don&apos;t need special equipment, a particular place to train, or a challenging opponent, just a good pair of shoes, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watch</a>, and determination. </p><p>But my silly Olympic challenge could apply to anyone&apos;s favorite sport. You could try to swim 50 meters in your local YMCA pool and see how close you come to Katie Ledecky&apos;s pace for her 1,500m gold (about 30 seconds per split). You could go to your local archery range, dive at the public pool, find your local trampoline park to see if you have any flips in you, join a boxing gym, or even try some break-dancing!</p>

<p>What matters more than the specific sport or your current abilities compared to superstar Olympians is that you use this event as both inspiration and a reality check.</p><p>I find watching Olympic running so much more enjoyable knowing that winded, painful feeling in my chest when I&apos;m pumping to finish strong on the final lap straightaway. I can feel in my body what it&apos;s like to run <em>that</em> fast, and I imagine a future where if I train hard enough, I can capture that feeling of running past my limits, even if only for a short while.</p><p>That&apos;s why I think everyone should try challenging an Olympian once in a while. Not because you have any chance of winning but because it&apos;ll inspire you to push harder than you ever could on your own. </p><p>And having seen endless armchair criticism on social media from fans mocking or attacking any athlete who doesn&apos;t win gold, I think some of you could stand to learn a little humility, as well.</p>

<p>All eyes are on the Pixel 9 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-confirms-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-real-in-official-tease">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, which are going to debut at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">Made by Google event</a> next month. However, we could see a long-overdue revamp of Google&apos;s smart home offerings at the event as well. A recent leak by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1817682764595970361" target="_blank">Arsène Lupin on X (formerly Twitter)</a> reveals a ton of information about a Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen). It would be the most expensive Nest thermostat ever, with a rumored $279 starting price. </p><p>The leak seems to be credible as it includes what looks to be official marketing and product images. It even includes a breakdown of how the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen) compares to the existing Nest Thermostat. While both devices can be controlled remotely with the Google Home app, that&apos;s about where the differences end. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/vysHee05Kh<a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryLupin/status/1817682770144920057">July 28, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The highlight of this rumored refresh is a design overhaul that will make the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen) a more premium product. There&apos;s a new borderless, high-resolution display that looks stunning in the leaked images. In fact, it looks quite like a blown-up Pixel Watch, and that&apos;s not a bad thing. The thermostat also features a stainless steel chassis, making it more attractive than the design of the Nest Learning Thermostat (3rd gen) and the standard Nest Thermostat.</p><p>There are plenty of new software features, too. The Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen) will offer a customizable home screen, so you can adjust the appearance of your digital display to your liking. The chart mentions a new feature called Dynamic Farsight that requires the Google Home app, and is presumably an iteration of the current Farsight functionality, which lets you see information at a glance.</p><p>Additionally, energy savings is once again a key selling point of the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen). The product materials reference Adaptive Eco mode and Smart Schedules, both of which will help reduce power draw. There&apos;s also a System Health Monitor that could help you figure out if there is a problem with your heating or cooling systems. It&apos;ll work with Matter, too, as the unified smart home standard continues to grow and be adopted by manufacturers. </p>

<p>In the box, the images suggest you&apos;ll get a Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen), a trim plate, a thermostat base, a steel plate, a Nest Temperature Sensor (2nd gen), and mounting screws and wiring labels. </p><p>Overall, if this is the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen), it looks like a pretty compelling upgrade. The redesign matches modern design trends and looks excellent, and there are new features as well. The only sticking point may be the $279 starting price, but the current Nest Learning Thermostat (3rd gen) retails for $250 at full price. </p><p>It&apos;s only a $30 increase over the existing model, but I&apos;ll be curious to see what sales and discounts will be available for the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen). You can pick up a Nest Learning Thermostat (3rd gen) for $170 right now, which is competitive. But it&apos;s important to remember that the Nest Learning Thermostat (3rd gen) is already almost a decade old. I suspect people invested in the Nest ecosystem will be happy to see a new Nest Learning Thermostat at all, and won&apos;t get hung up on the pricing. </p>

<p>This leak only covers the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen), but I hope it&apos;s a preview of what could be coming at the Made by Google event next month. The entire Nest lineup has been neglected for the past few years, and it&apos;s time to change that. Sure, the Nest Learning Thermostat (3rd gen) — which first released in 2015 — is one of the oldest products in the lineup, but it&apos;s not the only one to show its age. </p><p>In particular, I&apos;d like to see Google update the Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max. The Nest Hub (2nd gen) released in 2021, and the Nest Hub Max was released in 2019. You might think that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> replaces both devices, but that certainly isn&apos;t the case. It&apos;s too expensive to <em>just</em> serve as a smart display — you need to make use of its tablet functionality to make it worthwhile. Plus, it&apos;s much harder to deck out your home with Pixel Tablet(s) than it is with Nest Hub(s) for a reasonable price. </p><p>It doesn&apos;t get better when you look at the Google Home and Google Home Mini. They were released in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Though they&apos;re cheap, that doesn&apos;t make up for their aging hardware and feature set. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-audio-review">Nest Audio</a> is a few years old, too. Up and down the Nest lineup, there are more products that need an update badly than there are ones that do not. </p><p>So, here&apos;s to hoping the Made by Google event brings a long-overdue refresh to the entire Nest lineup. If new products are announced, Google might be competitive in the smart home space again.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>On Thursday, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25023542-appeals-decision-blocking-fcc-reclassification-on-broadband">blocked the FCC&apos;s Title II reclassification of broadband services</a>, calling it "a major question requiring clear congressional authorization." </p><p>That&apos;s the news. The FCC had previously decided in early 2024 that broadband internet providers should be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/why-net-neutrality-is-so-important">classified as common carriers</a> like telephone providers (this has been flopped back and forth since 2005). Providers did not like the ruling and sought to have the decision blocked before it could come into effect. The 6th Circuit Court obliged in June, saying more time and input were needed to decide the merits of the appeal. This week, it was decided it didn&apos;t need that much time, and input wasn&apos;t needed after all, at least not immediately.</p><p>Nobody should be surprised that an appeals court made a decision without hearing oral arguments from one side because that&apos;s how America works. William Churchill once said, "Politics is not a game. It is an earnest business." Truer words were never spoken.</p>
<p>You have a side. I have a side. Everyone has to pick a side. Here&apos;s something to consider: neither side is right because laws are meant to serve the best interests of everyone. In a perfect world, partisan politics and lobbying efforts would be tossed aside while both sides worked together in the court to do what&apos;s best for all of us.</p><p>In the real world, telecom providers went to a partisan court with a request to help them. It&apos;s also an election year, which is likely why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-court-blocks-biden-administration-net-neutrality-rules-2024-08-01/#:~:text=The%20Sixth%20Circuit%20U.S.%20Court,effort%20to%20reinstate%20the%20rules.">oral arguments have been scheduled</a> for late October or early November—just ahead of the election—and blocking these changes hurts one side. Maybe the ruling is correct, and the FCC has no authority, and telecom providers should not have to follow these rules. Maybe not. I don&apos;t know because I&apos;m not a legal expert on this matter, and I was not allowed to listen to legal experts give any arguments on the matter, as was originally decided.</p>
<h2 id="regardless-of-what-side-you-apos-re-on-you-should-be-upset-2">Regardless of what side you&apos;re on, you should be upset</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="J2SRsSq6FRDrxy3LU7kfVg" name="congress-7srp.jpg" alt="Congress" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J2SRsSq6FRDrxy3LU7kfVg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1365" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Louis Velazquez)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I do know is that I&apos;m distrustful, and you should be too. If not for this decision, pick one you disagree with and distrust that one instead. That&apos;s a problem.</p><p>Here&apos;s what I see: a decision that favored one side was made. A group of judges heavily skewed toward the other side has blocked that decision, saying we need to know more. Now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/02/harris-becomes-democratic-nominee/" target="_blank">Harris&apos; official nomination</a> has given <em>both</em> sides signs of life in the upcoming presidential election, knowing more isn&apos;t required, and it&apos;s just blocked for now. That&apos;ll show &apos;em.</p><p>I don&apos;t give a damn which side you&apos;re on, and you shouldn&apos;t give a damn which side I&apos;m on. You should be upset over what looks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/fccs-net-neutrality-rules-blocked-by-sixth-circuit-judges">obvious partisan politics</a> interfering with a decision that is supposed to benefit us all.</p>
<p>Our government can not make everyone happy because that&apos;s impossible when we are so divided. What it can do is be transparent. In this case, we deserve to hear why the FCC&apos;s rules were good for us and why they were not. This issue affects us all. It is about our ability to be informed and how much it will hurt our wallets. Your side deserves a chance to convince people on the other side.</p><p>Ideally, we wouldn&apos;t be at each other&apos;s throats about everything. I shouldn&apos;t care if you don&apos;t like gay people as long as you don&apos;t infringe on their rights. I also shouldn&apos;t care if you don&apos;t want to bake them a damn cake because you don&apos;t support them. Nobody at any level of government should be trying to make me care, and news providers should differentiate between news and opinion.</p>

<p>I&apos;ll do that again — the news is that the 6th Circuit has temporarily blocked the FCC reclassification of broadband providers, often called net neutrality.</p>
<p>My <strong>opinion</strong> is that it&apos;s all bullshit, and it looks like it was done to appease one bunch of loonies and defeat the other bunch of loonies. This happens when you let loonies appoint judges to lifetime appointments while having mechanisms in place to block those appointments until it&apos;s convenient for your side.</p>
<p>I try to stay out of politics because I hate dealing with lunatics. One side isn&apos;t going to agree with me. Respectful disagreement is cool, but unhinged lunacy is never far behind. I have better things to do than read the crap some internet asshole furiously shits out to share with everyone.</p><p>This time I&apos;ll make an exception, and I want to piss <strong>everyone</strong> off. Your side sucks. My side sucks. We should want to make individual decisions and not follow party lines so much, regardless of why we are told we need to do it. Net neutrality means your internet provider is gonna charge you more. It also means you&apos;re going to have better access to information and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">entertainment</a> without some mega-corporation deciding to screw it up. You didn&apos;t get to hear more from either party in this appeal.</p><p>You <strong>can</strong> ignore your side and think about what&apos;s right for you. So do it.</p>

Tech is cool like that and average things today were incredible just a few years ago.</p><p>Do we <em>really</em> know how to use that camera? I don&apos;t mean knowing what all the settings and buttons can do; I mean having a handle on where and when we can film without any repercussions. I thought I did, but I had a lot to learn, and I recently learned more about public photography and privacy in one day than in 15 years of covering tech.</p>

<p>You might have seen videos from "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_audit">First Amendment Auditors</a>" on YouTube or TikTok — I spent an uncomfortable day at the post office with a group of them.</p><p>If you&apos;re not familiar with the term, First Amendment Auditors use their camera to exercise their First Amendment rights by taking video in public spaces like sidewalks, post offices, or other government spaces. I won&apos;t say anything about any agenda they may have because they each have their platform to explain themselves. I will say that they are very knowledgeable of the laws surrounding public photography, and most of us have a lot to learn about the whole mess they create. Some of them, like one of the people at this particular outing, are also in law school and know <em>exactly</em> what they can and can&apos;t do.</p>
<p>I was there just to observe because I was curious. I parked myself off to the side <em>without</em> my phone camera in my hands to see how people reacted to what surely felt like an invasion of their privacy. What I learned is that the rules and laws can confuse us because there&apos;s a difference between what is legal and what is right.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3153px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.90%;"><img id="DDYZqXhJYtnNkTSPaj9LF8" name="mailbox.JPG" alt="A Spongebob mailbox" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DDYZqXhJYtnNkTSPaj9LF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3153" height="1794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>This article is going to be about rules and laws in the United States</strong>. Nothing here applies anywhere else, and if you&apos;re curious about filming in your country, I recommend you find a similar article written by someone more local with more knowledge. </p><p>In general, in the United States, if I am in a place I am allowed to be and can see it with my eyes, I can also photograph it. This is covered under <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/">the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution</a>:</p><p><em>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</em></p>
<p>The freedom of the press portion is why this applies to people with cameras at the Post office. There is no such thing as a press pass under the law; we are all journalists with the ability and right to gather and distribute information and the powerful camera in our phone makes it easy to do. It&apos;s a good thing, and like all good things is easy to abuse.</p><p>The confusion comes from our perceptions of privacy. When out in public, you have zero reasonable expectations of privacy. That means people will see you, will see what you are doing, and will film you doing it if they desire.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1170px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.17%;"><img id="g6MGRjjbWMDgmCZytfBmn5" name="arlo-video-doorbell-lifestyle-3.jpg" alt="Arlo Video Doorbell Lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g6MGRjjbWMDgmCZytfBmn5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1170" height="470" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Arlo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You are filmed every day you leave your house. Consumer products like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ring-video-doorbell-4-review">video doorbells</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/its-impossible-to-review-security-cameras-in-the-age-of-breaches-and-ransomware">security cameras</a> are filming you, cameras are mounted on the outside of the grocery store or the gas station, and even cars film you as they drive by. Cameras are also inside the places you visit and in some states can also record audio.</p><p>First Amendment Auditors often remind you of this and tell you that you have no right to privacy. They&apos;re correct — the Bill of Rights offers us privacy protections from the government (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/">Fourth</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/">Fifth</a> Amendments) but not from ourselves. You might hate this — I do — but feelings aren&apos;t laws. If we had a right to privacy and filming us required some sort of permission or a signed release, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/can-sentry-mode-record-continuously.294436/">Elon Musk would be in jail</a>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, there are nuances to public filming laws. In some cases, intent matters; if you take creepy shots of underage girls and then post them to the internet, you probably will get in trouble (thankfully) because of your intent. But if you take photos and videos of underage girls sitting on a bench and share them as news with no ill intent, you&apos;re not breaking the law. Wiretapping laws and things like two-party consent can also matter for filming inside businesses, even if it&apos;s the business owner doing the filming.</p><p>In the U.S., states can afford us more rights than the Constitution provides, and things like using a long pole to film over a fence or flying a drone into someone&apos;s backyard can be illegal. Unless you&apos;re afforded these special rights by the state, it&apos;s really trivial to film you almost anywhere.</p>
<p>First Amendment Auditors know about these nuances and take the time to learn the laws before they go somewhere to practice their rights. If there is any question about the law, an attorney will be promptly consulted. I&apos;m sure what they are doing is lucrative and profitable, so it&apos;s worth the costs to push the envelope.</p><p>I&apos;m going to assume that most of us aren&apos;t really interested in traveling the U.S. to film post offices or the DMV and just want to use our cameras to take great pics and videos of the things around us. We still need to understand where and when we can do it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="4yqBQ8Z9sspt68aFHzTPDC" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-versus-camera-sample-4.jpg" alt="A crowd in a building" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4yqBQ8Z9sspt68aFHzTPDC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That gets a little dicey when it comes to those odd encounters that can happen. If we see people in conflict situations or polar bears chasing penguins, we naturally want to film it. We&apos;re wired that way and people love a spectacle. It&apos;s why entities like TMZ exist.</p><p>You should definitely know the exact laws about photography in the location where you want to use a camera, but some general rules are easy to remember and <em>usually</em> apply.</p>
<h2 id="defining-quot-public-quot-and-quot-intent-quot-can-be-tricky-2">Defining "public" and "intent" can be tricky</h2>
<p><strong>Public means a few different things</strong>. Some places, like the sidewalk, are public. You can be there, and you can film anything your eyes (or a telephoto lens) can see. Other places, like government buildings, have publicly accessible spaces like lobbies where you can film, and other places aren&apos;t publicly accessible.</p><p>Things can be interesting when <strong>public and private intersect</strong>. Walmart is a private business that is open to the public. You&apos;re not breaking any laws if you film someone acting a fool in Walmart, but Walmart <em>can</em> ask you to stop, just like you <em>can</em> say no because using your camera is not against the law, just Walmart&apos;s policy. In turn, Walmart can ask you to leave their private business, and if you don&apos;t, law enforcement will become involved in escorting you out and serving you with a trespass notice.</p>
<p><strong>Intent is a complicated concept</strong> that usually requires a judge or jury to decide. I have a real-life example where intent decided the outcome. At a music festival, I noticed a man using his phone to film a friend breastfeeding her child. I confronted him, lost my temper, and knocked his phone out of his hand, damaging it.</p><p>I was cited for assault and battery, and he was cited for harassment. County attorneys declined to file charges against me, but I was forced to reimburse him for his damaged property. No charges were filed against him because breastfeeding is a "natural and wholesome activity" (I agree), and ill intent could not be proven. Taking photos of women at the beach, little kids at the playground, or a mother breastfeeding her child is not illegal unless the photos or video are used in a "bad" way.</p><p>I&apos;d do it again, but I would know I was in the wrong for doing it unless I could prove he had bad intentions.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-you-do-if-you-apos-re-being-filmed-2">What can you do if you&apos;re being filmed?</h2>
<p>Another thing to consider is what you can do if you&apos;re the one being filmed. You may have no right to privacy but you have the right to try and create it. That means stupid things like never leaving your house or wearing a disguise while out in public, but it also means being aware of your surroundings and taking precautions.</p><p><strong>It is legal for me to take a video of you entering your PIN at an ATM as long as I am where I am allowed to be</strong>. Doing something illegal with that information is different than witnessing it. This sucks because it <em>shouldn&apos;t</em> be legal, but it is. This also applies to someone getting in close to see what&apos;s on your phone&apos;s screen while you&apos;re using it to put in your password somewhere or if you&apos;re messaging someone. Keep this in mind and protect your privacy in case someone is invading it. Those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ferilinso-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Accessories/dp/B0CNRLPVFN?th=1">privacy screen protectors</a> can help, but being aware of what&apos;s around you is the best way to safeguard your privacy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj" name="Google-Messages-iMessage-green-bubble.jpg" alt="Google Messages on an Android phone and iMessage on an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You also need to know that in many places, you can not interfere with someone "exercising their First Amendment rights" by filming. Harassing them or otherwise impeding their filming can get you a charge. As much as you might hate this idea — I certainly do — a person with a camera has the same rights afforded to them as you do.</p><p>You also do not have to sign any form of release for someone to take photos or video of you unless it&apos;s being used for commercial purposes. That means I do need your permission to use you in a commercial or to endorse a product on TikTok. <strong>I do not need your permission</strong> to post monetized videos on social platforms if you&apos;re in them.</p>
<p><strong>The most important thing is to be respectful to each other</strong>. You can&apos;t stop me from filming you while you&apos;re at the post office or sitting at a sidewalk table eating lunch. The <em>best</em> thing that could happen is for me to be respectful and to stop filming you. The next best thing is for you to ignore me or to leave without causing a problem. It&apos;s tempting to yell at or do something even worse, but it&apos;s unwise — it could lead to legal troubles or just make you look unhinged on social media.</p><p>It might sound like I hate those guys at the post office taking videos of everyone, but I don&apos;t. I love what they have the right to do, but I dislike the way they go about doing it. I also understand that rights can be uncomfortable, and while I wasn&apos;t taking videos or spouting off laws and Constitutional Amendments, nobody wanted to see me in the corner associating with "those guys," and I felt bad doing it. </p><p>Knowing "the rules" when it comes to using your phone&apos;s camera is important. You should be able to film important things, and you get to decide what is important to you. You also don&apos;t want to end up in the back of a patrol car because you weren&apos;t aware of the laws themselves. </p><p>But maybe we should also consider how others feel when it comes to whipping out your camera.</p>

While you might expect the "Plus" to mean there&apos;s a larger display, it actually refers to the spec bump provided by the new MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro. The phone also comes standard with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, the upper configurations of the original Nothing Phone 2a.</p><p>Otherwise, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus is nearly identical to its non-Plus sibling, including the toned down Glyph lights on the back, dual 50MP cameras, and 6.7-inch OLED display. One notable upgrade is the 50MP selfie camera, up from 32MP.</p><p>The Plus side (pun intended) is that the phone only costs $399, which could make it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">best Android phones under $400</a>. The downside is that interested buyers in the United States need to purchase the device through a beta program, just like with the Nothing Phone 2a.</p>

According to 9to5Google, who spotted the feature, users can access Drag to Search by clicking the Lens icon in the address bar of their desktop Chrome browser. They&apos;ll then select something on the screen by moving the cursor to highlight the area. Once selected, a side panel will appear with your search results.</p><p>Drag to Search is appearing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-your-software-channel-chrome-os">Chrome beta channels</a>, including Chrome 128.

Instead, we got reports that it has likely been delayed as Samsung works out the kinks in the software (but isn&apos;t that what a beta is all about?).</p><p>Based on leaks and rumors, One UI 7 will reportedly see quite a refresh, adopting some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-one-ui-7-might-take-a-big-page-out-of-apples-ios-playbook">iOS-like cues</a>, particularly when it comes to the app icons and quick settings panel. Apparently, Samsung plans to separate the quick settings panel and notification shade, a move similar to Apple and other Android OEMs (Motorola has even done this with its new Hello UX).</p><p>It&apos;s not clear when we&apos;ll see the beta arrive on Samsung phones, but with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-beta-4-1">Android 15 beta</a> on its last leg and the Made by Google event around the corner, hopefully Samsung can get it together sooner rather than later.</p>

While the Pixel 9 series gets fun colors like Rose, Hazel, and Mint, it looks like the 9 Pro Fold may be limited to Obsidian and Porcelain, just like the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:603px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.50%;"><img id="QtdskMvTgry3By4E4K9brm" name="google-pixel-watch-3-leaked-comparison-photo.jpg" alt="A leaked comparison image of the Pixel Watch 3 and the Pixel Watch 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QtdskMvTgry3By4E4K9brm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="603" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to the Pixel smartphone colors, we also got a look at some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> specs and features. Apparently, the watch will have a much brighter display at 2,000 nits and faster charging than before, although battery life appears to be about the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>.</p><p>It also looks like you&apos;ll be able to view your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-review">Nest Doorbell</a> live feed straight from your watch, and there will apparently be some advanced running metrics, including something called "Cardio Load." It sounds like Google is setting its sights on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">best running watches</a> with the Pixel Watch 3, but with the battery life claims, it may still fall short.</p>

<p>Lastly, we got a look at what appears to be a new Google TV streaming device, aptly named "Google TV Streamer." Aside from the rather creative name, the device looks like a drastic change from the Chromecast with Google TV dongles, adopting a slim set-top box design. And while we don&apos;t know much about the device like power and storage, the remote is also receiving some changes with button placement, including a new mute button and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tvs-magic-button-debuts-launching-any-app-of-your-choice">Magic button</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when this device will launch, but given the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">Made by Google event</a> is happening on August 13, it seems likely it may appear on or around that time.</p>
