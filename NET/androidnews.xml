                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I used to take my Walkman (a WM-GX100) everywhere in my pre-teen years; it was just cool to be able to listen to music on the go, and I was attached to that thing — most of my vacation photos from that era had me rocking that Walkman. </p><p>When Sony&apos;s Discman became accessible a few years later, I switched over to those models. I ended up buying a few dozen cassettes (mostly alt rock), but the collection wasn&apos;t anywhere as extensive as my CD catalog, and I haven&apos;t paid any attention to them for the better part of two decades.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DtfoHVJC7G8yc8v7Gvsg8B" name="fiio-cp13-9.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player's design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DtfoHVJC7G8yc8v7Gvsg8B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These days, I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/roon-has-transformed-how-i-listen-to-music">Roon to stream my lossless music library</a> throughout the house, and I don&apos;t really use any analog media. But with a resurgence in retro tech, audio manufacturers are once again catering to this niche, and when Fiio said it was making a cassette player, I was interested.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8eWERitfU3jJDQHa9W7xt9" name="fiio-cp13-5.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player with cassettes next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8eWERitfU3jJDQHa9W7xt9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The CP13 is aimed squarely at users who have an existing cassette collection and want a reliable way of playing them back. Fiio says it wanted to faithfully recreate the look and feel of an analog device, and as such, it doesn&apos;t have Bluetooth connectivity or any other extras.</p>

<p>That said, you get some niceties: there&apos;s a built-in 1800mAh battery, and it charges over USB-C. The CP13 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Portable-Cassette-Earphone-Ultra-Low/dp/B0CYP26K5T">now available for $109 at Amazon</a>, and it is sold in interesting color options: Red and Silver, Sky Blue, White and Black (what I&apos;m using), and a Transparent model that looks amazing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qsibfC3MSi9Xh2GEtiFD3D" name="fiio-cp13-14.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player with Meteora next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qsibfC3MSi9Xh2GEtiFD3D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let&apos;s start with the positives: Fiio did an outstanding job with the design of the CP13, and the aluminum chassis means it is highly durable. The unit is smaller than Walkmans of yesteryear, and the design is on the minimalist side; I almost missed all the extraneous logos and branding that was a mainstay on all &apos;90s cassette players.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Bxm7dCgBE2umFPeDDwKsnB" name="fiio-cp13-7.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player's controls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bxm7dCgBE2umFPeDDwKsnB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The CP13 just has Fiio branding at the front and back, four buttons on the left — play, rewind, forward, and stop — and a volume knob along with 3.5mm jack and USB-C port at the top. You get a knurled texture to the volume knob that makes it easy to access, and the playback buttons have good tactility. There&apos;s a see-through window that lets you view the cassette, and there&apos;s a screen protector bundled in the box that can be installed over the glass pane.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qNcEKDu2RhNHnorTs7SqoA" name="fiio-cp13-8.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player's lid indent" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qNcEKDu2RhNHnorTs7SqoA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only issue I have with the design is that the lid is a bit difficult to open. Fiio added an intent to one side, but ideally, it should have added the same on the other side as well — as it is, it takes a decent amount of force to open the lid. That said, there are no issues with the build quality whatsoever.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S3itWuCFigo3Gbab5kfs8C" name="fiio-cp13-12.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player's cassette head" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S3itWuCFigo3Gbab5kfs8C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Using the CP13 couldn&apos;t be easier; just slot in a cassette, and hit the play button. The cassette player works with all cassette types, has a higher voltage 4.2V motor, and uses an entirely analog audio chain. The JRC5532 op amp has enough power to drive just about any headset, and I used the CP13 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">Fiio FT5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie600-long-term-review">Sennheiser IE600</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SZVXYgb2LUKUUywYHojUtD" name="fiio-cp13-18.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player plugged in to Fiio FT5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SZVXYgb2LUKUUywYHojUtD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, it tends to vary significantly based on the recording itself. I listened to my early 2000s collection of nu metal and alt rock, and while the overall quality isn&apos;t as refined, there is an undeniable charm to analog media. The digital rendition of Meteora in my collection sounds noticeably better, but it isn&apos;t as much <em>fun </em>as listening to the cassette.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QQ3N5oXzJEisuC7poHGoDE" name="fiio-cp13-17.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player with Meteora artwork next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QQ3N5oXzJEisuC7poHGoDE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, a lot of this has to do with nostalgia; I associate listening to cassettes with my pre-teen and teenage years, and that evokes a lot of memories. If you&apos;ve still got a cassette player from the &apos;80s or &apos;90s that&apos;s in a serviceable condition, you don&apos;t need the CP13. But if the cassette head is damaged or you need something new to listen to your cassette catalog, Fiio&apos;s cassette player is a great choice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="F7r4seqEwLaMw5yFs2YmN9" name="fiio-cp13-2.jpg" alt="Fiio CP13 cassette player design showcasing window" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F7r4seqEwLaMw5yFs2YmN9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a consumer product, the CP13 doesn&apos;t have anywhere close to the same finesse as cassette players of the past century; the noise floor is higher, you&apos;ll need to manually fiddle with the playback speed, and there isn&apos;t the ability to record. But as a tool that allows you to play back older cassettes and relive the nostalgia, it is outstanding.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is "combining Galaxy AI with Samsung Health" with its next update.</li><li>Its "on-device AI" will give the Galaxy Watch access to key features like an energy score, workout routines, racing past routes, and new HR metrics.</li><li>Samsung also promises "enhanced health algorithms" for better health accuracy.</li><li>One UI 6 Watch will add these Galaxy AI tools to Galaxy Watches "later this year," most likely in August. </li><li>Galaxy AI will be free "until the end of 2025."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung will add Galaxy AI features to both its Samsung Health app and Galaxy Watches this summer. Tailor-made sleep, health, and workout recommendations could help the Galaxy Watch series catch up to its fitness watch rivals — or even surpass them.</p><p>Starting this June, a select few One UI 6 Watch beta users will get to test out new personalized sleep and fitness coaching before these features roll out to the Galaxy Watch 4, 5, and 6 "later this year." We assume this will be in late August, shortly after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> launch.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s announcement suggests some of these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features will use "powerful on-device AI," while other metrics will rely on Samsung Health data from your phone or the cloud. The company announced features include an Energy Score that analyzes "average sleep time, sleep time consistency, bed/wake time consistency, sleep timing, previous day activity, sleeping heart rate, and heart rate variability" to quantify the user&apos;s daily condition.</p><p>Fitbit, Garmin, and Oura all have similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-fitbit-daily-readiness-score-and-how-do-i-use-it">Daily Readiness</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-body-battery">Body Battery</a> scores that help judge the impact of your sleep, workouts, and stress levels, so we&apos;re glad to see Samsung join their ranks. </p>

<p>Galaxy Watch owners will also get new "sleep indicators" that collect data on movement during sleep, sleep latency, heart rate, and respiratory rate and analyze it to help users "build better habits." </p><p>On that front, Samsung will provide "motivational tips, insights, and guidance" for customized health goals in the Samsung Health app. While we don&apos;t have a list of potential Wellness Tips, the sample below shows goals like lowering your body fat, consistent sleep streaks, and lowering your resting heart rate. </p>

<p>The biggest Galaxy AI changes to Samsung Health relate to fitness. While the One UI 5 Watch update added personalized heart rate zones, this update will add aerobic and anaerobic threshold metrics to analyze performance. </p><p>Essentially, the aerobic threshold indicates the heart rate at which you can train for extended stretches without lactate buildup, burning fat instead of sugar. The anaerobic threshold is your max-effort level, where your body can&apos;t inhale oxygen quickly enough to convert it into energy, accumulating lactate in your blood until your muscles are too stiff to move. </p><p>Running watches like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a> use this data to determine your training load and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a>, guiding your running training. If Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI can bring this kind of tool to a <em>mainstream</em> smartwatch, it would be a real game-changer for the industry. </p><p>In addition, Samsung promises "greater precision and accuracy" for its health metrics thanks to "enhanced health algorithms" based on its AI. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ugwKVbQyzkfAMSnmKCK859" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-heart-rate.jpeg" alt="A heart rate graph on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ugwKVbQyzkfAMSnmKCK859.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond that, Samsung promises a new "Workout Routine" that lets you "combine various exercises for a personalized workout and seamlessly transition to the next exercise without stopping." It sounds very similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">Garmin&apos;s indoor workouts</a>, which lets you pick from thousands of potential exercises while building your routine. </p><p>While Apple and Google/Fitbit rely on workout videos, Samsung will take a more self-guided approach. We wonder if the Galaxy AI will recommend exercises based on your fitness level or if athletes must build workouts entirely by themselves. </p><p>Lastly, Samsung promises a "Race" mode to "track current and past progress when running or cycling." Racing previous routes is a common feature on fitness watches, and Apple added this option with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/watchos-9-review">watchOS 9</a>; we&apos;re glad to see Samsung catch up on this front. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jJwsEyvW7QxsbRkzqYvKE7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-5-Pro-heart-rate-zones.jpeg" alt="Heart rate zones on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jJwsEyvW7QxsbRkzqYvKE7.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> last year, I found its health sensors could use some accuracy upgrades, and its barebones fitness features could use a revamp. So when Samsung announced Galaxy AI earlier this year, I noted how I was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsungs-most-promising-fitness-tech-2024-galaxy-ai">more excited by Galaxy AI than Samsung&apos;s upcoming hardware</a>, for its potential to improve on both fronts. </p><p>Wednesday&apos;s announcement only bolsters those hopes. Whether you buy the Galaxy Watch 7 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> — or even if you have an older Galaxy Watch — you should have a much better experience courtesy of the One UI 6 Watch update.</p><p>Of course, it&apos;s not a certainty. AI enhancements don&apos;t magically make everything better. But there is precedent. Fitness brands like Garmin and Fitbit depend on background algorithms to analyze your health metrics and workout data and tell you how tired or fit you are. </p><p>Plus, watches need reliable algorithms to determine heart rate data when the sensors aren&apos;t perfectly aligned with your skin. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> received Google&apos;s HR algorithm from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, and both have performed very well in HR accuracy tests. If Samsung truly has "enhanced health algorithms," that&apos;ll help it keep up.</p><p>Neither Apple nor Samsung has successfully implemented personalized fitness recommendations before now. Both brands have a higher bar to clear than the competition and more "casual" users who might hurt themselves with bad advice. So, for Samsung to beat Apple to the punch is a pretty big deal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="AmRxLdP5UdGAuaUwLxW62M" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-MWC-black-03.jpg" alt="Eyes on with the Samsung Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AmRxLdP5UdGAuaUwLxW62M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My main question is whether or not you&apos;ll have to pay for these insights or not. We&apos;ve heard rumors that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-us-price-subscription-rumors">Galaxy Ring will require a subscription</a> of $10/month or less on top of a $300+ price tag. Samsung has traditionally given users free Samsung Health insights, but if its new smart ring has a subscription, it&apos;s no great leap to assume the Galaxy Watches will as well. </p><p>Samsung&apos;s press release says, "Galaxy AI features will be provided for free until the end of 2025 on supported Samsung Galaxy smartphone devices," but that wording could leave the door open for a subscription on Galaxy rings and watches in the meantime—and we don&apos;t know how much it&apos;ll cost once that grace period ends.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 2 already has many of Samsung&apos;s promised Galaxy AI insights via Fitbit Premium, but that costs $10/month after a six-month free trial. If Samsung gives that same data for free, it would seriously undercut Google and Fitbit; even if Samsung eventually charges money, Galaxy Watch owners could get over a year of free Wellness Tips and Energy Score data first.</p><p>I still have a ton of questions about One UI 6 Watch and how it&apos;ll compare to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> for fitness. But today&apos;s announcement is undoubtedly a step in the right direction.</p>

The ULT Field 1 is the smallest of the three ULT POWER SOUND Bluetooth speakers the company offers now, but don’t let its diminutive size fool you! Sometimes, big things come in little packages; you’ll find that the ULT Field 1 is one such “little package.” </p><p>Want something highly mobile but large enough to expand your phone’s sound for a trip to the park or beach? The ULT Field 1 may be just what you&apos;re looking for.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MkJhz8KbMCimjxtBA4JLRP" name="sony-ult-field-1-camping.jpg" alt="Sony ULT Field 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MkJhz8KbMCimjxtBA4JLRP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This eight-inch long or tall (it can be used lying on its side or standing on end) Bluetooth speaker supports Bluetooth 5.3 and a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Bluetooth audio codes</a> like SBC, AAC, and LDAC codecs. For a mono speaker setup, the single tweeter and single woofer units produce a satisfying amount of clarity and warm audio with ULT enabled. That’s the backlit button on the top of the speaker, where you’ll also find the other controls. </p><p>The power button and Bluetooth pairing buttons also have status indicator lights; next to those, you have the play/pause/call button and the volume buttons. There’s also a handy carry strap on the unit&apos;s top edge, which can expand if necessary. The rear of the device has a rubber plug/cap, which helps it maintain that IP67 rating and keep water and dust out of the USB-C port.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LzwHFLsLwWNj6tUtViKybN" name="sony-ult-field-1-ult-closeup.jpg" alt="Sony ULT Field 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LzwHFLsLwWNj6tUtViKybN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With an IP67 rating, you can easily take Sony&apos;s ULT Field 1 to the beach and on other dusty, dirty excursions worry-free. However, I’d recommend buying it in one of the other colors because the off-white will look “well-traveled” pretty quickly. Those other colors are black, forest gray, and orange.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="txBgDPHPpedVKTavLD9CMM" name="sony-ult-field-1-plug.jpg" alt="Sony ULT Field 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/txBgDPHPpedVKTavLD9CMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>The speaker supports multipoint connections (two at a time) and can be used as a stereo pair when connected to another ULT Field 1 unit using Sony’s Music Center app. And speaking of that app, it&apos;s actually pretty basic here. Its most important features will be the ability to control the sound and make a stereo pair if you have two units.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CTC8TcqCWvSKtWm2masgXK" name="sony-ult-field-1-music-plus-app.jpg" alt="Sony ULT Field 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CTC8TcqCWvSKtWm2masgXK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Controlling the sound is pretty basic compared to the options you get with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-ult-wear-review">ULT WEAR headphones</a>. In this case, you can only turn ULT on or have it off and use your own custom sound via the three-band EQ. However, since you&apos;ll likely be outdoors with this small speaker, the nuance you can control with an EQ with more bands will likely be lost to the ether and inaudible.</p>
<h2 id="sony-ult-field-test-2">Sony ULT field test</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="edPyRcdCXxfC8iKWFzhLvR" name="sony-ult-field-1-playground.jpg" alt="Sony ULT Field 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edPyRcdCXxfC8iKWFzhLvR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let’s establish something from the start: this isn’t a party speaker for your country barn summer soiree or sunset beach bonfire. This is a “personal speaker” with enough volume for a small group of a few pals to hit the beach and have a kickback or to take to the park and relax to some Coltrane. Maybe you pack it, take it to the AirBnB you and your buddies rented for your week-long getaway, and use it in the backyard. Enough to provide some atmosphere and move your booties but nowhere near loud enough to elicit “disturbing the peace” calls to the police from neighbors.</p><p>To test the audio quality, I took the speaker to a few parks and to the beach. I used it alongside my JBL Charge 4, which is currently my and my wife’s favorite take-along portable speaker. After my testing, the ULT Field 1 will absolutely be our new go-to.</p><p>I went to one park next to a busy main street where a concert was proceeding in another section of the park. I tried to get as far away from that as possible, but the music coming from that section was still audible. Here, I walked about 30 feet away from the speaker before the audio was masked by traffic and other noise.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RHy4dvtpQzJmx67uewCkJG" name="sony-ult-field-1-park-30ft.jpg" alt="Sony ULT Field 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RHy4dvtpQzJmx67uewCkJG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The second park I visited was during the morning, around 10 a.m. The local private schools use it for their PE field, and it just so happened that there were around 50 high school students there that morning. Here, I was able to get roughly 50 feet away from the speaker before the vocals became somewhat indecipherable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="g2ERWGCPTotFwFUzKwYKMH" name="sony-ult-field-1-park-50ft.jpg" alt="Sony ULT Field 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g2ERWGCPTotFwFUzKwYKMH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparing the FIELD 1 to the Charge 4, I can tell you that the ULT function definitely makes a difference. I should note that the Charge 4 uses a less dynamic Bluetooth codec, SBC, while during my testing, the Field 1 used AAC, which has more “resolution.” I can also tell you that the ULT Field 1 sounds better when that function is activated than when it&apos;s not. The sound is flatter with ULT off, but turning it on immediately imbues presence and depth to the sound, making the music fuller and more robust close-up and at greater distances like 50 feet.</p><p>The ULT Field 1 does support LDAC, which is a nice addition, but I was unable to get it to work with that codec using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review">Galaxy S22 Ultra</a>, which both support LDAC. You may have better luck than me.</p><p>We’ve discussed “auditory masking” in other articles here, so keep that in mind when using a speaker like this outdoors. At the beach, the sound of the waves will compete with the higher frequencies in some of your music. Orchestral music, for example. Bottom-heavy songs sounded great when I listened to my music in the park, and instrumental music like R&B, which still had more mids and bottoms, also sounded great. However, music from the Chevalier score lost elements of the mix at 50 feet away in the park. Soft sections of violins were inaudible at that distance, so you’ll want to be closer if classical is your jam.</p><p>The only issue I found with the sound output from the Field 1 was that when you turn the volume up to its max and play a track with a really heavy bottom end, like Skrillex&apos;s “Mumbai Place,” I ran into a decent amount of distortion. That combination was a bit too much for this small unit.</p><p>Aside from music, the speaker can also be used for phone calls, video calls, and whatever audio is output from your phone. I found the volume excellent, and the person on the other end said I sounded clear. What is also clear is the accuracy of the battery life that Sony claims you’ll get. I let the speaker play with ULT activated the volume level set to 25 (it has 50 steps of volume), and the Field 1 lasted just under 12 hours. Turning ULT off will get you more playback time should you need it.</p>

<p>The Sony ULT POWER SOUND series of speakers brings the BOOM! But, in this case, that “BOOM” actually translates to a fuller sound for outdoor use. Couple that with an IP67 rating for water and dust ingress, solid battery life, and a small footprint with good sound output, and you have a speaker well worth considering for your summer outdoor shenanigans.</p><p>You can check out our roundup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">the best Bluetooth speakers</a> if you need something larger than what this offers, but for most casual get-togethers, the Sony ULT Field 1 is a great option for portable Bluetooth audio.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/kindle-oasis-2019-long-term-review">started using the Kindle Oasis</a> soon after it debuted in 2019, switching from the previous-gen Oasis that lacked the warm light feature. In the intervening five years, I used the Oasis extensively; after my monitor, the e-reader gets the most amount of screen time every week.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>All that usage has taken a toll on the battery life; I used to get a week&apos;s worth of use between charges, but these days, the battery barely lasts long enough to read one book. While that isn&apos;t as big a problem at home, I&apos;m not confident in its ability to last a transatlantic flight (not that I&apos;m making those journeys anymore, but that&apos;s a matter for another day).</p><p>The other issue I have with the Oasis is that it charges via Micro-USB. This wasn&apos;t a problem back in 2019, but nowadays, the Oasis is the only device in my daily rotation that still uses the Micro-USB port. I didn&apos;t think much of it at the time, as I figured Amazon would launch a follow-up model with USB-C.</p><p>But it&apos;s clear that Amazon has no intention of doing so. The 10th Gen Kindle Oasis is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/All-new-Kindle-Oasis/dp/B07L5JKKG8">still on sale in India</a> as of writing, but it&apos;s unavailable everywhere else, and unlikely to be restocked. Amazon lists the international edition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Oasis-now-with-adjustable-warm-light/dp/B07L5GDTYY">for just $135</a>, and while that is a stellar price, it isn&apos;t eligible for delivery in the U.S. Given that Amazon has refreshed all the other models in the series, it&apos;s evident that there are no plans to do so with the Oasis. That&apos;s annoying, because even after half a decade, the Oasis continues to be the best e-reader around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wiVZGK7rDSHTs3JkvmfurQ" name="kindle-oasis-3.jpg" alt="Kindle Oasis in-hand showing the settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wiVZGK7rDSHTs3JkvmfurQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A lot of what makes the Oasis stand out is the asymmetric design and the aluminum build; it just feels better to hold and use than any other e-reader. But what I like the best about the device — and why I continue to use it daily — is the page turn buttons. Physical page turn buttons absolutely make a difference when reading an e-book, and the ability to change orientation and use the buttons with either hand is the reason I use the Oasis over other e-readers.</p><p>The Oasis nails the dimensions as well, and the 7-inch screen is ideally suited for reading books. Coming in at 194g, it isn&apos;t too heavy to hold one-handed either. Essentially, what I&apos;m trying to get at is that the Oasis is still the best e-reader ever made, and it&apos;s frustrating that Amazon has no interest in making a new one.</p><p>Amazon is instead focusing its attention on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">Kindle Scribe</a> and the Paperwhite Signature, with the latter in particular taking up the mantle of the Oasis. The Paperwhite Signature is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-paperwhite-Signature-Edition/dp/B08B495319">more affordable at $189</a>, charges via USB-C and the Qi standard, and has E Ink&apos;s Carta 1200 panel with 300ppi pixel density. But there are no page turn buttons, and the plastic design isn&apos;t anywhere as nice to hold as the Oasis.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="soSizkdxnYSASYRFTubB4R" name="kindle-oasis-5.jpg" alt="Kindle Oasis in dark mode holding in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/soSizkdxnYSASYRFTubB4R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re a long-time Oasis user and are looking for a new e-reader, the best option may be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-page-review">Onyx Boox Page</a>. It also has a 7-inch E Ink Carta 1200 panel, physical page turn buttons, and weeks-long battery life. Onyx&apos;s software has a lot going for it as well — that was evident after using the Note Air 3 — and at $249, the Boox Page slots in at the same price point as the Oasis. While I haven&apos;t used Kobo&apos;s e-readers, the Libra Colour looks like a decent alternative, offering a color E Ink screen along with page turn buttons.</p><p>That said, I exclusively used Kindles for over a decade because of the convenience. While I buy from smaller publishers these days, a chunk of my e-book library is tied to my Amazon account, and the Kindle e-store — along with Kindle Unlimited — makes buying and reading e-books a breeze. But with Amazon unwilling to release a new high-end e-reader, it is becoming increasingly clear that I&apos;ll need to switch to Onyx or Kobo&apos;s products once my Oasis becomes unusable.</p>

<hr>
<p>T-Mobile announced on Tuesday (May 28) that it will acquire almost all of U.S. Cellular&apos;s wireless operations, including wireless customers and stores, as well as certain specified spectrum assets. </p><p>The carrier said they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/uscellular-acquisition-operations-assets">sealed the deal</a> for about $4.4 Billion. T-Mobile will get around 30% of U.S. Cellular&apos;s wireless spectrum, and this deal aims to improve connectivity across the board, especially for those living in remote rural areas. The carrier says that closing this deal will provide U.S. customers nationwide access to the fastest 5G and roaming network, also in areas where the network was previously limited. </p><p>"The Un-carrier is all about shaking up wireless for the good of consumers and this deal is another way for us to continue doing even more of that," says T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert. U.S. Cellular is said to retain 70 percent of its wireless spectrum and towers, leasing space of around 2,100 additional towers to T-Mobile.<br>
<br>
Laurent Therivel, CEO of U.S. Cellular, adds that the transaction will provide its customers "access to better coverage and speeds, as well as unlimited texting in more than 215 countries, content offers, device upgrades, and other T-Mobile benefits."</p><p>For now, U.S. Cellular customers still have the choice to stick to their current plans or move to an unlimited T-Mobile plan with no switching costs, which includes Un-carrier benefits such as streaming and free international data roaming.</p><p>If all goes as planned, the deal is expected to close in mid-2025.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-other-phone-carriers-2">What does this mean for other phone carriers?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:853px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Mj4P8iQyLCsDwu8wsWbkkV" name="t-mobile-test_2.jpg" alt="Person using cell phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mj4P8iQyLCsDwu8wsWbkkV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="853" height="480" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This acquisition could mean a few things for other cellular carriers in the U.S. wireless market, one of which is potentially lower prices. With T-Mobile&apos;s bigger coverage area, it might pressure other companies like AT&T and Verizon to offer competitive prices and offers to customers in order to retain them. </p><p>"As customers from both companies will get more coverage and capacity from our combined footprint, our competitors will be forced to keep up – and even more consumers will benefit," Sievert added.</p><p>An analyst from Wedbush Securities analyst <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/tmobile-tds-us-cellular-67d4d2a85fd73338334987933b468a40">told</a> the Associated Press that "the U.S. consumer has less choice, but there is more competition, and this could drive prices lower."</p><p>However, on the flip side, if T-Mobile monopolizes the market, especially in places where other networks lack coverage, such as rural areas, it might be tough for the company to offer competitive prices on the pretext of being the only player in the market. Recently, T-Mobile told customers on legacy plans that they would be charged more per line as a result of "rising costs."</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how other wireless carriers will react to this acquisition by T-Mobile, as U.S. Cellular is the fourth largest wireless carrier in the United States, albeit with fairly limited coverage.</p><p>The announcement comes not long after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-mint-mobile-acquisition">T-Mobile agreed to purchase Mint Mobile</a> and Ultra Mobile via an acquisition of parent company Ka&apos;ena Corporation.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Asgard's Wrath 2's Meta Quest 3 update is finally out, with v5.0.1535650 totaling 7.8GB of updated content.</li><li>The new update includes upgraded textures, large enemy and character models, and other graphical enhancements for Meta's most powerful VR headset.</li><li>Quest 3 gamers can choose between fidelity mode and performance mode to select better visuals or a better framerate.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The long-awaited Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2 graphics upgrade for the Meta Quest 3 has finally arrived, bringing with it 7.8GB of graphically upgraded content. Gamers can look forward to notably upgraded texture resolution in the environment, plus detail found throughout objects and other areas of the world.</p><p>To update the game, just head to your library tab on the Meta Quest 3, tap the three-dot overflow menu next to the Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2 listing, and tap update. Once you&apos;ve launched the game, open up the game&apos;s settings menu, tap user interface, and then enable Enhanced Rendering Features.</p><p>Note that checking this box toggles between "performance" and "fidelity" modes, as it&apos;s often referred to on consoles like the PS5. Leaving the box unchecked will run the game on Quest 3  at a higher resolution and a higher framerate than Quest 2 while checking the box will bring the framerate down to 72 FPS but upgrade the rest of the visual experience.</p>

<p>Above, you&apos;ll see some comparisons from developer Sanzaru Games showcasing how enemies and textures look after the visual upgrade. We&apos;ve also taken a handful of screenshots to showcase how it looks running on a Quest 3.</p><p>Many world objects and enemies, like the giant turtle pictured in the gallery above or even one of the giant scorpions you&apos;ll find throughout the desert, now feature spectral highlights, more detailed geometry, and enhanced texture detail. Other effects, like reflections, look better in motion rather than screenshots, so be sure to check the game out yourself to really enjoy the visual spectacle.</p><p>In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/asgards-wrath-2-review">Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2 review</a>, we named it the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oculus-quest-2-games">best VR game</a> of all time because of the scope of the game - a massive 100+ hour-long RPG - as well as the production quality and satisfying, varied mechanics in each of the game&apos;s seven chapters and four playable characters.</p><p>Over the past few months since the game launched, first-party Oculus developer Sanzaru Games has debuted free monthly events that players can dive into and collect special armor sets, weapons, and other goodies only available during those events.</p><p>Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2 is included for free with every Meta Quest 3 headset sold through the end of June 2024, so be sure to take advantage of the bonus by redeeming it on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/2603836099654226/">Meta Horizon store</a>. Aside from the graphical upgrade, the new update includes the following changes and additions:</p>
<ul><li>New Uncharted Rift layouts have been added – check out the Duat-themed areas on your next run!</li><li>Applied additional fixes to Monster Den 'Boiling-Bridge Hideaway' in order to address players being unable to complete this den.</li><li>Applied an additional check on Viggo’s mount gear to assist in unlocking the mount gear for players who have previously already upgraded Viggo’s armor. </li><li>Resolved an issue where Monster Den 'Dubious Cache' fails to be marked as complete for some players. </li><li>Resolved an issue where players could be blocked from progressing if they die during Djehuty’s Staff quest step.</li><li>Resolved an issue in Uncharted Rift - Ruins layouts where some players would become blocked from progressing due to a switch being displaced.</li><li>Resolved an issue where a voice line would repeat after completing the quest “Hide and Seek” and killing another Smiter. </li><li>Fixed an issue when encountering a Bruiser in a Loki Anomaly where the Bruiser's health bar would not appear.</li></ul>

<p>Samsung&apos;s upcoming first-generation smart ring is passing through its certification hoops, but its stop at the FCC spills more than expected.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2024/05/28/samsungs-galaxy-ring-stops-through-fcc-and-shows-off-everything/">DroidLife</a>, the Galaxy Ring is listed under the FCC ID "A3LSMQ503" within its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=N&application_id=GVBTaMEJp%2FstsNDsvLc3Aw%3D%3D&fcc_id=A3LSMQ503">official report</a>. From the listing, it seems confirmed that the device will hit the market with nine models, each with its respective ring size. Information about eight of the sizes, minus SM-Q503, are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>SM-Q500 (Size 10)</li><li>SM-Q501 (Size 11)</li><li>SM-Q502 (Size 12)</li><li>SM-Q505 (Size 5)</li><li>SM-Q506 (Size 6)</li><li>SM-Q507 (Size 7)</li><li>SM-Q508 (Size 8)</li><li> SM-Q509 (Size 9)</li></ul>

<p>The FCC&apos;s listing for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> contained battery information for each device. Ring sizes five through seven will feature a 17mAh battery. Sizes eight through eleven boast 18.5mAh batteries, while the larger size 12 Galaxy Ring sees a 22.5mAh capacity battery.</p><p>The listing continues by quickly mentioning a "charging cradle" for the Galaxy Ring. More substantial information about it is unknown, aside from a picture of the cradle&apos;s apparent underside to highlight the FCC&apos;s marking. The listing reportedly details that Samsung will label each cradle according to whichever model (and ring size) a consumer has purchased.</p>

<p>The publication also picked up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=7352716">official photos of the rings</a>, courtesy of Samsung. The pictures show off the device in various sizes and from different angles. Additionally, it seems the device will connect to devices via Bluetooth LE.</p><p>An earlier leak from March suggested that the Galaxy Ring could run for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-may-last-almost-ten-days">about 10 days</a>. It then dipped into the potential battery sizes of the device, purporting its smallest size could see a 14.5mAh battery while the largest could sit at 21.5mAh. However, with the current FCC listing, those numbers have increased slightly at both ends.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-model-number-sizes-leak">we&apos;ve heard rumors</a> about Samsung&apos;s potential to bring nine Galaxy Ring sizes to consumers based on American ring sizes. There was speculation that the ninth would either be given an "SM-Q503" or "SM-Q504" model number; we&apos;ve now seen that it&apos;s the former. Still, information about SM-Q503 is unknown. There&apos;s a chance this device takes the ring size up to 13, but we&apos;ll have to wait and see.</p><p>We expect Samsung to debut its Galaxy Ring, among several other devices, during its summer Unpacked event. Rumors state this could happen on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

<hr>
<p>Well-known PC and Android browser, Opera, has highlighted its latest AI feature drop, and this one comes with a little Google magic.</p><p>Today (May 28), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.opera.com/2024/05/28/opera-google-cloud-aria-gemini/">Opera announced</a> that it has started collaborating with Google Cloud to integrate its Gemini AI models into its in-browser AI, Aria. The company states that Gemini will enable the Opera browser to provide users with "the most current information, at high performance."</p><p>Opera reiterates Aria&apos;s design, which is that of a multi-LLM Composer AI engine. This gives the browser a chance to "curate" a better experience for users based on what they may need. Moreover, Aria piggybacks off multiple LLMs (large language models). Opera states that Aria will choose the best AI model to handle a user&apos;s task based on their "intent."</p><p>AI is woven through both the regular Opera browser and the OperaGX browser, geared toward PC gamers. Gemini will likely appear in both instances, however, Opera has not said when we should expect this.</p><p>This collaboration continues as Opera states Aria will soon pick up image generation and voice output capabilities. Courtesy of the work with Google Cloud, the Opera browser will deliver free image generation features to users through Google&apos;s Imagen 2 model on Vertex AI.</p><p>Additionally, Aria is being upgraded with "conversational-like" voice output, which lets the AI read its responses aloud to users.</p>

<p>Google debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-imagen-2-vertex-ai-debut">Imagen 2</a>, a text-to-image generation model, late in 2023. It was stated that the software could create "photorealistic" imagery based on users&apos; prompts. There was also the hope that Imagen 2 could rid users of some "typical problems" those types of bots are prone to.</p><p>Since then, during I/O 2024, the company unveiled its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements#:~:text=Imagen%203%20and%20Google%20Veo">Imagen 3 model</a>. The idea of creating photorealistic and life-like imagery remains the same with this new software. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Google explained</a> that Imagen 3 takes it a step further as users should experience an increase in detail across the board. Natural speech and the intent behind your prompt are areas where Imagen 3 was said to be better than its predecessor.</p>

<ul><li>A notable tipster dove into the latest Find My Device app version to discover a new biometric security option for users.</li><li>To bolster a user's personal security, the feature might work in tandem with the "don't ask again" box for the basic Google account sign-in.</li><li>Google teased "Remote Lock" for Find My Device at I/O, stating users can remotely close off their devices with their phone number and a security challenge.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As Google continues to expand its new Find My Device network to more users, plans to strengthen its security appear.</p><p>As spotted by AssembleDebug in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/find-my-device-biometric-login-apk-teardown-3446345/">Android Authority</a>, the app&apos;s code spills an extra biometric security layer. From the app&apos;s latest version, the biometric option was produced on the same page asking for your Google account credentials. </p><p>When enabled, users should be able to sign in quickly using their fingerprints.</p><p>This will likely give users more peace of mind when toggling the "don&apos;t ask again" option when using their Google account password. It&apos;s suspected that the two will work in tandem as users can leave their credentials saved on their devices backed with an extra layer that verifies their identity.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when Google plans to roll out its biometric security layer in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device#section-how-to-lock-your-phone-with-find-my-device">Find My Device</a> app. However, the tipster thinks it could happen when the network is more "commonplace."</p><p>AssembleDebug was then able to produce Google&apos;s planned "Remote Lock" function for the network&apos;s app. Produced thanks to a recent Play Services update, the feature&apos;s framework appeared, but without any proper functionality.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">teased Remote Lock</a> during I/O 2024, stating users can lock their phones down by using their phone number and completing a security challenge. We&apos;re not expecting this until "later this year," following Play Services to enable it properly.</p>

<p>Regarding a more common network, Google started rolling Find My Device out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">to more users</a> earlier in May. Shortly before I/O 2024, folks in Japan and the U.K. spotted the new network appearing on their device. Moreover, even more users in the U.S. started noticing the app appear updated on their phones. The network&apos;s expansion was joined by an extended cast of devices ready to support its functionality.</p><p>We started noticing its availability on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> while picking it up on the Moto Razr Plus.</p><p>One thing to note is that Google&apos;s Pixel series can be located <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-pixel-8-find-my-device-powered-off">without powe</a>r or when the device is shut down. Other devices, like Moto&apos;s foldable, are notably missing that bit of information when reading through the network&apos;s description for device operations.</p>

<hr>
<p>The idea of Wear OS 5 debuting this year changed from being just a rumor to becoming a certainty rather quickly, with Google officially previewing the upcoming operating system at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O 2024</a>. Now that Wear OS 5 is official, we&apos;re already looking ahead to the first beta. Wear OS updates are developed as part of a joint effort between Google and Samsung, and Galaxy Watches are often the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a> to get Wear OS betas first. That&apos;s why recent rumors have suggested a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wear-os-5-software-testing-spotted">Wear OS 5 beta for the Galaxy Watch 6</a> could be imminent. </p><p>Those rumors intensified over the last few days when one X (formerly Twitter) user spotted an official Samsung forum page for the One UI Watch 6 beta. Samsung is one version number ahead of Wear OS, so the One UI Watch 6 release will be our first glimpse of Wear OS 5 on actual hardware.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One UI 6 Watch beta incoming...👀Who's ready?#OneUI6Watch #OneUIBeta pic.twitter.com/jU94LG5D7t<a href="https://twitter.com/theordysm/status/1793589393216926119">May 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>This forum page, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/26/samsung-wear-os-5-galaxy-watch-beta/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first reported on, indicates that the first Wear OS 5 beta could be just weeks away. Although this specific page doesn&apos;t provide any new information, the fact that it is live at all could mean Galaxy Watch 6 devices will receive the One UI Watch 6 beta soon. </p><p>A new version upgrade is always exciting, and the possibility that Wear OS could be moving to a yearly release schedule could be even more exciting. But a consequence of that consistency, and the way Google releases Wear OS features, is that annual Wear OS upgrades will get more boring. They&apos;ll be more like watchOS, and that has pros and cons. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kufxphEuKxyDsosc99yqwN" name="YouTube-Music-Wear-OS-app.jpg" alt="YouTube Music app on Wear OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kufxphEuKxyDsosc99yqwN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The idea that Wear OS updates are becoming less exciting isn&apos;t just speculation. The jump from Wear OS 3.5 to Wear OS 4 wasn&apos;t a massive one, and early indications are that Wear OS 4 to Wear OS 5 could be an even smaller one. Aside from battery life improvements and changes to the Watch Face Format, there isn&apos;t a ton <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces&apos;">new with Wear OS 5 this year</a>, at least based on what Google has announced thus far. While those changes are appreciated — especially the battery life boost — they aren&apos;t exactly exciting. </p><p>Google specifically notes that workout tracking will be more efficient while running Wear OS 5. During a marathon, the company says Wear OS 5 will use up to 20% less power than Wear OS 4, which targets a particular segment of smartwatch users like Android Central&apos;s Michael Hicks, who writes our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/sunday-runday">Sunday Runday</a> column. Battery life improvements will indeed be the biggest user-facing Wear OS 5 upgrade. Everything else, from the Watch Face Format changes to using Android 14 as a base, is more developer-focused. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aKsQ2PKB9YkEFnsyv2WML3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-and-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2.jpeg" alt="The Apple Watch Ultra 2 (left) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (right) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aKsQ2PKB9YkEFnsyv2WML3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In some ways, the fact that "boring" Wear OS upgrades may become the norm is a compliment. Previously, there was so much wrong with Wear OS that we would see and get excited about big leaps between version upgrades. Now that annual Wear OS upgrades are on the horizon, it&apos;s impossible not to make a comparison between WatchOS and WearOS. WatchOS is the operating system that Apple Watches run, and it&apos;s arguably the most successful smartwatch OS released to date. </p><p>Apple is nearing 10 years of the Apple Watch, and WatchOS progress has slowed over the last few years. When an operating system matures, there are limits to how many improvements can be made year-over-year. Apple usually includes a big feature or two in each version of watchOS, and they&apos;re occasionally tied to new Apple Watch hardware. Wear OS upgrades will become just like WatchOS upgrades, with a feature or an improvement coming each year, but not much else. </p><p>Again, the fact that we can even make this comparison shows just how far Samsung and Google have come in reviving the Wear OS platform. It also means we shouldn&apos;t expect massive year-over-year changes that overhaul the Wear OS experience. It&apos;s more likely that Wear OS will evolve over a longer period of time, with one or two version upgrades needed to make a noticeable difference. </p>
<h2 id="there-apos-s-more-to-it-than-yearly-updates-2">There&apos;s more to it than yearly updates</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PnHSbKEWSgsYou9iZNzpai" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-white-band-purple-watchface-turn-crown.jpg" alt="Turning the crown on the Google Pixel Watch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PnHSbKEWSgsYou9iZNzpai.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another factor that will contribute to less exciting yearly Wear OS upgrades is the way Google releases features and changes. Unlike Apple, Google doesn&apos;t stock up on features for annual Wear OS releases. Instead, the company likes to release them throughout the year. </p><p>A new Wear OS feature might debut as part of a quarterly release, like a feature drop. It could even appear in a monthly security update, like when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-april-2024-update-rollout">Google added Vibration Watch to the Pixel Watch</a> as part of the April 2024 update, although these tend to be Pixel-specific additions. Some users might prefer this release schedule because features are rolled out when they&apos;re ready instead of being held for a yearly upgrade.</p><p>Despite that benefit, it has the consequence of limiting the impact annual Wear OS releases can have. We&apos;ll see what exactly Wear OS 5 has in store when the beta releases in a few weeks, assuming the rumors are correct. Barring a miracle, it won&apos;t be all that exciting, and Wear OS users should get used to that. There are a handful of great things that have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">come with Wear OS&apos; maturity</a>, but that also means upgrades like Wear OS 5 just won&apos;t be as exciting.</p>
