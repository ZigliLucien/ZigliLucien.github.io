<p>With Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">I/O 2024</a> behind us, the company is explaining a few new goodies that are on the way for its Workspace apps.</p><p>The company explained in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/google-gemini-workspace-may-2024-updates/">Keyword post</a> that Gemini is preparing to roll out a few extra updates for Gmail users on Android. The idea is to help users remain productive, which is where email summaries come into play. Google states Gemini will analyze an email thread and provide a summary filled with the most important points discussed by you and others.</p><p>This will arrive for Workspace Labs users in May with all Gemini for Workspace customers and Google One AI Premium subscribers in June.</p>

<p>Contextual smart replies, which aren&apos;t new in Gmail, are getting an AI boost courtesy of Gemini. The post highlights the model&apos;s ability to help users with more "detailed and nuanced" suggestions based on a given conversation in an email. Users will have the chance to edit Gemini&apos;s suggested reply if they don&apos;t want to send it as offered.</p><p>Workspace Labs users on mobile and the web will pick this up in July.</p><p>Gmail is also primed to pick up a "Q&A" feature via its sidebar on Android, powered by Gemini. Tapping the Gemini star icon in the app will produce a menu with a few pre-made options. Users can input their questions, such as ones that ask the AI to give a quick overview of important questions involving a user&apos;s book club. Gemini will scour your emails and pick out questions that should have your attention.</p><p>This feature will arrive for Workspace Labs users on mobile and the web in July.</p>

<p>Gemini&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">1.5 Pro model</a> is on its way for several of Google&apos;s Workspace apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Slides, and Sheets today (May 14). The AI&apos;s appearance will bring a longer context window and "more advanced reasoning." In short, Google states Gemini will be able to answer a wider range of user questions for better assistance.</p><p>Regarding the increased context window, the post highlights Gemini&apos;s ability to gather and understand more of a user&apos;s data. Additionally, it can provide helpful insights for users using their emails, content in Drive, and more. Users are also gaining the ability to type "@" in Drive to find a specific document they&apos;re looking for.Â </p><p>This can turn into a query for Gemini in which you can ask it for specific information found within that document, like contact information.</p><p>Gemini for the Workspace side panel is available now for Workspace Labs users and Gemini for Workspace Alpha users. Next month, Google plans to extend its reach to businesses and consumers on the desktop through Gemini for Workspace add-ons and the Google One AI Premium tier.</p><p>Lastly, Google&apos;s handy "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-generative-ai">help me write</a>" tool in Gmail and Docs is starting to arrive in more languages. The company states that the feature will support Spanish and Portuguese on the desktop. More language support is on the horizon, though when they could arrive is currently unknown.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>At Google I/O 2024, Google announced Project Astra, a multimodal AI assistant.</li><li>In its filmed demo, a Google engineer wears AR glasses that film your surroundings for Gemini to respond to.</li><li>We've heard rumors about Project Iris, Google's AR prototype, but Google hasn't officially announced anything.Â </li></ul>
<p>The first day of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">Google I/O 2024</a> went all-in on AI, neglecting any mention of hardware we hoped to see like the Pixel 9 or Pixel Fold 2. But one unannounced Google hardware project made a blink-and-you-miss-it appearance: a secret AR glasses prototype that looks surprisingly consumer-ready.</p><p>Demoing several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Gemini AI upgrades</a>, Google revealed Project Astra, a real-time multimodal AI from the Google DeepMind team that looks at your surroundings through a camera and answers your questions based on that visual context.Â </p><p>You can watch the demo below. And if you jump to 1:25, you can see the moment when the Google engineer puts on a thick-rimmed pair of glasses before the camera view changes to her eyeline.Â </p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXVvvRhiGjI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Google didn&apos;t call attention to these glasses, and we don&apos;t know what they&apos;re called. But they&apos;re clearly AR glasses, given the holographic dot and text in the visual center that displays Gemini AI answers to her questions. Google claims it was "captured in a single take, in real time," which suggests the footage is real and undoctored.Â </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses</a> also have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-ai-update">AI question function</a>, but with photo snapshots instead of video and Meta AI instead of Gemini. Plus, it has no visual way to show the AI&apos;s answer, relying solely on audio. That&apos;s where Google&apos;s mysterious AR glasses would potentially step things up.Â </p><p>We&apos;ve waited for a Google Glass successor for years. Behind the scenes, we knew about Google&apos;s "Project Iris," alleged VR/AR glasses with real-time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-smart-glasses-google-io-2022">Google Translate capabilities</a>. Alleged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ar-glasses-problems-behind-scenes">Iris project difficulties</a> had us worried that Iris might never come to fruition.Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oYWDsk5xBW4xwuPcfYAHfD" name="Google-IO-2024-AR-glasses.jpeg" alt="A screenshot from the Google I/O presentation showing a Google engineer wearing AR glasses with a camera and Gemini AI capabilities." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oYWDsk5xBW4xwuPcfYAHfD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">You get a brief glimpse of the Google engineer wearing the AR glasses prototype in the Astra demo </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This demo, however, has us wondering whether Google might be able to sell AR glasses powered by Gemini AI sooner than we anticipated. That would certainly be more exciting than many of the straightforward Google I/O 2024 AI demos today, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">AI Overview search summaries</a>.</p><p>Google&apos;s big XR project is developing mixed-reality software (AndroidXR) for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung&apos;s upcoming XR headset</a>, supposedly due out this year. In theory, Google&apos;s Iris AR glasses could follow after Samsung&apos;s headset with its own spin on AndroidXR, designed to be worn out in the world.Â </p><p>Imagine Google AR glasses that can interpret your surroundings in real time, along with other Google app capabilities like Google Maps directions or real-time Google Translate. If it&apos;s really coming soon, that could spice up a rather dull I/O presentation.</p>

Google states that users no longer need to break their questions up into smaller pieces.</p><p>No matter its complexity, Search <em>should </em>take your queries in stride, delivering relevant results to users.</p><p>Under the "multi-step reasoning" label, Search&apos;s AI ability to understand more complex questions is on its way to AI Overviews in Labs "soon."</p>

<p>Google first debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">AI Overviews</a> in January, alongside its reveal of Circle to Search. While they were initially a tool those in its Labs experimental realm could test, the company states that AI Overviews will roll out to all users today (May 14) in the U.S. Folks in other countries can expect the useful overview for queries, but it will take place at a later date.</p><p>Additionally, the ability for users to "adjust" their overview. Google states users will find options to simplify the AI&apos;s language or break things down into more understandable pieces. This feature is slated to arrive in Search Labs "soon" for English queries in the U.S.</p>

<p>The ability to record a video alongside a question and run it through Search is also on the way. Powered by Google Lens, the post explains that users can leverage the AI&apos;s video understanding to ask questions about why something is broken and how to fix it.</p><p>Users should describe the problem the best they can (with the video as extra context). Running the search will prompt Google&apos;s AI to deliver an overview with the most relevant steps on how to fix the problem with resources and other helpful troubleshooting tips.</p><p>Google adds that this ability to search with videos is coming to testers in Labs "soon" for English in the U.S. Extra regions are on deck, but it will take place at a later date.</p>

<p>Search is picking up a couple of extra features, such as planning. Google highlights the engine&apos;s upcoming AI-backed ability to help users plan meals or vacations. The company states that searching for "create a 3-day meal plan for a group thatâs easy to prepare" will produce a day-by-day breakdown in Search. Detailed recipes, where to begin, and more will be readily available in easily visible cards.</p><p>Users can then follow up and ask the AI to swap some recipes for ones that would fit a vegetarian or swap ideas for ones that fit dinner plans. An export button will appear so users can toss their plans into Docs or Gmail.</p><p>Meal and trip planning are set to arrive in Search Labs (English) for U.S. users "later this year." The AI ability to help plan for parties, date nights, and workouts is on the docket but there&apos;s no concrete date set yet.</p><p>Lastly, Google is bringing some organization to its AI-powered results. The post states that users looking for ideas on where to eat and more will find a results page that clearly breaks down several possible places of interest. The AI will help by creating headlines to separate different perspectives and content types.</p><p>A more organized AI-powered results page is beginning to arrive for U.S. users for dining and recipes. Later, Google states it has plans to incorporate movies, music, books, hotels, shopping, and more.</p>

<ul><li>During I/O 2024, Google highlighted several new features for the Play Store that developers can begin experimenting with.</li><li>Such features include better app searching, discoverability for specific devices, payment features, and security.</li><li>Google states users and developers can expect more to come in the weeks ahead.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s I/O day and Google is highlighting several new tools arriving for the Play Store that developers can use to better the user experience.</p><p>Google stated in a press release that the Play Store&apos;s app categories are in for a tune-up. To do this, the company states developers can extend their app&apos;s reach to users outside of the store with the new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/preview">Engage SDK</a>." Google adds that this new "surface" should help app developers highlight the "most important" piece of content in a user&apos;s app and launch "immersive, full-screen" experiences.</p><p>Such experiences would be fueled by a user&apos;s recommendations alongside any promotions the developers wish to show.</p><p>Google then reiterated its recent updates to Play Games on PC, Play Points, and more, which it discussed during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/03/key-product-updates-from-2024-google-for-games-developer-summit.html">Developer Summit</a> in March.</p><p>Custom store listings are set to arrive, giving unique details based on the keywords users have searched. Google states the Play Console will give developers tailor-made suggestions that could help their app reach a new target audience. "Cross-device discovery" is also on its way. This will help users interested in using an app on multiple devices.</p><p>The post states that an app&apos;s details will display screenshots, ratings, and reviews for different devices like phones, tablets, etc. Search filters will also benefit from this, as users can discover an app for whichever device they desire. Deep linking is said to help developers improve a user&apos;s app experience by sending them to a "relevant" page within the app for content, bookings, shopping, and more.</p><p>Security is a big part of the Google Play Store, so the company is opening its SDK Console to all SDKs for developers. In short, this gives developers a centralized place to view usage stats and tools to fix issues and information on following the store&apos;s various policies.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mwpx3vHjs2gwrmDtG86kpa" name="Google-IO-2023-logo.jpeg" alt="Google I/O logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mwpx3vHjs2gwrmDtG86kpa.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3200" height="1800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some "enhanced app-release tools" are making their way to developers. These are a set of pre-release checks to ensure that your app meets all the right quality points in terms of UI for a swift, uninhibited launch. There will also be a place to discard unwanted releases. Google states that this feature should help developers avoid "accidental updates."</p><p>A few features are entering the scene to help developers protect their products against "unauthorized" folk. Google states that "App Access Risk" is now in public beta and is designed to let app creators know if another app is capturing a user&apos;s screen or controlling their device. "Play Protect Verdict" acts like a safety net, alerting the app about the status of Play Protect and if there is any malware present on a user&apos;s device.</p><p>Developers also receive "recent device activity," which helps them weed out devices sending automated traffic or signs of an attack.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BZYwNpCHPh7WNyifZd2J4H" name="google-pixel-8a-back-bay-01.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 8a in the Bay blue colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BZYwNpCHPh7WNyifZd2J4H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Optimizations for revenue in the Play Store are arriving via extended payment options. Google highlighted its previous expansion of Pix in Brazil and UPI in India. However, users can now ask another to purchase an app or in-app content for them through a shareable Play Store link. This will begin for users in India and will likely go to more places if all goes well.</p><p>Additionally, Google adds that parents with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7103337?sjid=2881579024856471107-NC">Google Family</a> setup can approve their child&apos;s purchase on any Android OS.</p><p>Developers are picking up more revenue-based options such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10532353">recommended pricing</a> to better fit with any economic changes. The Play Store is said to begin displaying badges such as "best selling," "trending," and "popular" to help consumers make an informed choice.</p><p>Lastly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.play.billingtestcompanion">Play Billing Lab</a> app will help developers playtest new payment features for users <em>before </em>rolling them out. The app is designed to help better the one-time payment experiences and subscription plans.</p><p>With developer previews scheduled, the company states will have more updates in the "weeks to come."</p>

<ul><li>Google introduced an advanced AI feature for Google Photos, powered by Gemini AI, to enhance the platform's robust search capabilities.</li><li>This new tool, dubbed "Ask Photos," allows users to find specific images in their gallery by interacting with Gemini through typed queries.</li><li>Although currently limited to text input, the feature is expected to receive updates, including voice input and further enhancements to the search functionality.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>At the 2024 I/O conference, Google CEO Sundar Pichai showcased a new AI feature for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> that&apos;s intended to enhance the service&apos;s already strong search features, thanks to Gemini AI.</p><p>The search giant introduced a new feature called "Ask Photos," designed to let you find specific images in your gallery by chatting with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ask Photos, a new feature coming to @GooglePhotos, makes it easier to search across your photos and videos with the help of Gemini models. It goes beyond simple search to understand context and answer more complex questions. #GoogleIO pic.twitter.com/OsYXZLo5S1<a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1790428759700463632">May 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Photos&apos; new feature, rolling out later this summer with more capabilities, will let users search their photo collection using natural language. This relies on AI to understand the content of the photos and other metadata.</p><p>The new feature enhances typical image searches, with Gemini able to recognize specific content in images. Google demonstrated this by using a car license plate as an example. When asked about a specific plate number on a particular car model, Google Photos could identify and display the correct license plate details.</p><p>Right now, if you want to find a specific license plate, you&apos;d have to scroll through loads of car photos. But with the new AI feature, it&apos;s much smarter. It figures out which car you&apos;re looking for based on its location and how often it&apos;s shown up in your photos over the years. Then, it gives you the license plate number in a text response and shows you a photo to confirm it&apos;s right.</p><p>Other details like upload date and location will also help speed up searches when you use a prompt or ask a question. Plus, you&apos;ll be able to use <em>Ask Photos</em> with videos as well.</p>

<p>The feature will appear as a new tab at the bottom of the Photos app. When you tap on that tab, you&apos;ll see the Gemini icon and a welcome message over a bar that invites you to "search or ask about Photos."</p><p>For now, you&apos;ll need to type your queries into <em>Ask Photos</em>âvoice input isn&apos;t available yet. But when it rolls out, the regular search bar in your Photos app will get an upgrade to <em>Ask Photos</em> instead.</p>

<ul><li>With Google I/O 2024 ongoing, the company highlights several AI updates, such as a new Gemini model known as 1.5 Flash.</li><li>Gemini Nano on Android is getting an upgrade and will soon be able to handle images from users and "Multimodality."</li><li>The company also unveiled Veo (video generation) and Imagen 3, which are touted as Google's "highest quality" text-to-image generator.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With Google&apos;s I/O 2024 event underway, the company highlights several ways its AI model Gemini is set to improve with a new family and AI agents.</p><p>As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-update-flash-ai-assistant-io-2024/">blog post</a>, Google is welcoming in a new member to its Gemini ecosystem known as "Gemini 1.5 Flash." Following the launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-1-5-next-gen-ai-model">1.5 Pro</a> in February, the company states it quickly became apparent that its applications needed "lower latency and lower cost to serve." The 1.5 Flash model for Gemini is said to be lighter than its Pro sibling, with faster speeds and more efficiency, as a result.</p><p>Google states Flash can handle "high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale." The company adds that Flash can take care of large chunks of data and deliver quality that supersedes its size. Testing shows that the 1.5 Flash model thrives in summarization, chat applications, image/video captioning, data extraction, tables, and more.</p><p>Flash joins Pro in the public preview space with a 1 million token window in AI Studio and Vertex AI. For developers leveraging the API of Google Cloud customers, the window has increased to 2 million tokens.</p><p>Speaking of the 1.5 Pro model, Google says it&apos;s continued to plug away at updates, with its most recent one set to improve the AI&apos;s reasoning and coding. Image and video benchmark understanding for the model arrives for MMMU, AI2D, MathVista, ChartQA, DocVQA, InfographicVQA, and EgoSchema.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb" name="Google-Gemini-app-home-page.JPG" alt="The Google Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1910" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The next-gen Pro model has been upgraded to follow "increasingly complex" and "nuanced" instructions. Google states users can even specify product-level behavior such as roles, format, and style to the 1.5 Pro model. Audio understanding comes in for the Gemini API and AI studio, meaning the 1.5 Pro model can provide "reason" for images and videos uploaded to the latter.</p><p>Google adds that there are plans to implement the 1.5 Pro model into Gemini Advanced and Workspace apps. During I/O, it was teased that the upgraded model would arrive for Gmail and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-us-launch-new-features">NotebookLM</a>. Google quickly demonstrated 1.5 Pro&apos;s Multimodality power in its recent AI-powered note-taking app. It showed that users can have the AI simulate a conversation where it delivers larger pieces of information in a more digestible way.</p><p>More importantly, users can chime in and ask questions to the AI and have it provide relevant responses. Additionally, if you&apos;re child is eager to learn a new topic, Gemini 1.5 Pro can deliver age-appropriate responses if required.</p>
<h2 id="updates-for-nano-2">Updates for Nano</h2>
<p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">Gemini Nano model for Android</a> is getting some updates. The post states that the model is moving beyond text inputs and will soon start accepting images for users. Pixels are first in line, as Google states, Nano with Multimodality will begin to "understand the world the way people doânot just through text input, but also through sight, sound, and spoken language."</p><p>Gemma, the open-source model that leverages the same tech behind the Gemini models, is receiving version 2. The company highlights Gemma 2&apos;s revamped architecture for "breakthrough" performance and efficiencyâalongside new sizes. Gemma will soon pick up PaliGemma, a language model inspired by PaLI-3.</p>

<p>Google is taking its AI agents seriously as part of DeepMind&apos;s mission to be responsible and to ensure its helpfulness for the everyday user. The new universal AI agents the company has in store were created to process information faster by encoding video frames. Google adds that agents can combine speech and video to create a timeline of events and catch information relevant for recall.</p><p>DeepMind&apos;s work extends to implementing Google&apos;s speech models to help agents understand the context and quicken their response time during conversations.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-wave-of-video-and-image-generation-2">A new wave of video and image generation</h2>
<p>The other side of this substantial Gemini I/O 2024 update is Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-generative-ai-veo-imagen-3/">Veo and the new Imagen 3</a>. Veo is said to have an "advanced understanding of natural language and visual semantics..." The video generation model is also teased about having the ability to generate visuals that are close to the user&apos;s original idea.</p><p>Longer prompt understanding and capturing the right tone are also said to be in its wheelhouse.</p><p>Veo reportedly builds on Google&apos;s other video generation work like Generative Query Network (GQN), DVD-GAN, Imagen-Video, Phenaki, WALT, VideoPoet, and Lumiere. Beginning today (May 14), Google states Veo is available to "select" creators as a private preview through VideoFX. There&apos;s a waitlist creators must sign up for.</p><p>However, Google adds that there are plans to bring Veo to YouTube Shorts and "other products."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="itUbmDWojwRBzuhSguszf" name="google-io-2024-stage.jpg" alt="Google I/O 2024 stage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/itUbmDWojwRBzuhSguszf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Imagen 3&apos;s debut sees Google calling the model its "highest quality text-to-image model." Higher levels of detail, photorealism, lifelike images, and more are said to come from Imagen 3&apos;s capabilities. The text-to-image model can understand natural speech and the intent behind your prompt a little better than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-imagen-2-vertex-ai-debut">its predecessor</a>. Imagen 3 is also said to not skip out on those smaller details we might include in those longer prompts.</p><p>The next iteration of Google&apos;s text-to-image model is available today (May 14) for "select" creators through ImageFX as a private preview.

<ul><li>Verizon gets new AI tools to transform customer experience.</li><li>They are dubbed "Personal Research Assistant," "Fast Pass" resolution, "Segment of Me," "Problem Solver" and more.</li><li>These won't replace human jobs but rather assist them to save time and achieve complex tasks.</li></ul>
<p>Verizon announced today (May 14) that it will introduce nifty GenAI tools to transform the customer experience. The company promises that these tools won&apos;t replace human jobs but rather assist them in saving time and achieving complex tasks.</p><p>"These new tools make it simple to do business with Verizon and help reduce the cognitive load on our store and customer service partners," the company mentioned in its shared press release. First up in the lot is Personal Research Assistant, Verizon&apos;s personal assistant technology that promises to help frontline teams serve customers with accurate information by researching thousands of company&apos;s resources. These tools are believed to help its employees answer almost all queries that customers raise during support calls effectively and accurately.</p><p>Next comes the "Fast Pass" resolution, which claims to save customers precious time. It primarily uses AI to cleverly pair the customer to the relevant department or person quite easily, rather than getting assigned to a general customer representative. Additionally, Personal Shopper/Problem Solver is yet another time-saving tool for customers. It uses AI to instantly analyze a customer&apos;s profile and why they are calling. It will work alongside employees and give them a head start.</p>
<p>"Segment of Me" is another AI tool that helps customers get Verizon&apos;s personalized, unique offers and products. These can include new plans, product offers, and service upgrades, amongst others. Here, AI is promised to act accurately and proactively for customers regarding what they are looking for. Verizon notes that this increases engagement with customers, "lowered churn," and increases "overall revenue."</p><p>Brian Higgins, Chief Customer Experience Officer, Verizon Consumer, also notes, "AI is helping us not just meet expectations, but exceed them by showing our customers we&apos;ve got their back at every turn."</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-37">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>After picking up the pace with One UI 6.1 on older flagships, Samsung's now bringing the same update love to the Galaxy A54 and A34.</li><li>One UI 6.1 has been spotted hitting the Galaxy A54 in South Korea first, with a specific build number to look out for.</li><li>However, the update leaves out the full Galaxy AI experience and the latest May 2024 security patch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-restarts-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-s22-rollout">resuming its One UI 6.1 update for older flagships last week</a>, Samsung is now rolling out the same treatment for the Galaxy A54 and A34.</p><p>According to X user and well-known leaker Tarun Vats, Samsung has finally rolled out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6.1</a> update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a54-5g-review">Samsung Galaxy A54</a> in South Korea. The update comes with build numbers A546SKSU4CXDC, A546SSKC4CXDC, or A546SKSU4CXD1.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the same update rolled out in Poland and Europe with firmware version A546BXXU7CXDC, as per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/tarunvats33/status/1790229224382779718" target="_blank">same source</a>.</p><p>However, while the update brings advanced image editing tools and suggestions, it skips the Galaxy AI, which apparently remains reserved for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">flagship Samsung phones</a>, and the May 2024 security patch, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a54_and_a34_receive_one_ui_61_update-news-62840.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear if Samsung will release a separate update this month with the latest security patch.</p><p>At the very least, the rollout is happening, and more regions are likely next. We expect One UI 6.1 to roll out to the Galaxy A54 and A34 in other regions in the coming days.</p><p>The latest One UI version stands out because it has provided the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>, S23, and S22 with Galaxy AI. This AI helps with things like translating languages on the fly (Live Translate), searching the web with a tap (Circle to Search), and getting help with chats (Chat Assist), among others.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ai-more-past-gen-confirmed">Galaxy S21 also received Samsung&apos;s new AI</a> but only got a stripped-down version with Circle to Search.</p><p>Even though the update doesn&apos;t have all the fancy AI features from the pricey Galaxy S models, it shows Samsung is still giving love to its mid-range users with this software upgrade.</p><p>If you have a Galaxy A54 or A34 and live in the mentioned territories, you can download and install the new update by going to the Settings app, heading to <em>Software update</em>, and tapping <em>Download and install</em>.</p>
