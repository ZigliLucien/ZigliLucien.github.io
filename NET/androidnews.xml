<ul><li>Honor's new AI Defocus Eye Protection combats screen-induced eye strain and myopia by blurring peripheral vision while keeping the center clear.</li><li>The feature is claimed to reduce transient myopia by an average of 13 degrees, with some users seeing up to a 75-degree improvement.</li><li>Meanwhile, Honor also unveiled a new detection tech that uses AI to analyze eye contact, lighting, and image clarity in real time to detect deepfakes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor has introduced two new AI-driven features designed to keep users safe and healthy.</p><p>Honor showcased its new <em>AI Defocus Eye Protection</em> tech at MWC Shanghai. As its name implies, this new on-device feature uses AI to tackle the rising issue of screen-induced eye strain, with a special focus on combating myopia (nearsightedness).</p><p>The rapid increase in computer and mobile phone use in recent years has gone hand in hand with a worrying rise in global cases of myopia. This is largely due to the prolonged strain on our eyes from focusing on screens up close. Over time, this constant close-up viewing can cause the eyeball to elongate, leading to nearsightedness.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:875px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.57%;"><img id="PjHzDss3ygbYJ65FoNoTga" name="HONOR-AI-Defocus-Eye-Protection.png" alt="Honor AI Defocus Eye Protection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PjHzDss3ygbYJ65FoNoTga.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="875" height="425" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor&apos;s new feature is intended to replicate defocus glasses on your smartphone screen. Defocus glasses are great for your eyes because they blur your peripheral vision while keeping the center clear, helping reduce eye elongation.</p><p>While defocus glasses use corrective lenses, the exact workings of Honor&apos;s AI Defocus Eye Protection technology are still under wraps. However, Honor claims that this software solution can significantly reduce transient myopia in users, averaging a 13-degree reduction, with some seeing improvements up to 75 degrees.</p><p>The other feature is pretty intriguing. Honor claims it can detect fake content using AI by analyzing eye contact, lighting, and image clarity. It even works in real time to thwart video impersonation scams before they can do any damage.</p><p>In the AI era, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-and-universal-music-to-tackle-ai-deepfakes-in-music">deepfakes are increasingly problematic</a>. These realistic but fake media are hard to spot and pose a big online threat. Bad actors use them to hide identities, impersonate others, or create fake personas. This issue underscores the need for strong measures to protect against deepfake scams.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1357px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:41.34%;"><img id="34q2UvgchBrobLqszndSTa" name="HONOR-AI-Deepfake-Detection.png" alt="Honor AI Deepfake Detection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/34q2UvgchBrobLqszndSTa.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1357" height="561" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor says its AI deepfake detection scans video calls in just three seconds. If a fake is spotted, users get an instant on-screen warning, helping them avoid potential scams.</p><p>The company&apos;s deepfake detection runs on a carefully curated dataset of videos and images. This collection helps the AI spot common scam signs and subtle anomalies that reveal deepfakes.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear if these features work entirely on-device, but real-time deepfake detection likely needs an internet connection. The company also hasn&apos;t shared which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-honor-phones">Honor phones</a> will support these features or when they&apos;ll be available. More details should be coming soon.</p>

These days, I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-revodok-max-213-thunderbolt-4-dock-review">Revodok Max 213 docking station</a> connected to my machine, but I also use a portable dock mostly as a card reader, and that&apos;s where Dockcase&apos;s offering comes into the picture.</p><p>Dockcase managed to carve out a niche in this segment on the back of innovative designs, and its latest product is the Studio, an 8-in-1 USB-C hub. The Studio is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pocketssdenclosure/dockcase-studio-smart-usb-c-hub-8-in-1">being crowdfunded on Kickstarter</a> at the moment, and you can get your hands on the USB-C hub for $139. The retail price is set at $199, so you&apos;re saving $60 by backing the project right now.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9GdCey3o5XirYvWwZifran" name="dockcase-studio-7.jpg" alt="Dockcase Studio 8-in-1 USB-C Hub review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9GdCey3o5XirYvWwZifran.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Dockcase generally does a great job with the design of its hubs and docking stations, and that&apos;s no different with the Studio. The hub is made out of aluminum, and has a good heft to it. It has a grooved design at the bottom that ensures it stays planted on a desk, and it is small enough that you can easily carry it in a bag.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bxGTvQxYoGxQNiyZR78uin" name="dockcase-studio-8.jpg" alt="Dockcase Studio 8-in-1 USB-C Hub review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bxGTvQxYoGxQNiyZR78uin.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The chassis has a matte texture, but the top features a glossy coat, and it picks up smudges very easily. This is where you get the screen, and it is a unique addition; you can view all connected accessories, and it will show real-time stats — charging details, bandwidth, and so on.</p><p>The hub draws power via the USB-C host port, so it doesn&apos;t need any external power source. Dockcase bundles a carrying case with the Studio, but as I got an early testing unit, that wasn&apos;t included in the package. On that note, the only issue I have in this area is that the bundled 100W PD cable is short; Dockcase needs to start offering at least a 1m cable as standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uRSYxok4gK4cZvx7o54orn" name="dockcase-studio-9.jpg" alt="Dockcase Studio 8-in-1 USB-C Hub review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uRSYxok4gK4cZvx7o54orn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Studio is clearly aimed at content creators, as it has a unique selection of ports that&apos;s very different to what you get on every other USB-C hub. You get the standard card reader slots for SD and MicroSD cards, but then there are dedicated slots for CFExpress-A and CFExpress-B cards.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rfmcsnen7cHG2kh6UjM5Hk" name="dockcase-studio-1.jpg" alt="Dockcase Studio 8-in-1 USB-C Hub review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rfmcsnen7cHG2kh6UjM5Hk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That leaves just four regular ports, and you get one USB-A, one HDMI, and two USB-C connectors — a standard port and a PD option that provides up to 100W of power. It didn&apos;t have any issues charging the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO F6</a>, but the biggest issue with the hub is that you just don&apos;t get anywhere as many ports as other options in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WR6guQ26iKV6qqMvYjkFPo" name="dockcase-studio-10.jpg" alt="Dockcase Studio 8-in-1 USB-C Hub review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WR6guQ26iKV6qqMvYjkFPo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It would have been much better to get at least another USB-C or USB-A port, because as it stands, you don&apos;t get the ability to connect as many accessories to the Studio. Obviously, the advantage is that you can slot in just about any external memory card, so if you take a lot of photos and videos and use CFExpress in conjunction with SD cards, the Studio is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>I didn&apos;t see any problems in daily use; the Studio delivered the same reliable transfer rates as other docking stations when using an SD card. All USB ports are based on the USB 3.2 Gen 1 standard and deliver 5Gbps bandwidth, and I was able to maximize the bandwidth when connecting an external SSD to the hub.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yxeDRcEDyEed3y8WwYFzAn" name="dockcase-studio-6.jpg" alt="Dockcase Studio 8-in-1 USB-C Hub review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yxeDRcEDyEed3y8WwYFzAn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Navigating the screen is straightforward; you use gestures to dive in and out of menus, and because it uses a basic interface, there is some lag. You don&apos;t get any confirmation message when you change a setting either, and you&apos;ll need to power cycle the hub to see if the changes are present. A big part of the Studio&apos;s differentiation is the screen, and it also contributes to the cost — even at $139, it is significantly costlier than most USB-C hubs you can buy today.</p><p>That said, if you need a hub with a sturdy design and want CFExpress alongside MicroSD/SD card slots, the Studio is a great choice.</p>

<p>YouTube is experimenting with a new feature called "Hype" to boost community support for small content creators, available to viewers in select regions.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/281716083" target="_blank">community post</a>, YouTube says the new experimental feature lets viewers directly impact video rankings in the Explore section. With the Hype button under eligible videos, users can promote content they love and help it get discovered by more people.</p><p>Building on classic engagement metrics like likes and shares, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube</a> has rolled out the new feature for viewers in Brazil, Turkey, and Taiwan. This new tool lets viewers boost the visibility of a video published in the past seven days. Hyped videos get a ranking lift in the Explore section, with their prominence growing based on the number of hype endorsements they receive.</p><p>Currently, viewers have access to various methods to support creators. Besides liking and sharing, they can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-adds-collabs-livestreaming">Super Chat and Super Stickers for direct financial contributions</a>, adding to the ad revenue that creators earn.</p><p>YouTube&apos;s new feature takes a different approach by focusing on boosting smaller creators. Unlike past initiatives, Hype votes only affect a video&apos;s ranking in the Explore tab, not the Trending section. This helps new creators get discovered without being overshadowed by big, established channels.</p><p>For the time being, the feature is only available to a select group of YouTube Partner Program creators with less than 500,000 subscribers. Although it&apos;s not clear if it will be rolled out more widely, YouTube stresses that Hype votes are an extra ranking signal, separate from the main algorithm.</p><p>It&apos;s important to remember that content must follow <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-notes-pilot-launch">YouTube&apos;s community guidelines</a> to benefit from the Hype feature. The next few weeks will be a trial period for this new initiative, with possible tweaks based on viewer feedback.</p>

<p>We&apos;re expecting quite a stacked event this summer as Samsung prepares to debut the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>. The company showed off the device during MWC 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-may-last-almost-ten-days">and confirmed</a> some key specifications. Dr Hon Pak, head of the digital health team at Samsung informed the press that the Galaxy Ring&apos;s battery is estimated to last between "five and nine days."</p><p>A close-up of the Galaxy Ring highlighted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ring-eyes-on-mwc-2024">its various finishes</a>, such as gold, platinum silver, and ceramic black. Samsung stated that it&apos;s strongly focused on tracking a user&apos;s fitness data through its first smart ring. The company also claimed that its wearable weighs roughly "half" of its competitor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, we&apos;re (not so) patiently awaiting the reveal of Samsung&apos;s next foldables: the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6. EVP and Head of R&D Mobile Experience, Won-Joon Choi, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-ai-experience-optimized-upcoming-foldable-teased">teased in June</a> that an "optimized" Galaxy AI experience will arrive for its clamshell and book-style devices. Samsung sees both devices as "versatile" and "flexible."</p><p>Specifics on what we could expect were kept quiet. However, Samsung&apos;s EVP stated that Galaxy AI&apos;s "Live Translate" will expand to third-party <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging apps</a>. This could mean that those who frequent WhatsApp and Telegram could gain a Galaxy AI boost.</p>

<ul><li>Amazon is reportedly considering a paid tier for its Alexa voice assistant, which could cost between $5 and $10 per month. </li><li>The new AI assistant could be called “Remarkable Alexa” and feature enhanced artificial intelligence-based features.</li><li>Amazon would be joining the likes of Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI in asking consumers to pay a premium for AI software.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Artificial intelligence sparked a big period of investment in the technology following the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Companies want to spend money on research and development for AI to appease investors wanting to know what they’re doing to capitalize on the industry‘s latest buzzword. </p><p>Now that the investment period has been underway for well over a year for many companies, there’s one thing left to do, and that’s monetize it. And if you’ve been following the tech industry lately, companies have a clear preference for monetizing AI through subscriptions.</p><p>OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft already have paid subscriptions that provide exclusive features to those that pay extra. All three companies also have free versions that anyone can access without paying a cent. In ChatGPT’s case, without even creating an account. However, these companies all think their subscription services provide enough value to justify the extra monthly cost.</p><p>Amazon might be joining that list this year, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-mulls-5-10-monthly-price-tag-unprofitable-alexa-service-ai-revamp-2024-06-21/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> last week. The outlet says they spoke to multiple people with knowledge of the matter, and they shared Amazon’s possible plans to charge for a future version of Alexa. Like many of the companies and services listed above, there‘s a free version of Alexa that can be accessed through the app and with Echo smart speakers and displays. </p><p>Once again, Amazon is hoping that this new version of Alexa — dubbed “Remarkable Alexa,“ per the report, and supercharged with AI — will be worth paying for. Reuters says that Remarkable Alexa would cost a minimum of $5, but it could cost $10. Interestingly, Amazon isn’t considering bundling Remarkable Alexa with Amazon Prime. The company has taken this approach in the past, choosing to raise the price of Prime and add features rather than create multiple subscription services. </p><p>We don’t know a lot about what Remarkable Alexa will look like, and it could never see the light of day. However, in a 2023 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-2023-letter-to-shareholders" target="_blank">letter to shareholders</a>, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy mentioned Alexa as it relates to generative AI.</p><p>”We’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business,” Jassy wrote. “These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant), to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural language prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), to customer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others.”</p><p>The report notes that Remarkable Alexa could order food for delivery or compose an email, which sounds a lot like what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit tried (and failed) to do with the R1</a> and its large action model (LAM). Regardless of what this new version of Alexa looks like, it’s hard to see how or why people would pay a monthly fee for it. </p>
<h2 id="amazon-could-be-making-the-wrong-move-2">Amazon could be making the wrong move</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kphcFCckQcAUodiGSHTP75" name="echo-dot-with-clock-4th-gen-1.jpg" alt="Echo Dot With Clock 4th Gen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kphcFCckQcAUodiGSHTP75.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Amazon does intend to proceed with this pricing model and strategy for Remarkable Alexa, it would be a big mistake. Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI all have niche features and top-of-the-line LLMs that justify the subscription costs for some users. Google has Android and Workspace integration, Microsoft has Windows and 365 integration, and OpenAI has the GPT Store and multimodal GPT-4o. For now, Amazon doesn’t have anything that comes close to those offerings, and Remarkable Alexa wouldn’t change that.</p><p>At the end of the day, Alexa is just a voice assistant. Amazon should be looking to what Apple is doing with Siri and Apple Intelligence instead of trying to mimic the subscription-based model of other companies. Apple isn’t charging for Apple Intelligence — every device that supports it will automatically get on-device processing, Private Cloud Compute processing, and ChatGPT outsourcing for free. </p><p>Apple isn’t charging for Apple Intelligence because it doesn’t need to. Apple Intelligence isn’t the product; the iPhone is the product — and all the AI features are just the means to the end, which is selling more iPhones. The same can be said about Apple Intelligence for iPad and Mac. </p><p>Amazon can and should copy this strategy. It could make Remarkable Alexa a truly competitive voice assistant with AI and use that to sell its own products. The company already has the Rufus chatbot to help users buy products on Amazon, and I’m sure that e-commerce will be a big part of Remarkable Alexa, too. But more than that, an enhanced Alexa could be paired with new hardware and Prime memberships to add value. </p><p>I’m never a fan of subscription price hikes, though I suspect Prime members would accept a $5 or $10 price increase because the plan still offers a lot of value. I’m not so sure how many Alexa users would pay that same $5 or $10 extra for a standalone Remarkable Alexa subscription.</p><p>Amazon is late to the AI party, and that comes with an advantage. It‘s starting to see what other companies have tried, what works, and what doesn’t. Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google have all tried paid subscriptions, and their free versions are still much more popular. Meanwhile, the early opinions on Apple Intelligence seem to be overwhelmingly positive. </p><p>I wouldn‘t pay for an Alexa subscription, no matter the price or what features were included. And for that matter, I can’t think of <em>anyone</em> who would.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you want to trade in your current smartwatch for something brand new; you&apos;re shopping for a smartwatch on a budget; you enjoy using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung smartwatches</a>.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you already use one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> and you don&apos;t want to downgrade; you want to avoid the hassle of a trade-in; you prefer using LTE smartwatches (only the Bluetooth version is available at this time). </p><p>Designed to be a "fan edition" watch, the Galaxy Watch FE packs loads of popular wearable features into a simple, budget-friendly device. You get deep health and fitness monitoring insights with all of the powerful sensors that made Galaxy watches so famous, plus a 1.2-inch Super AMOLED display, 100 pre-installed workout modes, and the same Sapphire Crystal Glass construction that goes into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>. </p><p>Now, as with all of Samsung&apos;s FE devices, it&apos;s important to remember that the Galaxy Watch FE isn&apos;t meant to be the most groundbreaking smartwatch on the planet. If you&apos;re looking for that, you&apos;d be better off purchasing the aforementioned Galaxy Watch 6 or Watch 6 Classic (or even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>). But if you want a straightforward, brand-new device that won&apos;t break the bank, the Galaxy Watch FE is for you — <em>especially </em>if you can get it with a $100 discount. </p>

<ul><li>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 40mm smartwatch comes in cream and was spotted in an Amazon listing.</li><li>Alongside the price and availability, the listing also confirms a 128GB storage option.</li><li>The upcoming Galaxy Watch 7 will use a 3nm chip and sports a host of AI features, per the listing.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 series will likely be released at next month&apos;s Unpacked event launch, which will likely happen on July 10, although Samsung needs to confirm it officially. Meanwhile, a Canadian Amazon listing has already revealed the Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s pricing.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://passionategeekz.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-amazon-listing-revealed-features-and-pricing-ahead-of-launch/">PassionateGeekz</a>, the said Amazon listing showcases the regular Galaxy Watch 7 Bluetooth variant featuring 40mm size and a price tag of CAD 358 (~$268). It further confirms that the smartwatch will feature a round-shaped display and sport at least 128GB of storage. It will be powered by a 3nm SoC that promises to boost power efficiency and carry out smoother all-round operations.</p>

<p>There is BioActiveSensor that carries out users&apos; health tracking features like heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen levels — during workouts, sleep with sleep quality analysis, and more. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> will also have the goodness of AI, and as the description points out, "Personalized Daily AI Companion for AI-Powered Sleep, Exercises, and communication." </p><p>Additionally, users also get to use the Galaxy AI smart reply, which can give reply suggestions when texting from the smartwatch. It also includes an AI-based tone suggestion for replies that lets users know how they sound while having a conversation.</p>
<p>Another crucial detail of the aforementioned Amazon listing is the availability of the Galaxy Watch 7 in Cream (probably one of the multiple color options). The smartwatch will be delivered as early as July 16, corroborating the earlier leak and reaffirming that the launch happened earlier than the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> series.</p><p>The latest appearance follows the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fcc-listings-foreshadow-galaxy-watch-7-series-and-budget-galaxy-watch-fe">FCC listings</a> of the Galaxy Watch 7 series and the supposed Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-watch-7-ultra-specs-fcc-listing">FCC spotting</a>, which is all set to take on Apple Watch Ultra models.

<p>A new report claims Netflix is thinking about debuting a new free variant of its streaming services but for a select few areas.</p><p>According to information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-23/netflix-s-advertising-challenge-it-isn-t-big-enough">Bloomberg</a>, Netflix has held internal discussions about debuting a free, ad-supported plan (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/netflix-free-plan-3454100/">Android Authority</a>). If this happens, those "familiar" with the plan have stated it would apply to viewers in Europe and Asia. Rumors add that this plan could debut in large markets within those regions like Germany and Japan with "popular free TV networks."</p><p>This new plan reportedly deals with Netflix&apos;s scramble to find additional ways to "increase its audience."</p><p>However, the publication&apos;s sources claim that there are no plans to bring a plan of this capacity to U.S. consumers. Netflix "already reaches the majority of its potential customer base" in the region, thus making a move like this unnecessary.</p><p>The post highlights a similar move Netflix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-launches-free-plan-in-kenya">made in Kenya</a> in 2021 before discontinuing it. The most notable difference now is the addition of ads, as consumers in Kenya could watch shows and movies without them. The free plan offered personalized recommendations, parental controls, and profile creation options.</p><p>Sources add that these internal talks are still in their infancy, meaning things can go either way from here.</p><p>In other news, Netflix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-teases-price-hike-2024-plan">detailed its plans for 2024</a>, which include a (definite) price hike despite achieving a record revenue quarter. It seems as though the company is seeking help from its customers to pay for its larger endeavors with streaming. Netflix&apos;s $5 billion deal with the WWE for the next 10 years was given as an example, alluding to a new trend moving forward.</p><p>Unfortunately, Netflix hasn&apos;t yet detailed the specifics of its impending price hike for 2024.</p><p>What is certain is that the company plans to roll out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-highlights-smart-tv-home-screen-changes">a revamped UI</a> for smart TVs. During an interview with Netflix&apos;s senior director of products, Pat Flemming, it was confirmed that the new UI will help viewers see what&apos;s most important when scrolling over shows and movies. The new UI will place a quick preview, description, number of episodes, and more directly on the content card.</p>

<ul><li>Google's Gemini AI is now integrated into Gmail on both web and mobile platforms, offering AI-powered email assistance.</li><li>In the web version of Gmail, Gemini appears in a sidebar with suggestions like "Summarize this email," "List action items," and "Suggest a reply."</li><li>On mobile, a top button enables quick email summaries.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google just announced that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a>, which offers AI-powered email assistance, is now available in Gmail on both the web and mobile apps.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/06/gemini-in-side-panel-of-gmail.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Google introduced a bunch of AI features for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gmail-android-how-to">Gmail</a>. The big news is that the "Summarize this email" feature is now available on both iOS and Android. With Gemini&apos;s help, you can quickly shrink down long email threads or get help drafting replies. But Gemini is more than just a summarizer—it also lets you ask questions and dig up specific information from your inbox and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a> files.</p><p>Google has taken a big step forward by upgrading Gmail with its latest AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-15-pro-side-panel-rolling-out-now-for-google-workspace-labs-testers">Gemini 1.5 Pro</a>. This enhanced version comes with three major improvements: a significantly larger memory for context, a deeper understanding of information, and super-fast processing speeds.</p><p>In Gmail’s web version, Gemini appears in a sidebar on the right, next to your emails. This sidebar kicks things off with several handy suggestions like "Summarize this email," "List action items from this email," and "Suggest a reply to this email."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1546px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.37%;"><img id="FhiAmyKXcfzok4VxL4FXLK" name="gmail-ask-gemini-feature.png" alt="Gemini side panel in gmail on the web" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FhiAmyKXcfzok4VxL4FXLK.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1546" height="887" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the prompts are a great way to get started, Gemini’s real strength is in answering your direct questions. Don’t feel limited by the suggested options; you can have a natural conversation with Gemini and ask it anything about your emails.</p><p>The company is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/06/gemini-in-side-panel-of-google-docs-sheets-slides-drive.html" target="_blank">expanding</a> the Gemini side panel to include Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drive. In Docs, this handy tool will aid in polishing your prose, offering summaries, recommending tweaks, and creatively generating new content from your other files.</p><p>In Sheets, Gemini assists with creating tables, generating formulas, and explaining various functions step-by-step. In Slides, it can help you produce custom images and summarize presentations. Meanwhile, Drive can summarize multiple documents at once without opening them individually.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:350px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="HyWNUqjttnqHFQjc2JJiWc" name="Gmail-summarize-this-email.jpg" alt="Gemini summarize this email feature on gmail for android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HyWNUqjttnqHFQjc2JJiWc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="350" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, the mobile experience lacks a side panel, but a conveniently placed button at the top of your emails lets you quickly generate summaries. In the future, Gmail will offer contextual smart replies—one-tap responses tailored to your conversations. Plus, Gmail Q&A will soon allow you to find information within your emails using natural language queries.</p><p>Keep in mind that these advanced AI features are available to Google Workspace customers with specific subscription plans. If you have Google One AI Premium, the Gemini Business/Enterprise, or Gemini Education/Education Premium add-ons, you&apos;ll be able to use this functionality.</p>

<ul><li>Meta is working on a massive UI update for the Meta Quest line, allowing users to place windows anywhere in 3D space, as well as resize and reshape them.</li><li>The beta July v67 system update includes a new experimental feature for window management.</li><li>It's expected that Meta will launch the new major update in time for Connect 2024 and the Meta Quest 3s launch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s almost July and you know what that means! A new Meta Quest update has begun rolling out to beta testers and it includes the new UI update that Meta teased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-mysterious-new-ui-ad">back at the end of May</a>.</p><p>The July v67 Meta Quest update includes a new experimental feature that lets users treat windows more like they were on a traditional desktop computer with the added advantage of moving them around in 3D space! Users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1dnsdzi/quest_3_ptc_v67_new_windows_design/">on Reddit</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@lostinartmagic/post/C8ou8FlKSl0?xmt=AQGzHF-M7XxZ9Ziq_w4r0xcb1r-m0VQGfuEMlD-yLa-vPg">Threads</a> have already begun posting about it, showing off all the capabilities of the new experimental feature.</p><p>The update seems to add two major changes to window management. First, users can now launch apps in windowed mode and move them anywhere they want. Previously, only three apps could run at a time and would have to be snapped into one of three predetermined locations side-by-side, similar to a standard triple-monitor computer setup.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meta Quest OS v67 PTC has finally done it...🔗 https://t.co/L7i2lUWS8i 🔗 pic.twitter.com/rb7hBPS9lu<a href="https://twitter.com/Lunayian/status/1805434151111110805">June 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Now, windowed apps like the Quest browser, Threads, YouTube, and others can be moved around and placed anywhere. You can also move windows forward and backward in space, allowing windows to be placed in front of or behind one another. This works well for spacing windows around a room for a better mixed-reality setup.</p><p>The new UI now allows up to six apps to run at once: three pinned and three floating. Apps can be dragged to appear to be placed on walls, as well, giving them similarities to window management on Apple Vision Pro.</p><p>Windows can also be resized and reshaped in any way you like. Grabbing a window from the bottom right corner and dragging it out will resize it, allowing users to change not only the size of the window but also its shape. That means apps aren&apos;t confined to running in traditional "landscape" or "portrait" modes like a mobile app usually would.</p><p>If you&apos;d like to test the new features, you must be enrolled in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/using-your-headset/quest-ptc/">Meta Quest PTC</a> beta update channel. Once that&apos;s done, you&apos;ll eventually get the update when it rolls out to your headset. Meta updates headsets in waves, so not all users get the same update simultaneously. My Quest 3 still doesn&apos;t have the update despite being enrolled in the PTC group, so you may need to wait a while for it.</p>
