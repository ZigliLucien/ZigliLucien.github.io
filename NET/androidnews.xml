<p>Folks might remember when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the virtual stage in 2021 and debuted the Metaverse. During the unveiling, one of the keystone examples was a vision of at-home workouts with real coaches that can be virtually placed in your home, lending the authenticity and personability these platforms currently lack.</p><p>Surprisingly, Meta isn&apos;t going to be the company that actually invents this, despite ushering in the vision. Instead, that honor will go to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.alomoves.com/">Alo Moves</a>, an online on-demand "movement and mindfulness" platform that&apos;s currently creating a new high-tech mixed reality app for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> that&apos;s co-developed with the Oscar-winning visual effects studio, Magnopus.</p><p>The Alo Moves Quest 3 app will give at-home yoga fans to virtually see a life-sized instructor in their own home, recreated in lifelike three-dimensional space thanks to a unique volumetric capture method. This will allow players to not only move around the coach as they might in real life but also to use the power of mixed reality and "shrink" the coach so they can be placed anywhere in the room for easy reference during movement and mindfulness sessions.</p><p>The concept of this is very similar to what we saw in Zuckerberg&apos;s initial unveiling of Metaverse concepts, which would provide the tools for people to experience virtual activities in a way that feels more like an in-person event.</p><p>Alo Moves will deliver regular five to twenty-four minute classes with real instructors similar to Supernatural, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games/5">best Meta Quest 3 exercise apps</a>, but the key difference is that the coach will be in your home rather than in a virtual environment. That ensures that folks feel comfortable and safe since they can see their surroundings while still being able to focus on the workout.</p><p>Alo Moves XR is currently listed as coming soon and can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5379012005560059">wishlisted on the Meta Horizon store</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Magic Leap and Google announced that the two companies are entering a "multi-faceted, strategic technology partnership."</li><li>The announcement doesn't get into specifics, but it likely means new hardware from Magic Leap made for Google's upcoming Android XR platform.</li><li>This marks one of several major XR partnerships between Google and other technology providers like Samsung.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The mixed reality wars are heating up, and the latest partnership announcement between Google and Magic Leap further proves it. Magic Leap announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.magicleap.com/newsroom/magic-leap-and-google-partnership">on the company&apos;s blog</a> that it would enter a new, multi-faceted strategic technology partnership with Google to "expand the long-standing relationship between the two companies."</p><p>Magic Leap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.magicleap.com/magic-leap-2">currently makes</a> augmented reality glasses that are used in commercial and enterprise spaces for things like virtual training, manufacturing, and demonstrations, among other things. While the announcement doesn&apos;t specifically announce new hardware, the company says that "Magic Leap’s leadership in optics and manufacturing" will be combined with Google&apos;s technology platforms to "foster the future of the XR ecosystem with unique and innovative product offerings."</p><p>At Google I/O 2024, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">quickly demonstrated</a> a new pair of AR glasses that use the new Project Astra AI platform. The demonstration was short but impressive, showing how AI could be used on a pair of mixed-reality glasses to help people solve problems and even remember where they left things like car keys and glasses. It&apos;s not known if these glasses are just internal prototypes at Google or something to have to do with this Magic Leap partnership.</p><p>Android Central has contacted Google to obtain additional information about this partnership, but they did not respond in time for publication. We will update the article once we hear back.</p><p>Google is already an investor in Magic Leap, so the partnership makes sense given Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">renewed sense of interest</a> in XR after the debut of the Apple Vision Pro. Magic Leap has been making AR glasses for years, so it makes sense for Google to partner with a company that already has experience in the space in order for it to build out its expected upcoming Android XR platform.</p><p>Google is already in another partnership with Samsung to deliver the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung XR headset</a>, expected to debut later this year. Meanwhile, Quest 3 maker Meta recently announced that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">would partner with companies</a> like Xbox, Lenovo, and Asus ROG to create new headsets using its own Horizon OS.</p>

<ul><li>An APK dive into the Samsung Find app seemingly highlights a "Lost Mode" for the Galaxy Ring.</li><li>Strings in the code suggest users can make the ring produce light from its body for relocation purposes so long as their phone can still reach it.</li><li>Samsung has also seemingly worked in security measures by locking a user's ring to their Samsung account so no one else can use it.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>One of Samsung&apos;s apps has supposedly spilled some juicy details about its smart ring&apos;s rediscoverability if it was misplaced.</p><p>According to an APK deep dive by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-ring-lost-mode-3447019/">Android Authority</a>, the Samsung Find app seemingly contains information about a "Lost Mode" for the Galaxy Ring. Strings in the code suggest the Galaxy Ring will feature a light on its body, which will blink so users find it. A few string examples include "Tap start to make the light on your ring blink" and "Ring light is blinking."</p><p>Another string will appear if your phone can&apos;t reach the Galaxy Ring. The example reads, "couldn&apos;t connect to Ring to start blinking."</p><p>The publication&apos;s APK findings show that users must first enable "Lost Mode" through the Samsung Find app. There also appears to be a security feature on the way that locks a user&apos;s Samsung account in the app so mischievous individuals can&apos;t grab your ring data.</p><p>Similarly, there&apos;s another security measure for the ring embedded in the code: "this ring will be locked to your Samsung account. No one else will be able to use it."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:562px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.76%;"><img id="3pU5wvccEpz5fzBZotitkA" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-lost-mode-light.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Ring might feature a "Lost Mode" that produces a light from the ring's body for relocation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3pU5wvccEpz5fzBZotitkA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="562" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What&apos;s curious about the ring&apos;s secure lock to a user&apos;s Samsung account is that it seems useful for data protection (presumably) without compromise. The publication reiterates that the Oura ring features "data protection" to an extent, as the device will lock itself down in "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025592293-Transfer-Your-Oura-Data-to-a-New-Phone">Restricted Mode</a>." This activates if the device, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Gen 3 Ring</a>, is trying to connect to another phone.</p><p>Unfortunately, Oura&apos;s method of safeguarding your ring&apos;s data involves a full data wipe (factory reset) if it senses a new device pair attempt.</p><p>With this discovery coming from the Find app, it seems Samsung is continuing to prepare for the Galaxy Ring&apos;s launch later this year. We&apos;ve also heard of a "Lost Mode" before, as Samsung highlighted it during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-2-announcement">Galaxy SmartTag</a> launch in October. The mode is also used to relocate a handful of other Galaxy devices.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring made its expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-fcc-listing-cradle-specs-confirmed">debut at the FCC</a> for certification purposes two days ago, and with it came some important details. From its listing, the device was confirmed to arrive in nine different variants (ring size), and the battery capacities for each size were detailed. Additionally, the FCC&apos;s database offered a look at the device&apos;s charging "cradle." Not much else about it was learned through the lackluster mock-up.</p><p>Samsung is preparing for its summer Unpacked event, rumored to take place on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

<ul><li>Instagram is rolling out an update for Notes today (May 30), which makes good on a few teasers the company highlighted in April.</li><li>Prompts interact more with a user's Note, letting others provide their text-based or emoji response to an open question or statement.</li><li>Users can now tag their friends in a Note, which will immediately notify them.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta announced that users should prepare for some new features to hit Instagram Notes today (May 30).</p><p>As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MetaNewsroom/status/1796212308353421372">post on X</a>, Instagram is rolling out three new updates for its social Notes feature, which might help users elevate their quick posts. Firstly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-new-collaborative-features-notes-group-profiles">Notes</a> is finally picking up "Prompts." The idea is to encourage more interaction between a user and their followers. From your DM&apos;s page, users can start a prompt — which can be a question or anything to get the conversation going.</p><p>Others can tap on it on their respective DM&apos;s page and submit their text response or an emoji. Everyone who has responded will be represented by their profile icon with their response to the prompt nestled above it in a cute thought bubble.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With new Notes features, it’s even easier to connect with friends on @instagram. pic.twitter.com/t1euMfWiCg<a href="https://twitter.com/MetaNewsroom/status/1796212308353421372">May 30, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>When it comes to basic Notes, Instagram is bringing more interactability to it via "likes." After setting your mood, others who can see it can leave a "like," visible by a heart. Users can do so by tapping the heart icon in the reply field or double-tapping the Note itself. The original poster can tap their mood and see a comprehensive list of users who&apos;ve left a like on their Note.</p><p>Moreover, there&apos;s a three-dot menu beside each user for extra options and Instagram&apos;s Messenger icon to initiate a chat.</p><p>Notes are also picking up friend tags. When writing their Note, users can use "@" to tag a friend of theirs and continue writing their mood. The one you&apos;ve tagged will be notified once you post the Note.</p><p>Lastly, it seems that Instagram has also started displaying a user&apos;s Note from the DM&apos;s page on their profile page. This was a feature the company teased back in April, and it was still part of the features that were "coming soon." Now, users will notice their Notes above their profile picture inside of a thought bubble. Users can tap the bubble to delete it, write a new one, or see who left a heart.</p><p>It appears that Instagram is slowly rolling out these three updates for Notes starting today (May 30). Our internal tests show that the "like," tagging and profile blurbs are present on Android. However, we&apos;re still waiting for "prompts" to appear.</p><p>In April, Instagram detailed quite a few updates for its social Notes feature, one of which was "prompts." The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-cutouts-notes-additions-detailed">company stated</a> that it was still on the way, and we&apos;ve now approached a point where it&apos;s finally rolling out. Cutouts were another big feature in April, giving users an extra, fun way of using their own photos as stickers in Stories.</p>

But with limited software and security support, it’s more a transition phone between devices that you’ll only keep for a couple years.</p></p>

With many of the same AI features you’ll find in the bigger sister Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro along with impressive specs and great cameras, plus seven years of software and security updates result in better bang for your buck.</p></p>

<p>Looking for a decent, affordable phone that still boasts premium features? It sounds like a unicorn-type scenario, but thankfully, many manufacturers are coming out with solid devices for affordable prices that look, feel, and operate like more expensive variants, with a few concessions, of course. Among these are the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 and Google Pixel 8a. Both are relatively new entries in the company’s respective lines that won’t break the bank but will provide a pretty fabulous experience.</p><p>So how do they compare to each other, and which one is right for you? We’re here to help.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-design-and-basics-2">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: Design and basics</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Re3uEovYxxPtXk3gDCuByW" name="moto g stylus 5g 2024 in hand.jpg" alt="Moto G Stylus 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Re3uEovYxxPtXk3gDCuByW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First, let’s see how these two phones compare in terms of design, materials, and basic specs.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 comes in Caramel Latte or Scarlet Wave and boasts a massive 6.7-inch 2,400 x 1,080 FHD+ pOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. However, it taps out at 1,200 nits peak brightness. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">his review</a>, Derrek Lee says the phone is “incredibly vibrant,” even when used in Natural color mode (there are also Radiant and Vivid color modes). He does, however, find that the panel offers a bit too much contrast, sometimes resulting in darker parts of images and videos being a little <em>too</em> dark. </p><p>Covered in 2.5D glass with vegan leather (read: plastic) body, it has an IP52 water-repellent design, which means it isn’t quite as durable as the Google Pixel 8a. But with a protective case and some caution, you should be fine with light sprays in the rain: just no accidental dunks! Lee says the phone does a great job overall, not only in terms of its design but also performance, to “emulate the flagship experience while retaining its low price tag.” </p><p>With standard 256GB built-in storage (or 128GB on certain models), this phone offers a rarity with devices of late: a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot so you can expand storage up to 2TB. If you plan to take lots of photos and videos and download apps, this could sway your decision. It runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> with a promise of only one major software update and three years of security updates. This could be the deciding factor between these two phones, especially when you consider how long Google supports its Pixels in comparison. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>There's a lot to like about the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024, as noted in our review.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Battery life is a crucial feature, and this phone has a sizeable 5,000mAh battery that affords up to 40 hours per charge. Plus, it supports 30W TurboPower charging (double that of last year’s model) and 15W wireless charging with a separately purchased charger (it works with any Qi-enabled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">wireless charger</a>). There are also a few settings options for conserving battery life that are worth exploring if you find you need more in a pinch. </p><p>In terms of other basics specs, you get dual stereo speakers with support for Dolby Atmos, a nice inclusion given that this is a mid-level priced phone; two mics, FM radio, and yes, it even has a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you can connect your old pair of wired earbuds or headphones. There’s also an in-display fingerprint sensor, a nice departure from the usual side-mounted sensor in other Motorola phones, along with face unlock. </p><p>Of course, let’s not forget the phone&apos;s standout feature, which is noted in its name: the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 comes with a built-in stylus so you can perform certain tasks with more precision and give your finger a break. It’s thicker than previous-gen models but functions much the same. Lee says he doesn’t use the stylus enough to consider it a make-or-break feature. It’s a nice-to-have but not a need-to-have feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hFDQajQ6opEiPmzjpfmXeg" name="google-pixel-8a-ai-wallpaper.jpg" alt="AI wallpaper on a Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFDQajQ6opEiPmzjpfmXeg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By comparison, the Google Pixel 8a is the new budget option in the Pixel line, with similar features to the more expensive Pixel 8 but with a lower price tag. It has a smaller 6.1-inch Actua OLED display with the same 2,400 x 1,080 resolution and 120Hz along with 1,400 nits brightness in HDR and up to 2,000 nits peak brightness, so you can confidently use it outdoors without worrying you won’t be able to see the screen. </p><p>The screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 with a fingerprint-resistant coating, so you’ll find it more durable than the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024. This is also thanks to the higher IP67 water and dust-resistance rating. </p><p>Made of matte composite with a matte aluminum frame, it comes in Obsidian, Porcelain, Bay (a first for an A-series phone), and the limited-edition Aloe finish. Nicholas Sutrich says in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">his initial Pixel 8a review</a> that the phone is comfortable to hold and quite simply “looks nice” with its rounded corners. In fact, he says it’s his new favorite design of all the latest Pixel phones. </p><p>The Google Pixel 8a also comes with either 128GB or 256GB storage, but the differentiator here is that you can’t add more via microSD card since there’s no expansion slot. You do get a trial for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> cloud storage, though this is only temporary unless you’re willing to pay to continue to subscription once the free trial period is over. </p><p>Running Android 14 as well, Google future-proofs your purchase by offering a whopping <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-many-updates-will-the-pixel-8a-receive">seven years of OS and security updates</a> along with a consistent stream of Feature Drops. So, from the perspective of longevity, there’s more confidence that this phone won’t be outdated in a few years than the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024. Plus, the Pixel 8a will hold its value should you decide to upgrade and want to trade it in or resell it down the line. </p><p>The battery is slightly smaller at 4,492mAh, and it is rated to last for more than a day as well. An Extreme Battery Saver mode can extend life up to 72 hours when in a pinch. It, too, supports both fast and wireless charging. </p><p>Along with face and fingerprint unlock, you get stereo speakers with two mics and noise suppression but no Spatial Audio. There’s no headphone jack, so keep that in mind: for personal listening, you will need a pair of wireless headphones or a Type-C USB adapter.</p>

<h2 id="moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-vs-google-pixel-8a-power-and-processing-2">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 vs. Google Pixel 8a: Power and processing</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2LrRBGaemU4H6kmnZ5FkpW" name="moto g stylus 5g 2024 woman.jpg" alt="Moto G Stylus 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LrRBGaemU4H6kmnZ5FkpW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes down to it, it’s what’s on the inside that counts, right? And both these phones have great specs to delight casual users. </p><p>As noted, the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 runs on Android 14 out of the box. It also has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-6-gen-1-snapdragon-4-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 6 Gen 1</a> processor, which isn’t the most powerful (it’s the same chip that was in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2023</a>), but it will keep up with basic tasks like web surfing, streaming videos, and music, and even gaming. </p><p>This pairs with the 8GB RAM, up from 6GB in last year’s model. This is expandable up to 16GB using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">RAM Boost</a> feature, which uses the phone’s internal storage as virtual memory when needed. The trade-off is you have less storage when you’re using it. Lee doesn’t see a point in using it and hasn’t run into issues with gaming leveraging the 8GB RAM and Snapdragon processor alone. It’s quite impressive in this respect. </p><p>With Google being so heavily involved in AI technology, it’s no surprise that even its entry-level device gets plenty of AI features. You will not see anything of the sort with the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 beyond being able to access the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a> from the device and do cool things like create AI wallpapers. But it has some unique features of its own, typically relating to use of the built-in stylus. </p><p>There’s Moto Note app, for example, for jotting down notes without having to unlock the phone. There’s also a cool feature that lets you make a drawing with the stylus and add an effect, then turn it into an animated illustration. But that’s pretty much all you find when it comes to frills in this phone. </p><p>However, you do get secure protection through ThinkShield for mobile. Additionally, Ready For integration is upgraded to Smart Connect, so you can easily connect the phone to a PC or external display to mirror contents, use it as a second screen, move files, share peripherals, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kqdoMnSdPVJLr9E3JGXZpG" name="google-pixel-8a-multitask-pixel-tips-01.jpg" alt="Multitasking on the Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kqdoMnSdPVJLr9E3JGXZpG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also loaded with Android 14 (but, as noted, plenty of software and security support far beyond that), the Google Pixel 8a is powered by the Google Tensor G3 chip, the same as its bigger siblings. It offers 8GB RAM, enough to meet most users’ needs for a mid-range phone. </p><p>Like its bigger sisters, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>, the Google Pixel 8a has lots of AI features, including Circle to Search (search for images by circling them right from the app you’re in), the Gemini built-in AI assistant, Pixel Call Assist, Call Screen, Direct My Call, Hold for Me, Clear Calling, and other features. A fun new feature called Audio Emoji lets you create your own soundtrack audio effects during a call, like applause or laughing. </p><p>As with other Pixel devices, the Google Pixel 8a is protected with plenty of security, including VPN by Google One, the Tensor security core, Titan M2 security chip, and anti-malware and phishing protection. With Family Link, you can manage privacy settings for kids and do things like establish screen time limits and share location. </p><p>While it’s considered the “budget” option in the line, the Pixel 8a’s features and price suggest more mid-range. Sutrich says this phone reflects Google’s “best mid-range hardware yet, further blurring the line between the company’s flagship ‘premium’ offerings and this mid-range winner.” He singles out the thermal management as well, noting that the Pixel 8a performs better than even the Pixel 8 Pro in benchmarks, making it a good phone for intense activities like gaming, too.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-vs-google-pixel-8a-the-cameras-2">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 vs. Google Pixel 8a: The cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FcpHHRNfMw7nf4EJ4xHVRM" name="moto g stylus 5g 2024 camera.jpg" alt="Moto G Stylus 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FcpHHRNfMw7nf4EJ4xHVRM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How do the cameras in these two phones two stack up against one another? </p><p>The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 has a 50MP ultra-pixel main camera with optical image stabilization (OIS) combined with a 13MP ultra-wide rear camera with macro vision. The front camera is a favorable 32MP for taking fabulous selfies and group shots, recording videos, and more. </p><p>It has all the expected shooting modes, including portrait, pro (using a long exposure), panorama, night vision, live photo filters, and more. The cameras also have some AI features, including Google Auto Enhance, Auto Smile Capture, Google Lens, Shot Optimization, and Auto Night Vision. </p><p>You can also do basic things like take burst shots, use a timer, assistive grid, add a watermark, shoot in RAW mode, scan barcodes, and more. </p><p>Lee says the cameras do a “pretty good job,” producing images that are sharp, detailed, and vibrant with decent dynamic range. “The images won’t blow you away,” he says, “but they’re perfectly usable.” The phone also does a respectable job with low-light shots, resulting in images with not a lot of noise.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DcVMw6eFyhqbMozJxyyGkc" name="google-pixel-8a-camera-03.jpg" alt="Taking a picture with the Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DcVMw6eFyhqbMozJxyyGkc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparatively, the Google Pixel 8a has a larger 64MP quad PD wide camera with Super Res Zoom up to 8x. It has a 13MP ultra-wide camera as well, but the front camera matches that at only 13MP, a significant drop compared to the higher-res front camera in the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024. It isn’t all about resolution, of course. The Google Pixel 8a’s front camera, for example, has an ultra-wide field-of-view, so you might be able to get more people or more of a background in your shots. </p><p>Google’s bevy of AI features translate to the cameras in the Google Pixel 8a as well. Enjoy features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> for repositioning and resizing objects as well as using preset backgrounds, Best Take for choosing the best facial expressions for each person in a photo to get the best one, Magic Eraser, Photo Unblur, Real Tone, Face Unblur, Night Sight, Portrait Mode, and more. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> for videos, you can even remove distracting background noises. </p><p>Sutrich says the Pixel 8a’s cameras produce results almost identical to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, both taking fabulous photos given their price. With good high contrast, color-accurate images, and solid performance when capturing subjects in motion (like pets or kids), you won’t run into any major issues with the cameras in this phone.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-vs-google-pixel-8a-which-should-you-buy-2">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 vs. Google Pixel 8a: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6YAoRENQwue2vYvMhoTHXJ" name="google-pixel-8a-homescreen-01.jpg" alt="The homescreen of the Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6YAoRENQwue2vYvMhoTHXJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are compelling reasons to buy both phones when looking at the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 and Google Pixel 8a. The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 has the option for expanding storage, increasing RAM, Dolby Atmos support, and a headphone jack. Of course, there’s also the built-in stylus and all the fun and useful things you can do with it. You could also theoretically use a stylus with the Google Pixel 8a, but you’d have to buy one separately, and the experience wouldn’t be as seamless without the apps designed specifically for one. </p><p>But overall, the Google Pixel 8a stands out for superior specs in many respects. From the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> integration to the more durable design, additional color options, and higher peak brightness, it won’t disappoint. Also, consider that it’s a smaller phone. If you prefer that, the Pixel 8a will be more suitable. If you’re looking for a phone with a larger screen, you might find yourself considering the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 instead. </p><p>The biggest factor that could influence your decision between these two phones is the seven years of software and security support that Google offers. If you’re the type who buys a phone and hangs onto it for years, you’ll appreciate that the Pixel 8a won’t be outdated in two to three years. This will also be appreciated by those who are saving to upgrade. You can resell the Google Pixel 8a for a pretty penny to put towards a new one, even three, four, five, or more years down the line. </p><p>By contrast, with Motorola only offering one major software update and three years of security updates, this phone will get really old really quickly. Thus, the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is more of an in-between phone while you save up for a year or two to buy something bigger and better or a phone you get on a contract that includes a trade-in upgrade in two to three years. </p><p>Both these phones are great options for a killer price.

<p>The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is offered at an amazing price given its lovely design, premium features, and built-in stylus. There’s a lot you can do with this phone. Though it’s not a blow-you-away phone, it checks all the boxes as a decent phone that lets you do everything from stream video to listen to music, play mobile games, snap photos, and more. You’ll appreciate the headphone jack, expandable storage, Dolby Atmos, and larger screen. But there’s nothing especially compelling about this phone.</p></p>

Despite being the most affordable option in the new line, it has many of the same features as the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, including even the same chip. With fabulous cameras, a durable design, and a promise for years of software and security updates, plus new Feature Drops coming all the time, it’s a good future-proofing phone you can hang onto for years to come.</p></p>

<p>Motorola and Samsung have long made some of the better budget phones you can buy, but 2024 threw a wrench into our normal expectations. Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-galaxy-a55-and-a35">isn&apos;t bringing</a> the A55 to U.S. shores this year, which means American customers only have the A35 to choose from.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a> is the best $400 phone Motorola has ever made, eclipsing the Samsung Galaxy A35 in many ways. The only big advantage Samsung seems to have this year is the number of software updates offered, as the company will keep giving the Galaxy A35 updates until Android 18, while the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 will only receive Android 15.</p><p>Whether you&apos;ll hold on to the phone for that long may be a different story, but there&apos;s no denying the value that comes with years of software updates. With that said, here&apos;s how to choose between these two excellent $400 phones.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-vs-samsung-galaxy-a35-design-and-display-2">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 vs. Samsung Galaxy A35: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="86GdhXXZUA8bEU3A3EZNm9" name="samsung galaxy a35 gaming.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A35 gaming" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/86GdhXXZUA8bEU3A3EZNm9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung&apos;s Galaxy A35 is an easy choice for Galaxy fans who aren&apos;t looking to spend too much on a new phone, all while offering great specs and a feature-rich software experience. The phone&apos;s rather boring design is offset by some surprisingly exciting color choices of Iceblue, Lilac, and Navy, plus the standard black variant if you don&apos;t care much for colorful phones.</p><p>On the front is a 6.6-inch Samsung Super AMOLED display with 2340 x 1080 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. That display swaps between 60Hz and 120Hz depending on what&apos;s happening on-screen to help save battery, but it isn&apos;t quite as efficient as an LTPO display.</p><p>It features a max brightness rating of 1,000 nits, which is easily viewable in the sun, but the company&apos;s Vision Booster technology means that it uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> at all brightness levels. If you&apos;re sensitive to light flicker, this won&apos;t be a great phone for you.</p><p>Meanwhile, Motorola is using a 6.7-inch pOLED display on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 with a 120Hz refresh rate and a 2400 x 1080 resolution. Plus, Motorola&apos;s excellent flicker-prevention technology ensures that even PWM-sensitive users will find this display comfortable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xC6cASwAS7nfE6XYDZcNPC" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-review-hero.jpg" alt="The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 with its stylus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xC6cASwAS7nfE6XYDZcNPC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones use plastic frames, but Motorola went out of its way to make the Moto G Stylus 5G&apos;s frame look and feel like brushed aluminum. Not only that, but the vegan leather back on the Moto G Stylus 5G makes the phone look and feel substantially more luxurious than the Samsung Galaxy A35&apos;s shiny back.</p><p>The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is nearly 20g lighter than the Samsung Galaxy A35, meaning it&apos;s more comfortable to use for longer periods of time. </p><p>The downside is that the Moto G Stylus 5G only sports an IP52 water and dust resistance rating, which means you shouldn&apos;t take it in the pool on a hot summer&apos;s day. Meanwhile, the Galaxy A35 features a flagship-level IP67 water and dust resistance level, so it can get as wet or dusty as you need it to.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that Samsung is using Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on the Galaxy A35, which offers better scratch and drop resistance than the Gorilla Glass 3 on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4078px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FGt5ZF8Ud78tznEGxbNJJZ" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-review-10.jpg" alt="Multitasking on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FGt5ZF8Ud78tznEGxbNJJZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4078" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones feature very comparable specs with a few trade-offs in a handful of categories. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-1380-launch">Exynos 1380</a> processor in the Galaxy A35 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-6-gen-1-snapdragon-4-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 6 Gen 1</a> processor in the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 offer nearly identical performance across a range of categories, but the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 adds in 2GB of additional RAM for better multitasking performance.</p><p>Samsung sells a model with 8GB of RAM in some regions, though, which is the preferable choice if you&apos;ve got access to it. It&apos;s the minimum amount for truly smooth performance in modern Android, so it makes sense to choose the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 if you&apos;re more of a multitasker.</p><p>Both phones offer a choice of 128GB or 256GB of internal storage, plus the ability to expand the storage up to 1TB with a microSD card. However, buying straight from Motorola or Amazon will ensure you get the 256GB variant.</p>

<p>The biggest spec differences turn out to be pretty minor in the grand scheme of things, but can make or break the choice for some people. Motorola included both NFC for quick tap mobile payments and wireless charging in the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024. Not only that, but it&apos;s 15W wireless charging, which is as fast as many flagship phones.</p><p>Motorola also supports up to 30W wired charging on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024, meaning it&apos;ll charge a bit faster than the Galaxy A35, especially since both phones feature the same battery size.</p><p>While Samsung didn&apos;t include wireless charging on the Galaxy A35 but it did include a newer Bluetooth standard compared to the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024. The Bluetooth upgrade isn&apos;t a massive deal but it does mean the A35 will use less energy when paired with compatible Bluetooth devices and could provide a more consistent connection when used in the vicinity of a large number of Bluetooth devices — like on an airplane.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-vs-samsung-galaxy-a35-software-and-updates-2">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 vs. Samsung Galaxy A35: Software and updates</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BSwt6DXZkofsYCEn5E8Xv9" name="samsung galaxy a35 water.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A35 wet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BSwt6DXZkofsYCEn5E8Xv9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here&apos;s where the real meat of the difference is, and your choice is likely going to depend on the <em>other</em> tech choices you make. Folks who have a lot of Samsung devices — a Samsung TV, a Galaxy Watch, a Galaxy Tab, etc. — might want to stick with Samsung for their phone, as well.</p><p>Samsung does an excellent job of creating an entire ecosystem that links up and talks to other Samsung devices in a way few companies can because Samsung makes <strong>so many</strong> different types of electronics. The only big Samsung feature the Galaxy A35 doesn&apos;t support is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a>, the desktop UI that more expensive Samsung phones can display when hooked up to a TV or monitor.</p><p>The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">Samsung One UI 6.1</a> release on the Galaxy A35 also supports Samsung Knox Vault for the first time on Samsung&apos;s more budget-friendly models. This means deep data encryption and protection against bad apps if you&apos;re someone who enjoys sideloading.</p><p>Plus, Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> software allows an incredible breadth of customization options that help make your phone truly feel like <em>your</em> phone and less like a generic Android device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RbdLrcDosLRyk5ZY2JV7y6" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-review-13.jpg" alt="The quick settings menu on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RbdLrcDosLRyk5ZY2JV7y6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Motorola recently released its Android 14 update alongside a UI refresh. The OS introduces a handful of important under-the-hood changes as well as additional customization options beyond what was previously offered. For instance, the Quick Settings panel on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 can now be configured to display a large grid of icons, as seen in the image above.</p><p>There are also a ton of amazing little things throughout Motorola&apos;s Android 14 UI. Per-app volume adjustment can be a game-changer for anyone who doesn&apos;t want an app to deliver a surprise noise or who likes running apps side-by-side and only wants sound coming from one app.</p><p>Plus, the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 supports Motorola&apos;s new Smart Connect software, one of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-central-best-of-mwc-2024">favorite things we saw</a> at MWC 2024. Smart Connect seamlessly connects your PC, smartphone, tablet, TV, and other devices, which is even better than Samsung&apos;s similar offerings. This includes being able to drag apps between screens <strong>and</strong> operating systems, making it feel like all your screens are magically linked.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YMUJgN4pEDLXfHAK869b2T" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-review-19.jpg" alt="Writing a note on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YMUJgN4pEDLXfHAK869b2T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond normal software differences, the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 includes a stylus built into the body, similar to more expensive Samsung phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. That makes it easy to take notes at the drop of a hat and also means marking up images and making edits easier than with your finger.</p><p>Motorola&apos;s stylus software is visually incredibly similar to Samsung&apos;s, although you won&apos;t find as many useful features like Bluetooth connectivity for remote photo capture and other useful tools.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-vs-samsung-galaxy-a35-cameras-2">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 vs. Samsung Galaxy A35: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XdnUs8jp8pWFS5XUMK6jb9" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-review-17.jpg" alt="The cameras on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XdnUs8jp8pWFS5XUMK6jb9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;d wager that while neither phone&apos;s cameras are likely going to blow you away—especially if you&apos;re coming from a flagship-level device—the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is more likely to deliver a better overall image than the Samsung Galaxy A35.</p><p>Part of this comes from the hardware differences between the two devices. While the main sensor looks nearly identical on paper—both offer a main 50MP camera on the back—the rest of the Motorola camera hardware is notably better.</p><p>For instance, the Samsung Galaxy A35 sports an 8MP ultrawide camera and a 2MP macro camera. Historically, 2MP macro cameras are entirely useless and we&apos;re unsure why any company continues to include these cameras on any phone. They produce terrible images and certainly aren&apos;t worth the money it costs to make them and ship a phone with them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.29%;"><img id="uhWsXmrbdmCEn7YRXsDXSf" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-camera-sample-2.jpg" alt="A street at sunset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uhWsXmrbdmCEn7YRXsDXSf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4080" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Image taken with the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 sports a 13MP ultrawide camera that doubles as a macro camera. That means not only will your ultrawide photos look better and feature higher resolution, but the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024&apos;s macro photos will look like they come from an entirely different price class when compared to the Samsung Galaxy A35.</p><p>On the front, Motorola packs in a beefy 32MP sensor that looks great in most lighting conditions, while the 13MP front-facing camera on the Galaxy A35 delivers softer, less detailed images.</p><p>On the software side, Motorola has significantly upgraded its processing and now features much better-looking photos and videos because of it. Meanwhile, Samsung&apos;s software tends to produce overexposed images that have difficulty capturing moving subjects like kids and pets.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-vs-samsung-galaxy-a35-which-should-you-buy-2">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 vs. Samsung Galaxy A35: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YaAPDTTeE8nytUb4dwPBoM" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-review-01.jpg" alt="The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 in hand outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YaAPDTTeE8nytUb4dwPBoM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4030" height="2267" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is the better choice for most people but that doesn&apos;t mean that the Samsung Galaxy A35 isn&apos;t worth buying. Samsung offers better water and dust resistance and, most notably, three additional Android upgrades over Motorola. That means the Galaxy A35 will get Android 18 before Samsung is done with updates while the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 will still be on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>.</p><p>But most other categories fall in Motorola&apos;s favor here. The included stylus on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is incredibly handy, even if everyone won&apos;t use it all the time, and Motorola&apos;s software features are seriously great. Once you start using Motorola gestures like double-chop to toggle the flashlight, you&apos;ll wonder why all phones don&apos;t do something similar.</p><p>Motorola&apos;s cameras are notably better in nearly every regard, and the pOLED the company uses on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is far more vision-friendly than what&apos;s on the Galaxy A35.</p><p>Beyond that, the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 has more RAM for better multitasking and a far better build, which looks and feels more premium than the price tag suggests. Both phones are among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best budget Android phones</a> around, but we think the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is a better buy for $400.</p>

The transmission method determines how big the file can be, and Bluetooth is... well, let's put it this way: Wi-Fi is like an eight-lane freeway, while Bluetooth is a two-lane rural highway.</p>
<p>Qualcomm regularly updates aptX so you can have the prettiest, most robust vehicle possible, traveling that two-lane highway right through your ears and into your dome piece, er, brain.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="audio-processing-technology-becomes-quot-apt-x-quot-2">Audio Processing Technology becomes "apt-X"</h2>
<p>Audio transmission over Bluetooth radios has evolved significantly from the era of the sole SBC codec. Today, you will likely encounter acronyms for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">audio codecs</a> like LDAC, AAC, ALAC, or aptX. While some of these are newer technologies, aptX has a history almost as long as Bluetooth, dating back some 30 years. This longevity underscores its relevance and impact on Bluetooth technology today.</p><p>APT, or “audio processing technology,” began as a compression algorithm developed in the 1980s by Dr. Stephen Smyth as part of his Ph.D. research, and before it was Qualcomm aptX, it was just “apt-X.”</p><p>His work was first used to store CD-quality audio or transfer audio via ISDN lines (the precursor to DSL lines). ISDN lines were akin to that dial-up phone internet connection you’ve likely heard about. Before the advent of broadband, if you wanted CD-quality audio from remote sources, this was how you got it at the enterprise level.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="u6kC9QiqUVY8RAEfjZFfaP" name="Jurassic-Park.jpg" alt="Jurassic Park logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u6kC9QiqUVY8RAEfjZFfaP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Universal)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the 1990s, Steven Spielberg collaborated with DTS to use aptX and its compression technology to record audio for 5.1 digital playback. You may have heard of the films played back using this technology: “Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan,” and “Jurassic Park.</p><p>Apt-X, or “aptX” as you know it today, wasn’t acquired by Qualcomm until 2015. A year later, the company released the aptX HD standard, and it’s been iterating and upping the ante on compressed dynamic digital file coding/decoding (codec), bringing us to where we are today with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Sound products.</p>
<h2 id="qualcomm-aptx-a-timeline-2">Qualcomm aptX: A timeline</h2>
<p>The end goal of aptX and Bluetooth codecs, in general, has always been to transmit CD-quality audio data over Bluetooth&apos;s limited bandwidth. Over the years, that bandwidth has expanded, but not quite enough to transmit uncompressed CD-quality audio wirelessly.</p><p>Qualcomm took <em>its</em> first step toward this goal in earnest in 2016 when it launched aptX HD, promising high-definition wireless sound quality that they said was “barely distinguishable from high-resolution audio.” For the sake of comparison, before you read the rest of this article, let’s first establish what “high resolution” or CD quality actually is. Uncompressed CD audio files are 16-bit, 44.1kHz files with a bitrate of 1411kbps.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2009-aptx-standard"><span>2009: aptX standard</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h9fvx6wSi6EUQpa4gBbL7Y" name="sennheiser-px-210-bt.jpg" alt="Sennheiser PX 210 BT" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h9fvx6wSi6EUQpa4gBbL7Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Sennheiser PX 210 BT: The first BT headphones to support aptX </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sennheiser)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In 2009, aptX could only have a maximum bitrate of 384kbps at 16-bit/48kHz. Latency was an issue, so in 2012, the standard iterated and gave us aptX LL, or Low Latency, which was 352kbps at 16-bit/48kHz.</p><p>As you can see, it was still a long way away from giving consumers CD-quality audio, but it did something else—it gave users less lag time between the time the picture played and the sound was decoded. It is as low as 32 milliseconds, to be exact. When prioritizing low-latency stereo audio over quality, 32ms is faster than our brains can process, so it appears to be latency-free.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2016-aptx-hd-adaptive"><span>2016: aptX HD & Adaptive</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="taCE8WRXopA2csNVXYhH5J" name="Victor-EX-Dub1-2016.jpg" alt="Victor EX Dub1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/taCE8WRXopA2csNVXYhH5J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Victor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When aptX HD was launched in 2016, it supported both 16- and 24-bit depths, marching ever closer to that 1411 bitrate at a theoretical max of 576kbps at 24-bit/48kHz. However, Qualcomm recognized a bottleneck stopping them from realizing CD-quality audio, and that was controlling the hardware and software in various devices like smartphones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-9-earbuds-support-high-res-codecs">earbuds</a>, headphones, and speakers like the Victor EX Dub1 pictured above (which actually had a CD player).</p><p>So, in 2018, Qualcomm released the QCC5120 SoCs, or system on a chip, which was more efficient, giving Bluetooth devices longer battery life and paving the way for future advancements. </p><p>Also that year, it released the first iteration of aptX Adaptive, which, as the name implies, dynamically adjusts the amount of data being streamed between devices for better audio regardless of whether you’re listening to music, gaming, or watching videos. Improving upon previous bitrates, aptX Adaptive was 24-bit and scaled from 276-420kbps.</p>

<p>Qualcomm would launch the Snapdragon 855 chipset a year later, which brought native aptX Adaptive support to smartphones; then, in 2021, it released an update to Adaptive called Snapdragon Sound with Qualcomm aptX Lossless.</p><p>“With many leading music streaming services now offering extensive lossless music libraries, and consumer demand for lossless audio growing, we’re pleased to announce this new support for CD lossless audio streaming for Bluetooth earbuds and headsets which we plan to make available to customers later this year,” said James Chapman, vice president and general manager of Qualcomm.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2021-snapdragon-sound-and-beyond"><span>2021: Snapdragon Sound and beyond</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fDvmiXpduwyevLydwAcw85" name="snapdragon-sound-logo.jpg" alt="Snapdragon Sound" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fDvmiXpduwyevLydwAcw85.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This brings us to the present, and aptX Lossless is still working its way through the market. If your devices support it, you can listen to 44.1kHz, 16-bit lossless audio if your link quality is good enough. Lossless can stream CD-quality audio around that 1411kbps mark but can scale down to as low as 140kbits/s in areas with heavy RF interference. The standard also supports spatial audio with head-tracking and builds on the lessons learned from adaptive audio with “lag-free” mobile audio. For devices that support aptX Lossless, you can also choose between CD lossless audio and 24-bit, 96kHz lossy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">Hi-Res Wireless Audio</a>.</p><p>The bottom line to all of this aptX technology is that even though your earbuds, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/sonos-launch-ace-headphones">headphones</a>, or speakers may have the necessary Qualcomm chipsets, you still have to rely on your phone, tablet, or laptop’s manufacturer to support the codecs and that can be a problem. To use the technology, companies have to license it (pay for it), and they aren’t quick to do that.</p><p>Samsung uses its own proprietary codec, SSC, and supports older aptX standards, while Google uses its own chipset but supports aptX and aptX HD. There are other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> out there that are great devices and do utilize the Snapdragon Sound platform but aren’t readily available in America, considering that many consumers in the States rely on purchasing through a mobile carrier, and smartphone manufacturers often have to establish deals with carriers to have their products in stores.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (May 30), MediaTek announced its latest wave of chips aimed at powering the next wave of foldable and gaming phones.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://corp.mediatek.com/news-events/press-releases/mediateks-dimensity-7300-chips-level-up-ai-and-mobile-gaming-for-high-tech-smartphones-and-foldables">press release</a>, MediaTek detailed the "ultra-efficient 4nm chips" known as the Dimensity 7300 and the 7300X. The Taiwanese company says the former is designed to target multitasking, AI, gaming, and photography. Its 7300X chip will handle flip-style foldables as it provides dual display support.</p><p>The post adds that the 7300 series chips feature an octa-core CPU comprising four Arm Cortex-A78 cores. The 4nm process is said to lower the cores&apos; power consumption by nearly 25%. </p><p>Together, these cores clock in at 2.5GHz speed and are complimented by four Arm Cortex-A55 cores.</p><p>Photography is a headliner for the Dimensity 7300 as the chipmaker upgraded it with the MediaTek Imagiq 950 with "premium grade" 12-bit HDR-ISP. This features support for 200MP primary cameras. New engines for the chip should help its noise reduction in photos alongside better face detection, and video HDR. Consumers will find 4K video recording capabilities with an increased 50% wider dynamic range for higher quality detail.</p><p>Gaming phones will likely benefit from the 7300 series&apos; estimated 20% increase in FPS and energy efficiency. MediaTek states the chips take this further by optimizing 5G and Wi-Fi game connections, Bluetooth LE audio support, and Dual-Like True Wireless Stereo Audio.</p><p>On-device AI tasks will benefit from MediaTek&apos;s APU 655 and the chip&apos;s "mixed precision data types" help cut down on the memory strain from large AI models. Additionally, MiraVision 955 will boost device displays with 10-bit true color, global HDR standard support, and "enhanced" media playback.</p>

<p>With MediaTek announcing its latest wave of chips today, it&apos;s resurging memories of the leaks surrounding Motorola&apos;s upcoming Razr 2024. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-series-renders-reveal-cover-screen-changes">Since May</a>, the device has been rumored to feature the company&apos;s Dimensity 7300X chip, which has been confirmed today to focus on flip-style foldables. Moreover, the chip&apos;s dual display support will likely benefit the phone, considering leaked renders show off its new, larger cover display, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-ultra-aka-razr-plus-2024-live-image">mirroring its sibling</a>.</p><p>Another wave of leaks showcased the device&apos;s form factor, courtesy of a TENAA certification <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-images-totally-ruin-the-surprise-ahead-of-its-official-launch">database listing</a>. The Razr 2024 is rumored to feature a 6.9-inch FHD plus display and a 3.6-inch cover display. A 50MP primary camera is suggested to be paired with another 13MP sensor.</p><p>While we&apos;re likely approaching Motorola&apos;s China release for the new foldables, the devices aren&apos;t expected to hit the States until later this year.</p>

<ul><li>The front pane of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 pops up ahead of the anticipated July release.</li><li>As rumored earlier, the cover screen appears wider than the Galaxy Z Fold 5.</li><li>The images also indicate sizable bezels at the top, similar to the predecessor.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As we near the anticipated Galaxy foldables launch, which is likely to happen in July, more information seems to be popping up. While it was about the screen dimensions earlier, a new leak showcases a significant part of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 in real life.</p><p>The images come from prolific leaker Ice Universe on X, showcasing the upper portion of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, giving the audience a sneak peek at what to expect from the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">flagship foldable smartphone</a> from Samsung.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">THE NEXT FOLD pic.twitter.com/0CSpU0cD9T<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1795720359817400579">May 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Firstly, the book-style foldable phone might finally eliminate the rounded corners of its predecessor, the Galaxy Z Fold 5. Instead, it might opt for sharp edges similar to those of the company’s flagship phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>. </p><p>The Ice Universe&apos;s shared image shows the phone in a folded state, with a tiny portion of the cover screen at the top, including the camera cutout and the antenna, lined up top. </p><p>The shared display&apos;s noticeable feature is a sizable bezel right above the selfie shooter. It looks similar to the previous iteration, meaning we cannot expect radical changes like slimmer bezels on the cover screen.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Z Fold5 vs Galaxy Z Fold6 Fold6 screen width =Fold5 screen width+right bezel width pic.twitter.com/cbIjMNjikV<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1796092232547876913">May 30, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the tipster also shared another image of the front pane of the Galaxy Z Fold 6, placing it next to the Galaxy Z Fold 5, which indicates how different the successor would look. </p><p>The tipster further notes that the cover screen is wider than the predecessor model by a significant margin. Ice Universe shared the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-likely-to-opt-for-wider-cover-screen">same information</a> earlier this month, wherein the dimensions of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 cover screen were also revealed.</p><p>While the Galaxy Z Fold 5 sported a cover screen with a 57.4mm width, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 will feature a wider 60.2mm cover screen. The previous report also indicated that it would have a flatter surface and squared corners, which appears evident from the latest images leaked by the tipster.</p>
