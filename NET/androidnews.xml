<p>If you want to get on the Google Pixel bandwagon, the Google Pixel 9 is the best option you can get right now if you don’t want to pay more for the Pro or Pro XL. While it’s the entry model in the newest line, it boasts tons of premium features, Google AI integration, plenty of RAM, and a gorgeous high-res screen. When it comes to bang for your buck, this one goes the distance.</p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DVEdsb9wpdwVpsKE3f8dnB" name="google-pixel-9-pixel-screenshots-01.jpg" alt="Using the Pixel Screenshots app on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DVEdsb9wpdwVpsKE3f8dnB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9 is available in an Obsidian, Porcelain, Wintergreen, or Peony finish. Equipped with a 6.3-inch Actua OLED display with a 2,424 x 1,080 resolution, you get a refresh rate that can go from 60Hz up to 120Hz, depending on what’s needed for the application you’re using. It features rounded corners with a squared design and a new camera visor that houses dual cameras. </p><p>With a polished back and a soft metal finish frame, it has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> screen, making it a pretty durable phone. It’s also IP68 water and dust-resistant, adding to its rugged design, and has a fingerprint-resistant coating. </p><p>The screen can hit 1,800 nits brightness in HDR and 2,700 nits peak brightness, so you can confidently use it outdoors in bright sunlight and shouldn’t have any issues seeing the screen. </p><p>Available with either 128GB or 256GB storage, you’ll have to rely on cloud storage after that since there isn’t a microSD card slot. The 4,700mAh battery affords a day or more of battery life, which you can extend to up to four days using the Extreme Battery Saver mode. It also supports both fast charging using the optional Google 45W USB-C charger and wireless charging. With Battery Share, you can recharge your phone or other compatible devices, like a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-launch">Google Pixel Buds</a>. </p><p>Additional features include fingerprint and face unlock along with pattern PIN and password. There are stereo speakers and three mics with noise suppression along with Spatial Audio support. </p><p>As with all the latest Google Pixel phones, you don’t have to worry about this one becoming outdated quickly. Google promises seven years of OS and security updates, along with frequent Pixel feature drops through this same timeframe.</p>

<p>Comparatively, the Samsung Galaxy S24 comes in Cobalt Violet, Amber Yellow, Onyx Black, and Marble Grey. Samsung offers its own exclusive colors when purchasing directly, including Sapphire Blue, Sandstone Orange, and Jade Green. </p><p>Employing a unified design similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S23,</a> for those familiar with that phone, this phone has a flat front and back with rounded edges and a soft finish similar to the Google Pixel 9. It is made of Armor Aluminum, which is lighter than steel and comes with a Corning Gorilla Armor screen, making it slightly more durable. The three cameras are positioned in a vertical row on the back. </p><p>The screen is 6.2 inches in size, so it’s a smidge smaller, which also makes the phone itself a hair smaller as well. It’s also quite a bit lighter in weight. The screen is a dynamic AMOLED 2x FHD+ with a 2,340 x 1,080 resolution, slightly lower in resolution. With Vision Booster, you can get up to 2,600 nits peak brightness, which stands up to the Google Pixel 9 in this respect. It has the same 120Hz refresh rate as well. </p><p>It has the same IP68 water and dust-resistant rating, but the Samsung Galaxy S24 4,000mAh battery likely won’t last as long on a single charge. It supports both fast and wireless charging, as well as Wireless PowerShare for using the phone’s battery to recharge other compatible devices, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds</a>. Expect to get about a day’s worth of life per charge, which is less for heavier users. </p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 comes with the same non-expandable 128GB or 256GB storage variants. It has stereo speakers as well as face and fingerprint unlock. Like the Google Pixel 9, you get seven years of software and security updates with this phone.</p>

<p>Let’s look at what these two phones can actually do. </p><p>Equipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, the Google Pixel 9 is powered by the Google Tensor G4 processor. It has an impressive 12GB RAM, so you can be confident that it will keep up with all your multi-tasking needs, even activities like video streaming and gaming. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9 has all the usual AI features that you’ll find in other recent Pixel devices, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a>. These include seamless access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-google-messages">Google Gemini</a> and AI assistance with everything from photos to composing messages, surfing the web, generating images, and more. </p><p>You’ll get Google VPN standard with the phone along with Google’s end-to-end security. Along with multi-layer hardware security are the tensor security core, Titan M2 security co-processor, anti-malware and anti-phishing protection, and spam protection. </p><p>The phone also comes with plenty of safety features, including satellite SOS, emergency SOS, crisis alerts, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-enable-car-crash-detection-pixel">car crash detection</a>, and Safety Check. Set up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, it has the Bluetooth 5.3 spec with dual antennas for enhanced quality and connection. There’s also NFC, Google Cast, and built-in GPS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZMFgD8diq9sFmCHf975Zkm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-purple-01.jpg" alt="Looking at the different colorways of the Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZMFgD8diq9sFmCHf975Zkm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> allows for versatile setups, such as a second screen if you’re using the phone for productivity. It also works seamlessly with Samsung SmartThings for adding it to a smart connected home.</p><p>Also running Android 14, the Samsung Galaxy S24 also includes Samsung One UI 6.1 for further customization and personalization over and above the stock Android experience. Powered by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor, you get only 8GB RAM, which is significantly less than with the Google Pixel 9. Both should yield favorable results, but if you tend to do a lot of intensive tasks, from gaming to video recording and multi-tasking, you might appreciate the extra RAM in the Google Pixel 9. </p><p>You’ll get all the same AI features through Google Gemini AI, including ones like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Android Central’s Nicholas Sutrich</a> calls his favorite feature (it’s also available in the Google Pixel 9). There are also features like Live Translate, Note Assist, Transcript Assist, generative photo editing, and more, all of which you’ll find in the Google Pixel 9, too.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro-how-good-are-the-cameras-2">Google Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 9 Pro: How good are the cameras?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ydHjFktt8bW7ftRo4cAVHK" name="google-pixel-9-camera-add-me-feature-02.jpg" alt="Using the new Add Me feature on a Google Pixel 9 to add someone to an existing photo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ydHjFktt8bW7ftRo4cAVHK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everyone uses their smartphones as cameras nowadays, so how these two phones perform for taking photos and videos as well as in post-editing is crucial. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9’s main camera has a 50MP wide sensor and affords up to 8x Super Res Zoom. It also has a 48MP Quad PD ultra-wide camera with Macro Focus. The front camera is where it falls short: it’s a measly 10.5MP. We’ll have to wait until we can try it out to determine if how well the photos looks when snapping selfies and other content with the front camera. </p><p>When it comes to photo editing, you get all the Google camera features you have come to know and love over the last few generations of devices, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>, Magic Eraser, Best Take, Photo Unblur, and Portrait Light. </p><p>Using the rear camera, you can take 4K videos with digital video zoom up to 7x and can shoot 4K videos using the front camera as well. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> feature is available with this phone, as expected, along with enhanced features like cinematic blur and slo-mo. Record in stereo and use features like speech enhancement, wind noise reduction, and audio zoom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cUhsUJvUqKHWffbzpGikcm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-camera-lenses-03.jpg" alt="Looking at the different colorways of the Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUhsUJvUqKHWffbzpGikcm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How do the Samsung Galaxy S24 cameras compare? This phone also has a 50MP wide main camera, but its ultra-wide camera drops significantly in specs at just 12MP. It adds a 10MP telephoto camera as well, and the wide front camera isn’t much better at just 12MP. You get up to 30x space zoom, though, and 3x optical zoom. </p><p>Samsung adds the ProVisual Engine to this phone, an AI tool that helps power its intelligent features, many of which work just like they do in the Google Pixel 9. This includes everything from generative edit, which works like Magic Editor. Samsung adds some unique features as well, like Edit Suggestion, which recommends how to tweak a photo to improve it, and flaw detection that will help eliminate the possibility of taking a bad photo. </p><p>You can leverage AI features while taking videos as well, like instant slo-mo whereby AI will generate the additional frames to help fill in the blanks.</p>

<p>It’s a tough comparison when looking at the Google Pixel 9 vs. Samsung Galaxy S24. The Google Pixel 9 is the newer of the two phones, but the Samsung Galaxy S24 is not even a year old yet. Both give you seven years of OS and software updates, so you’re in a good position when it comes to longevity. They also both feature the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini AI</a> features along with photo editing features that match one another. </p><p>The decision may come down to nothing more than brand preference. The Google Pixel 9 does have more RAM and a slightly higher-resolution screen. Samsung adds a telephoto camera, but its ultra-wide camera doesn’t have as high of a resolution, though its front camera might be a tad better when looking at specs alone. </p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 has a more refined design and an Armor Aluminum finish, which ranks among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">the best Android phones</a>. However, both phones are rugged and meet water and dust resistance ratings. They’re equally great for productivity and entertainment. </p><p>The bottom line is that you won’t go wrong with either of these phones, which come in around the same price. If you’re familiar with Samsung Galaxy devices and like them, and if you own or plan to buy other Galaxy devices like Galaxy Buds or even smart home gear like a Samsung TV or appliances, you’ll want to stick with the Galaxy phone.</p><p>Conversely, if you are upgrading from an older model Pixel or even an Android phone of another brand, you’ll find the Google Pixel phones blazingly simple to use and intuitive. Plus, they work well with other Google devices, from Google Pixel Buds to your smart home speakers and more.</p>

For the fastest charging speeds, you need a Google Pixel Stand (Gen 2).</p></article></section>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-about-qi-wireless-charging-2">What you need to know about Qi wireless charging</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the latest Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL models don&apos;t have Qi2 wireless charging. When Google was asked why it didn&apos;t include Qi2 in its latest Pixel lineup, the company said that it doesn&apos;t see a large demand for the feature. This is similar to what Samsung said about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-dropped-the-ball-qi2-galaxy-s24">not bringing Qi2</a> to the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>Instead, Pixel 9 users must continue to use their new Android phone without the Qi2 technology <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">iPhone users have already been enjoying</a>. In fact, there is only one Android phone that supports Qi2 at the time of writing, and it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">one you wouldn&apos;t expect</a>. However, you can still enjoy Qi wireless charging, although not at the speed they would like, since Qi wireless charging technology only offers anywhere from 5W to 15W. </p>
<h2 id="pixel-9-wireless-charging-speeds-and-the-difference-between-qi-and-qi2-wireless-charging-2">Pixel 9 wireless charging speeds and the difference between Qi and Qi2 wireless charging</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.00%;"><img id="8wezwUmtxJrt3pQ3Fqh2XM" name="Google-Pixel-9-charger-3.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8wezwUmtxJrt3pQ3Fqh2XM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1680" height="1008" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit:  Arsène Lupin / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s important to remember that you can get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-will-stifle-innovation">Qi2</a> charger, but if your phone doesn&apos;t have Qi2 technology, your phone won&apos;t get the total 15W of wireless charging. Qi2 wireless charging offers faster charging speed and creates less heat since the charging coils are always correctly aligned thanks to the magnetic alignment, which enhances charging speeds.</p><p>With Qi wireless charging (not Qi2), the magnets can misalign when you get notifications if your phone vibrates, preventing your phone from being perfectly aligned. Or maybe you bump into the tablet you&apos;re charging your phone on and move it. However, by having Qi2, it&apos;s less likely your phone will stop charging or not get the full 15W that Qi2 provides when these types of things happen. Not charging your phone properly with the Qi-certified charger can cause a loss of power, resulting in heat that will damage your phone&apos;s battery over time.</p><p>Since the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL don&apos;t have Qi2 wireless charging, using accessories such as the best magnetic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-tripod">tripods</a>, portable batteries, and wallets is not possible unless you use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe accessories for your Android phone</a>.</p><p>The main question here is, do you <em>need</em> Qi2? It all comes down to how fast you need your phone to charge your phone. Just because the latest Pixels don&apos;t have Qi2, it doesn&apos;t mean you can get a great wireless charging speed. When you use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-stand-2nd-gen-charger-review">Pixel Stand Gen 2</a>, it charges the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL wirelessly at 15W, 21W, and 23W, respectively, but only up to 12W with Qi-certified EPP <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads" target="_blank">wireless chargers</a>. So it all comes down to which chargers you use.</p>

This means that the phones are tight to dust intrusion and can be continually submersed in water without ingress. </p></article></section>
<h2 id="can-the-pixel-9-survive-a-swim-2">Can the Pixel 9 survive a swim?</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Google Pixel 9 series</a> phones all feature an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance. With an IP rating, the first number represents the dust resistance, while the second represents water resistance. The "6" indicates complete protection against dust intrusion while the "8" means the phone can be continually immersed under 1 meter of water without any getting in.</p><p>While the Pixel 9 is highly water resistant, it&apos;s not technically waterproof as there is a possibility water will eventually get in. For the most part, you&apos;re safe from an accidental drop into the bathtub or swimming pool. You also don&apos;t need to worry about putting it away if you get stuck out in the rain. Still, you shouldn&apos;t use the phone underwater or deliberately submerge it without a special case.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review" target="_blank">Pixel 8</a> series was also IP68 rated, and if it gets wet, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7533279" target="_blank">Google Support recommends</a> immediately removing the phone from the water, turning it off, drying it with a cloth, and then allowing it to dry at room temperature to avoid damage. For example, the pins in the USB-C charging port will still be exposed to water, and the phone could be damaged if corrosion forms on the pins, so make sure it&apos;s dry before plugging it in.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the phone only maintains its water resistance as long as it&apos;s sealed to outside elements. If you crack the 6.3-inch or 6.8-inch OLED display on your Pixel 9 device, despite being made of tough <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a>, water could potentially make it into that crack, damaging the electronics. Similarly, the SIM card slot must be completely closed for the gasket to work properly. </p><p>With the powerful Tensor G4 SoC inside with 12GB of RAM on the Pixel 9 and 16GB on the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL, this phone is worth protecting. If you can keep the hardware in good condition, these phones should last you years, with Google even promising seven years of OS and security updates. The Google Pixel 9, like its predecessor, will more than likely be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> for quite a while, and it&apos;s a nice perk that Google has committed to longevity with long-term software support as well as durable hardware.</p><p>Thus, you&apos;ll want to make sure you protect these phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">Pixel 9</a>/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">Pixel 9 Pro XL cases</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-screen-protectors">Pixel 9</a>/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-screen-protectors">Pixel 9 Pro XL screen protectors</a>.</p>

An update coming to the Magic 6 Pro will enable the feature starting August 27.</p><p>While you won&apos;t be able to control your car with the phone — that was done via a unique app designed to control the custom servos and motors installed in the demo car — there are plenty of mundane use-cases Honor is touting, including pulling up notifications and opening apps just by looking at your phone.</p><p>Honor is going all-in on AI to differentiate its devices, and MagicOS 8.0 brings a slate of features in this area. Magic Portal continues to be a unique addition that makes it easier to pull up useful information or add actionable items from messaging threads seamlessly.</p><p>The Magic 6 Pro is still one of the best phones around, offering a gorgeous design and stellar cameras. The eye-tracking feature is exclusive to the device, but given the investment Honor made in the tech, it isn&apos;t hard to predict most of the brand&apos;s upcoming phones also getting the same.</p>

You can submerge in up to 1.5 meters of water for 30 minutes. You can't go scuba diving with it, but it'll survive a dip in the tub.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-about-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-water-resistance-2">What you need to know about the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold water resistance</h2>
<p>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) gives users this rating to indicate how careful they should be with their devices. The phone will be fine if you get caught in a rainstorm and have fresh water thrown at you for some reason. Other foldable phones are available with the same rating, for example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a>. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an IPX8 rating, meaning the IEC tested the phone for water resistance and received a high rating. The"8" in the rating (the second number) reveals how much water it can resist and indicates that you can drop it in freshwater as deep as 1.5 meters for as long as 30 minutes without it suffering permanent damage.</p><p>Since the IEC conducted the tests with fresh water, they gave the Pixel a rating that tells you to be careful with liquids such as sugary drinks, cleaning supplies, and similar liquids. You should also avoid exposing your phone to highly chlorinated pools and salt water, which could seriously damage it by weakening the parts and causing corrosion. The lowest number you&apos;ll see on a phone to indicate whether it is waterproof is a zero, with nine being the highest. A phone with the highest rating possible is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/blackview-bl8800-pro-review">Blackview BL88OO Pro</a>, with IP69K. The rating indicates that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> can withstand high-pressure water jets and dust, something you would find in food processing and pharmaceutical industry equipment.</p><p>The X in the IPX8 rating means that the company did not put the Google Pixel 9 Fold through testing for dust resistance. This doesn&apos;t necessarily mean it&apos;s not dust-resistant, but the company did not provide any testing details. You can protect your phone from dusty areas by placing it in a dustproof bag or by purchasing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-cases">Pixel 9 Pro Fold case</a>. Immediately dry it with a soft microfiber cloth if it gets wet, especially as the phone gets older. You can follow various cleaning tips to keep your new Pixel phone in tip-top condition by knowing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-clean-and-disinfect-your-android-smartphone#section-how-to-clean-your-phone-by-hand">how to clean and disinfect your Android phone</a>.</p><p>So, the next time you want to see if a phone is dust and waterproof, you can read it by knowing that the first number refers to its dust resistance, zero being the lowest and six being the highest. The second number refers to how waterproof the device is, with zero being the lowest and nine being the highest.</p><p>Keep in mind that daily wear and tear can degrade the IPX8 rating over time and reduce water resistance. Rough handling and falls can also damage the gaskets and seals. Avoid exposing your phone to extreme temperatures as much as possible to keep the IPX8 strong for as long as possible. If you want a Pixel with a high water and dustproof rating, you can also go with either the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, or Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p>

<p>Google is making some radical changes to its Pixel lineup once again, and it&apos;s more than just a facelift. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Google Pixel 9 series</a> represents the biggest change we&apos;ve seen in Google&apos;s Pixel phones since the Pixel 6 launched back in October 2021. We&apos;re not just talking about a new design but also an actual choice in sizes this time around.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro is the first smaller Pixel phone with the same camera and hardware features as the largest Pixel in the lineup, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Previously, you&apos;d have to opt for the biggest phone to get the best features and hardware, as we saw with last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>.</p><p>But what else can you look forward to? While Tensor G4 isn&apos;t a massive leap in everyday performance, it sports exponentially better AI processing — which means Google&apos;s exclusive Pixel apps and features all run better. It&apos;s also got satellite SOS connectivity, faster charging, more RAM, a brighter display, a better selfie camera, and a host of new features you&apos;re going to love. But is it worth upgrading to if you already have a Pixel 8 Pro? Let&apos;s find out.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="m6wKmWcDfu8dVRqaGzkQNS" name="google-pixel-9-rose-pink-display-01.jpg" alt="Holding a Rose Quartz Google Pixel 9 Pro with a pink themed home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m6wKmWcDfu8dVRqaGzkQNS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In everyday use, it&apos;s not likely you&apos;d notice much difference in the core experience with these phones. Other than the Pixel 9 Pro&apos;s more diminutive size, both phones run Android 14 with the Pixel experience atop, including the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-june-2024-feature-drop-detailed">Pixel Feature Drop</a>. The Pixel 9 Pro launches with a few more features than the Pixel 8 Pro but we expect those to make their way to Google&apos;s older phone shortly.</p><p><strong>Rear cameras: </strong>The rear camera setups of the two phones are nearly identical. They both use the same three camera sensors — a 50MP main camera, 48MP ultrawide camera, and 48MP telephoto camera behind a 5x optical zoom lens.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro sports a better ultrawide lens that takes in more light, but we don&apos;t expect a dramatic quality improvement, even if the small upgrade is nice. Both phones also sport a laser autofocus module with multi-zone focus.</p><p><strong>Temperature sensors: </strong>The only way to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-google-pixel-8-pro-temperature-sensor">Pixel temperature sensor</a> last year was to buy the big phone, but this year Google has outfitted the smaller Pixel 9 Pro with that sensor. It&apos;s located on the back of the phone in the camera island. Plus, now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-pixel-8-pro-body-temperature-sensor">it has FDA approval</a>, you can even use it to scan body temperature whenever you need it!</p><p><strong>Storage: </strong>Both phones feature the same amount of storage with identical price points between each. You can choose from 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage and neither phone supports expandable storage via microSD card.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="K7orNPM3U8hJfboWTqbwDW" name="google-pixel-9-pro-gemini-advanced.jpg" alt="Running Gemini Advanced on a Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K7orNPM3U8hJfboWTqbwDW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Protection:</strong> Pixels have had IP68 water and dust resistance for some time now, and there&apos;s no reason to expect that to change any time soon.</p><p><strong>Display: </strong>Both phones utilize a very low 240Hz <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> rate at all brightness levels. While this likely won&apos;t bother most people, folks sensitive to light flicker won&apos;t find either phone comfortable to use. That&apos;s especially true of the Pixel 9 Pro, which has an even brighter — and therefore harsher — display.</p><p><strong>Connectivity: </strong>Nearly all connectivity features are the same between both phones. Wi-Fi 7, support for all types of 5G, support for one physical SIM and one eSIM, Bluetooth 5.3, one USB-C 3.2-speed port, and stereo speakers. The Pixel 9 Pro also has satellite connectivity, which I&apos;ll cover in the section below.</p><p><strong>Software:</strong> The Pixel experience is one that you can count on to be regularly updated with new features every few months. Google calls these Pixel Drops, and they add significant value to Pixel phones. Google also maintains a whopping seven-year update schedule for its phones, so while the Pixel 8 Pro is a year old, you can still expect to see updates for six years to come.</p><p>Ironically, since the Pixel 9 is launching with the same version of Android that the Pixel 8 did — that&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> — support for it will end with the same version of Android years down the road. That should be Android 21 if the count stays the same between now and then.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5H3aZmBYMpZC9N44FRGj5f" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-rose-pink-02.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in Rose Quartz" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5H3aZmBYMpZC9N44FRGj5f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While much of the core experience of a Pixel is the same as the Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro, there are <em>a lot</em> of differences between the two devices, starting with design.</p><p><strong>Bold new design:</strong> If nothing, it&apos;s easy to spot a Google Pixel phone in the wild. That telltale camera bar sets it apart from every other phone on the market, and while Google has <em>iPhone-ified</em> the Pixel 9 series design, it still retained the trademark centered camera housing.</p><p>This time around, the camera bar has morphed into a camera island, separate from the side rails and prominently sticking out from the back of the phone. The side rails are completely flat, providing a stark contrast between the flat front and back of the Pixel 9 Pro&apos;s more industrial-designed exterior.</p><p>By comparison, the Pixel 8 Pro&apos;s curves were a lot more friendly-looking and feeling, with the back glass gently curving into the subtly curved side rails. Since the back tapered off into thinner side rails, this also gave the Pixel 8 Pro the illusion of being much thinner. I personally prefer the Pixel 8 Pro&apos;s design overall, and you might too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="548bAmXmYXau2FSmft9evg" name="google-pixel-9-pro-vs-pixel-8-pro-porcelain-04-camera-bars.jpg" alt="Comparing the Google Pixel 8 Pro to the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/548bAmXmYXau2FSmft9evg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Size: </strong>The next most obvious difference between the two phones is the size. With a 0.4-inch smaller screen, the Pixel 9 Pro is simply more comfortable to use one-handed than the Pixel 8 Pro. Plus, the Pixel 9 Pro is 14g lighter, meaning it&apos;s more comfortable for prolonged use on your little pinkie finger.</p><p>Anecdotally, users have complained about the growing size of phones for years and Google has finally answered the call by offering the same Pro-level features in the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL. For comparison&apos;s sake, the Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro <strong>XL </strong>are essentially the same size phone.</p><p><strong>Display: </strong>There are very few differences in the displays between the phones but the Pixel 9 Pro&apos;s display can get up to 3,000 nits of brightness while the Pixel 8 Pro tops out at 2400 nits. Neither of these numbers could ever be considered "dim" by any measurement, so while brighter is nice in the Sun it&apos;s not likely you&apos;ll notice a difference unless you frequent the beach a lot.</p><p><strong>SOS: </strong>The Pixel 9 Pro is the first Android phone in the U.S. with satellite SOS connectivity, letting you reach out for help even if you&apos;re literally in the middle of nowhere. That, alone, might be worth the upgrade, depending on your lifestyle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dnfZyRQictSRsHsu9DsuSg" name="google-pixel-9-pro-vs-pixel-8-pro-porcelain-02.jpg" alt="Comparing the Google Pixel 8 Pro to the Google Pixel 9 Pro and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dnfZyRQictSRsHsu9DsuSg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Battery and charging: </strong>The Pixel 9 Pro features a smaller battery than the Pixel 8 Pro because of the physical dimension differences — a 350mAh smaller battery, to be precise — but two things help offset that difference a bit. First is the charging speed.</p><p>With Google&apos;s new 45W charger, the Pixel 9 Pro can charge to 0-55% in 30 minutes. That&apos;s not particularly fast compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 12,</a> but it certainly beats a Galaxy S24, and it&apos;s marginally faster than the Pixel 8 Pro.</p><p><strong>Processor:</strong> The second battery life difference is wrapped up in the processor upgrade on the Pixel 9 Pro. Google says the Tensor G4 is cooler and more efficient than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3</a> in the Pixel 8 Pro, which, by comparison, was also cooler and more efficient than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g2">Tensor G2</a> in the Pixel 7 Pro.</p><p>We&apos;ll be testing this over the next few weeks, but the Pixel 8 Pro had no problem getting through a full day on a single charge, so we don&apos;t expect the Pixel 9 Pro to have a problem, either. If there&apos;s any one thing we hope most for, it&apos;s that the Tensor G4 in the Pixel 9 Pro stays cooler than other Tensors, which have a bad reputation for overheating and slowing the phone down.</p><p>That newer processor is also good for more than just better battery life, too. Tensor G4 is capable of processing AI-related tasks 2.25x faster than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in all other flagship Android phones like the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Given that all the new features Google announced for the Pixel 9 series are AI-related, this means the Pixel 9 Pro does Pixel things better than any other Pixel before it. Say that three times fast.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rj2RiPCrqxpXpK6XxBUkcF" name="google-pixel-9-rose-pink-01.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 9 Pro next to a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and an official Google case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rj2RiPCrqxpXpK6XxBUkcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Better multitasking: </strong>The Pixel 9 Pro packs in more RAM than any Pixel before it, including the Pixel 8 Pro. We&apos;re talking 16GB of RAM versus 12GB of RAM between these two phones, and heavy multitaskers will feel that difference every single day. If you juggle lots of apps at once, the Pixel 9 Pro is the right choice.</p><p><strong>Security changes:</strong> Google outfitted the Pixel 9 series with a new ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. Some folks were happy when this rumor appeared a few weeks ago, but I&apos;ve never had a good time with ultrasonic sensors, particularly when I try to use a tempered glass screen protector. I&apos;m not convinced this was a good change, but time and testing will paint a better picture.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NeW7yGLqNLaYFmz8oh4bci" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-display-lockscreen-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NeW7yGLqNLaYFmz8oh4bci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Selfies galore: </strong>Selfie takers will immediately notice how much better the Pixel 9 Pro&apos;s front-facing camera is. First off, it&apos;s quite a bit wider at 103 degrees, meaning you can fit more people into the frame without things getting awkward.</p><p>Second, the resolution has been improved and the new sensor is said to take in 30% more light than the old sensor. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review">Pixel 8 Pro camera review</a> showed that last year&apos;s camera was pretty darn good but this kind of upgrade always helps things.</p><p><strong>Gemini all the things:</strong> Every Google Pixel 9 comes with a free year of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a>, which, as you might expect from the name, is Google&apos;s most advanced AI engine. As Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/14517446">official product support page</a> states, "Gemini Advanced is far more capable at highly complex tasks like coding, logical reasoning, following nuanced instructions, and creative collaboration."</p><p>While Gemini is plenty powerful on its own, Gemini Advanced gives you access to the real brains behind the machine. If you&apos;re a tinkerer or just want to see if AI can do your homework, Gemini Advanced is a key tool for getting the most out of your phone. You can always pay for Gemini Advanced on a Pixel 8 Pro, but it&apos;s only included in the $20/month Google One tier, which includes 2TB of cloud storage and some other goodies.</p>

<p>You&apos;ve heard the saying "bigger is better," and while that might apply rightly to some things, it&apos;s not always true with phones. In the past, only the biggest phones offered the best features and the most powerful hardware, but Google is changing that in a great way with the Google Pixel 9 Pro, the first smaller Pixel phone with Pro-level cameras and features.</p><p>If you&apos;re running a Pixel 8 Pro already, upgrading to a Pixel 9 Pro makes the most sense if you&apos;re tired of having a big phone or spend a lot of time in the middle of nowhere. The upgrade will get you more RAM, a better processor, a brighter display, a better selfie camera, and potentially life-saving satellite SOS connectivity.</p><p>The best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-preorder-deals">Google Pixel 9 deals</a> can get you the new phone for a lot less, too, especially if you&apos;ve got a Pixel 8 Pro to trade in.</p>

By the Pixel Watch 4 launch, we can hope for new hardware perks.</p><p>Here is our early Google Pixel Watch 4 wishlist for areas of improvement, plus the scant rumors and patents we&apos;ve heard about Google&apos;s next smartwatch.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-watch-4-rumors-and-patents"><span>Google Pixel Watch 4: Rumors and patents</span></h2>
<p>Google patents dozens of ideas per month, many of which will never see the light of day in a commercial product. That said, there are a few Pixel Watch and Fitbit patents we&apos;ve spotted that we&apos;d <em>like</em> to see in the Pixel Watch 4, in theory.</p><p>The most bizarre and intriguing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-patent-shows-touch-bezel-controls">Pixel Watch patent</a> is one where Google turns its rounded-edge bezel into a squeezable, touch-sensitive control interface. In the exhibits below, you can see how Google envisions you tapping or sliding specific portions of the Pixel Watch edge to trigger actions like music controls, a flashlight, or a favorite app. </p><p>You could squeeze the screen to pause a song or open a notification, potentially <em>instead</em> of using the Pixel Watch 3&apos;s trademark crown. The patent includes a long list of potential actions based on the length, direction, speed, or location of your swipe or squeeze, which sounds a bit too complicated to work in practice but still sounds intriguing.</p>

<p>We highly doubt the Pixel Watch 4 would ditch its crown, but using the bezel edge for controls isn&apos;t that different from what Samsung does with its digital touch bezel on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7.</a></p><p>Another intriguing patent comes from the Google-owned Fitbit, claiming the idea for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-patented-a-fit-score-trick-that-every-smartwatch-could-use">smartwatch "Fit Score"</a> that informs the user how well the watch&apos;s bottom sensors can read your health data based on how snugly you&apos;re wearing it, as well as "differences in wrist size, skin color, hair density, BMI, fat percentage, and the likes."</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 would need a "Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS)" that would adjust your data if it detected that your watch wasn&apos;t fitted properly; for example, it would disregard low SpO2 warnings if your watch comes loose while you&apos;re sleeping.</p>

<p>Another Fitbit patent that uses on-wrist games to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-patent-shows-plans-to-monitor-mental-health">monitor your mental health</a> could be a nice feature, but we&apos;re focusing more on potential Pixel Watch 4 hardware changes. On that note, Fitbit has patented several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbits-soon-gain-ability-monitor-your-blood-presure">blood pressure monitoring</a> systems in the past few years, including one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/12059233" target="_blank">this August</a>. We know Google <em>wants</em> to implement these sensors soon; we just doubt it&apos;ll be consumer-ready by the Pixel Watch 4.</p><p>We also saw a Fitbit patent for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-arterial-stiffness-monitoring-patent">detecting arterial stiffness</a> as a warning sign for cardiovascular issues.</p><p>Beyond these long-term plans and ideas, we don&apos;t know yet what Google has planned for the Pixel Watch 4; Google itself probably doesn&apos;t know yet. So let&apos;s discuss what they <em>should</em> do.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-watch-4-wishlist"><span>Google Pixel Watch 4 wishlist</span></h2>
<p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 should keep the Watch 2&apos;s place among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">best Wear OS watches</a> once we&apos;ve fully reviewed it, but the competition isn&apos;t that fierce, and software isn&apos;t Google&apos;s main issue. </p><p>Here are all the ways that the Google Pixel Watch 4 should improve on its predecessor.</p>
<h2 id="better-battery-life-2">Better battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="g3VgNpcJfceduLa8MnGJx8" name="google-pixel-watch-3-sleep-tracking-2.jpg" alt="Sleep Tracking tile in Morning Brief on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g3VgNpcJfceduLa8MnGJx8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When we look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a>, many of them can last in a range from 40–100 hours, depending on the size and setting. The Pixel Watch 3&apos;s 24 hours with AOD or 36 hours with Battery Saver settings are lower than the rest of the competition. Even before we review it, we know that&apos;s a downside for a lot of people, especially those that use watches for sleep tracking.</p><p>To be clear, most watches with three-day battery lives like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> are larger and heavier than the Pixel Watch 3, with about twice the battery capacity. But the fact remains that these watches are much more convenient to use because they don&apos;t require daily charges.</p><p>By the Pixel Watch 4 launch, we&apos;d love to see Google employ its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Wear OS Hybrid Interface</a> and rely more on the Cortex coprocessor (or a more efficient MCU) to stretch out its battery life to 48+ hours without AOD. That&apos;ll probably start by adding a better CPU, which brings us to our next point...</p>
<h2 id="add-a-new-snapdragon-or-tensor-cpu-2">Add a new Snapdragon or Tensor CPU</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ubr3aUgtSFHaXthdqnK6fZ" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-app-drawer.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7's app drawer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ubr3aUgtSFHaXthdqnK6fZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Qualcomm developed the Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 in 2022, and it basically saved the Wear OS brand by giving watches the power they needed to revamp their software. Still, its 4nm silicon is already behind Samsung&apos;s 3nm Exynos W1000 in the Galaxy Watch 7, and we&apos;d expect a proper performance boost after three years.</p><p>Our first hope is that Qualcomm announces a new Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 CPU at its upcoming Snapdragon Summit, or at any point before next summer so the Pixel Watch 4 can incorporate it. Ideally, it would perform background tasks more efficiently to stretch out the Watch 4&apos;s lifespan.</p><p>As an alternative, we know that Google is hard at work developing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">3nm Tensor G5 CPU</a> using TSMC instead of Samsung, to make the Pixel 10 faster and more efficient than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>. It also made a proprietary Tensor A1 CPU for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-launch">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>. If Google can make its own 3nm Watch 4 CPU via TSMC, that would be exciting in its own right.</p>
<h2 id="dual-band-gps-and-new-sport-focuses-2">Dual-band GPS and new sport focuses</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="pzyoKMnEpU3eZs4XgU3Rng" name="google-pixel-watch-3-build-a-workout-on-watch.jpg" alt="Build workout on Pixel Watch 3 directly" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzyoKMnEpU3eZs4XgU3Rng.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-series-goes-official">Pixel Watch 3 launch</a> explicitly targeted runners with new software like custom run workouts, Fitbit Premium AI-generated daily run workouts, weekly cardio load tracking versus your target load, running form analysis, and a Morning Brief showcasing your Daily Readiness to work. It also promised "the most accurate heart rate for running" with a new Watch 3 HR algorithm that reduces "light artifacts" during fast-paced activities.</p><p>So why on Earth didn&apos;t Google give the Pixel Watch 3 dual-band GPS the one hardware upgrade it needed to take full advantage of this?</p><p>GPS-only running watches struggle with signal blockage, showing you off your actual running route when you&apos;re near tall buildings or underneath foliage. It can significantly change your estimated run distance and pace. That&apos;s why we were happy to see Samsung give the Galaxy Watch 7 dual-band GPS, and other brands like Amazfit have brought dual-band tracking to cheaper watches.</p><p>By the Pixel Watch 4, we hope to see Google rectify this and provide more accurate tracking. On top of that, we hope that Google and Fitbit continue to improve their fitness software for other sports like cycling or hiking. Running was a good starting point, but they should keep going.</p>
<h2 id="a-proper-wheelchair-mode-2">A proper wheelchair mode</h2>
<p>It&apos;s unconscionable that so few smartwatch brands and operating systems have implemented a wheelchair mode. Folks like Android Central&apos;s Jerry Hildenbrand can&apos;t get excited about watches that only offer "steps" instead of "pushes" and have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">move alerts</a> that insist you stand up when you can&apos;t.</p><p>That&apos;s why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a>, with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">dedicated wheelchair mode</a> that judges things like aerobic energy differently to take disability into account, is such a great option. And it&apos;s disappointing that we haven&apos;t seen a similar tack taken by other watch brands. Ideally, when the Pixel Watch 4 tracks your Fitbit Active Zone Minutes, it&apos;ll give wheelchair-bound folks a tailored experience.</p>
<h2 id="new-health-data-2">New health data</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qhfq-P2G_1I" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> added some exciting health-tracking tricks like continuous body response (cEDA), passive irregular heart rhythm warnings, and skin temperature, the only new health feature the Pixel Watch 3 offers is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection-explained">Loss of Pulse feature</a> that uses the PPG and wear detection to determine if you&apos;re experiencing a cardiac event and call emergency services for you.</p><p>We love this feature, but we hope that Google and Fitbit can bring new health data with the Pixel Watch 4 outside of emergencies. We wrote above about Fitbit patents for blood pressure or arterial stiffness, which are possible candidates. </p><p>Samsung recently gave its Galaxy Watch 7 blue, yellow, violet, and ultraviolet LEDs to enable new health data like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">AGEs Index</a>, which are "products formed when sugar interacts with proteins or fats in the bloodstream." A high Index corresponds with potential "diabetes, heart disease, and renal failure" issues, making it useful as a preventative metric. The Pixel Watch 4 doesn&apos;t have to track AGEs specifically, but it&apos;s the <em>type</em> of thing we&apos;d like Google to focus on so competitors don&apos;t leave it behind.</p>
<hr>
<p>We have plenty of other potential requests for the Pixel Watch 4. One colleague with the Pixel Watch 2 says he wants Google to improve notifications, making them visible without always having to turn your wrist or tap the screen. Another said jokingly that he wants the Pixel Watch to morph into a smart ring at night; we know there&apos;s a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbits-smart-ring-patent-is-just-the-beginning">potential Fitbit Ring</a> in development, so maybe we&apos;ll see that alongside the Watch 4.</p><p>Google follows Samsung&apos;s lead a lot, and what with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> making waves, we wonder if we&apos;ll see a Pixel Watch Ultra next year, addressing some of our complaints with longer battery life. We&apos;re not sure if we&apos;d actually want this, as much as we&apos;d hope the base Pixel Watch 4 improves on its own.</p>

<p>If you love Pixel phones, you might have your eye on the new Google Pixel 9. While it might not be worth an upgrade if you just bought the Google Pixel 8, even the 7, it’s a solid upgrade model for something older from either Google or another Android brand. With a gorgeous screen, fast and wireless charging, plenty of RAM, and seven years of support, you can’t go wrong.</p></p>

<p>If you were already impressed with the Google Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, you’ll be even more pleased with the company’s newest variations of each. When comparing the Google Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 9 Pro, the differences are much like they are with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-vs-google-pixel-8-pro">Pixel 8 vs. Pixel 8 Pro</a>. However, both phones also feature stunning upgrades from previous generations of models.</p><p>We’re here to help you choose a device from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> to upgrade to if you’re looking to trade in your old Pixel for a new one or perhaps make the switch to these branded devices for the first time.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Q7GuZrc2wXEKQJNz4D6HxV" name="google-pixel-9-rose-display-01.jpg" alt="The bright vibrant display of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL next to a bouquet of flowers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q7GuZrc2wXEKQJNz4D6HxV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro look relatively similar. But there are some details worth noting about how they differ in basic specs. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9, which comes in Obsidian, Porcelain, Wintergreen, or Peony, has a 6.3-inch Actua OLED display that boasts a 1,080 x 2,424 resolution at 422 ppi. The refresh rate is from 60-120Hz, adjustable based on the application, and the screen is covered with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a>. Get up to 1,800 nits brightness in HDR and 2,700 nits peak brightness. </p><p>The glass screen is complemented by a polished back with a satin metal finish frame that is IP68 water and dust-resistant. The screen also has a fingerprint-resistant coating. The phone comes with 128GB or 256GB storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6988px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NXEiLRpjZ3uQCusqLLfGPD" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-official-photo-4.jpg" alt="An official press photo of people making a selfie with the Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NXEiLRpjZ3uQCusqLLfGPD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6988" height="3931" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Available in Obsidian, Porcelain, Hazel, or Rose Quartz, the Pixel 9 Pro is made with the same scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover glass with a polished metal frame, but it has a silky matte back. It, too, meets an IP68 rating, has a fingerprint-resistant coating, and a 6.3-inch display. However, the screen is much higher in resolution than a Super Actua LTPO OLED screen with a 1,280 x 2,856 pixel resolution at 495 ppi. </p><p>You can adjust the frame rate from 1 all the way up to 120Hz with the Google Pixel 9 Pro, which can presumably lead to a smoother experience as well as improved battery life. Get up to an impressive 2,000 nits brightness in HDR or a whopping 3,000 nits peak brightness. </p><p>Both phones are identical in dimensions and weight, and both have a 4,700mAh battery that affords the same 24+ hour battery life that can be extended to up to 100 hours using the Extreme Battery Saver mode. Both also support fast charging, so you can get back up to more than half charge in just 30 minutes. This is when using the Google 45W USB-C charger, it should be noted, which is sold separately in both cases. Both are also Qi-certified, so you can use them with wireless chargers. Both include Battery Share for using the phone to charge other compatible devices, like Google Pixel Buds. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro both include features like fingerprint unlock, face unlock, and pattern PIN and password. Both also have stereo speakers, three microphones, noise suppression, and Spatial audio support. With both phones, you get seven years of OS and security updates as well as frequent Pixel Drop updates, so you can confidently hold onto either of these phones for many years to come. </p><p>Bottom line: the main difference when it comes to look and feel is that the Google Pixel 9 Pro has a silky matte back versus the satin finish and a much higher resolution, brighter, and smoother screen.</p>

<p>Before diving further into the features and functions of these phones and how they compare, let’s look side-by-side at the specs.</p>

<p>There are some notable differences here that could sway you in the direction of the Google Pixel 9 Pro or confirm that you will find the Pixel 9 sufficient.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro-features-functions-and-performance-2">Google Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 9 Pro: Features, functions, and performance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="no7QVAxMzTCCHcyZQH6SSd" name="google-pixel-9-pixel-studio-02.jpg" alt="Generating art using the Pixel Studio app on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/no7QVAxMzTCCHcyZQH6SSd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let’s get down to what makes these two phones different when it comes to performance. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9 devices launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, are powered by the Google Tensor G4 processor, and come equipped with 12GB RAM. Also, with Android 14, the Google Pixel 9 Pro boasts a much more powerful 16GB RAM. </p><p>With both phones, you also get Google VPN along with end-to-end security designed by Google. This includes multi-layer hardware security, tensor security core, Titan M2 security co-processor, anti-malware and anti-phishing protection, and spam protection for phone calls and messages. </p><p>Both offer safety features, including satellite SOS, emergency SOS, crisis alerts, car crash detection, safety checks, and more. There’s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, Bluetooth 5.3 with dual antennas for enhanced quality and connection, NFC, Google Cast, and built-in GPS. One difference between them is that, along with all the other sensors they include, the Google Pixel 9 Pro adds a temperature sensor. It also adds an ultra-wideband chip for accurate ranging and spatial orientation. </p><p>So, both these phones offer comparable specs when it comes to performance. The main differences you’ll find relate to the screen refresh rate and display itself, as noted above, along with the fact that the Google Pixel 9 Pro has more RAM. If you’re a serious mobile gamer, then you might want to opt for the step-up phone. Otherwise, both offer specs comparable to those of the performance department.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Lpe8pzAR77rLv3XNeojouJ" name="google-pixel-9-camera-add-me-feature-hero.jpg" alt="Using the new Add Me feature on a Google Pixel 9 to add someone to an existing photo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lpe8pzAR77rLv3XNeojouJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cameras are somewhat different between these two phones, with the Google Pixel 9 Pro being an expected step up in this department. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9 has a 50MP wide camera with up to 8x Super Res Zoom alongside a 48MP Quad PD ultra-wide camera lens with Macro Focus. Its front camera is just 10.5MP, but it has autofocus and a 95-degree ultra-wide field-of-view. It offers all the usual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> editing features, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>, Magic Eraser, Best Take, Photo Unblur, and Portrait Light. </p><p>The rear camera of the Google Pixel 9 can take 4K videos with a digital video zoom of up to 7x, while you can also take 4K videos from the front camera. Enjoy features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a>, cinematic blur, slo-mo, and more. There’s stereo recording, speech enhancement, wind noise reduction, and audio zoom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="9nn9cCSwAJSpyTVUqMnFnR" name="google-pixel-9-pro-official-lifestyle-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro official lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9nn9cCSwAJSpyTVUqMnFnR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro has a much more sophisticated camera system. The main camera is also 50MP wide, but it allows Super Res Zoom to be up to 30x, thanks to the addition of a third lens. This is complemented by a 48MP Quad PD ultra-wide camera with Macro Focus along with another 48MP Quad PD telephoto camera. While the Google Pixel 9 has a single-zone LDAF (laser detection autofocus) sensor, the Pixel 9 Pro’s is multi-zone. </p><p>The front camera on the Google Pixel 9 Pro is a 42MP dual PD selfie camera with autofocus and a larger 103-degree ultra-wide field-of-view. Along with the usual camera features you’ll find in the Google Pixel 9, the Google Pixel 9 Pro adds a few more. This includes the option to take high-res photos up to 50MP and use Zoom Enhance. </p><p>For video recording, the Google Pixel 9 Pro can capture videos at up to 8K resolution, powered by Video Boost, and with Super Res Zoom up to 20x. Along with the Audio Magic Eraser, you also get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">Video Boost</a>, as noted, as well as Night Sight Video and Super Res Zoom Video. </p><p>For content creators, the Google Pixel 9 Pro is clearly the better option. This is especially so if you tend to shoot selfie photos and videos, like livestreaming, and if you take snapshots from farther away, like at sporting events, concerts, or scenic shots. We won’t know for sure how these cameras compare and perform, however, until we get our hands on the phones to test them out. Stay tuned for our reviews.</p>

<p>There are slight differences when looking at the Google Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 9 Pro that might suggest you’ll want to get the better of the two. The main one is the improved cameras, especially the front camera, on the Pixel 9 Pro compared to the Pixel 9. If you shoot a lot of content, you might prefer the Google Pixel 9 Pro, which has advanced features, particularly when it comes to zoom shots. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro also has a brighter and potentially more responsive screen along with more RAM to afford a smoother experience during intensive tasks like gaming. The additional storage options are a bonus as well, especially since neither phone offers expandable storage via memory card slot. </p><p>But the Google Pixel 9 might be sufficient for most. The 12GB RAM is nothing to scoff at, and while the refresh rate goes from 60Hz to 120Hz versus all the way down to 1Hz, you might not notice this if you’re constantly multitasking on your phone and need that high refresh rate most of the time anyway. Just keep in mind that the battery could potentially drain faster on the Google Pixel 9 because of this. </p><p>With seven years of updates along with Feature Drops for both phones, you can be confident with either one. If you feel you want more, including a bigger device, opt for the also new Google Pixel 9 Pro XL instead.

<p>For everyday users, the Google Pixel 9 will impress. It has many of the same features as the Google Pixel 9 Pro with some concessions when it comes to screen resolution and brightness, RAM, storage, and cameras. But even so, it’s still a premium device that will please average users. Plus, you can’t go wrong with seven years of updates.</p></p>

Due to its larger size, the 45mm Pixel Watch 3 can&apos;t use them. Don&apos;t worry, there are loads of excellent screen guards available for both sizes of the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>Screen protectors are mainly made of tempered glass or plastic. You should pick the material of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> screen protector based on your use case. If you&apos;re clumsy and tend to bump into everything around you, it&apos;s a good idea to stick with glass screen protectors. I myself prefer glass because I could trip on air. But if you&apos;re a stable person with a good sense of spatial awareness, a plastic screen guard for your Pixel Watch 3 is okay too.</p>

<p>All of the best Pixel Watch and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-2-screen-protectors">Pixel Watch 2 screen protectors</a> can fit your next-gen Pixel Watch 3, but only if you get the 41mm case size. Sadly, the variety of accessories for the larger 45mm Pixel Watch 3 isn&apos;t as wide as compared to the regular old 41mm size. You can&apos;t even use older Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 bands on the 45mm variant, which is such a shame.</p><p>So, if you&apos;re rocking the 45mm Google wearable, you&apos;ll have fewer choices to pick from when getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-bands">Pixel Watch 3 bands</a> and screen guards. That being said, the situation with screen protectors for the watch is a lot better than watch bands, because a lot more of them are available for both 41mm and 45mm sizes.</p><p>The EGV 6 Pack for the Google Pixel Watch 3 is filth cheap and it gives you six, very high-quality TPU films to protect your wearable. These screen guards are made of durable TPU, so they are scratch-proof, capable of self-healing, and ultra-thin. The thinness ensures high touch response, even with the screen protector on your Pixel Watch 3.</p>

<p>The lovely Google Pixel Watch Active Band now comes in two sizes to accommodate the Pixel Watch 3, 41mm and 45mm. You can get this comfy fluoroelastomer band for any occasion.

<p>How I wish Google had figured out a way to use the same bands on both the 41mm and the 45mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-color-google-pixel-watch-3-should-you-buy">variants of the Pixel Watch 3</a>. They couldn&apos;t make this happen so now, anyone with the larger 45mm smartwatch is stuck with far fewer options when it comes to the best Google Pixel Watch 3 bands.</p><p>I highly recommend the Google Pixel Watch Active Band as the best overall band. And although you get this band in the box, I still suggest getting one more color to round things off. The Active Band comes in a couple of colors, but not all of them are available on the 45mm wristbands. Still, this is the most comfortable Pixel Watch 3 band hands down. You feel no fatigue or irritation even after wearing the band all day long and fleuroelastomer plays nice with sensitive skin. Also, the band&apos;s waterproof and it doesn&apos;t get dirty easily.</p><p>Style and pizzazz can be found in the Caseology Pixel Watch 3 lineup of wristbands. Both the Caseology Athlex Band and Caseology Nano Pop look sporty, are waterproof, and have an ergonomic wear experience. Swapping your existing strap with Caseology&apos;s bands is easy thanks to the spring action pin connector. And the best part is, if you&apos;re a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> owner, you can grab a matching phone case to compliment your Pixel Watch 3 band.</p><p>Want even more choices?
