<ul><li>Google has released the first beta for Android 15 that eligible Pixel device owners and developers can get in on.</li><li>Android 15's first beta helps with app experience on larger displays, app archiving updates, and more for those with braille displays.</li><li>The first beta marks Google's beta milestone for Android 15, and the company states it still plans to move into "platform stability" by June.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google released the first beta of Android 15 today (Apr. 11), and with it come a few important features enrolled testers should know about.</p><p>According to Google, the first Android 15 beta is arriving for the Pixel 5a up to the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8</a> series devices. This also includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> and the Pixel Tablet. Android 15&apos;s first beta brings more awareness to how larger displays (foldable/tablets) experience apps. Google states it has enabled the software&apos;s edge-to-edge capabilities for apps by default.</p><p>This update primarily benefits developers as they no longer need to tell the app to enable such capabilities explicitly. Furthermore, those creating apps will find Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/insets#inset-handling">Material 3 composables</a> available for extra assistance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1091px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.40%;"><img id="kD6ZvpZurfzDQ4YDse9sdX" name="android-15-first-beta-edge-to-edge-apps-enabled-default.jpg" alt="Google has enabled edge-to-edge display capabilities for apps in Android 15 by default." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kD6ZvpZurfzDQ4YDse9sdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1091" height="539" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android 15 is picking up additional support for app archiving. Google states the software&apos;s first beta displays OS-level support for archiving and unarchiving unused apps to benefit "all app stores." The OS will remove the chunkier API and cached files but leave behind a user&apos;s data.</p><p>Due to this, Google says users will see the app remain in their device&apos;s launcher alongside an icon highlighting its "archived" state.</p><p>The company continues its push for better security with Android 15, introducing "Key management" for E2EE (end-to-end encryption). The beta will offer such management at an OS level for the API for contact keys. In turn, this will let users easily manage and verify another user&apos;s contact information.</p><p>More inclusivity is inbound for Android 15 as the initial beta opens its testing doors on TalkBack&apos;s support for braille displays. The software is only compatible with braille displays using the HID standard over USB and secure Bluetooth.</p>

<p>Google states it plans to reach "platform stability" for its next major OS release by June. The company is right on schedule with its desired Android 15 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/overview#timeline">development timeline</a>. Users should expect betas in April and May before we eventually move into its stability phase. Those enrolled in the beta are encouraged to provide feedback as the process continues.</p><p>The company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">second developer preview</a> of Android 15 landed near the end of March and was all about Google&apos;s upcoming satellite connectivity. The company is preparing to introduce satellite capabilities for users&apos; SMS/MMS and RCS chats when they&apos;re without a Wi-Fi or cellular connection. Additionally, Google stated that it will continue to tighten the reigns on user security to bolster its capabilities in Android 15.</p>

<ul><li>Instagram announces several new features users can expect to see on the platform.</li><li>Currently, all users globally have access to "Cutouts," which lets users turn their photos into usable stickers and videos into animated stickers.</li><li>Instagram is preparing to introduce "Notes Prompts" that encourage more interaction while exploring Notes on profiles.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Here&apos;s a bit of fun to end your week: Instagram is introducing a few new features that are preparing to arrive for all users for DMs and more.</p><p>As detailed in a press release, the platform states the three features users can expect are designed to breathe more personality into Stories, Reels, and Notes. The first of the features is "Cutouts," which lets users turn photos into their own unique stickers.</p><p>Instagram states users use these custom stickers in Reels and Stories and any stickers created from a video will be animated.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:603px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.50%;"><img id="Da5rJsSWfygze7rmchDk3h" name="instagram-cutouts-creation-example.jpg" alt="Instagram now lets users turn their photos and videos into usable stickers for Reels and Stories." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Da5rJsSWfygze7rmchDk3h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="603" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the social media platform allows users to grab "eligible photos you see on Instagram" and turn them into usable stickers.</p><p>The next update is arriving for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-new-collaborative-features-notes-group-profiles">Instagram&apos;s Notes</a>, which will bring "prompts" to the quirky "set your mood" feature in DMs. The company states it has started exploring a way for users to "add prompts" to Notes that will encourage more interaction between users, friends, and followers. Those who see the prompt attached to your Note will be able to respond to it.</p><p>Prompts will appear within a user&apos;s DM page and display the number of responses it&apos;s received so far. Upon tapping, a short menu will appear from the bottom of the UI showing every user&apos;s response to the prompt. Your profile icon will be placed in the top left corner of this small menu, which, when tapped, will throw you into the standard Notes UI for you to write your mood.</p><p>Similar to how Notes works currently, it looks like users will be able to fine-tune the prompt&apos;s sharing settings. Users will likely find the option to share their "Notes Prompt" with followers they follow back or with close friends only.</p>

<p>That&apos;s not all for Notes; as Instagram teases, it&apos;s working on a way to bring the short blurbs to profiles. The feature is "coming soon" and will let users display their Notes on their profile for 24 hours. A person&apos;s blurb will appear right above their profile photo like a thought bubble.</p><p>Instagram states that Cutouts are currently available globally to all users. However, those interested in the new Notes feature must wait as it is still "coming soon."</p>

<hr>
<p>Rakuten Kobo has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kobo.com/news/now-in-colour-bring-your-books-to-life-with-the-new-kobo-libra-colour-and-kobo-clara-colour-ereaders" target="_blank">introduced</a> its first color e-readers, the Kobo Libra Colour and Kobo Clara Colour, alongside the classic black and white Clara BW.</p><p>The Libra Colour and Clara Colour are stepping up the game in Kobo&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">e-reader lineup</a>, building on the company&apos;s beloved e-readers, the Libra 2 and Clara 2E. These new devices ditch the old monochrome Carta 1200 screens in favor of E Ink&apos;s Kaledio 3 module.</p><p>E Ink&apos;s Kaleido 3 screen technology boasts crisp 300ppi resolution in grayscale mode. But when you switch to color, that resolution dips to 150ppi. Still, E Ink promises a palette of 4,096 colors with richer saturation, a step up from the previous-gen Kaleido Plus display.</p><p>To tackle the extra load, Kobo has beefed up the Libra Colour&apos;s processing power compared to the Libra 2. Plus, it has upgraded the battery, now packing a 2,050mAh capacity, putting it on par with other e-readers known for their long-lasting battery life, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-review">Amazon Kindle Paperwhite</a>. </p><p>The Libra Colour rocks a spacious 7-inch display and a generous 32GB of storage, all wrapped in an ergonomic design for cozy reading sessions. It keeps the perks of the Libra 2, like its IPX8 waterproof build and physical page-flipping buttons. Plus, it&apos;s now compatible with the Kobo Stylus 2, but snagging one will set you back an extra $70 since it&apos;s sold separately.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:820px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="oLdXBr62ZTjkPmoZLU5JWk" name="Kobo-Libra-Colour.jpg" alt="Kobo Libra Colour in white on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oLdXBr62ZTjkPmoZLU5JWk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="820" height="461" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Kobo Libra Colour </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Rakuten Kobo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the flip side, the Clara Colour stands out more from the Kobo Clara 2E. It sticks with the trusty six-inch display and IPX8 waterproofing but ups the ante with 16GB of storage and a beefed-up processor.</p><p>Both models provide access to the Kobo.com bookstore and seamless integration with OverDrive for snagging library books. They&apos;re also Bluetooth-ready, so you can listen to Kobo Audiobooks wirelessly.</p><p>These devices pack ComfortLight Pro-tech, which dials down the blue light, making late-night reading sessions comfy and easy on the eyes.</p><p>Kobo is also revamping the black-and-white version of the Clara, now dubbed the Clara BW, to set it apart from its colorful counterpart. It&apos;s pretty much the same as the old Clara 2E but with a speedier dual-core processor borrowed from the color models.</p><p>The Kobo Libra Colour will retail for $220, while the Kobo Clara Colour will be priced at $150. If you&apos;re eyeing the monochrome display, the Kobo Clara BW comes in at a lower price of $130. They&apos;re set to launch on April 30, and you can already pre-order them straight from Kobo&apos;s website.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung announces that more language support will arrive for its Galaxy AI software and features soon.</p><p>According to a press release, Samsung is preparing to expand the number of languages (and dialects) Galaxy AI supports this spring. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> already supports 13 languages, but Samsung states Arabic, Indonesian, and Russian will soon be options for users who are more comfortable with those languages.</p><p>Additionally, the Korean OEM plans to incorporate Australian English, Cantonese, and Canadian French into Galaxy AI&apos;s dialect side.</p><p>While not given an exact date, Samsung is interested in further widening its service by supporting Romanian, Turkish, Dutch, Swedish, traditional Chinese, and European Portuguese. The company states users should see these languages enter the fold "later this year."</p><p>In a follow-up newsroom post, Samsung&apos;s president and head of mobile, TM Roh, said the company is "committed to democratizing mobile AI for all; Galaxy AI’s language expansion this year will allow even more Galaxy users to communicate beyond language barriers on a scale that is completely unique to Samsung."</p><p>However, what&apos;s curious is Samsung&apos;s apparent teaser about additional devices that receive Galaxy AI features. After reiterating devices that currently have some, the company added that there are "more coming soon."</p>

<p>As Samsung highlighted, its increased language support will help those using Live Translate, Chat Assist, Note Assist, and more. Many of these features arrived for several past-gen devices at the end of March <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-ai-announcement">with the One UI 6.1 update</a>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23</a> series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>, Galaxy Z <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>, Fold 5, and Tab S9 series were among the eligible devices for the update.</p><p>These phones and tablets also received Google&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a>," which lets users run a web search for anything, anywhere on their phone.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s light teaser of Galaxy AI on even more devices makes sense, as the Galaxy S22 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-galaxy-ai-support-potential">could be on that list</a>. The company&apos;s TM Roh spoke briefly about it, stating the brand is conducting a "review" of the series to see if Galaxy AI features could function properly on the S22 series. The glaring issue is how heavily reliant Galaxy AI is on a device&apos;s hardware.</p><p>Despite that, Roh seemed somewhat confident it could be done—but we&apos;ll have to see. As for what else could join it—the waiting game continues!</p>

<p>Plankton isn&apos;t the only menace befalling the residents of Bikini Bottom! A new foul algae beast has taken over and needs to be cleaned up immediately in the first paid DLC for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/why-are-chores-more-fun-in-vr">PowerWash Simulator VR</a>, available now on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/3713270985434472">Meta Quest store</a> for $7.99.</p><p>Players will have the chance to use new PowerWash tools to clean up six different environments, including Conch Street, The Bikini Bottom Bus, The Krusty Krab, The Patty Wagon, The Invisible Boatmobile, and The Mermalair. As is the case with the base game, you can join friends to help make the clean-up easier and more of a social experience.</p><p>The SpongeBob SquarePants paid DLC follows the game&apos;s previous free DLC, The Muckingham Files 1 & 2, which added six brand new missions and bonus missions to visit previous client locations with new jobs.</p>

The studio head says the developer still has full autonomy over its titles and will continue to support and develop games like the PowerWash Simulator series for "years to come."</p><p>While PowerWash Simulator VR had some technical issues on launch, FuturLab has patched them out and upgraded the visuals for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> players. Since then, gamers have been praising the game&apos;s zen-like gameplay and immersion, which lets them relax and decompress alongside friends in the multiplayer mode while earning achievements along the way.</p>

<ul><li>The latest Google Photos app version shows Google's continued development of the "recover storage" feature for Android users.</li><li>Similar to the web, Android users will be able to compress previously saved photos and videos in their Photos cloud storage to free up space.</li><li>Google warns that compressing older files is irreversible and will not affect future uploads if users choose to do so.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new option hidden within the code for the Google Photos app teases a familiar space-saving function.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/10/google-photos-app-recover-storage/">PunikaWeb</a>, courtesy of AssembleDebug, the latest 6.78 version of Photos contains information regarding a coming "Recover Storage" option. The feature was discovered within the "Account Storage" section, under "Manage Storage." Upon tapping, the Android app showed an addition to the page that would let users "convert photos to Storage saver."</p><p>Google&apos;s description says the saver will "recover some storage" by reducing the quality of your previously cloud-saved items to save space. This method involves all of a user&apos;s photos and videos they&apos;ve saved via the cloud.</p><p>A subsequent page states <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Photos</a> will not touch the original quality of items stored in Gmail, Drive, or YouTube. Additionally, other items on a user&apos;s Pixel device may not be roped into this either.</p><p>The publication states Google&apos;s continued development of Recover Storage has brought in more information about photo/video compression. The company will seemingly warn users in-app that compressing their older items to a reduced quality "can&apos;t be reversed."</p><p>Users should also be prepared to wait a while as the app does its thing, which could take a few days.</p>

<p>If this feature sounds familiar, it&apos;s because the web-based version of Photos already offers this space-saving option. The good thing is that compressing your older media won&apos;t affect your future uploads, as stated on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6220791?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=1#zippy=%2Clearn-about-changes-to-backup-quality%2Cpixel-st-generation%2Cpixel%2Cpixel-a-:~:text=Reduce%20the%20size%20of%20your%20photos%20%26%20videos">support page</a>. So, if you&apos;re running out of space (again), you can always try to compress your files again.</p><p>There&apos;s speculation that Google could roll out its Recover Storage option to Android users soon as its functionality seems nearly done. Moreover, it seems it will arrive for iOS devices in conjunction with Android.</p><p>Yesterday (Apr. 10), the company announced that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-expands-ai-editing-features">few powerful AI editing tools</a> will soon arrive in Photos for free. Beginning May 15, all users can utilize Magic Eraser, Photo Unblur, Portrait Light, and a few more without a subscription. Eligible devices include those running Android 8 and above, Chromebook Plus devices, and iOS 15 and above.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube Music is improving its podcast features to attract more listeners to its platform.</li><li>People now have control over sorting options, recommendations and an updated search function.</li><li>YouTube Music team promises more improvements in the near future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube Music is picking up pace on its podcast content following the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-podcasts-shuts-down">shutdown of Google Podcasts</a> in an effort to make YouTube Music a better place for podcast enthusiasts. As this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-google-podcasts-migration-instructions">migration continues</a>, the Youtube Podcast team said in a Reddit post that they&apos;ve been "doing a lot" following consumer feedback to improve their experience on the app and that we should see more improvements.</p><p>The team points out three recent improvements made to the podcast user experience. Listeners can now sort a podcast&apos;s episode from newest to oldest, oldest to newest, most popular, or default (the order set by the creator).</p><p>Secondly, listeners outside of the United States who have podcasts in the YouTube Music Library will be able to see podcasts on their Home screen, including a new "Recommended shows" shelf. And finally, the team has also made changes to search results, making it easier to find YouTube podcasts. </p>

<p>Podcasts in YouTube Music <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-podcasts-launch">officially launched in April 2023</a>, when Google first started letting users in the U.S. listen to podcasts on YouTube Music. It has received several updates throughout the year and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-podcasts-global-launch">expanded to other countries</a> outside the U.S.</p><p>A major update that YouTube Music received was when the platform started to accept audio-only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-audio-only-podcast-upload-rss-feed">RSS feeds</a> — a quick and automated setup for creators to join the platform.</p><p>The YouTube team seemed optimistic about the future of YouTube Podcasts: "This is only the beginning, and the Podcasts team is working on a lot more improvements!"</p><p>Users have also been asked to join the conversation on Reddit about what improvements they&apos;d like to see in the future. Hopefully, in light of Google Podcasts shutting down, we can see more feature parity for users who were used to the now-defunct service.</p>

You can do everything from basic step counting to tracking your sleep, monitoring your heart for irregular heartbeats, and measuring and analyzing your body fat — a feat rarely found in a smartwatch. </p><p>One of my favorite uses of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4 Classic</a> is to track my workouts and outdoor adventures without needing to take my phone along, which also means connecting my favorite pair of Bluetooth earbuds directly to my watch. So, let&apos;s go ahead and answer the question:  how <em>do</em> you pair Bluetooth headphones with a Galaxy Watch?</p>
<h2 id="how-to-pair-bluetooth-headphones-with-a-galaxy-watch-2">How to pair Bluetooth headphones with a Galaxy Watch</h2>
<p>1. Put your earbuds in pairing mode. This will vary depending on the model that you are using. </p><p>2. From your Galaxy Watch, <strong>swipe down</strong> from the top of the watch face to reveal the <strong>Quick Panel</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Settings</strong> (cog) icon.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Connections</strong>. </p><p>5. Select <strong>Bluetooth</strong>. </p>

<p>Wait a beat, and before you know it you’ll see that your earbuds are connected to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch</a> and ready for you to tackle whatever’s next!</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-pairing-your-headphones-to-your-watch-2">The benefits of pairing your headphones to your watch</h2>
<p>Maybe you’re going to the gym, or maybe it’s a hike, but you can leave the phone at home (or in the car, hidden) and use that 16GB of onboard storage to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-save-music-files-galaxy-watch">transfer music files to your Galaxy Watch</a> and jam out to Beyonce’s new Cowboy Carter album while you get your sweat on!</p><p>You did do that ahead of time, didn’t you? If you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-launches-personalized-ai-playlists">subscribe to Spotify</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>, you can also use those services to get some motivational tunes, or podcasts onto the watch for those workouts as well. It&apos;s all good now that you know how to pair <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a> with a Galaxy Watch!</p><p>With the LTE version of the watch, you don’t even have to worry about downloading content directly to it, you can stream on the go to your heart’s content. Provided you have a strong enough signal and an app that supports standalone streaming from your Galaxy Watch. Personally, I’d rather have the music downloaded. Ain’t nobody got time for buffering in the wilderness!</p><p>I used one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a> on the market, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-review">Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4</a>, but these directions work with any Bluetooth wireless earbuds or headphones. If you really want to get the most out of that Bluetooth connection, pair your Galaxy Watch to Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a>, and you’ll be able to use the Buds app on the watch to control features like adaptive noise canceling right from the watch.</p>

<p>It&apos;s a Sega classic from the instant you start it up, with music by Rez veterans and addictive, high-score-based gameplay to match. But this isn&apos;t the only time I&apos;ve found myself practically addicted to a VR game where I smash a ball with some kind of racket.</p><p>Before C-Smash, it was Racket Club, a social Squash/Pickleball hybrid with a community that&apos;s as friendly as it is competitive and immediately landed on our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games/12">best Meta Quest games</a> when it debuted last Fall. Beyond these two titles, there&apos;s a notable enthusiast community that loves playing other racket games like Eleven Table Tennis, Pickleball One, Cybrix, Racket Fury, and several others.</p><p>Like Wii Sports, games that revolve around existing sports tend to be the most accessible experiences because you don&apos;t have to re-teach gamers what to do. People already know how to hit a ball with a tennis racket or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/helloreal-quest-golf-putter">a golf club</a>, and like the Wii, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> enhance the experience and make it feel even more real.</p>

<p>C-Smash VRS originally launched as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-ps-vr2-review">PSVR 2</a> exclusive game last Spring. It&apos;s a complete reimagining of the classic Dreamcast game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfnCyHqbc4Y">Cosmic Smash</a>, which puts players on one side of a Squash-sized court while blocks are placed on the other side.</p><p>If you&apos;ve ever played the classic Atari game Breakout — or one of its many clones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=breakout.brick.breaker.classic">on the Google Play store</a> — you&apos;ll immediately understand the concept. It&apos;s your job to lob the ball across the court and take out the targets as fast as possible. C-Smash is a classic arcade game through and through, awarding high scores and worldwide leaderboard placement for the best players.</p><p>The single-player campaign sees you making your way through the stars with its quirky Space Channel 5-esque sci-fi theme that feels a bit like it came out of the 1960s. Before the rounds begin, you&apos;ll choose your pathway through a randomized solar system that&apos;s filled with power-up planets, each of which will present a different challenge to clear out bricks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V4fGRewk5zgcosJPreaJoV" name="c-smash-vrs-official-screenshot-01.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of C-Smash VRS on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V4fGRewk5zgcosJPreaJoV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: RapidEyeMovers)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even the soundtrack is superb, ushering in a wave of catchy tunes and funky beats by the ever-amazing DJ Ken Ishii. If you don&apos;t immediately recognize the name, know that he was behind the soundtracks for Sega classics like Lumines and Rez. The game feels Sega through and through, and for a guy who grew up as a Sega Genesis fanboy, I&apos;m all here for it.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>As a kid who grew up as a Sega Genesis fanboy, I'm all here for C-Smash's incredible soundtrack and arcade gameplay.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Each planet features a different court theme and power-ups like multiball will no doubt excite pinball fans as they watch dozens of balls explode from those special bricks and clear out the entire court in seconds. I managed to get a top-5 high score worldwide in one of these multiball rounds before C-Smash VRS went public on Quest last Friday, although I doubt I&apos;m still on the leaderboard at this point.</p><p>Because each court is wider than you&apos;ll likely be able to move in your home space, you&apos;ll use the left controller stick to slide your character left and right to help yourself reach even the widest shots from the backplane.</p><p>I played the game on the PSVR 2 when it came out but decided I wasn&apos;t a fan of games that make you move around as much, given that the PSVR 2 has a cable I tend to trip over. Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> is completely wireless, I never once felt like I was being pulled out of the experience just to remember not to trip.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ygMYy3ScxjgRRJcQ8M5WeV" name="c-smash-vrs-official-screenshot-02.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of C-Smash VRS on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ygMYy3ScxjgRRJcQ8M5WeV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: RapidEyeMovers)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But C-Smash isn&apos;t just a single-player experience, and for me, that&apos;s where the real longevity comes into play. C-Smash VRS features several different multiplayer modes that put players on courts that face each other, tasking them with clearing or claiming all the bricks before the other player.</p><p>The mode&apos;s one weakness is that there&apos;s no cross-play at the moment, but the team confirmed that it&apos;s something they are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSVR/comments/1bg5b9o/comment/kv6d814">looking at implementing</a> in the future. In fact, that very Reddit thread outlines a new C-Smash Saturday meetup program the team at RapidEyeMovers holds every Saturday at 1pm PT / 4pm ET / 8pm GMT. It&apos;s perfect if you&apos;re looking for a little mid-day breakup of a lazy Saturday and it&apos;s sure to get your heart pumping.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1847px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.82%;"><img id="qwC7ppPkU4DrsAEPbYnFF6" name="wii-sports-tennis.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Wii Sports tennis" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qwC7ppPkU4DrsAEPbYnFF6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1847" height="1031" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Screenshot by Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think it&apos;s fair to say that Wii Sports sold more Wii consoles than any other game. The game was a free pack-in with every Wii sold in the West, proving the importance of including an accessible, killer app with every system.</p><p>Everyone loved Wii Sports. Gamers, non-gamers, young people, old people, etc. It was a game that brought people together for some fun physical activity in the living room and was instantly playable no matter your skill level. The game felt like pure magic and its influence can be spotted in many VR games to date.</p><p>In the same way, many VR sports games can offer extremely accessible gameplay by keeping things simple. C-Smash VRS is slightly more complicated than something like Wii Sports because it&apos;s more "video gamey," but that&apos;s why there are games like Racket Club.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHwNrFR2Fiw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>When you start up Racket Club, you&apos;re not greeted with a complicated menu system or a lot of nonsense hoops to run through. You can immediately head out the door and be placed into a public lobby filled with players ready to show you the ropes. The game instantly makes sense and it only takes a few seconds to understand the nuances that make it different from other racket games.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Racket Club's friendly community is as good as the game itself.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Just like C-Smash, you&apos;ll be hitting a ball with a racket and bouncing it off a wall, but unlike C-Smash, your opponents will hit the ball right back at you. Each court is only as big as the play space you&apos;re standing in which means you won&apos;t need to virtually move your character around with a joystick.</p><p>The latest update lets you customize and adjust the racket itself, too, helping players of all kinds feel comfortable holding the virtual racket the way they want to. I always take some time to adjust to each racket game&apos;s holding angle, so this was a particularly refreshing update for me.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZu-TcE4JDQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Racket Club&apos;s endearing fan base ensures you&apos;ll always have a good time. Players have always been super friendly and talkative, willing to play a few practice rounds to warm you up, and even gracious when they lose.</p><p>Unironically, it comes from the same developers that put together Demeo, a game that boasts one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-did-demeo-avoid-the-toxic-culture-of-so-many-multiplayer-games">friendliest online communities</a> I&apos;ve ever experienced. The internet is filled to the brim with jerks and trolls, but I have yet to have a bad experience with either of these titles from Resolution Games.</p><p>But while Wii Sports&apos; gameplay largely plateaus after a short time, Racket Club&apos;s simple-to-learn mechanics are more rewarding the more time you put into the game. The game has a true experience curve that feels realistic in both single-player and multiplayer modes, thanks to the company&apos;s unique use of deep learning AI for its computer-controlled players.</p><p>That means no matter if you want to play through the game&apos;s deep single-player campaign mode or head straight online and play against real human players, you&apos;re bound to have a rewarding experience. Couple that with the safety that mixed-reality gameplay delivers — you can play far better when you&apos;re not worried about smashing your TV — and it&apos;s clear that Racket Club is the Wii Sports Tennis successor we&apos;ve been looking for.</p>
