<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-3-repair-lack-report"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a> launched just a week ago, but we&apos;re still learning more important details about the smartwatch before it ships to consumers. Turns out, you might want to invest in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-screen-protectors">screen protector for the Pixel Watch 3</a>, because Google&apos;s policy for broken models is that they will be replaced, not repaired.</p><p>A Google representative confirmed this with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-watch-3-cant-be-repaired-3472994/">Android Authority</a>, stating that if you have a broken <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, you should check with "the Google Pixel Watch Customer Support Team to check your replacement options."</p><p>This isn&apos;t that much of a surprise, given this was essentially the policy for the Pixel Watch 2 and its predecessor. And while not exact reason was given, it&apos;s likely due to the way the watch was designed, which may make it difficult to repair.</p><p>Instead, Google recommends users enroll in its Preferred Care program, which covers damages received, including "out-of-warranty issues." However, if you do end up needing to replace your watch, you&apos;ll have to fork over $49, and given the cost of the insurance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-no-repair-policy-should-not-surprise-you">you&apos;ll have to decide if it&apos;s worth it to you</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch 3 is available for preorder now, so be sure to check out available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-best-google-pixel-watch-3-preorder-deals-how-to-buy-and-what-to-expect">preorder deals for the smartwatch</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-camera-astrophotography-manual-control"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>One of the best features on Pixel phones just got a little better. Thanks to the latest update to the Pixel Camera app, you can now manually trigger Astrophotography mode to capture pictures of the night sky.</p><p>Previously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography mode</a> needed to be activated automatically by keeping the phone still and waiting for the mode to appear. Once the moon icon appeared on the shutter button, you were then able to activate the mode.</p><p>Now, users simply have to switch to Night Sight mode in the camera app, and Astro mode will appear on the slider, where you can adjust the timer (see image above).</p><p>It&apos;s certainly a handy change, especially for Pixel owners who may not have known how to enable Astrophotography mode. This should make it easier to take cool images of the night sky, especially if and when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/may-2024-northern-lights-pixel-8-pro-galaxy-s24-plus">northern lights</a> decide to make another appearance in lower latitudes.</p>

Now, Google is giving Gemini a bit of a visual upgrade, which appeared on Pixel phones and is rolling out widely.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/23/gemini-glow-floating-overlay/">9to5Google</a>, the visual upgrade may look the same, but you&apos;ll notice there&apos;s a glow around the Gemini box when you bring up the assistant. However, it&apos;s not just a new glow that this brings; this signals a notable change in how Gemini behaves, which will now bring up answers in a floating box instead of taking up the full screen.</p><p>The new UI will help users use Gemini more contextually. It will allow users to drag and drop generated images into apps and ask for information about content on certain apps, like YouTube.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/google-ai-android-update-io-2024/#gemini-on-android">announced</a> this new Gemini experience back in May during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O 2024</a>, so it&apos;s good to see it reaching users now.</p>

Google is now building on this with a new Polish feature, which will essentially take what you&apos;ve already written and turn it into something more palatable.</p><p>To further refine your email, you can choose options such as Formalize, Elaborate, and Shorten to better correspond with what you&apos;re looking for.</p><p>You&apos;ll find this in the <strong>Refine my drafts</strong> option, which will now appear in email drafts on mobile devices when there are 12 or more words present.</p><p>These options, including Help me write, are available on Android and iOS devices, but you have to be a Workspace user with Google One AI Premium, Gemini Business/Enterprise add-on, or Gemini Education/Premium add-on.</p>

However, there are limits put in place to help prevent the generation of offensive or illegal content. As a result, the model won&apos;t (or shouldn&apos;t) produce images of public figures or any weapon-related visuals to prevent misuse.</p><p>It&apos;s actually pretty easy to get started, as you just need to head over to Google&apos;s ImageFX AI Test Kitchen and sign in with your Google account. And according to Android Central senior editor Jerry Hildenbrand, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-need-to-try-googles-imagefx-ai-image-generator">this is something you should definitely try for yourself</a>.</p>

We&apos;ve seen smart rings before, but none have the ecosystem and brand recognition of a product from a company like Samsung.</p><p>And for many people, it&apos;s a great product. Like any tech product, it has drawbacks and strengths, but it fills a need for plenty of us. Smart rings are here to stay, at least until something even smaller and more inconspicuous comes along to replace them.</p>
<p>Smart rings are different in another way, too: they&apos;re disposable by design. This is not because a company like Samsung or Oura wants to build something with a short, useful life but because there&apos;s no way to do it differently.</p><p>Imagine a small circuit board, some sensors, a tiny battery, and plenty of epoxy, and you have what&apos;s needed to build a smart ring. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/98423/samsungs-galaxy-ring-revealed">Over at iFixit</a>, they&apos;ve taken the time to crack open a Galaxy Ring to demonstrate this, and this is why we love iFixit. What they found shouldn&apos;t surprise anyone.</p>

There is no way to pack in the necessary tech and battery to power it and make the device serviceable without making it exorbitantly expensive. You wouldn&apos;t pay $800 for a smart ring, and neither would I.</p><p>This means more e-waste to deal with, but for us, it&apos;s not the big issue. That comes when we think about the lithium battery that powers the thing and how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">short the lifespan of a lithium battery is</a>.</p>
<p>The warranty period for a Galaxy Ring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/legal/LGL10000282/">is 12 months</a>. I reached out to Samsung to see if there are any further details to consider but the company hasn&apos;t responded in time for publication. When it does, I&apos;ll be sure to add any information about it.</p><p>Twelve months is also about the lifespan of the tiny lithium battery inside of it. A battery of this type has a life measured in charging cycles, and after about 400 of them the battery starts to go bad — it won&apos;t hold as much charge and it loses its charge much faster. Fortunately, smart rings tend to have pretty good battery life, so you won&apos;t have to charge them as often as you would a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatch</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JQ854PVT2R6KqQcRGXJ8xS" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-hero-16-9.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring balanced inside its charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JQ854PVT2R6KqQcRGXJ8xS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So once you&apos;ve charged your ring about 400 times, you can expect the battery to stop being "good enough." It will still work, but not for very long, and for a product designed to be worn so it can read a bunch of health data, time on the finger and not the charger is very important.</p><p>Once you reach the point where the battery isn&apos;t lasting long enough to make it useful for you, the only thing you can do is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-recycle-your-old-android-phone">drop it in a recycle bin</a> somewhere and buy a new one for $400.</p>
<p>To me, the biggest problem here is that a smart ring&apos;s "disposability factor" kills any market for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/more-people-are-buying-usedrefurbished-phones-ever">used or refurbished devices</a>. Never buy a used smart ring unless you personally know how long it has been used for and how it was used. </p><p>A smart ring isn&apos;t like a phone where you can save a fistful of cash buying used and spend a little of it to get the battery swapped out. When the battery dies, it&apos;s either covered by the warranty, or it isn&apos;t. If it isn&apos;t, you&apos;re only option is to buy something else.</p>
<p>I&apos;m not trying to discourage anyone from buying a smart ring. For plenty of us, a few hundred dollars every year or so is a solid way to spend money in order to help live a healthier lifestyle.</p><p>I&apos;m just pointing out what all the flashy ads you see aren&apos;t going to tell you: this cool product wasn&apos;t designed to last very long.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring lasts up to a week per charge, 10ATM and IP68 protection via the titanium frame, an ultra-lightweight design, and a complimentary charging cradle for on-the-go charging. It tracks a bunch of heart rate and sleep data passively, while being much more comfortable than a smartwatch.</p></p>

Purchase the new flagship phone alongside any six-month data plan at Mint and the T-Mobile-owned carrier will hook you up with with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>$400 discount AND six additional months of wireless</strong></a> coverage for 100% free. Mint Mobile has launched deals like this in the past, and I&apos;m not exaggerating when I say that these offers tend to <em>disappear extremely quickly</em>. In other words, don&apos;t wait to make your move if you&apos;re even remotely interested in this bundle deal from Mint. </p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 was just released on August 22nd, but you can already score a whopping $400 discount AND six months of free wireless coverage when you bundle the purchase of the phone with any six-month data plan at Mint. It's easily one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-deals-pixel-9-pro-discounts">best Google Pixel 9 deals</a> I've seen since the phone was first unveiled earlier this month, but don't expect it to be around for long. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c1e720f4-a69c-4b11-a3c4-1d3c933b3e09" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Thanks to this deal, you can get Google&apos;s latest flagship phone alongside an <em>entire year</em> of T-Mobile-powered wireless for as little as $489 when you pay upfront (or $21 per month if you use affirm). Even if you sign up for Mint&apos;s most-expensive Unlimited plan, you&apos;re still looking at a max upfront payment of $579. That&apos;s over $200 less than you&apos;d pay if you bought the unlocked Pixel 9 by itself, and that&apos;s not even considering the value of covering your phone bill for a year. </p><p>Our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carrier</a> in the biz, Mint Mobile isn&apos;t a slouch when it comes to coverage either. Owned and operated by T-Mobile (and famously endorsed by Ryan Reynolds), Mint operates with a simple buy-in-bulk plan system that gives you access to the world&apos;s largest 5G network, plus a free mobile hotspot and calls to Mexico and Canada. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, on the other hand, comes packed with Google&apos;s latest AI-powered technology, excellent cameras, and the efficiency of the Tensor G4 chipset. You also get seven years of OS updates guaranteed, which means you could be using this phone long after you say goodbye to Mint (if you decide to do so).</p>

<hr>
<p>Yet again, Meta has reportedly canceled development for the Quest Pro 2 XR headset.</p><p>The report stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-cancels-high-end-mixed-reality-headset">The Information</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-cancels-high-end-mixed-reality-headset" target="_blank">,</a> which states that "Meta employees" informed the publication about a canceled "high-end mixed reality" project (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-reportedly-canceled-quest-pro-2/" target="_blank">Upload VR</a>). The device in question is codenamed "La Jolla," which was stated to be the Meta Quest Pro 2. Supposedly, the Reality Labs team working on the project wanted to keep costs low and sell the device for under $1,000.</p><p>Sources add that those ambitions were becoming increasingly difficult due to the "high cost of displays." The headset was supposedly preparing to debut with a micro OLED display, which in itself is already "difficult to produce." The technology is similar to what Apple provides in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/rogue-ascent-quest-best-hand-tracking-game">Vision Pro</a>. The report claims that the Reality Labs team ran into cost troubles as the technology required ran high.</p><p>Notable Meta members like CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CTO Andrew Bosworth reportedly delivered the news.

<p>With that, it&apos;s clear that "La Jolla" was simply one cog in the Quest Pro 2 project machine. This isn&apos;t the first time that a version of the XR headset has been dropped. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/2024s-quest-pro-2-is-officially-canceled-but-thats-not-the-end">In March 2023</a>, Bosworth said that a device codenamed "Cardiff," which was supposed to take on the Quest Pro 2 moniker, got canceled. Instead, the company shifted toward a new adventure: "La Jolla."</p><p>Meta teased at the time that La Jolla would "feature photorealistic avatars" when it launched. Based on what Bosworth said in his recent Threads post, "La Jolla" has likely fallen into the "pass" category as Meta shifts its sights to better align with its goals for an XR headset. Meta has not confirmed that the Pro 2 is gone for good.</p><p>The Meta Quest Pro 2 had a similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/lg-made-meta-quest-pro-2-canceled">report surfaced in June</a>, making us feel like we&apos;re in a time loop. LG reportedly backed out of the project for a high-performance XR headset. The company has reallocated its personnel from the XR business to other areas as the former no longer aligns with its internal projections. It&apos;s stated that LG would remain on board with Meta for R&D purposes.</p><p>In other news, Meta announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-nervous-about-meta-horizon-os">Horizon OS</a>, the next iteration of its Quest OS. Despite the company moving in a very Google-esque way, its debut caused more concern than awe.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is already several OS updates ahead of Mobvoi and will continue to widen the software gap. Its durability, ultra-bright display, fast performance, and three-day battery life make it one of the best Wear OS watches out there, but it's also a bit too expensive for many buyers.</p></p>

<p>Among Wear OS watches, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro represents a battle for the title of best battery life. Both can last several days in normal conditions or extend their lifespans with battery-saver modes. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> has plenty of upsides over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>, primarily its more advanced software. But given that the Enduro has very similar specs and sensors to the Ultra, weighs much less, and costs nearly half as much, it&apos;s certainly a reasonable alternative!</p><p>While the Galaxy Watch Ultra is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> today, the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro gives it a run for its money as a premium smartwatch. Here are all of the main Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro differences to help you make your choice.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HmcTNNQwbAcxQDmWvLuspb" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-apps.jpeg" alt="The app drawer on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmcTNNQwbAcxQDmWvLuspb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung&apos;s all-titanium Ultra case looks stylish and pleasingly contoured but painfully thick and a little too heavy unless you&apos;re used to heavy watches. Samsung claims it&apos;s only 12.1mm thick, but it&apos;s really closer to 16mm once you account for the unmeasured sensor bump.</p><p>The 11.95mm TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro also measures thicker than its spec sheet, but it&apos;s still about 1mm skinnier and weighs 15.8g/ 0.56oz less, primarily because Mobvoi used aluminum instead of titanium, except for the ridged steel bezel.</p><p>Samsung offers more band options than Mobvoi&apos;s single rubber option, including the thick, water-repellent Marine, comfortable and lightweight Trail, and more generic, sporty Peakform.</p><p>While aesthetics is a matter of opinion, the Galaxy Watch Ultra will look more stylish to most people, if a bit cartoonishly thick from the side, while the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro has more of a sporty, everyday appearance in line with other fitness watches.</p><p>Both watches have a claimed MIL-STD-810H rating. Samsung specifies that the Ultra can withstand "high/ low temperatures, altitude, humidity, immersion, salt, fog, dust, vibration, and drops," while Mobvoi doesn&apos;t specify how rugged it is in certain conditions or if it only withstands drops. We do know the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro has a more standard 5ATM water protection rating, while the Ultra hits 10ATM.</p>

<p>Mobvoi gave the Enduro a Sapphire crystal lens to protect the display, one of the few improvements over the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> with Gorilla Glass. That matches Samsung&apos;s watch display for scratch protection.</p><p>Both watches only come in one display size, cutting out small-wristed folks who want better battery life and a lighter design. While Samsung&apos;s AMOLED watch display is slightly larger, they share the same pixels per inch (PPI), about 320.</p><p>Where Samsung clearly wins the head-to-head battle is brightness. Mobvoi doesn&apos;t advertise its display nits, so we assume it hits only 1,000 nits or less with adaptive brightness; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Mobvoi-TicWatch-Pro-5-Smartwatch-Review-Does-a-lot-and-lasts-just-as-long.738093.0.html">Notebook Check</a> only measured a 472-nit maximum on the TicWatch Pro 5, and we don&apos;t think Mobvoi updated anything besides the sapphire glass. By comparison, Samsung gave the Watch Ultra a vivid 3,000-nit max, making it really easy to read in direct sunlight.</p><p>Mobvoi&apos;s unique display quirk is its Ultra-low-power display, seated atop the AMOLED, for switching to "Essential" mode. You can choose from different backlight colors but otherwise the watch face will be black text, numbers, and symbols on a blank background, and it extends the watch&apos;s battery life by days, or even weeks.</p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s other display advantage (sort of) is its digital bezel around the edge, letting you scan quickly through Tiles by sliding your fingertip along it. Many people prefer the physical rotating bezel found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a>, but this solution avoids making the Ultra any heavier.</p><p>The TicWatch 5 Pro Enduro has a more traditional crown along the right edge, but only Mobvoi redesigned it from the standard Pro, so it&apos;s "less flush with the side casing and easier to scroll," according to our reviewer. It also has a secondary side button.</p><p>Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>&apos;s two-button layout, the Galaxy Watch Ultra has a third, orange <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-quick-button">Quick Button</a> that enables shortcuts like pausing or restarting a workout or triggering an emergency siren, and it looks quite svelte. Our only disappointment is that Samsung didn&apos;t make this button a crown as an alternative to the digital bezel, so that you have easier controls during workouts.</p>

<p>Both watches have 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage but rely on different CPUs. Mobvoi employs the same Snapdragon W5 chip as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, with four Arm Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz and a 22nm co-processor (250MHz) for background tasks. Samsung developed its own Exynos W1000 CPU with one Cortex-A78 (1.6GHz) and four Cortex-A55 (1.5GHz). </p><p>In other words, even though Samsung&apos;s new chip isn&apos;t clocked quite as high, it has one extra high-end core that helps speed through tasks quickly. Because of that, both watches speed through tasks and load apps quickly.</p><p>Samsung gave its watch better connectivity options than Mobvoi: The Ultra supports LTE, Wi-Fi 5GHz, and Bluetooth 5.3, while the Enduro has no cellular option, defaults to Wi-Fi 2.4GHz, and has Bluetooth 5.2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7mrkoZzGaUGqnUb5w9JFzQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-ecg.jpeg" alt="An ECG reading on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7mrkoZzGaUGqnUb5w9JFzQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of health and fitness sensors, both share an accelerometer and gyroscope for tracking arm movements, GPS and a compass for tracking and navigation, a barometer for elevation data, continuous heart rate data, and blood oxygen and skin temperature data at night. </p><p>Only the Galaxy Watch Ultra has dual-band GPS tracking, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test" target="_blank">which performed well in our fitness testing</a> against a dual-band Garmin watch and for heart rate data against a heart rate strap. </p><p>The TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro has a serious fitness focus. Its detailed TicHealth app allows you to track your workout progress without a subscription, even if it&apos;s not as popular as Samsung Health. We simply wish it had dual-band GPS, as well.</p><p>Both have irregular heart rhythm warnings, though only Samsung has an active ECG sensor for clearer confirmation of any issues. Samsung has a body composition sensor (BIA) for calculating your body fat and muscle percentages, though we&apos;ve found it to be fairly inaccurate compared to smart scale data. Unfortunately, you&apos;ll need a Samsung phone to access your AFib data, which is a frustrating choice for Samsung.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5pS3aGG3vpRrvQ7vr3NQhU" name="ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-oneplus-open-mobvoi-health.jpeg" alt="Mobvoi Health on the OnePlus Open and TicWatch 5 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5pS3aGG3vpRrvQ7vr3NQhU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The big question, of course, is battery life. The TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro has an extra 38mAh capacity, a slightly smaller display, and a dimmer backlight than the Ultra, which theoretically helps it last longer. </p><p>According to each company&apos;s spec sheets, the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro lasts 90 hours in the standard Smart mode or a whopping 45 days in Essential mode with the secondary display; the Galaxy Watch Ultra lasts 60 hours with the always-on display (AOD) active, 100 hours in Power Saving mode, or 16 hours with dual-band GPS.</p><p>In practice, our TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro reviewer called it "the Energizer bunny that just keeps going" and praised how it consistently lasted a few days per charge. The Galaxy Watch Ultra had issues with power drain initially but became much more efficient with post-launch updates. It actually lasts longer than its 60-hour w/AOD estimate, though it still won&apos;t quite catch the Enduro for longevity.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra launched with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> and will receive four major OS updates, plus four years of security updates. Google and Samsung coordinate on annual releases, so Samsung is always the first to receive new software, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung watches</a> let you choose between Google or Samsung apps for default functions, like Google Assistant or Bixby.</p><p>The TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro launched with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-3">Wear OS 3.5</a>. Although the Pro 5 series began an internal Wear OS 4 beta test in April 2024, we&apos;ve yet to see an official release. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a> adds better data backups and transfers between phones, Gmail and Calendar apps, and (most importantly) Google Assistant support. At the moment, TicWatches can only use Alexa as an assistant.</p><p>However long it takes Mobvoi to implement Wear OS 4, it&apos;s clear that the company will never catch up with Samsung and Google for software. Our reviewer harped on this issue in particular, saying he hadn&apos;t expected Mobvoi to release a new watch version without fixing its software delays first.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra is a long-lasting smartwatch in terms of software, battery life, ruggedness, and its future-proofed CPU. That might be enough to justify spending its high $650 price tag, especially if you can find a good trade-in deal to cut down on the price.</p><p>Still, the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro costs hundreds less and is often found on sale, while offering comparable performance, battery life, and display quality, along with a lighter design and the upside of its low-energy dual display and crown controls. If it weren&apos;t for the software issues, the Enduro would be an easy recommendation.</p><p>Considering those, it&apos;s tricky to suggest buying the Enduro when we have no guarantee about Wear OS 4&apos;s timetable or the possibility of future updates. It depends on whether you need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch" target="_blank">Wear OS watch</a> for cutting-edge smarts and voice assistant commands or if you&apos;re happy enough with actionable notifications and a ton of health data.</p>

<ul><li>The Galaxy S24 FE has reportedly run through the FCC for the usual certification hurdles with NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, and Wi-Fi 6.</li><li>Testing for its charging was conducted with a charger of 25W alongside details of Samsung offering a wireless alternative.</li><li>The Galaxy S24 FE is rumored to feature slimmer bezels and a slightly less noticeable chin and a 4,500mAh battery over the S23 FE's 4,000mAh.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s next FE phone for the S24 series might launch soon if its latest certification visit is any indication.</p><p>The FCC listing was discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-global-variant-fcc-battery/">91Mobiles</a> alongside additional details regarding its connections and other specifications (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s24-fe-fcc-3474690/">Android Authority</a>). The device&apos;s typical certification hurdles show that Samsung will likely provide NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, and GNSS support (GPS).</p><p>In Korea, the publication states Samsung has cleared the necessary tests for the Galaxy S23 FE&apos;s battery. The device supposedly rocks two different battery model numbers: EB-BS721ABE<strong> </strong>and EB-BS721ABY. Moreover, the company has reportedly tested the device with a wired charger supporting 25W.</p><p>The FCC&apos;s listing adds that the S24 FE may support wireless charging as another option.</p><p>Samsung is also eyeing 5G support (not surprising). The listing shows that the Galaxy S24 FE will likely cover a broad range of 5G bands.</p>

<p>Rumors previously suggested that the S24 FE&apos;s design would stick <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-renders-leak-showcasing-its-design">close to its larger flagship friends</a> — as the S23 FE did. With a clear look at the individual lenses in its vertical triple camera array, the back panel is likely to arrive with a glossy finish. However, things change on the front as the S24 FE might sport smaller bezels than the S23 FE, which featured a chin that was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">anything but acceptable</a>.</p><p>The exact screen size still hasn&apos;t been narrowed down, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-specs-leak">one rumor claims</a> 6.1 inches, and another suggests 6.6 inches.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-galaxy-ai-same-design-leak">Galaxy Tab S10 series</a> may join the FE phone, as rumors state October could host both launches.</p>

<ul><li>Google's first Android 15 QPR beta points toward a customizable alternate to Do Not Disturb called "Priority Mode."</li><li>Users can create custom modes under this mode, outfitted with fine-tuning options for how apps interact with it, people, display, and more.</li><li>Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1 started rolling out yesterday (August 22), which makes matters strange considering we don't have Android 15's stable version yet.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google didn&apos;t detail new features in its first QPR build for Android 15, but some eagle eyes spotted an upgrade for a long-standing feature.</p><p>Mishaal Rahman, writing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-priority-modes-3474550/" target="_blank">Android Authority,</a> discovered a hidden feature within Android 15&apos;s QPR1 Beta 1 code called "Priority Mode." According to the code, this new mode will bring a fully customizable DND (do not disturb) experience. Users can tap "Add mode" and begin reconfiguring settings for their specific purposes, not unlike Samsung&apos;s Modes and Routines.</p><p>As an example, Rahman showcased "Theater mode" within Priority Mode. The settings are broken into sections, with the first labeled "Stay focused." There, users may find options like filter interruptions, people (those who won&apos;t be blocked), apps, "alarms & other interruptions." Google&apos;s early code states the latter includes media.</p><p>Another option for display settings was spotted beneath an "Additional actions" label in the mode.</p><p>It also seems that Google is keeping "set a schedule" in Priority Mode so users won&apos;t have to dip into settings to turn a mode on. However, the post states users <em>cannot </em>schedule DND to activate automatically as that&apos;s now reserved for any created Priority Modes.</p><p>Speaking of, the custom modes you create through Priority Mode will be listed on its specific settings page. The post states users can find it by heading into <strong>Settings > Notifications </strong>or the <strong>Sound & Vibrations </strong>page. Priority Mode will feature the standard Do Not Disturb option with the chance to create Custom Modes right beneath it.</p>

<p>Rahman noted that Google&apos;s code shows a Priority Mode tile in the Quick Settings alongside DND. With Priority Mode hidden within Android 15&apos;s QPR1 Beta 1, it&apos;s unclear if we can expect this before the year&apos;s over. Additionally, there are nine options (icons) when creating a custom mode. So, it seems Google is trying to push customization for user needs with this one.</p><p>Google started rolling out its OTA update for enrolled Pixel testers for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-1-begins">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1</a> on August 22. The update was relatively small, arriving at around 500MB for some users. The company did not detail all that users could expect; instead, it offered insight into the usual hiccups of beta software.</p><p>Those over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/22/android-15-qpr1-beta-1-everything-new/">9to5Google</a> did spot a new long-press Quick Settings tile and a new loading animation early in the test.</p><p>The timing of things couldn&apos;t be odder as Google has released QPR1 Beta 1 to Pixel testers <em>without </em>launching Android 15. The software has faced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-it-mean-if-both-google-and-samsungs-android-15-updates-are-delayed">longer-than-anticipated "delay"</a> and this feature drop&apos;s arrival only adds to the confusion. The good news is the company released its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/final-android-15-beta-4-2-rollout">final Android 15 beta</a> earlier in August, leaving many to speculate that September will hold our stable release.</p>

<ul><li>A new leak reveals interesting specs of OPPO Find X8 and X8 Pro models.</li><li>Both models will purportedly sport large displays, one with a flat screen and the other featuring a micro-curved screen.</li><li>The OPPO Find X8 Pro model will have a large 5700mAh battery with 100W fast charge support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After the successful launch of the Find X7 Ultra and other Find X7 models early this year, OPPO is probably gearing up for the successor, the Find X8 series. A new leak now reveals what the company has to offer with the Find X8 and Find X8 Pro models.</p><p>The leak comes from prominent tipster Yogesh Brar, who collaborated with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-oppo-find-x8-and-x8-pro-key-specs-and-global-launch-timeline-revealed/" target="_blank">Smartprix.</a> The publication has released significant specs of the aforementioned models along with a tentative launch timeframe.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We could see Oppo Find X8 launch in Global markets by OctoberFind X8 Ultra launch early next year<a href="https://twitter.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1826287024355299676">August 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>According to the tipster, the OPPO Find X8 and the Find X8 Pro will sport 6.7-inch and 6.8-inch displays, respectively. Both feature a 120Hz refresh rate and 1.5K resolution. However, the vanilla model comes with a flat screen, whereas the Pro model will have a micro-curved screen. </p><p>Other similarities between devices include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9400-cores-rumor">Dimensity 9400</a> SoC, a step up from the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-benchmarks-vs-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Dimensity 9300</a> chip seen on OPPO Find X7. The camera setup will likely be similar as well, including a 50MP primary sensor next to a 50MP ultrawide angle lens and a 3x telephoto lens. The Pro model will have another 10x periscopic telephoto lens.</p>

<p>The battery capacities on both OPPO phones seem similar, too: 5600mAh for the Find X8 and 5700mAh for the Pro variant. Regardless, these two phones support 100W super-fast charging speeds.</p><p>The tipster further notes that both devices will sport a glass body and come in White, Black, and Blue colorways. However, the vanilla model will also be Pink, which appears to be the ongoing trend, as the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> phones also come in several shades of Pink for the first time.</p><p>While OPPO launched the predecessor Find X7 series for the Chinese region early this year, the company is likely gearing up for the Chinese launch soon, per the tipster. The Find X8 is rumored to have an October global launch, while the launch of the Pro model is yet to be determined. Also, according to the tipster, there is no word on the Ultra model yet, except for the tentative launch of early next year.</p>

Galaxy Watch 5 Pro owners might have hoped for more battery life, while Watch 6 Classic users probably dislike the design choices Samsung&apos;s engineers made. Apple fans will scoff at the similarities to their Ultra watch, while Pixel Watch fans may be jealous of the premium features.</p><p>If you ignore the fact that Samsung cribbed upgrades like the third Quick Button, siren, and 3,000-nit display from Apple and look at this device in a vacuum, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is a fantastic smartwatch that has grown on me after six weeks of testing. I&apos;ve become accustomed to its weight, its design makes my other smartwatches look cheap, and its fitness performance surpassed my expectations.</p><p>Most importantly, Samsung patched a serious issue with the Galaxy Watch Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> a few weeks after launch. During my initial review, the battery drained so quickly that I found it hard to recommend paying so much for so little upside. Now, it more than lives up to Samsung&apos;s battery estimates, and that made me bump my review score up a half-star.</p><p>So even though many people saw pictures of the Ultra and wrote it off as ugly or a weird Apple clone, I&apos;d advise you to take it seriously—if you can afford it. </p><p>I can&apos;t wave away the simple fact that this watch costs more than the Pro and Classic that preceded it, and even if the Galaxy Watch Ultra is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> today, not everyone needs to spend so much money on a watch. So let&apos;s dive in and help you decide if you&apos;re ready to splurge on the Ultra!</p>

<p>Samsung released the Galaxy Watch Ultra on July 24, 2024, for $649 / £599 / €699 / CA$879 / A$1,299 / ₹59,999. By contrast, the 44mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> with the same display size costs $329, or about half the price. </p><p>Available in White, Silver, and Black, the Galaxy Watch Ultra has three band options: Marine, Trail, and Peakform. Each costs $79 as a standalone option if you choose to buy a second option. The nylon Trail band is the lightest for the best comfort but will absorb sweat. The elastomer Marine band repels water for swimming and water sports but feels the heaviest. The rubber Peakform band is a sporty middle ground option.</p><p>As of late August, Samsung offers a significant trade-in discount for the Galaxy Watch Ultra on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch-ultra/buy/galaxy-watch-ultra-47mm-titanium-gray-sm-l705udaaxaa/">Samsung.com</a>. While they vary by country, in the U.S., you can get up to $350 off with a Galaxy Watch 6 Classic or Watch 5 Pro. I&apos;ll include some of the trade-in values below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>$350: </strong>Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, GW 5 Pro, Apple Watch Ultra / Ultra 2</li><li><strong>$300: </strong>GW 4 Classic, AW Series 9 / 8</li><li><strong>$250: </strong>AW Series 7 / 6, Garmin Forerunner 965 / 955 Solar</li><li><strong>$200: </strong>GW 6 / 5, AW Series 5</li><li><strong>$175: </strong>Garmin Venu 3, Forerunner 265</li><li><strong>$150: </strong>GW 4 / 3, AW SE (2), Garmin Instinct 2 / Crossover, Forerunner 255</li><li><strong>$100:</strong> Any smartwatch in good condition</li></ul>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Djij3smV8fwqE4g7U7CEJW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-buttons.jpeg" alt="A side view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra sitting on a table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Djij3smV8fwqE4g7U7CEJW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li><strong>Despite being heavier and thicker than most watches, you get used to the Ultra's weight.</strong></li><li><strong>The Marine band is comfortable and balances the Ultra's weight and look well, while the Trail is better suited for workouts.</strong></li><li><strong>The Quick Buttons is very useful but should have been a crown.</strong></li><li><strong>While durable, the Ultra has had a few quality control issues since launch.</strong></li></ul>
<p>Samsung designed a watch that looks better in person than in photos. All you can see from afar is a chunky square; in person, the shiny, metallic contours and buttons, rounded edges, and raised bezel look attractive and distinct from any other smartwatch I&apos;ve worn.</p><p>Without a band, the Galaxy Watch Ultra weighs 60.5g / 2.13oz, comparable to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a> 47mm (59g) but heavier than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Watch 5 Pro</a> (46.5g). Unlike the Classic, most of that extra weight is for squircle aesthetics, not the function of a rotating bezel. Switching to this will be a real transition if you&apos;re used to the 1.5-inch Watch 6 (33.3g), though not compared to other "flagship" watches.</p><p>Still, this thing is chunky. Samsung claims it&apos;s 12.1mm thick, not including the massive health sensor lump; I measure it as closer to 16mm thick. </p><p>Despite its thickness and weight, I&apos;ve grown accustomed to the size and don&apos;t find it as uncomfortable as I first did. Also, even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">I hate wearing a smartwatch to bed</a>, I&apos;m pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn&apos;t <em>terrible</em> to wear for sleep tracking across several nights of testing. My Marine band keeps it feeling loose and breathable. </p>

<p>I enlisted my smaller-wristed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch Series 9</a>-wearing fiancee for her opinion, having her wear the Galaxy Watch Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> on either wrist. She said she&apos;d happily wear either but that she preferred the Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s design and the fit of the Marine band over Apple&apos;s Trail band, which she said made it look and feel "top-heavy."</p><p>Though I find the Marine band quite thick and would&apos;ve preferred the thinner nylon option, it <em>proportionally</em> matches the Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s bulk, so the weight distributes more naturally, and it appears less oversized. I don&apos;t mind an imbalanced, blocky look for a softer, more breathable band, so I&apos;d have chosen Trail or Peakform myself.</p><p>I&apos;ve since supplemented Samsung&apos;s main band with third-party <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-bands">Galaxy Watch Ultra bands</a> that cost significantly less. Samsung&apos;s Dynamic Lug system is proprietary and doesn&apos;t work with your old Galaxy Watch bands, but at least it&apos;s incredibly easy to use. Tap two buttons along the Ultra&apos;s bottom to pop out both straps, then slide and click the new bands in. Once you know what you&apos;re doing, it takes less than a minute.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="j3sbcMwSzXdxXWBGby3EjU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-display.jpeg" alt="A close-up view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and its default watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j3sbcMwSzXdxXWBGby3EjU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What makes the Galaxy Watch Ultra "niche" is its rugged design, which is tailored for extreme conditions. All Samsung watches have the MIL-STD-810H label slapped on, meaning they should survive if dropped on the floor. Samsung specifically tested the durable Ultra for "high/ low temperatures, altitude, humidity, immersion, salt, fog, dust, vibration, and drops."</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra can survive elevations up to 29,527 feet, or slightly higher than Mount Everest. Of course, it&apos;s only rated for temperatures of -4°F to 131°F (-20ºC to 55ºC) before functions fail, and most mountain peaks get much colder than that. Ultra users will probably wear it in more casual workout conditions.</p><p>Samsung promises that the Galaxy Watch Ultra has 10ATM water resistance (double most watches&apos; max depth) and was tested in salty or chlorinated water. Thus, you can safely swim anywhere or use it for high-speed water sports, as long as you gently rinse and dry it off afterward. </p><p>Unfortunately, since launch, we&apos;ve seen a couple of Ultra buyers complaining about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1eap2rj/galaxy_watch_ultra_misalignment/?rdt=60372">misaligned displays</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/BrandonButch/status/1826696437062926587">Quick Button falling off</a>, with Samsung customer support reportedly refusing to step in in one case. It reminds me of the issues with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-volume-rocker-falling-off">Pixel series&apos; volume rocker falling off</a>, and it&apos;s my one vague concern with the Ultra&apos;s design — that it may run into durability issues and that Samsung&apos;s QC won&apos;t be as responsive as you&apos;d expect for such an expensive device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KzmyLJeos9ShaWka8erhqF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-orange-buttons-01.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Galaxy Watch Ultra Quick Button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KzmyLJeos9ShaWka8erhqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-quick-button">Quick Button</a>, nested between the usual two Home and Back buttons, opens up your Samsung Health exercises by default, though you can reconfigure it to trigger your flashlight, stopwatch, or water lock mode. Hold it down, and you&apos;ll trigger an 85db siren to help people find you in emergencies. It&apos;s uncomfortably loud in practice, which is the point in emergencies!</p><p>During a workout, you tap the Quick Button to pause the activity instantly instead of having to swipe left and tap a button with sweaty fingers. It&apos;s extremely convenient, the main thing I&apos;d miss as a runner if I downgraded to the Galaxy Watch 7.</p><p>My main complaint is that Samsung made the Quick Button crown-shaped but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-copies-apple-watch-ultra-except-for-most-important-feature">didn&apos;t add any crown functionality</a>. Without the Watch 6 Classic&apos;s physical bezel, you&apos;re fully reliant on swipes or rotating your finger along the display edge to scroll, and I much prefer a physical dial since that leaves my view of the display uninterrupted. Without a crown or bezel, the Ultra experience is missing something.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hardware-and-display"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: Hardware and display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HmcTNNQwbAcxQDmWvLuspb" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-apps.jpeg" alt="The app drawer on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmcTNNQwbAcxQDmWvLuspb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li><strong>The Galaxy Watch Ultra has a new Exynos W1000 CPU with a faster clock speed and more cores than the Watch 6's Exynos W930.</strong></li><li><strong>It has the same RAM as last gen but double the storage.</strong></li><li><strong>The display is the same size (but brighter) than the Watch 7's.</strong></li></ul>
<p>Samsung gave the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch 7 44mm the same 1.5-inch, 480 x 480 display with about 320 pixels per inch, except that the Ultra hits 3,000 nits of brightness instead of 2,000. That extra brightness looks fantastic in direct California sunlight, richly colorful and unimpeded by reflections. </p><p>It has Sapphire glass to protect against scratches and an elevated bezel that makes the display less likely to scrape against something than the fully flat Watch 7. </p><p>You might wish Samsung had made the Ultra display even larger to justify the higher price, but it&apos;s already heavy enough. Maybe Samsung will transition the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra 2</a> to a squircle, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">as has been rumored</a>, to differentiate the Ultra from mainline Galaxy Watches. For now, Samsung has made the right call by keeping things familiar to long-time Android watch fans.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch 7</a> have nearly identical hardware. The four main Watch 6-to-7 upgrades — the Exynos W1000 CPU, doubled storage, dual-band GPS, and 3x the LEDs for better heart rate data — are found on both watches. I&apos;m glad Samsung didn&apos;t keep these new perks exclusive to try and upsell us, but that does mean the Ultra doesn&apos;t have that many exclusives besides extra battery life and built-in LTE cellular through your carrier.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t make these upgrades any less valuable. I&apos;ll talk in a later section about the excellent GPS and HR performance, and the doubled storage is vital for anyone who wants to stream music, podcasts, or audiobooks while using the Watch Ultra as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-used-to-want-lte-smartwatch-but-not-anymore">standalone smartwatch</a>.</p><p>As for the Exynos W1000 upgrade, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/processor/wearable-processor/exynos-w1000/">Samsung&apos;s marketing claims</a> that it&apos;s "2.7x quicker" than the last-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-details-exynos-w930">Exynos W930</a>. That had just two Cortex-A55 cores clocked at 1.4GHz, while the newer CPU has four Cortex-A55s clocked slightly higher (1.5GHz) and one Cortex-A78 (1.6GHz).</p><p>In real-life use, it&apos;s undoubtedly faster than my Watch 6 and (especially) Watch 5 Pro, loading apps and processing Google Assistant queries in a flash. I <em>wouldn&apos;t</em> say the Galaxy Watch Ultra is 2.7x faster, as the Watch 6 was already quite fast. But you see far less lag, and the extra cores will handle demanding tasks for future Wear OS feature updates. I have no complaints.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="owMQiSATR6SGdaGPE2em73" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-siren.jpg" alt="Triggering the siren by holding the action button on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/owMQiSATR6SGdaGPE2em73.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Otherwise, if you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Galaxy Watch 6 vs. 7</a> and Ultra for hardware, Samsung didn&apos;t change anything significant with its connectivity standards or sensor array, aside from the siren and "free" LTE.</p><p>I&apos;ll admit that I didn&apos;t test the Ultra&apos;s LTE features. I don&apos;t care much about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-used-to-want-lte-smartwatch-but-not-anymore">standalone LTE features</a>, and I suspect plenty of Ultra buyers will let the LTE functions go unused because the setup is a hassle and the carrier add-on cost is surprisingly expensive. Google recently launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> and offered two free years of data for anyone who upgrades to an LTE model; I really wish Samsung had done the same with the Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Samsung promises 60 hours of battery life with the always-on display active or 100 hours in power saver mode.</strong></li><li><strong>While the Ultra had a battery drain issue at first, Samsung fixed it with a post-launch update.</strong></li><li><strong>It takes about two hours to recharge.</strong></li></ul>
<p>During my initial Galaxy Watch Ultra review, I warned would-be Ultra buyers that it didn&apos;t live up to Samsung&apos;s battery promises. It only tended to last about 40 hours with AOD, so I knew I&apos;d have to charge it before a second night of sleep tracking. The battery drain was painfully noticeable.</p><p>Thankfully, Samsung patched whatever caused this rapid draining, and the Ultra has more than lived up to its on-paper promises since then. At the moment, it&apos;s been 60 hours since I last charged it, and the battery is at 21% despite two nights of sleep tracking and two hours of dual-band GPS tracking. It could probably make it a third night, but I&apos;m charging it to be safe.</p><p>Without AOD, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is among the longest-lasting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>, competing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch 5 Pro Enduro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> — though both watches cost half as much.</p><p>As for fitness tests, I found the Galaxy Watch Ultra used about 15% battery across two hours of GPS-tracked workout time, before and after the patch. That would put it on pace for 13 hours of tracking, which is slightly below estimate but more than enough for an all-day workout with enough juice left for sleep tracking.</p>

<p>Samsung gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-watch-5-pro">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and Watch Ultra</a> the same 590mAh capacity, and it&apos;s fair to wish that Samsung had found more room for a little <em>extra</em> capacity this time, given the Ultra&apos;s weight gain. The Watch 5 Pro had equal longevity two years ago but naturally lost some of its endurance since then; that means the Ultra will provide a boost, but also that it may not last as long as we&apos;d hope.</p><p>As for charging speed, it&apos;ll depend on your charging adapter. I&apos;ve seen conflicting reports on whether this series uses 10W or 15W, but practically speaking, it usually takes me about two hours to refill the Ultra from low battery to 100%. That&apos;s not as fast as you might like, but slower charging usually corresponds with better battery health over time.</p><p>Samsung had to redesign the charging puck a bit because of changes to the health sensor, which means the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Watch 7 no longer support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-wireless-power-share-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Wireless PowerSharing</a> from your Samsung phone. I never took advantage of this feature myself, but our Watch 7 reviewer called this a "small bummer" for "forgetful folks" who liked topping off their watch away from home.</p>

<ul><li><strong>The Galaxy Watch Ultra's dual-band GPS regularly matches up with Garmin's dual-band tracking.</strong></li><li><strong>Its new revamped HR sensor has extra LEDs and does very well for standard workout tracking, though it can struggle with high heart rates.</strong></li></ul>
<p>Samsung tripled the number of LEDs in the Galaxy Watch Ultra compared to the Watch 6, which it promised would improve accuracy during intense workout activities from 88% to 94%. It also added dual-band GPS, which lets the watch pull your location data from multiple satellite positions to work around any obstructions like buildings or foliage.</p><p>Does it make a difference? Health and fitness data was my biggest knock against the Watch 6 when I reviewed it last year. This year, I performed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">rapid-fire fitness test</a> and found that the Galaxy Watch Ultra closely matched up against a Garmin watch for GPS accuracy and a dedicated heart rate strap for HR data. It only struggled in one instance: when running an anaerobic track workout at a near-max heart rate.</p><p>Since then, I performed a longer test, running with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> and Galaxy Watch Ultra on each wrist, both in dual-band mode. In the end, they both had a matching 160 bpm HR average and were only 0.01 miles apart in tracked distance after 9.5 miles. They also deviated by only 1 step per minute for tracked cadence, and their total tracked steps were only 309 apart after over 17,000 steps total.</p>

<p>Looking more closely at how they compare, the Galaxy Watch Ultra did start to struggle a bit in the later miles, randomly dipping in moments when I was stepping up my pace, then overcompensating and rising to higher heart rates. It averaged out, but "serious" athletes may want to rely on a dedicated strap for the best results.</p><p>In terms of GPS accuracy, Garmin did win the battle; the Galaxy Watch Ultra had mile-long stretches where it showed me off my running path, while Garmin stayed perfect. Practically, though, it didn&apos;t matter: the Ultra and Forerunner stayed parallel without the weaving or signal loss the GPS-only Watch 6 had.</p>

<p>Since my initial review, I performed one more accuracy test for redundancy, pitting the Galaxy Watch Ultra against the Garmin Forerunner 965&apos;s GPS and my heart rate strap.</p><p>For distance, both watches showed 6.21 miles and a 162 bpm average exactly during my first run. Samsung and Garmin&apos;s GPS lines frequently overlapped one another throughout, and the heart rate data closely mirrored the more accurate OHR armband (though still imperfect at times).</p><p>For my track workout, I mistakenly started my Samsung workout 30 seconds earlier than Garmin&apos;s, which skewed my heart rate average. Taking that into account, the Ultra was mostly on point for that hard mile, but it did have one 30-second span where it struggled to register my 180+ bpm range before catching up.</p><p>Overall, the Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s fitness hardware is much stronger than in previous generations, with its dual-band GPS as a strong point and anaerobic workouts as the only area that needs improvement. </p><p>The next step is to improve Samsung Health&apos;s rather basic fitness software. Now that both Apple and Google have introduced training load to their respective health apps, it leaves Samsung as the odd company out; its Energy Score is much more focused on the day-to-day, not offering a week-to-week perspective. For now, I&apos;m relying on third-party apps like Strava for those kind of insights.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7mrkoZzGaUGqnUb5w9JFzQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-ecg.jpeg" alt="An ECG reading on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7mrkoZzGaUGqnUb5w9JFzQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li><strong>The new sensor array uses extra LEDs to supposedly offer more accurate readings.</strong></li><li><strong>While the Galaxy Watch Ultra did well for sleep data and HR accuracy in my tests, the SpO2 and BIA sensors were less reliable.</strong></li><li><strong>The newest AGEs Index appears to be all-but-useless.</strong></li></ul>
<p>Most of your Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra health data comes in a few forms: passive HR and stress data during the day, active ECG readings, and sleep tracking at night with data like blood oxygen (SpO2), skin temperature, respiratory rate, and sleep stages.</p><p>I procrastinated on sleep tracking tests before my initial Galaxy Watch Ultra review — I assumed it would be uncomfortable and mess with my sleep — but I finally sucked it up since most of the Ultra&apos;s new tricks, like Energy Score and AGEs Index, rely on overnight data. Turns out it&apos;s not actually that uncomfortable to wear.</p><p>First, the good news: Samsung provides in-depth, accurate sleep data like physical recovery, restfulness, mental recovery, and sleep cycles. The Ultra gave very similar data to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> across the board, except that Samsung calculated a higher heart rate variability (HRV). </p><p>While sleep tracking is always a bit relative and uncertain, my Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s daily Energy Score, Stress levels, and resting heart rate all seem to match my real-life energy and typical data on other watches. I had one instance where my resting heart rate while working was unusually high but dropped to proper levels after I cleaned the bottom sensor array; I recommend keeping yours clean for the best results.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XWVvWpMPPt68pErqp8iQ35" name="samsung-health-sleep-data-galaxy-watch-ultra.jpg" alt="Screenshots of the Samsung Health app showing a total sleep summary for the reviewer's recovery, heart rate, respiration, blood oxygen, and other metrics." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XWVvWpMPPt68pErqp8iQ35.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the flip side, I&apos;m very disappointed with Samsung&apos;s vague sensor array upgrades. Both the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra have new LED colors — Blue, Yellow, Violet and Ultraviolet — which track new health markers, starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">advanced glycation end products (AGEs) index</a> tracking. Samsung claims AGEs is just "one of the many new advanced features planned for the next Galaxy Watch."</p><p>But if AGEs Index is a sign of what the new Galaxy Watch Ultra LEDs can do, I&apos;m not impressed thus far. At first, I was worried that it showed me a mid-high score, suggesting my bloodstream has excess compounds from a poor sugary diet that signal premature aging and potential health issues. Then I saw that every other Ultra reviewer and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1eirxbz/ages_index/?rdt=43277">whole Reddit thread</a> all show screenshots with the same score, regardless of each person&apos;s health and lifestyle.</p><p>It&apos;s still a Samsung Labs feature, so I&apos;ll accept that it could improve over time. But Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-temperature-sensor-cycle-tracking-rollout">waited almost a year to enable skin temperature readings</a> on the Galaxy Watch 5. I don&apos;t get why it&apos;s making this feature available and stressing people out with fears of diabetes or other issues, when it&apos;s not able to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy people.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jHjVWRCD2m8oBhcNU4jgeP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-blood-oxygen-reading.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, while measuring for blood oxygen levels." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jHjVWRCD2m8oBhcNU4jgeP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just like when I reviewed the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and Watch 6, I find that the Galaxy Watch Ultra will sometimes show a low blood oxygen range when I wake up in the morning, like "84%–99%." Other times, it shows a more reasonable range like "91–100%," but it&apos;s never clear from this range how <em>much</em> time was spent at high or low percentages and whether I have anything to worry about.</p><p>Given that no other watches give me readings this low while sleep tracking, I&apos;m leaning towards simply turning this feature off and saving the battery life. At least the temperature sensor seems to be more accurate than it was on previous models.</p><p>As a final minor point, I continue to be unimpressed by Samsung&apos;s BIA sensor. Last year, the Galaxy Watch 6 measured my body fat percentage, which was about 4% higher than my Withings scale (28 vs. 24%). This year, it has me at 24.7% instead of my current reading of 19.8%, with about 10 extra pounds of fat. I suspect the Ultra&apos;s little microcurrents can&apos;t reach down to my legs, so the algorithm just extrapolates based on my height and weight.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 44mm has most of the same perks as the Galaxy Watch Ultra, aside from its extra durability, battery life, and brightness. You can also buy it with LTE support if that matters. You miss out on the extra battery life, which is a fairly major drawback, and its design is much more basic. In exchange, it weighs (and costs) about half as much and measures 2.5mm thinner.</p><p>Looking outside of Samsung watches, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> are two Android watches with consistent three or four-day battery life, and both cost significantly less than the Galaxy Watch Ultra. They both have their drawbacks, however. The TicWatch has yet to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>, meaning it still has no Google Assistant, and the OnePlus watch has documented issues with heart rate accuracy. </p><p>Then you have the new Pixel Watch 3 45mm. It&apos;s quite different from the Ultra, with a much shorter battery life and significantly lighter design, but it also has a fitness focus with a Daily Readiness score and a Cardio Load score that&apos;ll appeal to runners. Unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t have dual-band GPS, but it does have Google&apos;s patented heart rate accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Galaxy Watch Ultra if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Better battery life is your first priority</li><li>You're using an older smartwatch and want a new one that'll last years</li><li>You prefer the Galaxy Watch Ultra style over the Watch 7 (or Watch 6 Classic)</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Galaxy Watch Ultra if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're attached to the "Classic" look and bezel controls</li><li>You prefer a lighter smartwatch experience</li><li>You can't afford the Ultra for what it offers</li></ul>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is a great smartwatch that&apos;s enjoyable to use, adding the hardware changes necessary to make it feel powerful and reliable. Even if serious athletes would probably prefer something like a Garmin Fenix or another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> brand, the Ultra falls in between casual and serious users in an intriguing way.</p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Watch Ultra isn&apos;t all that different from the Watch 7. Its design is a bit polarizing without a physical bezel or crown; both watches have the same fitness updates and MIL-STD-810H standard, and the Watch 7 is more comfortably light. It&apos;s fair to say that you&apos;re paying for the Ultra&apos;s looks, extra button, brighter display, and the convenience of charging it every few days.</p><p>If you can get your hands on one for a reasonable trade-in deal, I&apos;d certainly recommend upgrading to the Galaxy Watch Ultra if it looks and sounds appealing. Otherwise, at full price, it might be a tall ask. And given Samsung&apos;s path from Pro to Classic to Ultra in the last three years, you might decide to hold out for whatever new smartwatch experiment comes next, Ultra or otherwise!</p>

                            <![CDATA[ After almost two months with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, we're very impressed by its quality across the board. Now that Samsung has fixed its battery drain issue, it's easier to recommend, too. Just make sure to find a good trade-in deal, given how expensive the Ultra is compared to the Galaxy Watch 7. ]]>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>As Android Central&apos;s resident flip phone guy, I was initially quite excited about the prospect of two flip phones launching so close together. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 was unveiled just weeks after the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 launched, so it was hard not to make comparisons between the two. Unfortunately, that didn&apos;t exactly play out in favor of the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>Compared to the Razr Plus 2024, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is very much an iterative update over its predecessor. That doesn&apos;t mean there aren&apos;t upgrades to be found, and some of them are the kind of upgrades we hoped to see on last year&apos;s model. And, of course, there&apos;s plenty of new software to play around with, as Galaxy AI is pretty much running the show.</p><p>So, is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> worth buying with the $100 price increase? I&apos;ve spent roughly a month testing the phone and comparing it with other flip phones. Comparatively, this is probably the most powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> you can buy right now. However, the experience still misses some key elements, and I wish Samsung would stop being so stubborn and change them already.</p><p>And knowing there are cheaper options makes it a little difficult to fully recommend. However, that doesn&apos;t make the Galaxy Z Flip 6 a bad buy by any means, so long as you&apos;re willing to fiddle around with it a bit.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-boast-ai-upgrades-and-thinner-bodies">launched</a> the Galaxy Z Flip 6 on July 10 during the Galaxy Unpacked July 2024 event. The phone went on sale on July 24 and retails for $1099.</p><p>You can choose either 256GB or 512GB of storage, although the latter option will cost $1219. Fortunately, Samsung&apos;s preorder deal is still live, meaning you can get a free upgrade to the higher storage option, which will cost the same as the 256GB version. It&apos;s unclear how long this and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-preorder-deals">Galaxy Z Flip 6 deals</a> are going to last, so you should jump on it while you can.</p><p>There are several available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-should-you-buy">Galaxy Z Flip 6 colors</a> to choose from, including Yellow, Mint, Silver Shadow, and Blue. If you order from Samsung.com, you can purchase exclusive colors such as Crafted Black, White, and Peach.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-design"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="V8AvqfT8JFyXTGDiy8s4s3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-03.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 folded on a blue table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V8AvqfT8JFyXTGDiy8s4s3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4092" height="2302" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li><strong>Overall design is nearly identical to predecessor.</strong></li><li><strong>Sharp corners can make the phone painful to hold.</strong></li><li><strong>Matte glass looks and feels better than previous models.</strong></li><li><strong>Official dust rating makes it more durable.</strong></li></ul>
<p>As far as design goes, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 made few changes from the Galaxy Z Flip 5. It now has a completely flat Aluminum Armor frame with a matte finish instead of a glossy one, a change reminiscent of the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is also a hair thinner when folded; otherwise, it&apos;s the same size and weight as its predecessor. It&apos;s a bit impressive, given some of the spec bumps the phone has received, which I&apos;ll talk about later. And speaking of fold, the hinge is very stiff and sturdy, just like the rest of the phone.</p><p>One big upgrade we see this year is the inclusion of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-waterproof">official dust resistance rating</a>, bringing the phone to IP48. This ensures it&apos;s protected against particles larger than 1mm in size, so it&apos;s not foolproof, but it&apos;s a major improvement nonetheless.</p><p>Even with the impressive durability, I recommend adding a case. Fortunately, we have a collection of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cases">Galaxy Z Flip 6 cases</a> for you to check out. I personally like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7C9BLD4">this one from Thinborne</a>.</p>

<p>One interesting design choice Samsung made is the bumper around the display. On the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, there was a seamless transition from the bumper to the frame, which had a slight inward curve to it. Now that the phone is completely flat on the sides, the bumper stops short of connecting to the frame and creates a small divot when the phone is closed, which should make it easier to open the phone with one hand. This does mean that there&apos;s a small opening toward the hinge where the bumper doesn&apos;t quite reach, but it&apos;s nothing quite like the older Z Flip models that wouldn&apos;t completely close shut.</p><p>Just like the frame, the back glass also has a soft matte finish, which I like much more than the glossy one on the Z Flip 5. That means you won&apos;t have to worry about fingerprints as much, except for on the main cover panel.</p><p>Speaking of, the two cameras on the front now have a colored ring around the sensors to match the color of the phone, which is a small but nice touch. Unfortunately, with this type of camera protrusion, you will have to worry about dust accumulating around them.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Xk33zq3Ca5579tvjuvpsre" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-16.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 display outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xk33zq3Ca5579tvjuvpsre.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li><strong>The main display is very bright, even outdoors.</strong></li><li><strong>The display crease has been significantly minimized.</strong></li><li><strong>The cover screen specs are mostly the same, with a relatively low resolution and refresh rate.</strong></li><li><strong>The PWM rate is still lower than that of the competition.</strong></li></ul>
<p>The internal 6.7-inch OLED display retains the 2640 x 1080 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, although the brightness has been jacked up to 2600 nits. The result is a display that is quite bright and vibrant, even with the screen mode set to Natural (my usual preference). I often find that the built-in screen protector can hinder the view a bit on foldables, but that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case with the Galaxy Z Flip 6. It&apos;s also very visible outdoors, which is a huge plus.</p><p>Another win is the crease, which Samsung has drastically minimized thanks to "enhanced layers" on the main screen. Now, when I run my finger across the display, the crease is hardly noticeable, although not completely nonexistent. There&apos;s still much more crease than you&apos;ll find on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, for instance, but it doesn&apos;t bother me nearly as much when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-galaxy-z-flip-5">compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>.</p>

<p>The cover screen doesn&apos;t have the highest specs on the block, falling behind its closest competitors with a 720 x 748 resolution (306ppi) and 60Hz refresh rate at 1600 nits of peak brightness. For a flagship flip phone, that&apos;s quite low, even when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-motorola-razr-2024">compared to the mid-range Motorola Razr 2024</a>, which has a higher 1056 x 1066 resolution (413ppi) and a 90Hz refresh rate with a 1700 nit peak brightness.</p><p>The lower resolution can be a little jarring, especially when compared to the main FHD+ panel.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Samsung continues to ship phones with low PWM frequencies. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 has a PWM frequency of 240Hz, which is quite low and bound to negatively affect those who suffer from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>. I won&apos;t have a problem with it myself, but I know others who do, and it&apos;s unclear why Samsung continues to ship phones with displays like this even though many other manufacturers either provide higher PWM frequencies or include flicker reduction techniques (like Motorola).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2166px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:84.86%;"><img id="2AGLX3wPQMZAjsEqEWiUnk" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-pwm-measurements.jpg" alt="PWM measurements of the Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2AGLX3wPQMZAjsEqEWiUnk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2166" height="1838" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see, both displays also have very high levels of modulation depth, which is the perceived difference between a display&apos;s on state and its off state. Screens with high modulation depth feel more like a strobe light to your brain. They are perceived as being clearly off (and therefore completely dark) before turning back on again, typically at full brightness. Users who are sensitive to flickering lights will have the most problems with these types of displays since the difference is so drastic.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> for Galaxy brings a welcome performance bump (although the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 was plenty powerful) along with 12GB of RAM, up from 8GB. It appears the main difference between this version and the normal Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is a slight bump in CPU clock speed, which is usually the case for these "Samsung-exclusive" chips. How much it helps is unclear, but the chip is plenty powerful regardless.</p><p>This phone breezes through everything you throw at it. I&apos;ve played a few games like Honkai: Star Rail and Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, and the gameplay is incredibly smooth, even at the highest settings. It probably won&apos;t blow any of the best gaming phones out of the park, but you shouldn&apos;t be disappointed in the performance by any means.</p>

<p>And while the phone occasionally gets warm, I haven&apos;t noticed it get uncomfortably hot, which tends to happen to the top half of flip phones such as this.</p>

<p>Unlike some more standard flagships like the base Galaxy S24 or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 comes with 256GB of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care">UFS 4.0</a> storage to start with. You can also choose the 512GB option, although there is still no 1TB option, nor will you find expandable storage. Still, for most people, these two storage options should be enough (I myself am fine with just 256GB), but if you want more, you&apos;d have to opt for another phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, which has a 1TB option.</p><p>Of course, you won&apos;t find a 3.5mm headphone jack, but you will find a decent set of stereo speakers with plenty of depth and clarity when listening to music. There&apos;s also a dialogue booster that does exactly as it states and works surprisingly well.</p><p>I also really like the haptics on the Z Flip 6, and doing things like typing, swiping back, or opening the sidebar gives a very nice and subtle vibration.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-battery-life-charging"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6: Battery life & charging</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="CKLZzpWPboeS8xmGaHgZC9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-28.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 on a wireless charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CKLZzpWPboeS8xmGaHgZC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3916" height="2203" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li><strong>Battery lasts all day on a single charge.</strong></li><li><strong>Wired charging still falls behind at just 25W and is quite slow.</strong></li></ul>
<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 manages to impress me with its battery life. This is thanks to the fact that it has a larger 4,000mAh battery, which does well when combined with the more efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. On regular use, I find that I get between six and eight hours of battery life with a single charge. After unplugging at 8 a.m., the phone will be on its last leg by 8 p.m., and considering how often I&apos;m on my phone, I consider this a win. Of course, battery life will depend on how you&apos;re using it, and I imagine some Galaxy Z Flip 6 owners may be able to get through little more than a day, although you&apos;ll probably want to charge before bed or when you wake up, depending on your habits.</p><p>The only downside is that despite the bump in battery capacity, the charging speed remains at 25W, while other flip phones have surpassed that speed. As a result, it will take well over an hour to get from empty to 100%. Even after charging to 60%, the phone would tell me I had roughly 50 minutes to fill up the battery. Wireless charging is no better at just 15W, so unless you have time to spare, you&apos;ll want to stick to wired charging.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6: Cover screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zPTURLLLkEpCBZYJS7LCUS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-22.jpg" alt="Weather widget on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zPTURLLLkEpCBZYJS7LCUS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li><strong>Software upgrades on the cover screen are minimal.</strong></li><li><strong>You can now fit multiple widgets on a single panel.</strong></li><li><strong>Apps only accessible via Labs or Good Lock extension.</strong></li><li><strong>Cover screen adds dual-screen Interpreter mode and Smart Replies.</strong></li></ul>
<p>As expected, my experience with the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen has been mixed. Samsung continues to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-initial-impressions">hinder the cover screen experience</a> in the same ways that it did with the Galaxy Z Flip 5, so I won&apos;t really rehash that too much. The focus is on panels, or "widgets," and less on using full apps, and the experience as intended works, for the most part.</p><p>Widgets like Weather are well-designed and mostly do what&apos;s expected of them, providing glanceable information, so you&apos;re <em>hopefully</em> opening your phone less for certain things. Unfortunately, you can&apos;t really interact with them much aside from scrolling through details or selecting different days to view.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-27.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen widgets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4134" height="2325" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, Samsung now lets you fit multiple widgets onto a single panel. This is somewhat limited, too, as you&apos;ll have to select from preset dimensions. Some options will take up a full panel, while others will fit into 2x2 or 2x4 spaces, but it depends on the app, and you can&apos;t resize them like you can on the Razr Plus 2024 cover screen.</p><p>Otherwise, the cover screen experience isn&apos;t much different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. Everything is largely handled on the main display, and many actions will prompt you to open the phone. You actually have very little way of managing the cover screen from the actual cover screen, a weird limitation that I find highlights the disconnect Samsung has with how it handles the external display. The most you can do from the display is change your wallpaper and add/remove widgets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9vaER3KiFVQ4ztkTpo7gag" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Gemini-cover-screen.jpg" alt="Gemini on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9vaER3KiFVQ4ztkTpo7gag.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are some fun new interactive wallpapers, and you can add AI wallpapers to the cover screen. As always, you&apos;ll have to dig into Labs or the Good Lock app if you want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">set up and use full apps on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a>, but once set up, the experience is decent. Just know that you&apos;re going to spend some extra time setting up your Galaxy Z Flip 6 since you have two displays to configure and yet another app to download.</p><p>Given the relatively small cover screen display size (compared to the Razr series), apps feel even more condensed, which can make navigating UIs a little awkward. There&apos;s still no multitasking, so exiting an app does just that without letting you switch to another you have open.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jR2Gcb2Wo8XSNoioVVm5pD" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Good-Lock.jpg" alt="Good Lock on the Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jR2Gcb2Wo8XSNoioVVm5pD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung does take advantage of the cover screen in other ways that are useful. The Interpreter app has been updated to include translations on the cover screen, giving both people a potentially more comfortable view when speaking. I find that this works quite well, even if it takes some getting used to at first. In my limited experience, you&apos;re able to have a somewhat natural conversation and the phone keeps up relatively well.</p><p>The cover screen also has AOD, which is always handy, especially on a smaller display. I just wish the quick settings menu was a little more robust, as you only get eight options and a brightness slider, and you can&apos;t seem to edit the buttons. I also don&apos;t really find the Galaxy AI Smart Replies very useful, which is only compounded by the fact that you can&apos;t even use them and have apps enabled on the cover screen at the same time.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Camera improvements fairly minimal over predecessor.</strong></li><li><strong>Phone seems marginally better at capturing movement.</strong></li><li><strong>Selfies don't handle darker skin tones well.</strong></li><li><strong>Useful features when folding the phone at a 90-degree angle.</strong></li></ul>
<p>I was happy to learn Samsung upgraded the primary camera to a 50MP sensor. While I can&apos;t say now whether it&apos;s <em>significantly</em> better than its predecessor, I&apos;m quite pleased with the result. Images have plenty of contrast, depth, and vibrancy. The camera can struggle a bit with dynamic range, and the sky will often appear blown out. However, I haven&apos;t run into this very often.</p><p>Samsung still struggles with movement, so images can come out a little blurry and lacking in detail if your subject isn&apos;t completely still, and there is sometimes some distortion toward the edges of the image. That said, I do think Samsung has improved a bit on this front, and the phone has been able to capture things like a moving car and a cat without completely failing.</p><p>Fortunately, zooming and low light are also handled well, making for a well-rounded camera experience. However, so far, I&apos;m not a fan of how selfies make my darker skin look, showing that Samsung still has some work in this regard.</p>

<p>Motorola isn&apos;t known for having the best cameras, but I think the Razr Plus 2024 has had a bit of a glow-up in that department, so I naturally pit the two phones against each other. Overall, I think Motorola has been able to hold its own against the Galaxy Z Flip 6, although Samsung handles low-light and nighttime images much better. There tends to be a bit more contrast at times in Samsung&apos;s images, which may make the photos more appealing, although the Razr Plus 2024 images are a bit closer to real life in terms of color, at least most of the time.</p><p>And despite the benefit of a 2x optical telephoto lens on the Razr Plus 2024, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 still manages to keep up pretty well at various zoom levels, thanks to some AI enhancements.</p>

<p>The video quality is pretty good, and my only complaint here so far is that recording is limited to 4K 60, although who is really recording in 8K resolution?</p><p>There is a new feature in the video mode that effectively turns the phone into a camcorder when you fold it 90 degrees. The UI adjusts to fit the viewfinder on the top half of the screen and gives you a zoom slider on the bottom half when you begin recording. It also presents a preview on the cover screen while you&apos;re recording, making it a neat way to take advantage of the form factor.</p>

<p>Another interesting way the phone takes advantage of the cover screen is with Auto Zoom, which you can enable when opening the camera on the cover screen and setting the phone down at a 90-degree angle. The camera will automatically adjust lenses depending on how close or far you are away from it, which is a handy way to take individual or group selfies without having to do much work yourself.</p><p>But as usual, I would highly recommend downloading the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-samsung-galaxy-camera-settings-good-lock">Camera Assistant app</a>, which adds more useful features to your camera, such as a 2x button for faster zooming, auto HDR, a faster shutter button, and more.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Galaxy Z Flip 6 runs Android 14 out of the box with One UI 6.1.1.</strong></li><li><strong>New Galaxy AI drawing features can be fun.</strong></li><li><strong>Some previous features receive useful upgrades.</strong></li><li><strong>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 will receive seven years of software updates.</strong></li></ul>
<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-devices-confirmed">One UI 6.1.1</a> out of the box, which comes with some new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features. I&apos;m both impressed and perplexed by some of the image-generation features, like Drawing Assist, which is truly fascinating and will not only add some fairly realistic and amusing images to your photos via Sketch to Image but will also turn your doodles into entertaining "works of art" that only a mother could love.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QF7GDsBEH2S7fiDvxVqSd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-10.jpg" alt="Generative AI drawing of R2-D2 on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QF7GDsBEH2S7fiDvxVqSd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a few ways to access Sketch to Image, including the Samsung Notes app and the sidebar. It&apos;s also accessible via the Gallery app, where you can sketch things onto existing images to give them an extra bit of flair. The results can range from realistic to pretty outlandish, but I think it&apos;s a fun way to edit images, even as a gag.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="yJKKGVEK2gVdb4wCActvHJ" name="Sketch-to-image-dinosaur.jpg" alt="A dinosaur in a neighborhood" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yJKKGVEK2gVdb4wCActvHJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Can you guess what part of the image isn't real? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m a bit less impressed with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-portrait-studio-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Portrait Studio</a> in Photo Assist, where the phone attempts to generate artistic versions of faces out of a selection of different styles. My colleague Nick Sutrich and I wanted to like this feature in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">hands-on with the Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, but the images it generated looked nothing like us, instead churning out generic-looking faces with at least the same skin tone. Essentially, it&apos;s almost like a caricature of me, but even caricature artists do a better job of capturing my likeness.</p><p>The experience on my Galaxy Z Flip 6 is no different, leaving me mostly disappointed, although maybe you&apos;ll get lucky and find one that somewhat resembles you if you squint. I know it&apos;s meant to be a fun feature that you shouldn&apos;t take seriously, but I would be more impressed if it actually created images that look like me.</p>

<p>The Live Effect feature is cool, turning transforming 2D photos into cinematic videos, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-cinematic-wallpaper-on-android-14">Cinematic Wallpapers</a> on a Pixel phone. It appears to be based on Samsung&apos;s excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-lift-objects-from-a-photo-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Image Clipper</a> feature, which separates the subject from the background and then creates a video that can be used as your wallpaper. I do wish the effect was actually based on motion instead of just looping a video when set on your lock or cover screens, but the effect is still pretty cool.</p><p>Other interesting Galaxy AI features that I&apos;ve enjoyed include Instant Slow-Mo, which now lets you save clips; Composer, which helps you write comments, emails, and more on various apps based on past conversations and prompts that you provide it; and the Recorder app, which I find particularly useful as it will transcribe/translate and summarize recordings for you—something also possible in the Samsung Notes app.</p>
<p>Aside from the new Galaxy AI features, you also get Google AI features like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, which I love.</p><p>Samsung is extending its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> software update promise to the Galaxy Z Flip 6, meaning users can expect at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-updates-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-receive">seven years of updates and OS upgrades</a>. Whether or not a foldable like the Galaxy Z Flip 6 will last that long is another thing.</p>

<p>Foldables are still a growing segment, particularly flip phones, but there are still some good phones that will give the Galaxy Z Flip 6 a run for its money. The most obvious is the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, which also just launched and will be available for purchase at the same time as the Z Flip 6. OPPO&apos;s Find N3 Flip is also a phone worth considering, particularly if you live outside North America.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 features very similar specs to the Z Flip 6, with a flagship Snapdragon chip, 12GB of RAM, and a 4,000mAh battery. The Razr is $100 cheaper and has a larger, more functional cover screen, which makes it a tempting buy over the Flip. That said, the Flip has a more powerful chipset and better software support (based on Samsung&apos;s track record). Additionally, some may prefer to have an ultrawide camera over a telephoto sensor.</p><p>You could go with the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a>, which also has an ultrawide camera and is nearly half the cost. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-motorola-razr-2024">picture quality is noticeably worse</a>, and overall performance may not stack up</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">OPPO Find N3 Flip</a> has a great display, a sleek design, and a fantastic camera system. The battery capacity is also larger then most other flip phones, but the phone isn&apos;t really available in North America, so there may be some incompatibilities, and ColorOS is definitely an acquired taste.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're interested in a new flip phone.</li><li>You want access to the latest AI features from Samsung and Google.</li><li>You're already ingrained in Samsung's ecosystem.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're tempted by the cheaper Motorola Razr Plus 2024.</li><li>You want a useful cover screen experience.</li><li>You don't want to spend more than $1000 on a phone.</li></ul>
<p>Samsung is clearly playing it safe with the Galaxy Z Flip 6, which is more evident by Motorola&apos;s Razr Plus 2024 launch a week prior, offering upgraded specs, a larger cover screen with a refined experience, and a cheaper price tag. That&apos;s not to say this is a bad phone because it&apos;s not. I would normally have no problem recommending this phone because it&apos;s quite a fine phone, but with a $100 price bump, I&apos;m not sure I can recommend this over last year&apos;s just-as-fine Galaxy Z Flip 5.</p><p>Samsung is essentially falling into the same trap as Google, where it&apos;s hard to justify spending much more than previous models when those phones are just as good and will likely receive a handful of the newer features anyway.</p><p>If you can find some deals and you&apos;re rocking the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review">Galaxy Z Flip 4</a>, then I&apos;d say go ahead and buy the Galaxy Z Flip 6. But even then, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-motorola-razr-plus-2024">I would almost recommend the Razr Plus 2024</a> instead, which has already had some intriguing deals since it&apos;s gone on sale.</p>
