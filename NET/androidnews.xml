<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">latest Android 15 developer preview</a> contains some hints about an audio-sharing feature that will allow you to listen to the same audio on different compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a>.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/21/android-15-dp2-audio-sharing/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, Android 15 DP2 includes mentions of Bluetooth audio sharing tucked away in the <em>Connected devices</em> part of the Settings<em> </em>app. This isn&apos;t the first time we&apos;ve seen hints of this feature; it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-bluetooth-le-audio-stream-discovery">made a brief appearance in Android 14 QPR2 Beta 3 last month</a>, and it looks like it&apos;s starting to come together now.</p><p>This new feature in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> will make it easy for others to listen to your media with their own compatible headphones without needing to pair them to your phone first. Plus, there&apos;s a handy "Play a test sound" option to make sure all connected Bluetooth devices are synced up and ready to go.</p><p>There&apos;s also a "Stream settings" text visible underneath, but for now, it&apos;s not showing any content.</p>

<p>Currently, the <em>Share audio</em> feature isn&apos;t functioning in the newest Android 15 developer preview build. But it should be up and running in a future beta release. Keep in mind, though, that it&apos;ll probably only work with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/bluetooth-auracast-broadcast-audio-announcement">wireless earbuds that support Auracast</a>.</p><p>Auracast lets one device, like your phone or computer, send out audio to a bunch of headphones and speakers all at once. This Bluetooth technology has a ton of potential, from making group listening sessions easier to helping people with hearing issues.</p><p>What&apos;s neat about Bluetooth Auracast is that it doesn&apos;t need the usual pairing setup. This means you can have lots of streams happening simultaneously across multiple devices without any fuss. In theory, you can connect as many devices as you want, which makes it perfect for things like public broadcasts in waiting rooms, gyms, bars, airports—you name it.</p><p>Bluetooth Auracast has been out for a bit, but only a handful of products have it built-in. But that might change if it gets a big boost from being more integrated into Android 15.</p>

While there&apos;s a lot of excitement about official satellite connectivity, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-fold-tablet-persistent-taskbar-option-android-15-dp2">return of the old taskbar</a> for large-screen devices, and other features, one addition coming to Android 15 that I&apos;m excited about aims to give more flip phones the cover screen experience they deserve.</p><p>According to Google, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager#COMPAT_SMALL_COVER_SCREEN_OPT_IN">property</a> in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> will allow developers to declare that their app can be used on smaller displays like those used for cover screens on flip phones. Google says this must measure at least 1.5 inches for the shorter dimension and at least 2.4 inches for the longer dimension.</p><p>"These screens are too small to be considered as compatible targets for Android apps to run on, but your app can opt-in to supporting them, making your app available in more places," says Dave Burke, Google&apos;s VR of engineering. This means more flip phones should potentially be able to run full apps on their cover screens, a function that is fairly limited on most flippables outside of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a>.</p><p>If you&apos;re a fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>, as I am, it&apos;s not hard to see why this is exciting for the immediate future of the form factor.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve been using the Motorola Razr Plus as my daily driver ever since the phone launched in June 2023. There&apos;s a lot to like about the phone, but the biggest appeal for me is the fact that I can run almost any app on the large 3.6-inch cover screen. This means I can spend less time on the more power-hungry main display as I respond to texts, watch videos, and even play games without needing to open my phone. It&apos;s a great experience and one I hoped Samsung would lean into when it launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> a month later. Unfortunately, that wasn&apos;t the case.</p><p>I&apos;ve written before about my disappointment with the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/choosing-between-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-motorola-razr-plus">why I chose to stick with the Motorola Razr Plus</a> despite Samsung&apos;s phone having a better chipset, better battery life, and better cameras. It&apos;s no secret to those who know me that I love One UI, and I would much rather be using the Z Flip 5 for that very reason. However, the cover screen experience is quite lacking, and the Razr Plus far surpasses other flip phones I&apos;ve used like the rather impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">OPPO Find N3 Flip</a>. The Razr Plus may not be perfect, but this is the one thing that it gets right, and to me, it&apos;s the most important thing. It just works.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hMxyR4uRo4fdkm9iNY5wmJ" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-review-11.jpg" alt="App continuity button on the Razr+" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hMxyR4uRo4fdkm9iNY5wmJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Samsung makes users go through hoops to get apps working on the cover screen, and even then, the experience still feels lacking. Out of the box, there are only a handful of unofficially supported apps that you can access via the somewhat hidden Labs setting and have apparently been optimized for the cover screen.</p><p>However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-initial-impressions">if you want to use more apps</a>, you&apos;ll have to download <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a>, install a module, enable a feature within that module, and then select which apps you want to appear. It&apos;s a bit much, and I&apos;ve had to explain this process to some friends who ended up buying the phone and had no idea this was possible.</p><p>Samsung has apparently worked with some developers to bring optimized versions of apps to the cover screen, which explains why the selection is pretty limited. Samsung has also suggested that more apps may be available in the future through Labs.</p><p>The problem is that Samsung is hindering its large cover screen by failing to really take advantage of it like Motorola is. It&apos;s not entirely clear why the company has opted to only allow select apps on the cover screen outside of trying to offer a so-called "curated" experience, but with this new capability in Android 15, Google is removing one potential barrier, and Samsung—and other OEMs—have an opportunity to give us the cover screen experience we deserve.</p><p>After all, while having apps optimized for the cover screen is nice, I would much prefer to have them available than not or avoid having to dig into apps and menus to make it happen. The optimization can happen later.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3885px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GNuJxZXfk4VcuazZJTzvbE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-OPPO-Find-N3-Flip-Motorola-Razr-Plus.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 5, Find N3 Flip, and Razr Plus side by side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNuJxZXfk4VcuazZJTzvbE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3885" height="2185" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right now, the Razr Plus is really the only flip phone I know that is taking full advantage of its cover screen this way. However, this new capability in Android 15 has the potential to open the floodgates for more OEMs to offer a similar experience. That&apos;s great for me as a lover of modern flip phones, but that also means Motorola would lose one of its main advantages over other devices.</p><p>After all, if I can get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> or 7 with Android 15, a decent camera, and a better cover screen experience, then I&apos;m sold. Of course, app developers and OEMs like Samsung still have to opt-in to support the feature, but I can&apos;t imagine companies not wanting to when Google is practically handing it to them.</p><p>This change in Android 15 may also give us a glimpse into Google&apos;s plans for a potential <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-flip">Pixel Flip</a>. The company hasn&apos;t been forthcoming about its plans regarding a flip phone to follow the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>, but given how popular the form factor is compared to the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, it&apos;s likely Google is considering building one in the future. That said, if it does, I imagine Google will want to offer a similar cover screen experience to the Razr Plus and may even work with developers to further optimize apps for the smaller displays.</p><p>The global foldable market is growing, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.displaysupplychain.com/press-release/samsung-led-q423-foldable-market-huawei-expected-to-lead-in-q124-for-the-first-time">the latest numbers</a> show that Motorola is steadily catching up to Samsung, thanks to its new Razr models and stiffer competition in the space. However, it&apos;s only a matter of time before even more companies like Google and even OnePlus introduce their own flip phones, meaning Motorola will need to give me another reason to continue using the Razr if it wants to remain competitive.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>iQOO is reportedly already working on the successor of the iQOO Neo 9 Pro, despite the latter's recent release.</li><li>The upcoming smartphone is rumored to feature a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, similar to the one powering the flagship iQOO 12.</li><li>While the company hasn't confirmed plans for a new Neo-series phone, leaked details include display specs, camera features, and fast charging capabilities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The iQOO Neo 9 Pro was only released last month, but a new leak suggests that the company is already working on the next-generation model with some crazy specs.</p><p>It looks like iQOO might be preparing a fresh smartphone to follow up on the iQOO Neo 9 Pro, which hit store shelves earlier this year. The scoop comes from Digital Chat Station over on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5014665757198623" target="_blank">Weibo</a>, and although they didn&apos;t spill the beans on the exact model, savvy commenters deduced that it&apos;s likely an iQOO phone, possibly joining the Neo 10 lineup (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/iqoo_neo10_pros_impressive_specs_leak-news-62127.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>As per the leaked information, this upcoming smartphone could pack a serious punch under the hood with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset</a>, the same processor that fuels the flagship model, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-12-review">iQOO 12</a>, and many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there.</p><p>Even though the company hasn&apos;t confirmed any plans for a new Neo-series phone yet, other juicy details about this rumored smartphone have found their way online, such as the display specs, camera details, and even hints about its fast charging capabilities.</p><p>According to DCS, the screen will be a 1.5K LTPO OLED flat display, boasting a max refresh rate of 144Hz.</p><p>DCS also claims there will be two cameras on board. One is rumored to be a 50MP with a sizeable sensor. Furthermore, expect blazing-fast 120W charging, paired with a "large battery" for all-day power. The phone could also include an X-axis motor for some impressive haptics.</p><p>Despite packing some seriously top-tier specs, rumor has it that this phone&apos;s frame might be plastic—definitely a curious choice. On the flip side, the back is said to come in either glass or faux leather, depending on your color preference.</p><p>As of now, the Vivo sub-brand is keeping mum about its next big release, especially since the Neo 9 Pro was just released last month. But some people are speculating that this new phone could be marketed as a "flagship killer" because, well, the choice of a plastic frame suggests they&apos;re aiming to keep costs down.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly expanding the reach of its SGE test to include U.S. users who haven&apos;t signed up for its beta environment.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://searchengineland.com/google-starts-testing-ai-overviews-from-sge-in-main-google-search-interface-438680">SearchEngineLand</a>, users who aren&apos;t in Google&apos;s Search Generative Experience (SGE) environment have noticed new AI features (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/25/google-ai-powered-sge-expansion/">9to5Google</a>). Search users not in SGE should soon notice its AI overviews when running a query through the engine.</p><p>Google confirmed to the publication that it is "starting with a set of queries where it thinks generative AI can be especially helpful." The company adds its expanded generative AI test, which is aimed at users&apos; complex questions that will push its AI to scour multiple sources across the web.</p><p>Google commented that the purpose of expanding the test is to gather feedback from the general public.</p><p>The company states it is "confident" that the value and quality its SGE feature brings will help the end user. Moreover, these AI overviews may not appear in a widespread fashion for the bulk of Google Search users.</p><p>Google is testing several variations of its generative AI experience, and only a "small subset" of U.S. users will see it. 9to5 adds that this test will include those who haven&apos;t signed into Google, as well.</p>

<p>Google launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-opens-access-to-search-labs">Search Labs</a> in May 2023, and the test environment brought loads of generative AI features that users could playtest. One notable feature was a way users could ask the AI a follow-up question for additional information about a query&apos;s answer. AI was also seen urging users to consider certain factors related to technology, such as battery life or other quality aspects.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">rolled out</a> AI overviews onto the main Google app on Android alongside Circle to Search. The overviews are present during multi-search moments through Lens, giving users access to a wealth of information collected on a subject and the AI&apos;s sources.</p><p>More AI and SGE tests are on the horizon for Search as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-liz-reid-appointed-head-of-search">Google appointed Liz Reid</a> as its new head on March 19. Reid touted a background in AI at Google before rising to lead Search further through the use of the company&apos;s generative AI software. During her announcement, Reid stated that Search will implement more SGE and AI overviews, focusing on its ability to understand context-rich queries.</p><p>The test we&apos;re seeing roll out now for non-enrolled SGE users sings a similar tune, meaning we&apos;re likely on the cusp of those AI additions.</p>

<ul><li>The latest Motorola Edge 50 Fusion renders have now leaked, showing the entirety of the device.</li><li>It will feature at least three colorways and IP68 water resistance.</li><li>The device is expected to have a 50MP primary sensor, 13MP ultra-wide, and a 32MP selfie shooter.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As we near the Motorola Edge 50 Pro launch, another Edge series smartphone is also up for launch, and the official renders seem to have just shown up on the web.</p><p>The upcoming Motorola Edge 50 Fusion renders come from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/03/exclusive-leak-motorola-edge-50-fusion.html?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-androidheadline&utm_content=later-41941898&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio">Android Headlines</a> and reveal the device in full. The device&apos;s design appears similar to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-pro-debut-in-early-april">Edge 50 Pro</a>, except for the shorter camera module on the back. The visor blends into the back panel alongside the top middle frame of the device.</p>

<p>The Edge 50 Fusion, per the latest renders, reveals a rounded corner design with a large display and very minimal bezels on the sides. In contrast, the top and bottom bezels appear more significant than the side ones because of their curved display measuring 6.7 inches and being a pOLED panel, which further has Gorilla Glass 5 on top, notes Android Headlines.</p><p>The renders further showcase the Edge 50 Fusion in three colorways: Ballad Blue, Peacock Pink, and Tidal Teal. All three color variants feature a textured back, and the blue variant notably features a vegan leather finish. The Edge 50 Fusion will also support an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance.</p>

<p>According to Android Headlines, the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 will power the Edge 50 Fusion, which recently seemed to have scored 913 and 2629 in single and multi-score when run through a Geekbench test. The device will also equip 8GB of RAM coupled with 256GB of onboard storage. Keeping the lights on is expected to be a decent 5000mAh battery with support to 68W fast wired charging.</p><p>The new camera visor will comprise a 50MP primary camera aided by another 13MP ultra wide-angle camera. And for selfies, the Edge 50 Fusion will be sporting a 32MP front camera.</p><p>This device is set to launch alongside the Motorola Edge 50 Pro, which will launch in India on the same date. The device is likely to be priced at around $300.</p>

<ul><li>Spotify announced the start of its "Learning Courses" test for U.K. users, bringing videos to the platform for educational purposes.</li><li>The company states these videos will encompass several areas, such as making music, creativity, business, and more.</li><li>Free and Premium users can watch two lessons for free, but any lessons of interest after must be purchased.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Today (Mar. 25), Spotify is introducing a new test for U.K. users that brings several educational videos to the music streaming service.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-03-25/spotify-tests-video-based-learning-courses-in-the-uk/">press release</a>, the company states eligible users will find these videos "alongside favorite music, podcasts, and audiobooks." Spotify states its first entry into educational videos, known as "Learning Courses," will focus on teaching users how to make music, creativity, business, and living healthier.</p><p>To join, Spotify adds that users in the U.K. will find these courses at home and browse tabs in the mobile app. More importantly, these courses aren&apos;t free forever, as the service states that Premium and free accounts can allow you to watch two lessons without additional payment.</p><p>Those on a desktop must head to Spotify&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://courses.spotify.com/?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fcourses.spotify.com%2Fhome%3F_branch_match_id%3D1023817652572117109%26utm_source%3DPR%26utm_campaign%3Dspotify_courses%26utm_medium%3DFTR%26_branch_referrer%3DH4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXLy7IL8lMq9TLyczL1ncLCYoPCAIARbB9IxsAAAA%253D">official Courses page</a> to purchase lessons. Once purchased, the company adds users can view the videos on their mobile device or desktop. Users will be given details on a lesson, with Spotify detailing how many lessons are in a course, how long it takes to get through it, and more.</p>

<p>Spotify states the catalyst behind its Learning Courses is its partnership with BBC Maestro, PLAYvirtuoso, Skillshare, and Thinkific. The company is also interested in helping educational creators increase their audience. The post states that "about half" of its Premium subscribers have listened to self-help or educational podcasts.</p><p>Spotify&apos;s vice president of product development, Babar Zafar, added, "Many of our users engage with podcasts and audiobooks on a daily basis for their learning needs, and we believe this highly engaged community will be interested in accessing and purchasing quality content from video course creators."</p><p>The post states that Learning Courses are rolling out today (Mar. 25) for U.K. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">users on mobile</a> and desktop. Unfortunately, Spotify has not stated whether or not folks in the U.S. can expect to receive access to this test.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ 
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>WhatsApp beta for Android bearing the 2.24.7.6 version is bringing a new Status update feature.</li><li>Like Instagram, users will be able to share up to one-minute video as a status update.</li><li>Earlier, the same ability was limited to only 30 seconds.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is working on a new feature, which is apparently the most requested one — the ability to share longer status updates.</p><p>Currently, WhatsApp users can share a status update video with a runtime of 30 seconds, but this could be changing, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-7-6-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>. The latest WhatsApp beta bearing the <strong>2.24.7.6</strong> version has been found to test status updates that can be up to one minute long, a significant boost from the existing limit. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="aeD9sSGNjzmXvjKkCve8jf" name="whatsapp-status-update-one-minute.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Status update one-minute long" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aeD9sSGNjzmXvjKkCve8jf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>WABetaInfo further notes that the new feature is currently available only to a select group of beta testers. However, following an official update, more users will soon be able to use it. </p><p>Previously, users could only share short video forms through status updates or multiple 30-second clips of a longer video post. The new ability allows users to share longer, one-minute videos, similar to what we are used to on Instagram Stories. </p>
<p>Apparently, the new ability has been WhatsApp&apos;s most requested feature, and the decision to bring it was based on user feedback, notes WABetaInfo. </p><p>WhatsApp has been constantly on the verge of introducing/ testing new features to compete with and catch up with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">rival messaging apps</a>. The messaging platform has recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-testing-transcribe-voice-notes-feature">found testing</a> transcribing voice notes on Android, which earlier was available for iOS users. </p><p>Moreover, WhatsApp has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-beta-prepares-optional-link-preview">started testing</a> the ability to hide link previews in chats through the recent beta version of the app. Late last month, WhatsApp also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-will-now-let-you-format-text-as-lists-block-quotes-and-code">rolled out</a> new text formatting options to the existing bold, italic, strikethrough, and monospace formats.</p>

The app&apos;s latest beta, version 20240318 openbeta_dynamic, now shows an "Add More" and "Send" pill-shaped button instead of the current build&apos;s download and send options.</p><p>Additionally, beta testers are treated to an added box to type in a message for the image they&apos;re going to send. Further tinkering showed that opting to snap and attach another photo will refresh the screen, but Messages will keep your previously typed message intact.</p><p>Google&apos;s latest test for Messages is missing one notable function: editing. AssembleDeBug&apos;s find is missing the "edit" button that the stable version of Messages provides. Seeing as the test has just begun, it could be a matter of time before Google pops in an editing button for photos on its new attachment page.</p><p>The publication notes that it has experienced the new attachment page in Messages on multiple devices in the beta. This likely means that the majority of those with the beta version of Messages will see this test today (Mar. 25) and beyond.</p>

<p>Android user&apos;s latest camera-focused test in Messages arrived shortly after the app picked up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-new-camera-viewfinder-rollout">brand-new viewfinder</a>. Google pushed a server-side update for Messages on March 15 that reworked the UI users would find when snapping a photo. The simplified UI offered zoom options, an easy camera switcher, and options for photos and video capture.</p><p>Unfortunately, the latest UI changes ditched the gear icon for more camera settings. That small page previously let users tinker with their flash, camera timers, and aspect ratio.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google is preparing to implement Gemini into Messages, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-gemini-integration-capabilities-detailed">launched a beta</a> for those with eligible devices. Digging into the app&apos;s code showed that Gemini functions similarly to its desktop variation, giving users access to Google app extensions like Maps, Gmail, Flights, and more. The AI bot could also assist users with coding and could be placed into a group chat, though the latter didn&apos;t function properly.</p>

From now through the end of the sale (and <em>potentially</em> beyond, knowing Amazon) you can score an absolutely massive 28% discount on the 256GB foldable, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C34DL6Z7"><strong>knocking the price down to $1,299.99</strong></a>. </p>

<p>It took a long time, but the unlocked <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> is finally getting its first major discount during Amazon's Big Spring Sale. At $1,299.99, the Pixel Fold comes packed with a number of premium features, including some flagship-level camera tech, years of software support, and two vibrant OLED displays. It may not top its direct competition from OnePlus and Samsung, but at this price, it's a steal. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C34DL6Z7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b7b23950-5179-4b1d-ac97-edb5a198ea1b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,799.99" data-dimension48="$1,799.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you want an excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> at a discount; you need to take consistently great photos and video; you want a Pixel phone and tablet all rolled into one.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>you can wait until the Pixel Fold 2 is released (probably this summer); you don&apos;t care about Pixel and can afford an arguably better foldable, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>.</p><p>Even at $1,299.99, the Pixel Fold is still far from cheap, but if you&apos;re familiar with the premium foldable landscape, you&apos;ll get why this $500 discount is such a big deal. The Google Pixel Fold is essentially a cutting-edge tablet and flagship phone all rolled into one, with two gorgeous OLED displays, some amazing camera tech, and fluid, efficient performance from the Tensor G2 chipset. The Fold was also one of the first large-screen foldables to actually fold flat on a surface, thanks to its durable teardrop hinge, and you&apos;re guaranteed to receive years of software support straight out of the box. </p><p>This is the biggest discount that the unlocked Google Pixel Fold has ever received by a margin of hundreds. Will it end when the Amazon Big Spring Sale comes to a close at midnight on March 25th? That&apos;s the big question, but I wouldn&apos;t risk it.</p>

<ul><li>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 might feature more RAM, as rumors suggest it could see an additional 12GB option.</li><li>The clamshell may also feature a boost for its cover display, as its refresh rate could increase to 120Hz.</li><li>Rumors continue to speculate the Flip 6 will receive a larger battery array, which could reach 4,000mAh.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new batch of rumors suggests some welcome changes could arrive on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 later this year.</p><p>The rumors stem from X leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/kro_roe/status/1771446292805546038">kro_roe</a>, who states the Galaxy Z Flip 6 could launch with two chip variants (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-6-12gb-ram-120hz-cover-screen/">SamMobile</a>). The leaker purports the Flip 6 will feature Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 or Samsung&apos;s Exynos 2400 in certain regions. Rumors add that the clamshell&apos;s next cover display boost could impact its fluidity.</p><p>The Flip 6 could feature a 120Hz refresh rate cover display, up from 60Hz on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Z Flip 5</a>.</p><p>Internally, the foldable is rumored to offer an 8GB and a 12GB RAM variant. The RAM sizes also appear to be region-locked, meaning we&apos;ll need Samsung&apos;s official word to know for sure. The X leaker states consumers will likely see the same internal storage pairing of 256GB and 512GB as Samsung&apos;s 2023 launch.</p><p>Speculation surrounding a "larger battery" for the Flip 6 cropped up again, though the leaker didn&apos;t give specifics.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Flip 6 Spec SheetSnapdragon, Exynos up to 8 GB RAM, 12 GB depending on region256,512 GB of storageLonger battery than predecessor120Hz external screen in development<a href="https://twitter.com/kro_roe/status/1771446292805546038">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The Flip 6 could follow a pattern similar to the Galaxy S24 as it offered the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the U.S. but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-exynos-will-be-just-fine">gave other regions</a> its Exynos 2400. Samsung boosted its custom SoC with a new CPU and NPU, meaning the chip is fast and should be a worthwhile alternative if the rumors are true.</p><p>Meanwhile, the latest Flip 5 only offers one RAM choice: 8GB. Rumors give the impression that Samsung will finally give consumers the choice to go bigger with the popular foldable&apos;s memory for handling apps. Additionally, the soon-to-be predecessor features a 3,700mAh battery setup. The current leak didn&apos;t mention how "large" Samsung could go, however, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-larger-dual-batteries-rumor">previous rumor</a> suggested it could reach 4,000mAh.</p><p>The Flip 5 already saw a cover display boost as the Korean OEM opted for a larger 3.4-inch screen. Rumors clashed, as a leak stated the display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fold-6-larger-displays-rumored">could rise again</a> to nearly 4 inches, but a batch of alleged renders showed that things might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-renders-leak">stay the same</a> as their predecessor.</p><p>We&apos;re only a few months out, but speculations swirl that Samsung could host its summer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">Unpacked event</a> on July 10 in Paris, France. This event should reveal its next wave of foldables and the Galaxy Ring.</p>
