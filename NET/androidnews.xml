<p>Google relaunched the Find My Device network to compete with Apple&apos;s similar item-finding Find My network, with the official roll-out going <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">live in April 2024</a>. The idea behind this was to create a web of compatible devices around the world to help you find lost stuff using compatible item trackers.</p><p>This is right up my alley as a professional accessory fiddler, which is why I got my hands on the latest and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">greatest Bluetooth trackers</a> that support the new network. Chipolo and Pebblebee were the first brands to jump on the Find My Device train, so those are the brands I chose for my little experiment.</p><p>We&apos;ve all heard that Google&apos;s Find My Device network is live, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/googles-find-my-device-network-is-live-but-it-isnt-working-as-expected">it isn&apos;t working as expected</a>. Still, I was really hoping that my test would yield positive results to a certain extent. Here&apos;s how it went down.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2556px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="SRB5UNuckEYD6iUD7vE58U" name="google-find-my-device-network-trackers-pebblebee-chipolo-lifestyle-2.jpg" alt="Various Google Find My Device Bluetooth trackers from Chipolo and Pebblebee held in one hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SRB5UNuckEYD6iUD7vE58U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2556" height="1438" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Pebblebee was kind enough to send me the Pebblebee Clip for Android, Pebblebee Card for Android, and Pebblebee Tag for Android. Here are the basic specs of the three Bluetooth trackers.</p>

<p>To get a fair understanding of the network, I also reached out to Chipolo for their Google Find My Device compatible trackers. The brand just launched updated versions of its older lineup. Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/chipolo-one-bluetooth-tracker-review">Chipolo ONE Point</a> and the Chipolo CARD Point have been revamped to support Google&apos;s new network.</p>

<p>Both brands offer your typical circular trackers with keyholes as well as card-shaped ones. In addition to these, Pebblebee offers a tiny tag that comes with a silicone mold and double-sided adhesive tape. You can either attach the tag to your pet&apos;s collar using the silicone holder or use the sticky tape to attach it to something like a TV remote.</p><p>In essence, Pebblebee and Chipolo&apos;s Find My Device trackers are nearly identical in terms of functionality. You set each tracker up using your Android phone and each brand&apos;s respective <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Android app</a>. The app automatically helps you add your tracker to the Google Find My Device app.</p><p>I found Chipolo&apos;s app to be a tad faster while setting up new trackers. Meanwhile, Pebblebee&apos;s trackers have better response and a wider Bluetooth range. Bear in mind that Chipolo&apos;s trackers are louder than Pebblebee&apos;s. They all sport splash-proof water resistance across the board.</p><p>What&apos;s really cool is that Pebblebee&apos;s trackers are rechargeable using plain old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cables</a> or magnetic-pin-to-USB-C cables.</p>

<p>After setting up the Google Find My Device trackers, you name and attach them to things that matter. What I ended up doing with all five of my trackers was dividing each one among my friends and asking them not to disclose their location to me. I wanted to locate them randomly using the power of Google&apos;s network, and my friends could then confirm whether the network was correct or not.</p><p>Everything worked out fine and dandy while the trackers were within my phone&apos;s Bluetooth range. However, the minute I was out of range, the network lost them immediately. At this point, I decided it was time to turn things up a notch.</p><p>The next day, I marked all Bluetooth trackers as lost. Surely, at least one of the five trackers would be found over the next few days? Shockingly, three whole days passed before I heard anything back.</p><p>And get this: it wasn&apos;t even the network that helped me find my "lost" trackers. I happened to have dinner with my friends and had forgotten that some of them were carrying my trackers. Midway through my meal, a notification on my phone alerted me that one of my lost trackers was found and was nearby.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.33%;"><img id="rXEnfLMRkn3xTMDSLvpx2T" name="google-find-my-device-app-screenshots.jpg" alt="Google Find My Device network app screenshots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rXEnfLMRkn3xTMDSLvpx2T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To say that I was disappointed would be an understatement. I was under the impression that the network would work spectacularly well, seeing as how Android devices are massively popular in the Asian region where I am based.</p><p>Going off of my expectations versus reality, I soon realized that the presence of Android devices is not enough for the Find My Device network to be successful. My colleague <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/googles-find-my-device-network-is-live-but-it-isnt-working-as-expected">Brady Snyder did a fine job explaining this</a>.</p><p>Although the majority of all Android and Google Fast Pair devices can use Google&apos;s new network, not many choose to contribute to the crowdsourcing network. Limited contribution and participation are killing what could be a fantastic anonymous way of item tracking.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.33%;"><img id="VJLvbMZRiqnjQcBntwG6P5" name="google-find-my-device-app-screenshots-2.jpg" alt="Google Find My Device network app screenshots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJLvbMZRiqnjQcBntwG6P5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ironically, Google offers too many options for participating in the Find My Device network. This was designed to protect user privacy, so I can&apos;t really fault them for that, but it doesn&apos;t really make sense, seeing as how device location data contributions are anonymous and encrypted.</p><p>Apart from this confusing variety of options to contribute to the network, there&apos;s also the fact that a lot of people simply haven&apos;t set up the Find My Device feature on their Android devices yet. It&apos;s not on everyone&apos;s list of first things to do with their new Android phone, and some people don&apos;t even know about the feature, which is a whole other problem.</p><p>So, what can be done to fix this? As controversial as it might sound, Google needs to find a way to make more Android users contribute to its crowdsourcing network if its Find My Device network is going to reach its full potential. If people choose not to be part of the network, it will fail as an item-finding network by design. And with that in mind, there will be no point in upgrading your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">Bluetooth trackers</a> to the latest variants either. Since contributions to the crowdfunded Find My Device network are anonymous anyway, why give people so many chances to opt out of its more useful feature?</p>

<ul><li>Google patched a serious security issue for Pixel devices with the release of the June Pixel Feature Drop last week.</li><li>Though the flaw affects more Android devices, non-Pixel devices will have to wait for Android 15.</li><li>This decision leaves Android devices vulnerable to an actively-exploited flaw for months.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Last week, Google finally addressed a critical security flaw that researchers and security advocates have been raising awareness of since April. The problem? Google included the fix in the June Pixel Feature Drop, and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> aren&apos;t able to receive the update. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-patches-exploited-android-zero-day-on-pixel-devices/" target="_blank">BleepingComputer</a> first reported the patch, and the team at GrapheneOS — who first reported the vulnerability — confirmed that non-Pixel devices will need to wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> to get a fix.</p><p>Google patched 50 security vulnerabilities in the Android 14 QPR3 update for Pixels. However, one stands out because it is a zero-day vulnerability. This means that the flaw was actively exploited in the wild before Google became aware of it. Zero-day security vulnerabilities are the most severe, and thus, Google recommends that all Pixel users apply the June update as soon as possible. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's fixed on Pixels with the June update (Android 14 QPR3) and will be fixed on other Android devices when they eventually update to Android 15. If they don't update to Android 15, they probably won't get the fix, since it has not been backported. Not all patches are backported.<a href="https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1801294252925927728">June 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The company shared this information on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2024-06-01" target="_blank">Pixel Update Bulletin</a>, which is where Google provides updates on security problems affecting Pixel devices or Android. "There are indications that CVE-2024-32896 may be under limited, targeted exploitation," the company explains. According to GrapheneOS, the actively-exploited CVE-2024-32896 refers to the same exploit that was previously reported as CVE-2024-29748. The new identifier represents the Pixel-exclusive fix that was included in the June update. </p><p>The issue is an elevation of privilege (EoP) problem with Android firmware that Google referred to as of "high severity" for Pixels. </p><p>"It was exploited by forensics companies against users with apps like Wasted and Sentry trying to wipe the device when detecting an attack," the GrapheneOS team <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1801294115407106186">explained</a>. "We addressed it as part of making our duress PIN/password feature and reported it to get Google to fix it across Android, which is now done." </p><p>The developers add that two core problems are making the exploit possible. The first is system memory not being erased when entering fast boot mode, meaning that it&apos;s possible for an exploit to access older system memory. A separate but related issue centers around the Android Open Source Project device admin API needing reboot-to-recovery to erase — though this has been fixed in Android 14 QPR3.</p><p>The first problem was previously fixed on Pixels, and the second was fixed in the June Pixel Feature Drop. However, as we&apos;ve mentioned, Pixel phones and tablets are the only ones that receive the fix. That&apos;s because of the way that Android OEMs release software updates and fixes, and it isn&apos;t entirely Google&apos;s fault. </p>
<h2 id="why-other-android-phones-aren-apos-t-getting-a-fix-2">Why other Android phones aren&apos;t getting a fix</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="H9uJ5yTZcUC5qbV6eB2BDK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-lockscreen-03.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H9uJ5yTZcUC5qbV6eB2BDK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Considering that this issue was actively exploited and has a high severity, you&apos;re probably wondering why other Android devices aren&apos;t getting a fix. After all, Google is advising Pixel users to update their devices ASAP to protect themselves. The truth is that Google has done its part, and it&apos;s up to the other OEMs to implement a fix. The company included the patch in Android 14 QPR3, and any device that receives the Android 14 QPR3 update will get it. </p><p>Fixes like this one are often added to the Android Open Source Project, or AOSP, which serves as the basis for other versions of Android. An operating system like Samsung&apos;s One UI or OnePlus&apos; OxygenOS uses AOSP as the groundwork. The issue is that third-party operating systems usually apply AOSP upgrades yearly. So, Samsung will likely use the AOSP version of Android 15 as the basis for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-early-testing-spotted">One UI 7</a>. However, a future version of Android 15 QPR2 or Android 15 QPR3 wouldn&apos;t impact Samsung Galaxy devices until One UI 8. </p><p>In other words, the reason Google Pixel devices are the only ones to get this patch are because they&apos;re the only ones to receive monthly, quarterly, and yearly updates. Theoretically, a company could take the fix included in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-2-2">Android 14 QPR3</a> and apply it to their phones. However, since other OEMs don&apos;t do quarterly updates, the security patches included in Android 14 QPR3 won&apos;t hit their devices until Android 15. </p><p>Some security patches are seeded to older versions of Android through a process called backporting. This doesn&apos;t happen for every patch, though. Google probably should have backported the fix for this security flaw, keeping in mind the severity and its zero-day status. However, it&apos;s not necessarily Google&apos;s responsibility to do so. Additionally, only half of the security issues are related to AOSP. No one can solve the first issue described above except each manufacturer itself. </p><p>This is the latest example of how choosing an Android phone from a brand other than Google can put a user at a security risk. Other brands are too slow to respond to critical zero-day flaws with patches, and it&apos;s a real problem. Sometimes, the blame lies with Google and others with the partner OEMs, and it&apos;s often a mix of both. Either way, the users suffer.</p>

<ul><li>Tipster Ice Universe has shared some exciting details about the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim.</li><li>It is a thinner, lighter, and bigger alternative to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, launching in China as Galaxy W25.</li><li>The tipster indicates that the slimmer Galaxy foldable will launch in October, and not at the upcoming July Unpacked event.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s anticipated Galaxy Unpacked event is only a couple of weeks away. We should see the Galaxy Z Fold 6 next to the Galaxy Z Flip 6 during the launch event. Several rumors have been regarding another Galaxy Z Fold 6 model over the past few months; however, new information indicates it is likely to launch in October. </p><p>The device in question is the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim, another foldable device from Samsung. Well-known leaker Ice Universe on X has shared some interesting details about the foldable of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim. As the name suggests, it will be thinner, lighter, and larger than the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 6 and will be renamed Galaxy W25 in China, notes Ice Universe. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Z Fold6 Slim will be named Samsung W25 in China, which is lighter, thinner and larger than Fold6.Will be released in October and does not support SPen.<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1803016380838551887">June 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The tipster further indicates that it will be launched in October, although it didn&apos;t specify whether it is for the Chinese market or other regions. Also, it will be missing an important feature, which is the support for S-Pen, unlike the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> that support it.</p><p>In the accompanying interactions with the comments on the aforementioned X post, Ice Universe has shared that it wouldn&apos;t be some kind of Fan Edition device. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim will also have a solid build, as it utilizes the premium titanium frame.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim details are still scarce, although this isn&apos;t the first time we have heard about it. Late last month, prominent display analyst Ross Young <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-fold-6-slim-expected-to-launch-in-2025">shared details</a> of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim, which slightly differ from today&apos;s Ice Universe claims.</p><p>While Young also hinted that the Z Fold 6 Slim will have a bigger display than the original Z Fold 6 next to no S-Pen support, he noted that the alleged device won&apos;t launch until next year, as its display panel will be shipping in the fourth quarter of this year. </p>
<p>In the meantime, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-stick-to-two-galaxy-foldables-as-before">latest report</a> from South Korea claimed that Samsung is sticking with the same two foldables this year, citing a lack of differentiation factors.</p><p>While it will be encouraging to have more foldables phone options from Samsung to consider next to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Z Flip 6</a>, rumors regarding the Z Fold 6 Slim are becoming speculative at this point. </p><p>Given the tipster&apos;s solid credibility, if the prediction regarding the new Slim foldable phone is accurate, it would be an interesting option to look forward to, even if it likely turns out to be a pricer.</p>

<ul><li>An APK dive into the Google app's latest beta shows the company's early development of an audio lookup feature.</li><li>Concrete details are scarce, however, speculation suggests the function could let Circle to Search run an audio query based on sounds from your device.</li><li>Circle to Search was previously tipped to pick up new features for "copying" and sharing highlighted snapshots alongside split-screen support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent discovery shows that Google could implement a way for its Circle to Search to handle audio queries.</p><p>An APK dive conducted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1803036529839030335">AssembleDebug</a> in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-audio-search-apk-teardown-3452225/">Android Authority</a> shows evidence of a new audio option. The tipster discovered the feature in beta version 15.24.28.29 of the Google app on Android.</p><p>When activating Circle to Search, the feature displays a new music note icon between the manual search box and the Google Translate icon.</p><p>Details about the feature&apos;s functionality are scarce as the tipster couldn&apos;t get it to function properly. However, speculation suggests the note&apos;s icon could let <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a> listen in on what your device is playing and that as a query. This could be useful as another way of discovering music heard through a social media app or anywhere else on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>.</p><p>What&apos;s also unclear is if users can let Circle to Search listen in on a segment of audio <em>and </em>attach extra written context in the bar. This is already a possibility as the feature captures what&apos;s been circled with the option of adding a bit of text to help refine Google&apos;s search.</p><p>The tipster needed to manually surface the note&apos;s UI button, however, with so little information it&apos;s likely Google&apos;s still in early development.</p>

<p>There&apos;s more in development for Google&apos;s Circle to Search as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-new-options-spotted">a previous APK dive</a> showed updates for sharing and editing. Regarding the former, the app&apos;s code showed the feature may let users circle a section but opt to share that highlighted portion with others through the sub-menu instead of running a query.</p><p>The latter "copy" what they&apos;ve circled and throw it into their device&apos;s photo editor to spruce it up, add annotations, or share through Messages and more.</p><p>Another discovery during Android 15 beta showed that Google plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-phones-may-soon-let-you-use-circle-to-search-in-split-screen-mode">bring split-screen support</a> to it for Pixel phones. This would allow Pixel owners to use two apps at once <em>and </em>leverage Circle to Search&apos;s assistance for quick queries without having to swap around.</p><p>Moreover, it seems as though the lack of support was more of an internal development bug as supported Samsung phones don&apos;t have a problem.</p>

<p>The CMF by Nothing Phone 1 is shaping up to be an interesting device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothings-cmf-phone-1-might-rock-a-beefier-mediatek-chipset-after-all">as previous teasers</a> have shown it sporting a curious knob on its back panel.

A 5,000mAh battery with 33W fast charging is also rumored. Speaking of its backing, the CMF Phone 1 features an odd screw head, which picked up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/cmfbynothing/status/1803042431039877159">another teaser most recently</a>.</p><p>User Ben Gaskin on X showed off the device&apos;s orange-colored screwdriver with the caption "what does this screwdriver mean?"</p>

The Watch Pro offered a square design reminiscent of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple&apos;s Watch</a> with a 1.96-inch AMOLED display and an estimated 13-day battery life.</p><p>There&apos;s very little information about where CMF by Nothing could take its next Watch and Buds regarding design and specifications.

<hr>
<p>OnePlus is preparing for its next Nord phone launch later this month. The company has started teasing the phone, which is the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and it will likely be dubbed Nord N40 in the U.S. market.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/launch/nord-ce4-lite-5g#subscribeLuckRule::subscribe">teaser page</a>, the Nord CE 4 Lite will feature a striking blue color variant, which the company calls “Mega Blue,” complementing its predecessor Nord CE 3 Lite from last year, which came in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-ce-3-lite-5g-launch">bright yellow colorway</a>. It will sport a conventional-looking dual camera module (a bit smaller than the previous iteration) at the back, accompanied by a dual LED flash.</p>

<p>OnePlus has also confirmed the primary camera of the handset, which includes a 50MP Sony LYT-600 lens with OIS support.</p><p>As for the launch date, tipster Abhishek Yadav on X has shared the global launch date, which is set for June 24. Yadav has further shared some of the confirmed specifications of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range handset</a>. </p><p>It includes a 120Hz refresh rate AMOLED display with a notable 2100 nits peak brightness. It further supports Aqua Touch, which allows users to efficiently use the display even when their fingers are wet or in such scenarios.</p>

<p>The device&apos;s massive 5500mAh battery keeps the lights on. It supports OnePlus’ 80W SuperVooc charging and reverse charging up to 5W. </p><p>As for the launch, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is currently set for the Indian market on June 24 at 7 PM IST. Considering the predecessor’s debut for the U.S. market, it will likely come in a month after the release in India and other markets, likely dubbed as Nord N40, as mentioned. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">Nord N30</a> turned out to be a decent recommendation with its great-looking design and lots of software updates. Its battery life turned out to be great as well—thanks to its fast charging speeds. We expect the same, if not a better version, whenever it lands in the U.S. market. </p>

<ul><li>YouTube appears to be testing a feature that will add notes at the bottom of the video.</li><li>This aims to provide sources and relevant information to viewers about the video, making it easier for them to spot fake/altered videos on the platform.</li><li>This is being rolled out to US people who will start seeing notes on videos in the "coming weeks and months." </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/new-ways-to-offer-viewers-more-context/">announced</a> on Monday (June 17) that it is testing a feature to allow people to add notes and provide relevant and easily understandable context to their videos on the platform. </p><p>The blog post explains that YouTube could include notes that clarify when a song is a parody, or a new version of a product being reviewed is available, or let viewers know when older footage is mistakenly portrayed as a current event. This will make it easier for viewers to spot fake or altered videos/news on the platform.</p><p>This feature looks similar to Community Notes on X, which provides a disclaimer right below the tweet to inform users that the post is misleading or lacks information—providing links to additional sources on the web.</p><p>YouTube says it will invite a limited number of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14925346#zippy=%2Cwho-has-access-to-write-notes%2Cwhy-can-i-see-notes-on-videos-even-though-i-cant-write-them%2Cwhat-happens-to-my-note-after-i-submit-it%2Ccan-i-check-the-status-of-my-notes%2Chow-do-i-delete-a-note%2Cdo-i-need-to-sign-up-to-write-notes-and-how-do-i-know-if-im-off-the-waitlist%2Cwho-rates-notes">eligible</a> contributors who will write notes on these videos to help them test this feature before expanding it on a larger scale. </p><p>To be eligible to participate in this test, users should have created their account six or more months ago, haven&apos;t had any community guidelines strike in the past year, and aren&apos;t supervised or have a brand/school account containing multiple users. It&apos;s important to note that these YouTube accounts need to be based in the United States and have their language set to English.</p><p>"These <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230586?sjid=7456120448090610509-NC" target="_blank">third-party evaluators</a> are the same people who provide feedback on YouTube’s search results and recommendations," the blog states.</p><p>Also, these contributors will appear as "anonymous" on YouTube&apos;s notes, so they won&apos;t have to worry about being &apos;exposed&apos; per se. The company says that as the pilot project expands, contributors themselves can rate notes as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:93.00%;"><img id="CDtH5yfSuGorZbQCdE9s5E" name="YouTube-notes-.jpg" alt="YouTube tests notes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CDtH5yfSuGorZbQCdE9s5E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="744" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>YouTube says that Notes will appear publicly under a video if they’re helpful to a wide range of audiences. </p><p>Under a video, viewers will be given options to choose if they found the note “helpful,” “somewhat helpful,” or “unhelpful” and why. Allowing users to share their thoughts about whether the note cites the right sources or is written clearly and neutrally. </p><p>"From there, we’ll use a bridging-based algorithm to consider these ratings and determine what notes are published," the blog added.</p><p>YouTube says that people in the US will start to see notes on videos in the "coming weeks and months."</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (June 18), Google is detailing its latest Android 15 beta update for developers and users involved.</p><p>According to Google, its Android 15 Beta 3 rollout brings the upcoming major OS release into "Platform Stability" right on schedule. With that, there are only a few things testers and developers should look out for, like passkey and Credential Manager updates.</p><p>Google is letting enrolled testers in on single-step sign-in capabilities through biometrics like facial recognition, fingerprint, or screen lock. Previously, users were given two sub-menus: one asking about a "saved passkey" for a given service and another for their biometrics. Now, users will see one unified sub-menu detailing the service they&apos;re signing into and a prompt for their fingerprint or the option to use a PIN.</p><p>The company states that if a user accidentally dismisses the app&apos;s prompt to use a passkey, the Credential Manager will display autofill suggestions on their keyboard.</p>

<p>For developers, the post states they can deliver Credential Manager API requests through the inline autofill fallback UI or its dropdown menu. This is all done through the user&apos;s keyboard, as previously mentioned.</p><p>Google states it has now depreciated WebSettings (WebSQL) in Android WebView with Beta 3. These settings no longer appear in Chrome, either. Additionally, the company will look to turn the methods into a "no-op" on all Android software versions "in the next 12 months."</p><p>The update&apos;s rollout also encourages app developers to prepare their products, libraries, tools, and game engines for Android 15. Google hopes devs will prepare their apps for the new "FLAG_STOPPED" changes that ensure apps remain stopped until a user&apos;s manual input is detected. Support for 16KB pages, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/gmail-gets-predictive-back-feature-on-android-14">predictive back animations</a>, and support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">Private Spaces</a> are items to keep an eye on even if developers aren&apos;t yet targeting Android 15.</p><p>Android 15 Beta 3 is rolling out now to all enrolled testers and supported devices. Those with a Pixel phone can check which devices can join the testing environment <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">and get started</a>.</p><p>The last Android 15 beta update came via a minor patch labeled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-2-2-private-spaces-nfc-fixes">Beta 2.2</a> early in June. The original Beta 2 update was frustrating as enrolled testers quickly let Google know. Beta 2.2 continued to hammer away at some of those pesky problems plaguing Private Spaces and some devices&apos; NFC capabilities no longer functioning. Other problems regarding the app drawer and HDR were also targeted.</p><p>Google is right on time in reaching Platform Stability for its next major OS release in June. We should continue to get updates, most likely to iron out any problems until Beta 4 arrives in July. From there, we&apos;ll see where the road takes us.</p>

<ul><li>Augments are digital objects that can be placed in the real world, viewable through a Meta Quest 3 headset.</li><li>Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth said Augments went back to the drawing board back in January because they "weren't good enough."</li><li>Augments were originally supposed to come out this year but will likely launch next year instead.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>When Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg originally laid out the vision of the Meta Quest 3, it included plenty of mixed reality content. At the center of that vision was Augments, a series of digital items that could be placed in your home — on the walls, ceiling, floor, tables, or even floating in the air — that would encourage users to keep their headsets on for longer by giving them handy utilities and artwork to admire.</p><p>However, Meta CTO Andrew Bostoworth said on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/boztank/">June 17 Instagram AMA</a> that the feature didn&apos;t quite turn out the way it was originally envisioned, causing it to be sent back to the drawing board. Part of the problem, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/quest-3-augments-back-to-drawing-board-delay/">UploadVR</a> points out, is that the Augments feature was originally built upon Meta&apos;s Spark Studio platform but the Quest&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-ui-first-details">newest AR tools</a> are a far better fit for what Meta originally wanted to do with Augments.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TJgStPyZRwoUf5Xxeut2eV" name="meta-quest-3-augments-connect-2023.gif" alt="A demonstration of the Meta Quest 3's Augments feature at Meta Connect 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TJgStPyZRwoUf5Xxeut2eV.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Augments were first shown off at Meta Connect 2023, as seen in the GIF above, with Zuckerberg talking about how digital picture frames could be placed on the walls with Facebook picture feeds. Zuckerberg also talked about how a "mirror" could be setup in your workout space, letting you quickly start up Supernatural or one of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games/5">best exercise apps for Meta Quest</a> in a context-sensitive way.</p><p>Bosworth didn&apos;t give any hints as to what Augments might look like in its refashioned form, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-mysterious-new-ui-ad">latest Meta Quest ads</a> give us an idea of what to expect. Meta has been overhauling much of the operating system that runs the Quest experience, called Meta Horizon OS, as it looks to have companies like ASUS ROG and Xbox <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">launch their own VR headsets</a> with Meta&apos;s software.</p><p>We expect the original vision of Augments to remain in its final form when the feature eventually launches—likely next year—and could even transition to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">Meta&apos;s upcoming AR glasses</a> when that product launches in a few years.</p><p>Many of Meta&apos;s upgrades for the Quest, particularly the mixed reality feature, seem like they are being made in advance of better, more comfortable hardware that people would want to wear all day. Augments could be a huge paradigm shift in how people get their daily information instead of turning to smartphone apps.</p>

<p>Our favorite Android smartwatch on the market today, you can already score a whopping $81.99 discount on the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> when you buy from Walmart this week. This is the biggest straight discount that we've ever seen on the 40mm watch, and it's unlikely that the price will drop much further when Prime Day hits. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Rotating-Personalized/dp/B0C792QRW6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8ed3a146-75fc-4c96-b5b0-cbc168af7620" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 40mm: $299.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 40mm: $299.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>The Watch 6 and 6 Classic share all the same software tricks and hardware specs, except that the Classic is heavier thanks to the stylish stainless steel. So why upgrade? Aside from its "classic" look, this model brings back the rotating bezel for more exact physical controls, which we really enjoyed in our testing. Again, we've yet to see the price dip this low, so no reason to wait if you want one. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Classic-Stainless-Steel-Smartwatch-Bluetooth/dp/B0CCW95RBD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b90bebf9-6cb9-4e4c-a9b9-e6fbf26a1d0b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic 47mm: $429.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic 47mm: $429.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Perfect for folks with smaller wrists, the compact Garmin Vivoactive 4S boasts up to seven days of battery life on a single charge plus all of the health and fitness tracking features that you'd expect from a Garmin watch. If you can afford to spend a little more, we'd go for one of the models listed above; but if you're trying to stay under $200, nothing beats this offer from Amazon.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Smaller-Sized-Smartwatch-Monitoring/dp/B07W7W9DQQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="562d037f-43e3-417a-934a-b1adb8e884b3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Vivoactive 4S (GPS): $329.99" data-dimension48="Garmin Vivoactive 4S (GPS): $329.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>2021's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4 Classic</a> is also seeing an excellent $200 discount, thanks to the folks at Walmart.

<p>Still one of our <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">favorite Garmin watches</a> years after its initial launch, this watch has key fitness essentials like daily suggested workouts, recovery time, and intensity minutes, with two weeks or 20 GPS hours of battery life. The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-55-review">Forerunner 55</a> isn't a looker with its MIP display, but it's a proper starting point for first-time Garmin runners that won't break the bank or compromise on important features. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Running-Suggested-Workouts/dp/B092RH2NXJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="efba87d6-360e-48a7-8150-d1d349dd286c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Forerunner 55: $199" data-dimension48="Garmin Forerunner 55: $199">View Deal</a></p></div>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-prime-day-faq"><span>Prime Day FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="when-is-prime-day-2">When is Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Amazon has confirmed that Prime Day will occur sometime in July, but we don&apos;t have the exact dates just yet. That being said, the sale event typically happens around the middle of the month, so we can assume that will be the case again this year. We&apos;ll update this page once the dates are confirmed. In the meantime, there are plenty of offers currently available from Amazon and many of its biggest competitors, such as Best Buy and Walmart. </p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-find-the-best-smartwatch-deals-during-prime-day-2">How can I find the best smartwatch deals during Prime Day?</h2>
<p>If you&apos;re hoping to invest in some Android tech this Prime Day, we recommend keeping an eye on our site for the latest deals and news. For everything else, consider signing up for one of Amazon&apos;s newsletters or use a website like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/"><strong>Camelcamelcamel.com</strong></a> to see some live price tracking. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-an-amazon-prime-member-xa0-2">Do I have to be an Amazon Prime member? </h2>
<p>Prime Day was specifically designed to benefit paying Prime subscribers, so you&apos;ll need to be a member to enjoy the vast majority of deals during the sale. If you haven&apos;t signed up yet, it&apos;s worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon offers a 30-day free trial</strong></a> that lets you explore all of the benefits of a Prime subscription without paying a dime. After the 30 days wrap up, Prime memberships start at $14.99 per month.</p>
