<ul><li>Family Link is getting a design refresh, reorganizing the app into three pages: Screen Time, Controls, and Location.</li><li>School time will come to Android phones managed with Family Link starting next week.</li><li>Parent-managed controls will hit Family Link devices "in the coming months."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is refreshing the design of the Family Link app and bringing a few features introduced for kid-friendly Wear OS watches to Android phones, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/families/family-link-updates-february-2025/" target="_blank">announced</a> today, Feb. 12. The user-interface shakeup splits the Family Link for Android app into three main pages: Screen Time, Controls, and Location. The new look for Family Link is designed to make it easier for parents to manage multiple children and devices, Google explains.</p><p>With the fresh UI, the Screen Time page shows a breakdown of a child's device and app usage. Parents can also create or manage Downtime and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-school-time-parental-android-feature-detailed">School time restrictions</a> from this page. Basically, everything Screen Time related is now organized cleanly in one place, no matter how many devices or kids you have.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Controls page is the home for changing account data settings, approving app downloads, and blocking specific websites, according to the company. This includes individual options for managing a child's parental controls for YouTube, Google Search, and other apps or services. At the top of the screen, there's an oval that shows which child's profile you're currently viewing, which also lets you swipe between them.</p><p>Finally, the Location page is exactly what it sounds like — it's a map showing your child's last-updated location, device battery life, and cellular connection.</p>

<p>Google made waves when it introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">kid-friendly smartwatch</a>. More recently, it helped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-and-google-teamed-up-on-new-galaxy-watch-7-experience-for-kids">Samsung make the Galaxy Watch for Kids</a>. Both of these efforts helped make smartwatches available for children, and created new parental control options for parents.</p><p>One of those features is School time, which is a parental control option intended to reduce distractions from smartwatches during school hours. Now, Google is bringing that same feature to Android phones with Family Link starting next week. School time can be customized by parents to limit phone features, silence notifications, block certain apps, and report which apps kids are using while they're at school.</p><p>Additionally, the Galaxy Watch for Kids was the first Wear OS smartwatch to support parent-managed contacts. This feature will come to Android phones "in the coming months," which will let parents restrict calls and texts made by their child only to contacts they've approved.</p><p>School time and parent-managed contacts are the latest Family Link feature set to come to Android phones after starting on watches. Last year, Google announced plans to make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-for-kids-support-2025">Google Wallet available to kids</a> in a limited fashion.</p><p>If you're just learning about Family Link for the first time, we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-create-google-account-your-kid-through-family-link">the complete guide for how to get started here</a>.</p>

<ul><li>The Apple TV app is officially available on Android as of now, so Android users no longer have to use a browser to stream Apple TV Plus content.</li><li>Apple TV on Android uses Google Play Billing, so users can subscribe via the Google Play Store without needing an Apple device. This change also applies to the Android TV or Google TV apps.</li><li>The Apple TV app for Android is for accessing Apple TV Plus or MLS Season Pass; it can't be used to access purchased iTunes content.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Over five years after launching the Apple TV Plus streaming service, the company is finally bringing the Apple TV app to Android. Starting today, Feb. 12, users can download the Apple TV app from the Google Play Store and access the Apple TV Plus and MLS Season Pass subscription offerings. The move comes after Apple previously made an Apple TV app for the Android TV and Google TV platforms back in 2021.</p><p>The new Apple TV app will run on devices with Android 10 or newer installed, and that includes a mix of phones, tablets, and foldables. Unlike the Apple TV app on Apple devices, the Apple TV app for Android will not offer certain features, like access to iTunes content or Apple TV channels. Instead, this app focuses on Apple's streaming services.</p><p>The Android version of the app is built to be cross-platform, with features like "Continue Watching." You can start a show or movie on one device and pick up right where you left off on another, regardless of whether that's an Apple or Android device.  Additionally, users can plan out their streaming with a "Watchlist," and can download Apple TV Plus content to their Android device for offline watching.</p><p>Notably, Apple is now integrating with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/xbox-app-to-allow-purchases-gaming-following-google-court-ruling">Google Play Billing</a>. This means that Android users can sign up for Apple TV Plus on an Apple device or on the web, but they can also do so through the Google Play Store directly in the Android app. This is a first for Apple, as the Apple TV app for Android/Google TV did not support signing up for the streaming service in the app — until now.</p><p>Apple says the app is designed for Android, bringing a "familiar and intuitive interface," but there are some missing features that longtime Android users might miss. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast">Google Cast</a> isn't available at launch, so you can't cast a show from the Apple TV app on your Android phone to your Google TV, Nest, or Chromecast device. The company plans to build and improve the Apple TV app for Android over time, and Google Cast is the kind of feature that could be added in the future.</p><p>The two streaming services available on the Apple TV app for Android are Apple TV Plus (which includes Friday Night Baseball) and MLS Season Pass. Apple TV Plus costs $9.99 per month, and includes hit shows like <em>Severance</em> and <em>Ted Lasso</em>, as well as Friday Night Baseball — which airs two MLB games weekly during the regular season with no regional blackouts. There's also MLS Season Pass, the all-access streaming service for Major League Soccer, which costs $14.99 per month or $99 for the entire season.</p><p>Android users can download the Apple TV app from the Google Play Store starting now. This was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/news-weekly-october-12-2024">previously rumored back in October</a>, and of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-android-integrates-songshift-feature">the Apple Music app for Android</a> has been around for about a decade.</p><p>You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">try Apple TV Plus for free</a> for seven days.</p>

There is something for everyone, even if you're not interested in "just another glass slab."</p><p>These phones also come with an array of features and price points. If you want a good camera, you can have one. If you want something fast and able to play games, you can have it. If you want both, you can have that too. The choices seem endless and that's good for us all; we both get exactly what we want. There's something we both need, though, even if we didn't know we needed it: a battery that's easily replaced.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XxyfiGCNgNsQ2HTyRyJeVK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-12" alt="Battery activity results on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XxyfiGCNgNsQ2HTyRyJeVK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The batteries inside consumer electronics are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">disposable by design</a>. A battery that lasts a decade or longer could be built, but the costs would be astronomical, so almost everything you buy that's battery-powered comes with a battery that's disposable by design.</p><p>This is because today's "battery science" allows manufacturers to build a battery that's efficient and easy to charge while still being relatively cheap to make but doesn't have a very long lifespan. I'm not talking about the time between charges or your phone being able to last the full day on a single charge — I mean how long that battery is able to be charged and used.</p>
<p>Battery life is measured in charge cycles and not days or weeks, but you can say the battery inside a phone is designed to last about two years of normal use. Two years is forever in the tech world, and something bigger, stronger, and faster <em><strong>will</strong></em> come out by then, and you <em><strong>will</strong></em> want it. However, the rest of your phone is built to last a lot longer than two years. The life of a modern smartphone is dictated by how long a phone maker is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fairphone-2-receives-stable-android-10">willing to provide support</a> and how long the battery will last.</p><p>If Samsung (for example) would still offer software support and provide replacement batteries, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/do-you-think-galaxy-s10-still-worth-buying">Galaxy S10</a> could be a fantastic phone for a lot of people in 2025. But it does neither, so you've probably moved on by now.</p>
<p>I'm not picking on Samsung. They've actually made a huge advancement on this front with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S25,</a> and one of its best features that nobody (well, almost nobody — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/108201/galaxy-s25-ultra-teardown-quick-battery-fix-slow-progress-on-repairability" target="_blank">thanks, iFixit!</a>) talks about is how easy it is to replace the battery.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-t-change-it-but-someone-else-can-2">You can't change it but someone else can</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4EVadpV_ew" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>A phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> or even something more user-serviceable like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD Skyline</a> doesn't magically give you some super secret technician powers. You'll probably never tear your phone apart on the kitchen table and change its battery. That's fine; we're expected to be consumers and users, not field techs.</p><p>But there is always someone who can do it. Your local carrier store might have repair techs or maybe there is a shop at the local strip mall beside that Mongolian barbeque joint that fixes things like phones and PlayStations. Even a super complicated and difficult-to-repair phone can be serviced by someone determined and qualified.</p><p>This isn't a good option for most of us because of one thing: the cost. Spending $250 to fix an old phone seems dumb when you can buy a new one for $99 down and $20 a month in the eyes of most people. So when the battery in a phone that is otherwise good as new finally wears out, we just buy a new one.</p>
<p>This is a mindset that needs to change. I'm not suggesting that everyone thinks as I do — I used my old BlackBerry until I couldn't find parts for it on eBay because I'm cheap — but it's simply not disposable when something costs upwards of $1,000. Maintenance should be done so the product can continue to be used.</p>

<p>Think of changing the battery in your phone like an oil change for a car or truck. Older models were easy — turn a wrench to drain the old oil or pop off the back cover to remove an old battery and replace what needs to be replaced. Anyone can do it, and it only takes a few minutes.</p><p>Newer phones (and newer cars) require a bit more skill to service and you're likely to take them to someone else so it can be done right. The price you will pay for that service depends on how hard it is to perform; getting another two years of life from a product like a phone can be so expensive that we don't want to do it.</p>
<p>This is why products that have a serviceable battery inside are important, even 100% mainstream products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> of phones. You might not tear it apart on the coffee table, but knowing someone else can do it cheaply is one of the best features the S25 has to offer.</p>

<p>The upcoming OnePlus Watch 3 is tapped to last five days per charge, and while we don't know its price yet, you can bet it'll cost much less than the Apple or Galaxy Watch Ultra while lasting much longer. It's time for OnePlus to light a fire under some big-name toes.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-detailed-ahead-of-launch">OnePlus Watch 3</a> will officially launch on February 18 with some significant changes over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>: a new titanium bezel, a rotating crown that's functional instead of decorative, a faster and more efficient coprocessor, and an "optimized" GPS antenna.</p><p>What matters most is that OnePlus squeezed another day of battery life for standard use (120 vs. 100 hours) and heavy use (72 vs. 48 hours) from the same Snapdragon W5 processor within a year. Pretty impressive!</p><p>Its 631mAh capacity — a 131mAh generational boost — isn't that different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">Mobvoi TicWatch Enduro</a> and Atlas (628mAh), but those are both rated for 90 hours and use a very limited Essential mode to achieve extended battery life. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> aren't that far behind at 590mAh and 564mAh, respectively, but they only last 60 or 36 hours with typical use.</p><p>What trick did OnePlus use to pull off this gap? Most of the credit goes to the new battery tech that it recycled from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, but I think we should pay just as much attention to its new "BES2800" coprocessor — because it'll make or break the OnePlus Watch 3 experience. And I wonder if other brands will try to emulate OnePlus's method of success.</p>

<p>Any Wear OS watch will use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Wear OS Hybrid Interface</a>; it relegates low-power, background tasks like heart rate and notifications to the mobile coprocessing unit (MCU) to save battery life and leave the main, power-hungry cores dormant until they're needed for apps. But it was OnePlus that really harnessed that power on the OnePlus Watch 2 with its RTOS-running BES2700.</p><p>As effective as this system was for longevity, our reviewer found last year that this 12nm chipset seemed too slow to properly handle messages and sensor data with the same speed and reliability we're used to with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>.</p><p>With the Watch 3, the main SoC is unchanged for Wear OS tasks, but now we have a 6nm BES2800 that OnePlus says will "ensure an optimal balance between long battery life and intelligent functionality."</p><p>With great power, paradoxically, comes greater efficiency. We saw with last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> how it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-snapdragon-8-elite-doesnt-need-efficiency-cores-to-last-longer">didn't need efficiency cores</a> because higher-clocked chips can hit the same benchmarks with significantly less power.</p><p>Our OnePlus Watch 3 review will be the real test, but we can assume these background RTOS tasks will now run with better efficiency on a 6nm chip than on a 12nm one. The question is, will other brands follow suit? Most current Wear OS watches have 22nm MCUs, which feels well short of the mark. But hardware aside, I wonder if relying on RTOS for certain tasks is something other watch brands should emulate.</p>
<h2 id="extra-capacity-and-curious-lab-results-2">Extra capacity and curious lab results</h2>
<p>Smartwatches can only fit so much battery capacity before the design becomes too bulky for anyone to wear. That's why we've heard so much chatter recently about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/samsungs-game-changing-wearable-battery-life-upgrade-could-arrive-next-year-and-even-the-apple-watch-could-benefit">Samsung and Apple using solid-state batteries</a>: They can't increase capacity without turning off fans of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">skinny, pretty watches</a>, so they're biding their time for a denser battery with a higher Wh/L.</p><p>While they twiddle thumbs and wait for this unproven tech, OnePlus has stuck its mobile Silicon NanoStack Battery into its watch. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon</a> or standard lithium-ion battery shares the same cathode, but the former mixes silicon and graphite for the anode, making these batteries more dense and resilient against extreme weather conditions.</p><p>A 22% capacity boost is nothing to sneeze at, but even without a spec sheet, we can assume the OnePlus Watch 3 will be heavy. One of our Watch 2 complaints was the absence of a smaller, lighter model, and it doesn't seem like that's changed here.</p><p>Wearing a Watch 3 won't be for the small-wristed, and it's fair to ask how far its battery would go with the halved capacity as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3 41mm</a> (306mAh) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 40mm</a> (300mAh).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TxCrE5NDybCNSrfW872aV7" name="OnePlus-Watch-2-vs-Google-Pixel-Watch-2-wearing-01.jpg" alt="The OnePlus Watch 2 and Pixel Watch 2 worn on left and right wrists" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TxCrE5NDybCNSrfW872aV7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Bigger watch = more room for a bigger battery </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's also fair to point out that OnePlus's five-day estimate has some odd caveats. The laboratory conditions had the tester only getting 6.5 hours of sleep per day, streaming music to earbuds for 15 minutes, taking one five-minute call per day, and only using watch apps for about 20 minutes per day. And it assumes the phone-watch Bluetooth connection will be disabled for 10 hours a day, for some reason.</p><p>Even the "heavy use" scenario keeps the GPS workouts, music streaming, phone calls, and other applications fairly short and limited. For comparison, the Apple Watch Ultra 2's official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/watch/battery/">36-hour estimate</a> includes 8 hours of LTE connection, double the GPS and music streaming and more clock checks. It feels less like they were stretching the battery life for marketing purposes.</p><p>Still, it doesn't <em>really</em> matter to me if the OnePlus Watch 3 perfectly hits five days or loses a day or two with real-world activity. What matters more is having that leeway built in, counterbalancing the inevitable loss of capacity you see on watches after a couple of years.</p>

<p>Last year was already a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-2024-retrospective">strong year for Wear OS</a> because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> put a big emphasis on battery life efficiency with current hardware. But 2025 could be even more significant because it's the year we may finally get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new Snapdragon Wear chip</a>.</p><p>Qualcomm's VP of wearables said the company's objective is to aim for "a week's worth of battery life" using Snapdragon chips. He further suggested that a combination of custom cores and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-is-risc-v">RISC-V software</a> could help Android watches trend in that direction.</p><p>But even before this paradigm shift, OnePlus is pushing the current Snapdragon hardware as far as it can go, and I think that other brands will take more notice than you might think.</p>
<p>OnePlus doesn't really compete with most other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> brands in North America and Europe; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP52895124">IDC's latest report</a> shows a vast majority of OnePlus & OPPO watches were sold in China. But it still hit nearly 8 million sold in three months, only a few million short of Samsung.</p><p>Apple Watches have a big Chinese market presence, but they've fallen short of Huawei and have Xiaomi and Oppo/OnePlus chasing them from behind. Even if Apple has a complacent stranglehold on the U.S. market, it can't stand pat with its 18-hour battery life if its Chinese rivals start making this look totally inadequate.</p><p>And if Apple makes a battery life push, Samsung (and its partner Google) will focus on keeping its lead and making Android watches sound superior on paper, even if they fall short in sales.</p><p>That's why, even if the OnePlus Watch 3 — and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/oppo-details-watch-x2-big-display-leap-for-oneplus-watch-3_id167501">OPPO Watch X2</a>, its sibling/clone with near-identical specs — feel like niche products here, I predict that they'll kick off a smartwatch arms race (pun intended) and nudge the bigger brands out of their battery life complacency. None of them want to look deficient and behind the times.</p>

<ul><li>iFixit posted a complete teardown of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which showcased the ease users would find repairing/replacing its battery.</li><li>The video extends credit to the phone's triple camera array as Samsung provided multiple modules, meaning each lens can be repaired separately.</li><li>Despite the phone receiving a fair score, the difficulties concerning its screen repairability are striking.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's latest Galaxy S Ultra model is taken apart in an iFixit video to determine its level of repairability.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4EVadpV_ew&ab_channel=iFixit">posted a video</a> of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra's</a> repairability, which showcased a few notable surprises. To begin, iFixit started by removing the back panel. According to iFixit, Samsung recommends that users conducting self-repair or other business apply heat before doing so. However, the back panel was removed using a strong clamp tool — though heat would likely make it much easier, per the video.</p><p>The teardown commends Samsung's efforts at improving the repairability of its battery as users won't have to grapple with auxiliary tools to remove it. The battery is held in place by four, sticky pull tabs. After those are removed, the battery literally "falls out."</p><p>Next is the slightly redesigned triple camera array. This received high marks due to Samsung's usage of "multiple modules" for the trio. iFixit states that if one camera becomes damaged, a repair center can fix it without having to chuck it away and redo the entire set.</p><p>Overall, the Galaxy S25 Ultra received a fair score of 5 out of 10 on iFixit's repairability scale. The video specifically notes the difficulties around removing the Galaxy S25 Ultra's OLED display, which comes with a warning: don't remove it "unless it's already broken."</p><p>You watch iFixit's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4EVadpV_ew&ab_channel=iFixit">complete teardown</a> of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which goes in-depth about the internal changes to the S Pen and other repairable features.</p>

<p>On a related note, the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-more-repairable-but-iphone-16-pro-wins/">Android Police</a> highlighted iFixit's statement, which calls the S25 Ultra the "most repair-friendly" Galaxy phone. Despite it being the most "friendly," there are clearly some issues Samsung needs to fix. Moreover, the publication also notes that while the Galaxy S25 Ultra improved in some areas, it still falls short of the 7 out of 10 score iFixit gave the iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p>Shortly after the S24 Ultra launched last year, PBKReviews <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pbkreviews-teardown-for-samsung-galaxy-s24">conducted its teardown</a> of the device. While different places have different opinions, PBK gave the past-gen Ultra a 9 out of 10 repairability score. That video specifically highlighted Samsung's usage of pull tabs for the battery and how "easy" it is to access its screen and charging port for repairs.</p><p>Curiously though, PBK did state how difficult it was to remove the display "without damaging it." The teardown didn't appear to apply heat and only utilized a clamp tool with several other tools wedged beneath the screen to lift it.</p><p>It's worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-samsung-partnership-concludes">iFixit cut ties with Samsung</a> last spring as its repairability goals were misaligned. Much like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, iFixit highlighted how Samsung's products are "too glued together," which made it hard for the former to deliver the parts home repair consumers would need without a price spike.</p><p>iFixit made it clear that it would still attempt to obtain Galaxy product parts when it could; however, guides for home repair will no longer be made.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has reportedly pushed a quiet update for Maps, bringing a few more road safety alert options.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-maps-adding-more-options-for-reporting-road-incidents/">Android Police</a> spotted the latest Maps alerts, involving road or roadside dangers caused by the weather. Specifically, the publication discovered four new options in Maps when reporting "incidents." Those choices are: low visibility, unplowed road, flooded road, and "object on road."</p><p>Each option deals with a particular weather occurrence, such as thick early morning fog, torrential rainfall, and the after-effects of a snowstorm. However, the "object on road" choice could help drivers point out more than just a downed tree branch following a storm. Users could use it to report items that could puncture their tire and more to keep their fellow drivers safe.</p><p>While the post points out that these four options have joined the broader "report and accident" menu on Android Auto, it's not everywhere yet. It seems as though Maps is getting this in waves, giving drivers the options first.</p><p>The post claims the reporting options haven't appeared properly on Android devices, yet users on iOS are supposedly "slowly" receiving them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:833px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.03%;"><img id="32JcKx8vkLoRrMNLsg4knD" name="google-maps-weather-related-incident-report-added" alt="Google Maps has reportedly added four new incident report options for weather-related hazards on Android Auto." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/32JcKx8vkLoRrMNLsg4knD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="833" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Police)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reporting-wise, Google has dropped a couple of updates for Maps to improve the experience, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-it-easier-to-report-police-spottings-in-maps">like one for police</a>. In November, Maps refined the way users could report police activity. The incident report was previously classified as "speed trap;" however, Google renamed it "police" to generalize all roadside activity. The app on Android Auto now conveniently features the "police" option at the top of the incident list, beside "crash," "slowdown," and "construction."</p><p>More importantly, Google and Waze joined forces last summer to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-is-making-your-commute-less-sucky-with-new-traffic-and-parking-helpers">share incident reports</a> for drivers. The collaboration <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-is-getting-smarter-with-wazes-help">appeared more widely</a> for drivers in December. If shared from Waze, users will see the alert appear on their in-dash display with a tag confirming where it's from. Users can "confirm" the report, giving it some street cred when others see a report of police activity or a roadside hazard.</p><p>Google hasn't forgotten its Android phones as Maps rolled out an update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-new-update-helps-you-plan-your-holidays-and-skip-the-crowds">for weather-related delays</a> last fall. Users traveling — at any point in time — can take advantage of how the weather could impact their travels and the city's local transit systems.</p>

<p>Users tuning into YouTube TV's live channels are noticing a few notable offerings are missing, but it looks like the company is on it.</p><p>A Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/thread/324513108">community manager</a> highlighted several of YouTube TV's usual free channel providers are suffering issues on the platform (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/12/youtube-tv-outage-cbs-cw-telemundo-fix/">9to5Google</a>).

<p>Hopefully, these issues will be corrected soon as YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-wants-to-use-machine-learning-to-figure-out-whos-lying-about-their-age">laid out its plans</a> to continue its TV presence in a recent blog post. The platform turned 20 years old and to celebrate, it detailed what's next for 2025. YouTube highlighted that TVs have become the primary way users interact with the platform and view content.</p><p>Elsewhere, YouTube talked about its "big bets" for the year, which include "algorithmically" estimating a user's age on the platform. The platform already includes several safety rails for managing a user's age to avoid seeing unwanted content. Parents can also deploy a few parental controls to help keep things within a comfortable scope.</p><p>YouTube did not elaborate <em>on </em>its plan to do this, but we will likely see the results later this year.</p>

<p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phone-under-100">$100 Android phone</a> might sound too good to be true, but that's exactly what the NUU N10 is. This impossibly cheap phone comes with Android 14 and Gemini baked in, plus it has zero bloatware. I was offered the opportunity to test the device, and I thought, how bad could it possibly be? Only one way to find out — by using it.</p><p>Thus, use it I did.</p><p>I was fully prepared for an entirely abhorrent experience with the NUU N10. When a company refuses to disclose the name of the phone's processor, one can only assume they are ashamed of it. But the spec sheet isn't all trash, and even a no-name 1.6GHz octa-core processor can perform well enough.</p><p>Throughout my testing, I felt the need to periodically remind myself that this phone costs just $100. It mitigated a lot of my harsh judgment because, really, how much can (or should) you expect for that amount of money?</p>

<p>Put the price tag aside for a few seconds, and hear me out. The NUU N10 comes with some generous screen real estate, boasting a large 6.6-inch IPS LCD screen with an HD+ resolution and a 90Hz refresh rate. A higher screen refresh rate really helps improve the snappiness of the phone, even if it's not the sharpest tool in the shed.</p><p>The body of the phone has a nice weightiness to it and the soft matte back paired with the silver metal frame looks modern and attractive. Unfortunately, the rear is very obviously made of plastic and feels uncomfortably flimsy. There's no in-screen fingerprint reader, but that's fine because the side-mounted one inside the power button works wonderfully well.</p><p>Accompanying the N10's mammoth 5,000mAh battery supports 18W USB-C fast charging, with a Type-A-to-C cable and a 10W power brick in the box. The 3.5mm headphone jack, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot for expanding the 128GB onboard storage, and dual SIM slots are a nice touch, seeing as most flagship phones ditched this golden trio several generations ago.</p><p>NUU tied it all together by providing everything a user could need in the box, starting from basics like a cable and SIM card removal tool to extras like a phone case and power adapter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jviuYJc5pFi6VQfC2ycwbd" name="NUU N10" alt="NUU N10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jviuYJc5pFi6VQfC2ycwbd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike past NUU models, the N10 favors the full-fledged Android 14 over the lighter Android Go version of the OS, probably because it has 4GB of RAM, which can be extended to 8GB by using local storage via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">virtual RAM</a>.</p><p>It's not much, but NUU promises one year of software updates for all of its phones. As mentioned earlier, the phone comes with absolutely no bloatware pre-installed, nor does it have ads. Overall, the stock <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> experience is very neat and clean.</p><p>Frills such as water or dust resistance IP ratings and support for CDMA carriers are missing here. You can still use the NUU N10 on GSM carriers like T-Mobile and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNOs like Mint Mobile or Tello</a>.</p>

<p>Let's be real; it's practically impossible for something this affordable to be an all-rounder. NUU would have to lose money for that to happen. So, while there are many winning characteristics of the N10, there's a lot to feel icky about as well.</p><p>Plastic body aside, the display just doesn't get bright enough. You'll really struggle with outdoor usage, especially in the daytime with the sun shining mightily.</p><p>Then there's the speaker setup, which defies common sense. The NUU N10 has bottom-firing speakers that sound awful, with warbled audio that is almost completely muffled by the user's hand when in landscape orientation.</p><p>The mic doesn't yield any better results either, failing to capture the full range of vocals but somehow picking up background noises and occasional echoes.</p><p>I could have forgiven all these crimes to a certain extent, but it's crazy that the NUU N10 only comes with one 13MP primary camera and a useless 2MP macro lens. The main lens is godawful at its job.</p>

<p>The so-called "AI" camera does nothing for picture quality, which is lacking in detail, depth, and color balance. Forget about capturing shots in the spur of the moment because the N10's camera gives you blurry shots even if you blink too aggressively. The 5MP front camera isn't any better either, with a poorly functional face unlock.</p>

<p>NUU incorporated extensive parental controls into the N10, making this phone ideal for tweens or teenagers. Since the phone doesn't cost much, the appeal is much higher for younger audiences who can't afford more expensive devices or aren't allowed to have premium phones.</p><p>Considering the price and build quality, the NUU N10 is an ideal starter phone for kids. If it breaks, it won't hurt their guardians much as the investment is so low to begin with. The parental controls add a layer of reassurance. And with no heavy-duty bloatware installed, the device runs well enough for children to use on the daily without getting stuck or hanging.</p><p>For the longest time, I couldn't imagine any brand other than Xiaomi when considering such a tight budget. And let's be honest, the only reason why Xiaomi is able to sell you a decked-out cheap phone is because it comes chock-full of clunky bloatware and ads. It's a marvel how little this phone costs despite having none of those things.</p><p>The long and the short of it is that this is an inexpensive Android phone with no creature comforts. It doesn't immediately look cheap, but it certainly feels like it to a certain extent. The lackluster audio gear exhibits cost-effective traits as well. Nevertheless, the NUU N10 is one of the few $100 Android phones that can be used without ripping all the hair off your head. If you're in a pinch, it'll do.</p>

Last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x6-pro-review">X6 Pro</a> combined great hardware with an unbeatable value, and POCO is doing the same with the X7 Pro. The phone has a brighter AMOLED panel, better camera at the back, and a massive battery — the Indian model has a 6500mAh unit. <br><br>Interestingly, POCO partnered with Marvel to launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-is-the-poco-x7-pro-iron-man-edition">Iron Man edition</a> of the X7 Pro, and it looks incredible. It's exciting to see budget phones get limited-edition variants, and it adds a level of exclusivity to the X7 Pro that you don't usually see in this category. <br><br>POCO is doing all the right things with ingress protection, and the X7 Pro gets IP68 as standard. Like previous years, value is a big differentiator, and the X7 Pro manages to undercut its rivals once again. I used the device for just over two weeks, and I'm convinced this is one of the best budget phones around.</p>

<p>Xiaomi unveiled the POCO X7 and X7 Pro on January 9, and both phones are now available in select global regions. The standard X7 has a dual-curved design and is powered by the Dimensity 7300, but it has the same cameras as the X7 Pro. The main difference is a smaller 5110mAh battery (5500mAh in India), and it costs ₹21,999 ($253) for the 8GB/128GB variant. There's also an 8GB/256GB model that costs ₹23,999 ($276) in India and £199 ($247) in the U.K. Xiaomi is selling a 12GB/512GB edition of the POCO X7 in the U.K., and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Xiaomi-X7-Pro-smartphone-HyperCharge/dp/B0DKP4M9DS">going for £249</a> ($310) as of writing. <br><br>The POCO X7 Pro, meanwhile, is powered by the Dimensity 8400 platform, and it has a 6000mAh battery. POCO has a dedicated variant in India with a massive 6550mAh battery, and the device starts at ₹27,999 ($322) for the 8GB/256GB variant in the country and £269 ($335) in the U.K. There's also a 12GB/256GB model that costs ₹29,999 ($346) in India, and the U.K. gets a 12GB/512GB model that's selling at £309 ($384). <br><br>I'm using the Iron Man edition of the X7 Pro, and it comes in a single 12GB/512GB configuration. This model is limited to select Southeast Asian countries, where it costs the equivalent of $399.</p>


<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-x7-pro-design"><span>POCO X7 Pro: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2692px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.87%;"><img id="JY3oEHpUH2UrAvYs2jYutP" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JY3oEHpUH2UrAvYs2jYutP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2692" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO overhauled the design of the X series this year, and the X7 and X7 Pro look quite different to their predecessors. Interestingly, the standard X7 retains the dual-curved design and ends up looking like the costlier option, with the X7 Pro switching to a boxy profile with flat sides.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="i4pRiRZtz6hpAUgA5cP62Q" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i4pRiRZtz6hpAUgA5cP62Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the X7 Pro has beveled sides, so it isn't uncomfortable to hold the device. And even though it has a sizeable 6000mAh battery, it comes in at an easily manageable 195g. That's because it features a polycarbonate mid-frame as well as a plastic back, but you don't quite get the feeling that you're using a budget phone — POCO did a good job with the basics.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="USbbCP9mhFPjU6TvSchP2Q" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/USbbCP9mhFPjU6TvSchP2Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the sides have a matte texture, and the coating extends to the back as well. The Iron Man edition has a custom etched design at the back that highlights Iron Man's helmet, and it is pretty distinctive. The regular variants just get a matte texture at the back, and POCO has a yellow model with a leather back this time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="htiw7ZTxVx8dUVi8ydkVsP" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/htiw7ZTxVx8dUVi8ydkVsP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera island looks cleaner this year as POCO is using just two cameras at the back, and it doesn't dominate attention at the back. It doesn't jut out considerably from the body, and while there is a little wobble when using the phone, a case mitigates the issue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dwpcCrK29NTswS4ibD7VvP" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dwpcCrK29NTswS4ibD7VvP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get red accents around the camera lenses at the back and the power button, and it gives the design a little added flair. Other niceties include an IR blaster, and IP68 ingress protection. It's great to see POCO delivering the same standard of dust and water resistance as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review">Xiaomi 14T</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">14 Ultra</a> on budget phones, and the Indian model even gets IP69 — just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PFvpVa5HzNf6M4ye7BjDrP" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PFvpVa5HzNf6M4ye7BjDrP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no problems with usability on the X7 Pro. Xiaomi did a great job with the design of the phone, and the matte texture combined with a relatively light chassis makes holding and using the phone that much more comfortable.</p>

<p>POCO is using the same 6.67-inch AMOLED panel as last year, but it has better brightness — it now goes up to 1400 nits in HBM mode and 3200 nits when viewing HDR content. There is a noticeable difference when viewing the panel next to the X6 Pro, and it gets brighter in outdoor use. The panel is covered by Gorilla Glass 7i, and like all POCO phones, you get a screen protection installed out of the box.</p>

<p>It isn't the brightest screen around — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-14-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 14 Pro+</a> gets brighter — but I didn't see any issues using the device outdoors, and it has good color rendition and contrast levels. You get 120Hz refresh, but you'll have to go into the settings to enable the mode, and there's Dolby Vision integration. You get a decent amount of customizability when it comes to adjusting the color balance, and a good selection of always-on styles.</p>

<p>The X7 Pro does a great job with HDR content in the likes of Netflix and YouTube, and it holds up well during gaming. I would have liked increased brightness in regular use, but as it stands, this is still one of the best AMOLED panels around in the budget category. You even get 1920Hz PWM dimming,</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GFF75kJu4VPK6Sh9mFCorP" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GFF75kJu4VPK6Sh9mFCorP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO knows how to deliver great hardware on a budget, and the X7 Pro continues that trend. The device is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 8400 Ultra, and just like the Dimensity 9400, it only has big cores — you get a Cortex A725 running at 3.25GHz, three Cortex A725 cores at 3.0GHz, and four A725 cores going up to 2.1GHz. Also included is a Mali-G720 GPU with seven cores, and it manages to do a terrific job. <br><br>Basically, the X7 Pro is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best budget phone</a> around in this regard, and if you need a gaming-focused device that doesn't cost a lot of cash, this is the one to get. The phone blazes through mundane tasks, and it manages to hold its own in demanding titles as well; while you don't quite get the same stable framerates as high-end devices, it does a better job than most other budget phones available today.</p>

<p>I didn't notice any lag or stutter either, and the device has been a delight to use. There are no issues with connectivity either, and while the vibration motor doesn't have granular feedback, it is decent enough. You get AptX HD codecs and NFC as well, and that is a nice bonus. <br><br>Coming to the battery side of things, I got well over a day's worth of use with the X7 Pro. I'm using the model with the 6000mAh battery, and users in India should get even better battery life thanks to the oversized 6500mAh unit in the region. The battery doesn't last as long as other phones with 6000mAh cells like the X200 Pro, but I still got a day's worth of use consistently, and there was never any battery anxiety. <br><br>Charging the battery takes 46 minutes using the bundled 90W charger, and annoyingly, POCO doesn't include the charger in all countries. My device came with the charger included in the package, but that isn't the case in the U.K. and other western markets.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-x7-pro-cameras"><span>POCO X7 Pro: Cameras</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MEaTgeks5HP7pPiHx64bDQ" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MEaTgeks5HP7pPiHx64bDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO's phones don't have the best cameras, and the X7 Pro is aiming to do better on that front. The device gets a 50MP main camera with Sony's IMX882 imaging module, and it's joined by an 8MP wide-angle lens. There's no 2MP lens at the back, and that's a good thing — it was one of the most pointless sensors ever fitted to a phone. <br><br>The camera interface is identical to last year, so you get the same shooting modes, same effects and filters, and the same toggles around the viewfinder. You finally get the ability to shoot 4K60 video via the rear camera, and it's a much-needed inclusion. It is limited to the main lens — the wide-angle only goes up to 1080p — but it's a good addition nonetheless.</p>

<p>The phone takes decent shots in daylight conditions, producing photos with good dynamic range and colors. It does a good job in low-light scenarios as well, and while you don't get quite as much detail, there isn't much in the way of noise. The wide-angle lens is average, and while it takes passable photos in good lighting situations, it doesn't manage to deliver the same caliber of shots at night. <br><br>The camera is better than previous years, but it still isn't the best in this category. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-review">Nord 4</a> takes better photos in just about any situation, so if you need a good set of cameras at the back, you should pick up that device instead. If you're okay with average cameras and need a phone with powerful hardware, the X7 Pro gets my recommendation.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-x7-pro-software"><span>POCO X7 Pro: Software</span></h3>

<p>Software continues to be an area where POCO's devices have a definite edge over their Redmi siblings; the X7 Pro runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and it comes with the usual slate of AI-assisted features. The software interface will be familiar if you've used a Xiaomi or POCO phone in recent years, and while there aren't any visual changes, you get better fluidity. <br><br>I still believe that Xiaomi is in need of a visual overhaul, and it needs to do something about the bloatware on its devices. Other than that, I don't have any negatives on the software front; the Iron Man edition has a few custom extras — including icons and backgrounds — but it has the same feature-set as the standard X7 Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2DSPyjtuoC8oCH6vxQsq7Q" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2DSPyjtuoC8oCH6vxQsq7Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi tends to be overly aggressive with memory management, and there were instances where I had issues receiving push notifications. This is an issue on most Xiaomi phones I use, and I get around it by disabling any battery-related tweaks. <br><br>The X7 Pro will get three guaranteed Android updates alongside four years of security updates, and that is decent enough in this category. That said, Xiaomi doesn't do a good job delivering updates on time, so when updates will actually make their way to the device is an unknown — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> is unlikely to be rolled out anytime before the end of the year.</p>

<p>I really like the OnePlus Nord 4, and the device continues to be a good choice in 2025. It has similar caliber of hardware, and holds up incredibly well during gaming. The design is cleaner, but you get a smaller 5500mAh battery. Coming in at ₹28,999 ($335), it is costlier than the X7 Pro, but it is a solid alternative. <br><br><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO's F6</a> is also a good recommendation if you need a gaming-focused device. It outmatches the X7 Pro in this regard, and as it has been around for the better part of a year, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/poco-f6-5g-titanium-256-gb/p/itme731d9a334947?pid=MOBHYUZGDMF7UJMG">down to just ₹26,999</a> ($312), making it a terrific bargain. It has better cameras than the X7 Pro as well, but it has a relatively smaller 5000mAh battery.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a budget phone that feels great to hold and use</li><li>You want a battery that easily lasts a day</li><li>You need good performance</li><li>You want reliable ingress protection</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a budget phone with great cameras</li></ul>
<p>POCO didn't change the fundamentals too much with the X7 Pro, and that's a good thing. The phone continues to be one of the fastest in the budget category, and you get a vibrant AMOLED panel, standout battery life, and fast charging. The cameras aren't the best around, but the main camera does a decent job in its own right. <br><br>There's a lot to like with the software, and the fact that you get Android 15 out of the box gives the X7 Pro a distinct advantage over the Redmi Note 14 Pro+. The only negative is that the model sold in the U.K. and other western markets isn't as good as the Indian variant, but outside of that, the X7 Pro is a terrific budget phone. As an overall package, there are few devices that manage to come close.</p>

<p>Motorola makes some of the most value-for-money Android phones and is always pushing the expectations envelope across price segments. Sure, it has a few misses now and then, but by and large, we have generally gotten good products. Its Moto G series has been globally acclaimed for delivering exceptional value in the budget segment, and that continues with the latest Moto G Power 2025.</p><p>Priced the same as the Moto G Power 5G 2024, the new model offers an updated design, better shatter protection for the display, and a truly impressive IP69 rating for ultimate dust and water resistance. This makes it a no-brainer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300">under $300</a>, but the 2024 model is now heavily discounted, which makes it good value too. If you're unable to decide between Moto G Power 202 vs. Moto G Power 5G 2024, we're here to help.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-power-2025-vs-moto-g-power-5g-2024-design-and-display-2">Moto G Power 2025 vs. Moto G Power 5G 2024: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jysoQN7LxmCLMCJAskjzuf" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-Slate-Gray-lifestyle" alt="The Moto G Power 2025 face down on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jysoQN7LxmCLMCJAskjzuf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1778" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola has dropped the 5G moniker from the name, so it's just the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch">Moto G Power 2025</a>. It has a similar vegan leather material for the back panel as the previous model, so it should be comfortable to hold, and fingerprints should be a non-issue. It has gotten a bit fatter at 8.7mm and a tad heavier at 208g when compared to the 2024 model. The new rear camera housing with four exposed rings makes it look more premium, as the design is similar to the Moto Edge series.</p><p>The two big changes to the design are the addition of Gorilla Glass 5 for the display and the new durability certifications. The display is still an IPS LCD panel but a bit larger at 6.8 inches. You still get the 120Hz refresh rate. We hope Motorola has increased the maximum brightness in the Moto G Power 2025 as the previous model wasn't the easiest to use outdoors, under sunlight.</p><p>The big talking point, however, is the IP68/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> rating on the 2025 Moto G Power. Till now, we've only seen this on a few flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 13</a>, so to have it on a $300 phone is mighty impressive. Motorola has also boosted its durability by padding it with a MIL-STD-810H certification for toughness. The phone is available in Slate Gray and Leaf Green. The latter shade gives the phone a unique look and is something I'd pick if I were using it without a case.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G Power 5G 2024</a> is a tiny bit slimmer and lighter and should offer a similar in-hand feel thanks to the vegan leather back. The frame is plastic but it doesn't really feel cheap or poorly put together. One thing we noted in our review is that the rear leather panel is prone to scuffing quite easily, which can make your week-old phone look a few months old if you're not careful.</p><p>The display has prominent bezels and a big chin, which screams budget. The 6.7-inch display has a 120Hz refresh rate and a Full HD+ resolution. We found it to be plenty sharp with good color reproduction for both games and regualar app usage. The brightness was the only main sore point here, as it was rather difficult to see outdoors when we reviewed it.</p>

<p>The Moto G Power 2025 is only available as a single variant with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for $299.99. Even though it's sold unlocked, it is compatible with all the major U.S. carriers. Eventually, you should be able to buy it via a carrier, too, at a heavily subsidized price. You don't get a charger in the box (some carriers might bundle one), so you'll have to buy one separately or choose from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">best USB-C chargers</a>.</p><p>The processor in the Moto G Power 2025 is the MediaTek Dimensity 6300, which feels like a downgrade to the Dimensity 7020, on paper anyway. Both are built on the 6nm process, but the 6300 has a higher maximum CPU clock speed of 2.4GHz, and it uses a different GPU. At the same time, the 7020 has a higher memory bandwidth. We'll know how much of an impact the new chip actually makes once we review the phone, but overall, I wouldn't expect much of a difference in daily usage.</p><p>The rest of the specs of the Moto G Power 2025 are similar to last year's model. There's expandable storage, NFC, stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and a 5,000mAh battery with 30W wired and 15W wireless charging. The camera setup also seems identical. You get a 50MP main sensor with an f/1.8 aperture and an 8MP ultrawide with autofocus, so it can be used as a macro camera. Selfie duties are handled by a 16MP sensor. The image quality of the 2024 Moto G Power was just about average, so I'm keen to know if Motorola has made any improvements here.</p>

<p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 also launched at the same $299.99 price in 2024 for 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. Motorola is now selling it at a heavily reduced price of $179.99, which makes it much better value compared to its original price.</p><p>It's powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7020, which <em>looks</em> a bit better on paper, and it delivers decent performance for casual games. Do anything more intensive, though, like try running any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-premium-android-games" target="_blank">premium Android game</a>, and the phone will start to choke. We found the battery life to be solid, lasting a full day even with heavy use. Lighter users should be able to go two to three days before thinking about charging it.</p><p>Connectivity features of the Moto G Power 5G 2024 are similar to the newer model, including the presence of NFC. The cameras are also the same, with a 50MP and 8MP rear sensors and a 16MP sensor in the front. The performance of the two rear cameras is strictly okay and good enough for casual use only.</p>

<p>The Moto G Power 2025 launched alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a>, which also runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> with Motorola's unobtrusive customizations. The software experience should be very similar which means you can expect the usual Moto Actions gestures like the double-chop to turn on the flashlight, double-twist of your wrist to open the camera, and so on. The Moto G is slated to get two OS updates and three years of security patches, which should also apply to the G Power.</p><p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 ran <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and Motorola has released the Android 15 update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en-us.support.motorola.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/184137/~/whats-new-in-android-15%3F---moto-g-power-5g---2024">changelog</a> for the phone too. However, it's hard to say if it will get anything beyond this. Motorola doesn't have the best track record when it comes to timely OS updates, even for its premium phones, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>If you already have a $300 budget, just get the Moto G Power 2025. It has the best water and dust-proof certification, bar none, in that segment. There's wireless charging, and you get a great-looking phone. It also comes with the latest Android version, two promised OS updates, and it's certified to survive falls and drops.</p><p>The only other alternative worth looking at is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">CMF Phone 1</a> by Nothing. For a lower price, you get an AMOLED screen, a customizable back panel, good cameras, and three years of promised updates. Be aware, though, that 5G coverage is a bit spotty in the U.S., and there's no wireless charging, IP rating, or NFC.</p><p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 wasn't easy to recommend at $300, but at its current $180 price, it's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200">best picks under $200</a>. I would argue that it's slightly better value than the new Moto G 2025 since it has an ultrawide camera and wireless charging.</p>

<ul><li>Galaxy S25 Edge leaks have been doing the rounds, with one suggesting that the phone will feature a battery smaller than the base Galaxy S25.</li><li>The device is likely to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, like the Galaxy S25, hinting at powerful AI features and software.</li><li>The phone will allegedly have a 200MP primary camera and a 50MP ultrawide lens.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Ever since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge was teased</a> at the recent Unpacked event, we've been waiting to learn more about the elusive device. The most recent leak comes from tipster Anthony/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_">@TheGalox_</a>, who took to X to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_/status/1888235427917672575?s=19">reveal</a> a spec list of the upcoming device that will likely appear in April this year.</p><p>According to Anthony, the phone will sport a 6.7-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED display with a refresh rate of 120Hz. The device will allegedly be 5.84mm thin, as indicated to us in a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/leak-reveals-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edges-thickness-and-battery-size" target="_blank"> previous leak</a>. The tipster goes on to say that the device will feature a fairly meager 3,900mAh battery and a vapor chamber cooling system within, which may be similar to the one featured with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><p>The rear panel of the device will apparently feature two powerful cameras: the 200MP primary sensor (which has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-slim-could-pack-a-serious-camera-punch-despite-its-thin-profile">previously rumored</a>) and a 50MP ultrawide lens, although there's no mention of the selfie/front-facing camera.</p><p>The phone is said to come with 12GB of RAM and two storage, either 256GB or 512GB. There's no mention of software, another post by avid tipster Yogesh Brar suggests that the phone will come packed with the new One UI 7 out of the box. As such, the phone will have all the AI quirks that will be featured in the Galaxy S25 series.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge- 6.6" dAMOLED, 120Hz display- Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC- 200MP + 50MP (UW)- IP68- OneUI 7- 3,900mAh battery- 25W charging<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1888844172905296347">February 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>However, both leaks have slightly conflicting details about the device's dimensions. This one mentions that it will have a slightly smaller 6.6" display. Brar also adds that the Galaxy S25 Edge will come with an IP68 dust and water resistance certification, similar to the Galaxy S25 series. While the battery specs seem to be the same on both leaks, Brar adds that the device will support 25W charging, with no mention of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">compatibility with Qi2</a>.</p><p>While we don't have much information on how many colorways this phone will launch with, Anthony says that it will cost around $1100, meaning it will sit somewhere between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>While these leaks paint a slightly clearer picture of what we could expect from this phone, there are still some grey areas that have been left to people's imagination, particularly given potential compromises in the name of thinness. Will this device be able to remain off a charger, given its battery capacity, higher-resolution display, and powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chip?</p><p>Android Central senior editor Jerry Hildenbrand was already feeling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-slim-if-its-real-who-asked-for-this">less enthusiastic about the Galaxy S25 Edge's capabilities</a> before Samsung teased the device. Similarly, managing editor Derrek Lee feels as though the move is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-reveal-feels-desperate">desperate attempt by Samsung</a> to appear interesting again. Regardless, we anticipate to know more about the phone closer to the device's official release.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube">YouTube</a> turns 20 this year, and while the platform is two-decades old, many of its users are much younger. To celebrate the anniversary, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan outlined the platform's "big bets" for 2025 in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/our-big-bets-for-2025/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, and they involve clamping down on younger users lying about their age.</p><p>"We’re also laser focused on protecting our youngest users," the company says. "And that's why we'll use machine learning in 2025 to help us estimate a user’s age — distinguishing between younger viewers and adults — to help provide the best and most age appropriate experiences and protections."</p><p>It's unclear exactly how YouTube plans to algorithmically estimate the age of its users, but it comes as age verification and requirements for social media platforms becomes a hot topic in the U.S. and abroad. YouTube already offers certain protections for younger users, and parental controls for parents. The platform's official age requirement for individual accounts is 13 years, but younger kids can use the YouTube Kids app with help from a parent.</p><p>Separately, YouTube wants to make the platform better for education by building new ways to learn about topics shown in a video and creating a mechanism for YouTubers to build courses.</p><p>Age verification and protections are just the start of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/made-by-youtube-2024-ai-hype-updates">how YouTube plans to use AI and machine learning to grow</a> and safeguard the platform in 2025. It's also working on protections against deepfakes on the platform, so creators can control how AI portrays them on YouTube. It's starting out with a pilot program for prominent people, but theoretically could grow beyond that in the future.</p><p>It could become expanded, like YouTube plans to expand auto-dubbing after a small test last year. YouTube says it will soon make auto-dubbing, which automatically translates content to other languages with one press, available to everyone in the YouTube Partner Program.</p><p>Of course, YouTube is very confident in its place in social media and pop culture as 2025 begins. It says YouTube "will remain the epicenter of culture," and is doubling-down on TV. To that end, YouTube says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-fantasy-custom-multiview-nfl-sunday-ticket">TV is now the primary device type for watching YouTube</a>, even ahead of mobile.</p><p>"It's remarkable to think that YouTube has been helping people create, learn, connect and more for two decades," Mohan writes. "As we embark on our next chapter, we're committed to empowering creators, fostering community, and continuing to redefine how the world watches, listens, and connects."</p>

<p>The Gulf of Mexico is now the Gulf of America on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a>, at least in the U.S. The body of water bordering the southeastern North American coast will now appear differently on Google Maps depending on a user's location, following a change that is rolling out now.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-to-adopt-gulf-of-america-rename">Google announced weeks ago</a>, the company said it has "a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources," and thus planned to rename the Gulf of Mexico when the U.S. officially completed its name change. That process has been completed, as the Gulf of America is the new name for this body of water in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edits.nationalmap.gov/apps/gaz-domestic/public/search/names/558730" target="_blank">U.S. Geographic Names Information System</a>.</p><p>The move is only indirectly related to President Donald Trump's executive order issuing the name change. This is why the renaming is taking effect on Google Maps now, not when the executive order was first issued. Instead, the reason for the name change in the U.S. is because the U.S. Department of the Interior officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edits.nationalmap.gov/apps/gaz-domestic/public/search/names/558730" target="_blank">updated the Gulf of Mexico's name in the GNIS by Order 3423</a> issued by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.</p><p>Of course, the controversial renaming of the Gulf of Mexico was directed by President Trump. The resulting effect on Google Maps is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>United States users will see the name "Gulf of America"</li><li>Mexico users will see the name "Gulf of Mexico"</li><li>Users in all other regions will see both names</li></ul>
<p>"The names you see in the Maps app are based on your country location, which is determined by information from your phone’s operating system (e.g., iOS and Android), including your SIM, network, and locale," Google explains. "If you’re using Google Maps on the web, the names are based on the region you select in your Search settings or your device’s location, if you haven’t selected one."</p><p>Based on these conditions, it is virtually impossible to change the Google Maps name of the Gulf of Mexico/Gulf of America to your preference manually.</p>

Unfortunately, the stock Android multitasking UI, known as Overview, leaves a lot to be desired, meaning phones that opt for this interface simply don't multitask as well as others.</p>

<p>Much of this frustration started for me when the Android team redesigned the multitasking UI during the Android 9 Pie update. Instead of the vertically-scrolling card interface that showed four or five apps at a time, Google's design team opted to follow the old Palm Pre model of large, horizontally scrolling cards — something that isn't very surprising given the head designer of Android was also on the Palm WebOS team.</p><p>This new design made multitasking very inefficient because only one large app card is visible on the screen at a time, while a sliver of one additional app is shown off to the side. There's no way to tell what app is next in the list until it appears, making it hard to switch quickly between more than two apps at a time. Thankfully, companies like OnePlus, Vivo, Samsung, and a few others have figured out that this UI isn't the best.</p><p>From grids of apps to floating windows, triple-app split screens, and quick app switching, I've picked out my favorite Android multitasking UIs that'll let you get more done in less time. The most efficient way to multitask on a modern Android phone is to use swipe gestures, not the traditional 3-button navigation layout, so many of the gesture-based features I speak about below are dependent on that setting.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-oneplus-2">The best: OnePlus</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wf5WaHFDdp8SXNp8XghBzY" name="oneplus-13-multitasking-ui" alt="Multitasking on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wf5WaHFDdp8SXNp8XghBzY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>OnePlus and Oppo phones let you quickly switch between 10 apps at once with a single swipe and a tap.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>OnePlus has the best default multitasking UI you'll find on any Android phone, but it wasn't always that way. Back when Android 9 Pie came out, OnePlus quickly adopted Google's terrible UI but realized its mistake when its most loyal users were unhappy with the oversimplified UI. Since then, OnePlus' multitasking UI design has managed to bridge the best of every idea, offering a quick way to instantly swap between seven apps at once, run two apps at once, and even quickly hover a third app on the screen.</p><p>From the overview UI, it's possible to choose from the last <strong>10 apps</strong> with a single swipe and a tap. This is thanks to the quick slider at the bottom that shows the icons of each app along with a large card of the app above it. This is the fastest you can switch between apps on any Android UI and it's also available on OPPO phones thanks to the company's merging of Color OS and Oxygen OS code bases.</p><p>Ironically, this UI is very similar to what Apple used to have in iOS 7-9 before the iPhone X came out. I say ironically because the company made multitasking worse by removing the bottom row of icons, but thankfully, OnePlus and OPPO realized their mistake and capitalized on it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WJoYZ6JhzTLKVY3Mzuh27i" name="oneplus-13-multitasking" alt="Quickly juggling multiple apps on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WJoYZ6JhzTLKVY3Mzuh27i.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also quickly split the screen or make the current app float by dragging your thumb up from the bottom of the screen until the current app card rests in the "floating" or "split" sections that appear on the screen. Some other phones, like Samsung, have a version of this feature but don't allow you to do it in a single swipe.</p><p>The introduction of the Canvas feature from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> was rolled into the Oxygen OS 15/Color OS 15 update for any eligible phone and allows you to run split-screen apps in a "nearly full-screen" mode. This makes it more convenient to use split-screen mode because you can have the prominent app take up 90% of the display while the other rests at the bottom 10%, waiting to be maximized.</p>
<h2 id="runner-up-vivo-2">Runner-up: Vivo</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="t7R7DzvqhBn7Wu4tRGiDLN" name="Vivo-X100-Pro-multitasking-ui-grid" alt="Multitasking on the Vivo X100 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7R7DzvqhBn7Wu4tRGiDLN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Vivo offers a selection of a grid or AOSP-style card list right on the Overview screen.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Out of the box, Vivo users can quickly select between the traditional single-large-card UI and a tablet-like grid of cards with the tap of a button. On the Overview UI, just tap the icon at the bottom to switch between the two views, making it easy to select from <strong>4 apps</strong> via a single tap and <strong>another four</strong> with a swipe.</p><p>You can find this grid of cards on other phones, but most require you to do something special to enable it. Foldable phones usually only have this UI on the large inner display, and while Samsung phones offer several similar UI options, you have to separately download the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> app from the Galaxy Apps store along with a separate module just to find the option. Vivo makes it available via a single tap on all its phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SMtf8iaqXSdk5jpkJVbuWB" name="vivo-x100-pro-multitasking" alt="Efficiently multitasking on the Vivo X100 Pro with the grid view option" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SMtf8iaqXSdk5jpkJVbuWB.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo's UI also features the same swipe-up-and-hold to either split or float the active window that's on OnePlus and OPPO phones. In fact, most phones from China sport this feature, making us wonder why Samsung, Google, Motorola, and others don't implement it.</p>
<h2 id="power-user-option-samsung-2">Power user option: Samsung</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BRWCoDPMyqaeYfBUEfTCeF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-One-UI-7-Beta-2-multitasking" alt="The new multitasking UI in One UI 7 Beta 2 running on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BRWCoDPMyqaeYfBUEfTCeF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung's default stacked cards in One UI 7 offers kinetic scrolling, improving the stock experience, but the real key lies in using one of the many Good Lock alternatives.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Samsung <em>finally</em> got with the program and did something about the terrible stock multitasking UI in Android when it began rolling out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7 beta</a> at the end of 2024. The new UI looks like a mash-up of Android and iOS designs, sporting the stacked card look of iOS with the four quick icons at the bottom.</p><p>The problem with Samsung's design is that the icons at the bottom aren't based on active apps. They're based on an algorithm Google built into Android that tries to figure out which apps you use most often. That means these icons are almost never the same, and while they can sometimes be helpful, the lack of consistency is more a problem than a help.</p><p>At the least, Samsung's cards "snap" into place, making it easier to focus on each one as it passes by. But you don't have to deal with this nonsense UI if you <em>really</em> want to multitask. Just download Good Lock and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-good-lock-is-going-global-with-a-fresh-redesign-in-one-ui-7">change basically anything</a> you see on the Overview screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DEccU7R7u5Sb5Gq8xjQbVH" name="samsung-multitasking" alt="Multitasking in One UI with the stacked list and grid options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DEccU7R7u5Sb5Gq8xjQbVH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With Good Lock, you can select from five different "task changer" UI designs. List is the default option that shows one vertical card at a time. Grid is the one I praised Vivo for including by default, and it shows six app cards on screen at a time. Stack is the new default in One UI 7 and shows one prominent card up front with three cards "peaking" behind it. This one makes it easier to see what app is next in the list but doesn't enhance multitasking as much as the Grid option does.</p><p>The Vertical List option resembles the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/rJyVNrxGonU?si=dtU5tvwC66KfVGUK&t=34">Galaxy Nexus multitasking UI</a> of vertically-scrolling cards, which makes better use of screen space than the default horizontal list. The last option, Slim List, is the "real" power user option as it offers <strong>seven apps</strong> to choose from immediately.</p><p>Samsung also offers hover and split-screen app options, but you need to open up the Overview UI first, then long-press on a card and drag it to the appropriate action. This is an extra step versus what Vivo, OnePlus, OPPO, and other Chinese brands offer.</p>
<h2 id="honorable-mention-foldables-2">Honorable mention: Foldables</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4232px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="foMdWDkAdjygAHYBSNvT7H" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-04.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold open apps view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/foMdWDkAdjygAHYBSNvT7H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4232" height="2381" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Book style foldables offer multiple ways to multitask, and most have a pinnable dock that allows for one-tap multitasking.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Technically, book-style foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and the OnePlus Open offer the best multitasking experience on any phone, but not everyone likes the size of these devices. Most offer a different multitasking experience on the smaller outer display than what's on the big inner display.</p><p>Some foldables, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> below, don't have an option to "pin" the dock at the bottom of the screen. Most other book-style foldables, however, allow you to have this dock present at all times, meaning multitasking is a single tap away at all times.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KEsirm7eEguyEZ82ZcLWrY" name="honor-magic-v3-foldable-multitasking" alt="Multitasking on an Honor Magic V3 using the app dock and grid view Overview UI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KEsirm7eEguyEZ82ZcLWrY.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus wins the award for best foldable multitasking UI because its small screen UI is identical to its other phones, including that handy row of app icons at the bottom. When you open the phone, you'll find there's no real reason to ever open Overview, thanks to the app dock at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>While most foldables have this dock now thanks to Samsung and Android 12L, OnePlus one-ups things with its Canvas software that lets you run <strong>three apps</strong> <strong>at a time</strong> on the big screen. You can arrange these in several ways, but it takes multitasking to a new level.</p>
<h2 id="barely-better-than-stock-google-motorola-nothing-honor-2">Barely better than stock: Google, Motorola, Nothing, Honor</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GAhzLRJBgQ5DwCmKFVfbMj" name="google-pixel-9-multitasking-ui-buttons" alt="The quick image copy button, screeshot button, and select button on the multitasking UI on the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GAhzLRJBgQ5DwCmKFVfbMj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many Android manufacturers have chosen to stick mostly to the stock UI but add a few convenience features. Motorola and Google offer quick action buttons at the bottom for taking a screenshot, allowing you to screenshot an app in the Overview UI without having to reopen it. I'm not sure who uses this, but I've never found myself tapping the button other than to see what it does.</p><p>Motorola also offers a button below the cards that locks the app in memory, making it a priority to stay in RAM for quick access in case the phone is running low. This is best for phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a> that only have 4GB of RAM and might reload apps often. A third button is available from the Overview UI on some Motorola phones when the sidebar gesture option is enabled, allowing apps to be quickly floated with a tap and then moved into a semi-hidden side panel when minimized.</p><p>Google Pixel phones have a screenshot button and a second "Select" button that can extract text from an app tile, but it's far slower and clunkier than just swiping between two apps using the gesture bar at the bottom of the screen. Some cards on the Pixel Overview UI also have a quick "copy link" or "copy image" button, which is actually quite handy on some occasions. Overall, though, the Pixel's Overview UI is overengineered and poorly designed.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>These companies add something to the barebones AOSP experience but don't fix the core problem of the large card design.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Honor keeps the default giant card UI but enhances things by adding a small button to the top right of each card to instantly float the window. This doesn't help with switching between more than two apps quickly, but it's at least a little better for juggling three apps when you have one floating. Honor also has a quick hover and split-screen action when you swipe up from the bottom of the screen and drag the card to the appropriate action.</p><p>Nothing doesn't add any buttons to the Overview UI but does allow users to quickly float the active app by sliding up from the bottom of the screen until the card gets to the top half of the screen. This will put the app in a floating window for nicer multitasking, complete with clearly marked "minimize" and "close" buttons in the app's floating frame (similar to Motorola), but overall, it's the most basic of all four companies listed here.</p><p>While these four companies do something better than AOSP, they're niche features that you probably won't use all the time. They don't fix the main problem, which is the inefficient single giant card on the screen and no real way to quickly switch to another app without needless scrolling. Additionally, none of them offer the kinetic scrolling Samsung offers, making it more difficult to find the app you want as the card goes whizzing by.</p>

<p>I find it very hard to understand why Google hasn't fixed this UI in the seven years since Android 9 Pie was released. I got excited when the first Pixel Fold was unveiled in May 2023 and showcased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-fold-multitasking-ui">a grid-like multitasking UI</a>, only to later find out that this UI only appeared on the large inner display, not the outer display that I used most of the time.</p><p>The bottom line is that Android's default Overview multitasking UI needs a huge facelift. The best alternative right now is OnePlus's default design, which takes the large card format and substantially enhances it with a simple icon grid below, making it easy to switch between the last 10 apps with a single swipe and a tap.</p><p>Every other company convolutes this process in some way, with the next-best option falling under the grid format on Vivo and Samsung phones or the vertically-scrolling "slim list" on Samsung's Good Lock app. Any company that opts for stock Android is simply stuck with the worst option possible, making multitasking a chore rather than a joy.</p><p>Google needs to address this with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, and it needs to happen ASAP. You have lots of options to choose from, Google. Any of them would be an improvement over what's currently available. Thanks.</p>

<p>Google I/O 2025 is officially set for May 20 and May 21, 2025 at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/google-io-2025-save-the-date/" target="_blank">announced</a> today. The annual developer conference, which will feature multiple keynotes and developer sessions both online and in-person, was teased earlier today. As is tradition, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-help-reveal-google-i-o-2025s-date-with-prism-shift-puzzle-game">Google launched a small puzzle game</a>, where users could collectively work together to unlock the official dates for I/O 2025.</p><p>Google shared more information about I/O 2025 in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/about?category=General" target="_blank">FAQ page</a> on its website. "This year’s event is open to everyone online on May 20-21, 2025," the page explains. "Tune in to the livestreamed keynotes and sessions, then dive into technical content and learning material on demand."</p><p>Aside from the in-person experience near Google headquarters in Mountain View, there will also be community-led developer sessions around the globe. The company says the first day of I/O 2025 will begin "with keynotes, followed by breakout sessions, workshops, demos, networking opportunities and more continuing on day two."</p>

On a few occasions, Google has announced new hardware at I/O keynotes, but it did not announce anything last year.

<ul><li>Leaked renders of the alleged Pixel 9a surfaced online giving out design details and all the colors.</li><li>Renders show that Google might've given up on the thick camera visor on this device for the first time</li><li>The device will supposedly come with a new 48-megapixel main sensor. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The leaks just keep getting better for the upcoming budget Pixel 9a and this time we got to see the full renders of the device, along with its four new colorways (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-9a-renders-colors" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>).</p><p>According to the publication, the Pixel 9a will arrive looking a lot like its predecessors but with one major design change. The phone is supposedly ditching the thick camera visor that is the signature on all other Pixel phones from the past few years. The phone is said to showcase the cameras flush with the rear panel of the device, basically giving it a smooth, sleek finish while showcasing a dual camera array. These rumors are backed by the most recent leak of the Pixel 9a cases which didn't seem to have the same camera cutout in them as other Pixel models.</p><p>The publication further notes that the Pixel 9a lineup will come in the same colors as the Pixel 9 series i.e., Peony, Obsidian, and Porcelain, along with an Iris (purple) color  and matching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/alleged-pixel-9a-silicone-cases-renderings-colors" target="_blank">cases to go with it</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="msN8b8SMFu2wwYWgU3Re5X" name="Google-Pixel-9a-renders" alt="Leaked renders of the supposed Google Pixel 9a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/msN8b8SMFu2wwYWgU3Re5X.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the hardware, the renders show that the Pixel 9a will have two bars on the side for the physical buttons, which will mostly be the power and volume controls, rounded corners, and a flat display. The publication adds that this year's device is a tad larger, with dimensions of 154 x 73 x 8.9mm compared to the 152.1 mm on the Pixel 8a. The reason is, that the device would likely see a larger battery with a capacity of 5,100mAh and increased charging speeds as well, 23W wired and 7.5W wireless.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9rsUDvQySRziKbUWVemS5X" name="Google-Pixel-9a-renders" alt="Leaked renders of the supposed Google Pixel 9a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9rsUDvQySRziKbUWVemS5X.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Furthermore, Android Headlines adds that the main camera on the device is said to get an update. Supposedly the tech giant is letting go of the 64MP main sensor for a new 1/2-inch 48MP main sensor with an f/1.7 aperture. It is said to be sticking with the 13MP ultrawide camera along with the same 13MP selfie camera.</p><p>While these still seem like speculations, leaks like this should always be taken with caution. However, it seems like we don't have to wait for long since another leak now claims the Google Pixel 9a will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-9as-exact-release-date-is-already-known-report-claims" target="_blank">debut in March</a>, with preorders for the device opening on March 19.  The device is also said to feature two configurations for $399 and $499 (256GB), respectively.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung brings “Suggested replies” for Galaxy S25 devices, offering AI-powered responses in messaging apps.</li><li>The feature is currently spotted in Labs settings, requires Samsung Keyboard to use it.</li><li>Users can edit and send the responses, and the feature currently works with WhatsApp.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung started making the flagship Galaxy S25 series widely available to the masses last week. As more users get their hands on the devices this month, the company seems to have already been rolling out new features for the trio.</p><p>As Mishaal Rahman notes (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-keyboard-suggested-replies-3524723/">Android Authority</a>), Samsung is bringing an advanced feature for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> devices dubbed “Suggested replies.” The new feature works in conjunction with Samsung Keyboard for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging apps</a> like WhatsApp to give AI-powered replies to chat.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.61%;"><img id="WE7jPTb2h7Rpt4KMSQJz8b" name="Galaxy-S25-Suggested-replies-feature.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 series Suggested replies feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WE7jPTb2h7Rpt4KMSQJz8b.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="277" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.61%;"><img id="orTph2pJUv7EARvRyBvw8b" name="Galaxy-S25-Suggested-replies-feature-01.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 series Suggested replies feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/orTph2pJUv7EARvRyBvw8b.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="277" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>The feature comes as a part of the Labs settings found in the Galaxy S25 series. Per the screenshots shared by Rahman, the new feature’s description goes on to indicate that users can get AI-powered suggested replies to chat and text messages they receive — but only while using the native Samsung Keyboard.</p><p>Since it is an experimental feature and works only with Samsung Keyboard, Rahman notes that it is highly unlikely that it would work with a third-party keyboard like Gboard or SwiftKey, for instance. Samsung also doesn’t say which messaging apps the respective new feature works with, but, according to Rahman’s testing, it worked pretty well with WhatsApp.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.61%;"><img id="RvCF9StfMsYvTPHN3frH8b" name="Galaxy-S25-Suggested-Replies-on-WhatsApp.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 series Suggested replies feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RvCF9StfMsYvTPHN3frH8b.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="277" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cited example indicates a question sent to a user asking which AI assistant is better, Galaxy AI or Apple Intelligence. The receiver on the other end using Samsung Keyboard with the suggested replies feature enabled has seen a couple of suggested responses like “both have their pros and cons.”</p><p>However, a user needs to pick the provided options and has the ability to edit it before sending, which appears handy. While it worked with WhatsApp, for Rahman, it didn’t work with Google Messages — although it has its version of suggested replies dubbed Smart Reply.</p>
<p>For those wondering, in order for the new Suggested replies feature to work seamlessly, it requires the data from the chat, and Samsung doesn’t yet say whether it is taking the help of Gemini to generate these suggested responses. However, the feature description indicates that “Messages are processed on your phone to provide suggested replies,” followed by instructing users to check the terms and conditions of the Galaxy AI’s features.</p><p>Right now, the rollout of the feature is limited to the Galaxy S25 series; however, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>’s official rollout to older Galaxy phones like the S24 Ultra would indicate whether the feature is for more Galaxy phone users.</p>

<hr>
<p>Some alleged information regarding the upcoming availability of Xiaomi 15's latest flagship series in global areas has surfaced.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-vous-devoile-les-prix-europeens-et-dautres-details-sur-les-xiaomi-15-et-xiaomi-15-ultra-59954">Dealabs</a> (French), information on the pricing of the Xiaomi 15 and the Xiaomi 15 Ultra have been discovered for European markets (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/02/11/xiaomi-15-ultra-global-prices-leak/">Gizmochina</a>). The publication reportedly "retrieved the corresponding" price, storage, and colors of the latest Xiaomi phones. Starting with the Ultra, the post suggests it could arrive for € 1,499 (~$1,553) in France and other parts of Eurpope.</p><p>Xiaomi may also only offer the device in one color, Chrome, alongside a 512GB storange option. Information on its RAM wasn't stated.</p><p>Elsewhere, the post highlights the supposed Xiaomi 15 data, which claims it will cost €1,099 in Europe (~$1,138). Consumers could see colors similar to what Xiaomi delivered to its Chinese market: green, black, and white for its 512GB storage option.</p><p>What's odd is that it seems Xiaomi has tinkered with the available storage options, at least for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-and-15-pro-with-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-announced-in-china">the original 15</a> from October. The leaks don't make it clear if the Chinese OEM is offering a 512GB choice for both the base model <em>and </em>the Pro, considering the latter reached 1TB while the former topped out at 256GB.</p><p>There's still a little uncertainty, but that might disappear quite soon. The post claims the devices are gearing up for a February 26 launch date in Europe.</p><p>The most interesting of these alleged pricing leaks is the Xiaomi 15 Ultra as, following a delay, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-exec-highlights-launch-timeline">the device is set for this month</a>. The company's president of the mobile phone department, Lu Weibing, stated the 15 Ultra will see a "simultaneous" release in China and overseas markets. Weibing was attempting to answer user's burning questions about the company and its products, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-alleged-delay-and-certification">following a rumored delay</a>.</p><p>However, during that time, the 15 Ultra was spotted in an FCC listing with 90W fast charging. Tpster's claimed the device could see a ~5,400mAh to ~5,800mAh battery to join its rapid, corded charger and 50W wireless charging capabilities. The FCC listing also detailed support for satellite communication for texts and calls.</p><p>The original Xiaomi 15 and 15 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-preps-global-debut-8-elite-fcc-listing">appeared at the FCC</a> in November, signaling the company's upcoming global release.</p><p>Xiaomi's Lu Weibing added that the 15 Ultra would drop <em>after </em>the Chinese New Year. The celebrations usually run into February so, perhaps, this rumored late date holds some merit. More importantly, the Ultra should join its base and Pro siblings in that global debut as Xiaomi <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-launch-and-14-ultra">did something similar</a> with the 14 series.</p>

<ul><li>Google TV is reportedly developing a "News Brief" feature and a recent update discovery showcases a few key descriptions.</li><li>It seems News Brief will be AI-backed and sourced  based on the "days' top news."</li><li>Another string shows that Google plans to let the AI read your curated news stories aloud for you on your TV.</li><li>Google TV's update last fall brought the "Home panel" to users, which mirrors smart home controls found on the TV Streamer.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly preparing to roll out a new feature for its TV experience that delivers important news updates to users.</p><p>An APK dive into a recent Google TV update by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-tv-ambient-mode-news-3524995/">Android Authority</a> discovered code pointing toward an upcoming "News Briefs" feature. The publication states that this feature is wrapped in Google TV's "Ambient Mode," which typically offers a slideshow of landscape wallpapers when you're not watching anything (idle).</p><p>While not confirmed, the post adds that it seems users will have "control" over the News Briefs with (potentially) the ability to toggle it on/off.</p><p>Google's recently added code gives us a glimpse into what to expect, like its main purpose of showing "news headlines in your screensaver." The company also alludes to this feature being heavily backed by AI. Another string states that the top headlines shown are "AI-generated based on the day's top news."</p><p>Interestingly, Google's "News Brief" might tack on reading capabilities by the AI serving up the headlines. One string states, "Press OK to listen to your news brief." Considering this is designed for a TV, having the AI read aloud a few important headlines and perhaps a brief overview of its content makes sense.</p><p>The publication wasn't able to get this part working, so it looks like we'll have to wait until it hits Google TV devices officially. The post states that Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googletv/thread/320132855/google-tv-begins-news-briefs-experiment-in-the-united-states">highlighted</a> the beginning of a test for News Brief. This newly discovered code could indicate the test's approach. That highlight post detailed the News Brief's availability via the "For You" page for U.S. viewers.</p>

<p>Google's TV side has been relatively quiet ever since the company launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">Chromecast replacement Streamer</a> last summer. Not only does the box offer 800 free channels, but it doubles as a smart home hub so users can keep tabs on their connected devices and cameras from the living room (or anywhere).</p><p>Google then rolled out two important updates for its TV experience, one of those involved a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-updates-control-center-entertainment-smart-home">personal control center</a> that mirrored its new Streamer. Users with Google TV sets received the next-gen "Google Home panel." From there, users who opted against purchasing a TV Streamer could control their thermostats and lights, as well as receive doorbell notifications.</p><p>Google TV users also picked up a dedicated sports tab on the "For You" page for live games, upcoming ones, and YouTube highlights.</p><p>A quieter update dropped in November, which let users manually decide the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-first-google-tv-streamer-update-lets-you-manually-choose-an-audio-output-format">audio output format</a> for their Google TV.</p>

The Google Pixel 9 Pro, easily one of the best phones on the market today, is currently chilling with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-pro-256gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587890.p"><strong>$200 discount at Best Buy</strong></a>, marking the same low price that we saw during last year's Black Friday sales. </p><p>Indeed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-drops-massive-presidents-day-sale-event-here-are-the-top-10-tech-deals-that-you-should-care-about">Best Buy's Presidents' Day sale</a> has no shortage of excellent deals on Android phones, tablets, and wearables, but if you're looking for an AI-powered flagship with great cameras to match, then this discount on the Pixel 9 Pro can't be beat. </p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a modern flagship phone with AI features, long software support, and some of the best cameras in the biz; you prefer to buy your phones unlocked.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a phone with a bigger screen or a built-in stylus; you need more than 128GB of base storage; you're looking for a trade-in opportunity. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9 series was released last October and the Pro/Pro XL quickly rose through the ranks to become one of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> on the market. Straight out of the box you get a unique, thoughtfully-designed flagship with a glorious 6.3-inch OLED 120Hz display and durable Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and IP68 construction. Under the hood, the phone boasts the efficient Tensor G4 chipset, 16GB of RAM, and loads of useful AI features, plus you're guaranteed to receive seven years of OS/security updates. </p><p>As detailed in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">our 4/5-star review</a>, the Pixel 9 Pro faces challenges in the form of its two biggest rivals, the Galaxy S25 Ultra and OnePlus 13, but both of those phones are currently a lot more expensive than Google's flagship. With regular, day-to-day use, the difference in performance between the three phones becomes pretty marginal, so it's not like you're sacrificing much by going with the Pixel.</p><p>In other words, if you know you like Google phones and you're looking for a good deal, look no further than the Pixel 9 Pro at Best Buy.</p>

<hr>
<p>Users are starting to unravel Samsung's changes to a Good Lock module app that allows for some crazy customization.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1ii6u9q/home_up_on_one_ui_7_is_crazy/">thread on Reddit</a> showed off the capabilities of Samsung's One UI 7 Home Up module revamp in the beta. The original poster displayed the "limitless" possibilities of the refreshed module in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, which involves app/folder placement. Pinching inward on their display brought up the usual home screen editing options but with an added "DIY Home" button.</p><p>Tapping it gives users complete freedom over the size and orientation of an app widget, or folder.</p><p>More importantly, the usual grid-view we have on Android is seemingly tossed out the window. The user isn't restricted to "snapping" anything into a given spot on their home screen as the demo shows them sliding things around to unusual spots. There's even a widget on their screen that's partially out of view.</p><p>The user is also able to overlap widgets and apps, for a truly chaotic home screen.</p><p>The demo only shows these wacky changes applying the apps above the bottom toolbar where you'd have your static apps like messaging, phone calls, contacts, or anything else. Additionally, tapping a folder that's been rotated or upside down will produce its contents as normal when opened.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1ii6u9q/home_up_on_one_ui_7_is_crazy">Home Up on One UI 7 is crazy</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui">r/oneui</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Samsung was reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-good-lock-module-customization-update-spotted">developing a revamp</a> for its Home Up module in Good Lock in October. A tipster on X discovered several upcoming tools like the ability for users to alter the stiffness, friction, blur, and duration of animations through Home Up. Those options were discovered beneath an "advanced tuning" sub-section with the "simple tuning" concerning animation speeds.</p><p>While this Reddit demo didn't show off those selections, it did offer a glimpse at its display size customization abilities for folders and apps.</p><p>Late in January, a Samsung community member <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-good-lock-is-going-global-with-a-fresh-redesign-in-one-ui-7">confirmed</a> that Home Up was involved in Good Lock's global refresh for One UI 7. The official post stated Home Up was "one of the most changed apps" in its software upgrade this year. One UI 7 lets users run Home Up's customization functions without opening the app itself.</p><p>Those enrolled in the One UI 7 beta can likely try out these wacky customization features and you'll have even more time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">following Samsung's delay</a>. The company is reportedly interested in pushing back the stable rollout of its OS on the Galaxy S24 yet again due to a display coloring issue. This means that the year-old trio will roll into a fourth beta soon.</p><p>Samsung did state that One UI 7 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">preparing to hit</a> its past-gen Galaxy S devices "imminently" in Q1 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Spotify Premium users are hearing ads, which is likely the result of a bug.</li><li>The company is looking into the issue, first reported last Friday, but did not confirm the ads are accidental.</li><li>Ad-free music streaming is a key perk of Spotify Premium, which starts at $12 per month, and users are understandably frustrated.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify">Spotify</a> is one of the few music streaming services that offer a free tier for listening, but many pay for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify">Spotify Premium</a> to listen to songs in any order and get an ad-free experience. It's not cheap — the Premium Individual plan starts at $11.99 per month — and one of the key selling points is getting rid of commercial breaks. That's why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify-subscribers-exceed-260-million-as-the-platform-grew-11-percent-in-2024">Spotify Premium users</a> are frustrated, because some are reporting hearing ads despite subscribing to the service.</p><p>There are multiple reports of this issue on Spotify's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Ongoing-Issues/Premium-users-hearing-ads/idi-p/6698887" target="_blank">community forums</a>, dating back to last Friday, Feb. 7 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-premium-ads-3524922/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). Customers are also reporting issues contacting support and getting help, with one user saying that it has been "impossible to talk to anyone at Spotify." Nearly one week later, the company is looking into the problem.</p><p>"Our tech teams are currently investigating reports of Premium users hearing ads," a support representative wrote. "We'll keep you posted here if we have any news to share, so make sure to Subscribe to the thread to stay tuned."</p><p>Spotify asks users affected by the issue to add to the thread with their device information, app version or web player, the type of ad they heard, and any troubleshooting steps they've already taken. In the thread, some users have reported trying numerous troubleshooting steps, and yet the problem still persists.</p>

<p>Notably, the support representative did not explicitly confirm that Spotify Premium users hearing ads was a result of a bug. It does seem like this is the case, and we'll likely learn more soon.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Spotify to confirm that ads played for Spotify Premium subscribers were not intentional, and asked for an update on the support investigation. We did not hear back in time for publication, but will update this article when we do.</p><p>For now, Spotify Premium users should know that they're not alone if they are hearing ads or getting commercial breaks while listening to music.</p>

<ul><li>Google confirmed that Android XR will have camera permissions near-identical to Android phones.</li><li>Devs can request access to the "rear camera" to contextualize your surroundings and place mixed-reality objects accordingly.</li><li>They can also see a real-time "avatar" of your "selfie-cam" feed for eye and face tracking.</li><li>Meta Quest headsets currently don't allow this, though devs will get optional access sometime in 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android apps must seek permission before using your camera. Now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> will preserve your privacy — or give devs access to your living room feed — based on your preferences. Headsets like Samsung Project Moohan will analyze your living room surroundings and adjust mixed-reality games and apps using that context.</p><p>Developer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://skarredghost.com/2025/02/07/android-xr-camera-access-2/">Skarred Ghost</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/android-xr-will-give-developers-passthrough-access/">UploadVR</a>) asked Google whether devs would get Android XR camera access, given that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> headsets still don't allow access for privacy reasons — at least until later in 2025.</p><p>A Google representative responded that "similar to any Android app, a developer can use existing camera frames with user permission for XR."</p><p>Specifically, the application can seek access for the "main world-facing camera stream" and the "main selfie-camera stream" that points at your face; Google likened this to accessing the "rear" and "front cameras" on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>.</p><p>On the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/get-started#permissions-xr">Android Developers page</a>, we can see the specifics: Developers can request access for "Scene Understanding," aka use cases like "Light estimation; projecting passthrough onto mesh surfaces; performing raycasts against trackables in the environment; plane tracking; object tracking; working with depth for occlusion and hit testing; persistent anchors."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b5qhEdSGH8kVnjNEpbr7Sf" name="Android-XR-infinite-desktop" alt="A mock-up of Android XR showing floating screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b5qhEdSGH8kVnjNEpbr7Sf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Android XR apps can float in space without context, but mixed-reality apps will need more data to blend into <em>your</em> reality. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Android XR will enable "basic" hand tracking by default like "pinching, poking, aiming, and gripping," devs can request advanced tracking through the rear camera for "hand joint poses and angular and linear velocities," creating a "mesh representation of the user's hands" that sounds like it'll boost immersion and make hand-tracked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">VR games</a> more enjoyable.</p><p>The Android XR developer page also explained that games will need selfie camera permissions to access your "eye pose and orientation" for avatars, "eye gaze input and interactions," and for "tracking and rendering facial expressions."</p><p>Thankfully, granting selfie-cam permissions won't actually give devs a real-time close-up of your goofy expressions and pores. Android XR will only send an "avatar video stream" generated on-device to developers.</p><p>As with any Android app, Android XR will require a certain level of trust between user and developer, that your living room data won't be used for nefarious purposes. We assume that Android XR will let you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-review-app-permissions-your-android-phone">review app permissions</a> and check the Privacy Dashboard to confirm apps aren't using camera data when they shouldn't.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-is-so-promising-for-android-xr-2">Why this is so promising for Android XR</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wk6fVLh3yDcAZUAqs8egG3" name="meta-quest-3-official-mixed-reality-lego-brick-tales.jpg" alt="An official mixed reality image of Lego Brick Tales and a Meta Quest 3 headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wk6fVLh3yDcAZUAqs8egG3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Currently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/one-year-later-mixed-reality-games-are-booming">mixed-reality games</a> on Quest rely on whatever boundaries you draw using system software; it can ask you to draw a tabletop space for building XR LEGO sets, but it can't see what you're looking at and interpret that data in creative ways.</p><p>Meta Quest headsets will enable a Passthrough API in early 2025 to open camera data up to devs, and it's promising to see that Android XR will enable this tool from the start.</p><p>Developer Skarred Ghost described how he used a "hacky camera access trick on Quest" to "prototype an AI+MR application that can help people do some interior design of their houses," something that "wouldn’t have been possible" without camera permissions.</p><p>With Android XR's camera permissions, you could transform your house with holographic designs to make it look cooler, or scan something in real life and then put that object into your living room.</p><p>Mixed-reality games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gdc-2024-best-upcoming-quest-3-vision-pro-vr-games">Laser Dance</a> use general headset boundary data and object detection to create XR obstacles, but more exact living room data would allow for more creative challenges (like recognizing a table as something you could crawl under, instead of just a massive block taking up space).</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a> and other XR headsets will certainly benefit, but it's AR glasses that'll really need this kind of camera access for apps, simply because you'll wear them all day in unfamiliar environments, where analyzing your surroundings is the whole point! Apps like Google Maps and Translate will need camera access, but Android XR will let third-party apps piggyback on your feed, too.</p><p>Beyond all of the possible applications of camera access, it's reassuring to know that Android's privacy focus will carry over to Android XR, unless you're certain you trust a developer enough to peek into your living space.</p>

<ul><li>Some Pixel 7 users on Android 16 beta report device reboot issues.</li><li>Notably affected devices include the Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro and the Pixel 7a.</li><li>The annoying bug in Android 16 beta is causing these devices randomly reboot during voice calls, per user reports.</li><li>A Google employee has acknowledged the issue, and a fix is expected to be rolled out soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has rolled first beta of its latest Android 16 operating system over the past few weeks. Since it’s a beta, users are expected to note some bugs; however, the latest one from Pixel 7 owners indicates a major bug, which is making the devices almost unusable, per some reports.</p><p>According to recent findings by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/02/10/pixel-7-series-call-reboot-android-16-beta/">Piunikaweb</a>, some of the Pixel 7 handsets are experiencing random reboots during voice calls who are on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 beta</a>. The Pixel 7 series devices here include the Pixel 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a>, and Pixel 7a featuring build numbers like <strong>BP22.250103.008</strong>.</p>

<p>The cases of random reboots during voice calls seem to be happening over the past few weeks, which is making the handset unusable for several minutes, per the shared user reports.</p><p>The issues here appear random, as some of the users note that their Pixel 7 phone kept rebooting at least four or five times out of ten calls, and mid-conversation during the call. Additionally, some devices rebooted every three to seven minutes during a call, further clearing the call log.</p><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-review">Pixel 7</a> users note that the bug is alarming despite being a beta version of Android 16 as it is a basic function for any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. It is also believed to be frustrating for some during important calls like work or emergencies, for example.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the reboot seems to occur without any relevant warning and it is also being witnessed on shorter voice calls. Thankfully, a Google employee seems to have acknowledged the issue, stating “We have shared this with our product and engineering team and will update this issue with more information as it becomes available.”</p><p>While it is encouraging to see the company quickly acknowledge the issue, it would perhaps take a while for the fix to be rolled out. Meanwhile, affected users should try rolling back to stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> builds as the bug sounds annoying, to say the least. It is also recommended to wait for the official Android 16 release or a more stable beta release — especially if you are flashing it on a primary phone.</p>

In America, the influence of automakers has given us too many unwalkable cities. Many European cities are walkable and have robust public transportation. Being able to have the right tool for the right need can make all the difference in the world, and that’s where Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 come into play.</p><p>It’s been almost six years since the launch of the original Powerbeats Pro. Those became Beats highest-selling in-ear headphones ever, and with good reason. The locked-in fit and the sound quality worked for a lot of people! In 2025, they’ve taken things to a new level by adding a few new features, including heart rate monitors—all for the same price as 2019’s Powerbeats Pro.</p><p>Previous attempts at including heart rate monitoring in earbuds haven’t been all that great, so let’s dive in and see what Beats is bringing to the table this time around!!</p>

<p>Arriving at the same price as the 2019 Powerbeats Pro, the Powerbeats Pro 2 launched online on February 11 from Apple.com, with in-store availability on February 13th for $249.99.</p><p>You can pick up a pair in one of four colors: Jet Black, Quick Sand, Hyper Purple, and Electric Orange. Beats has been pushing out new colorways in other products as collabs with celebrities, so I’d expect to see these in some other color options in the future.</p>

<p>Let’s begin with the feature that is likely going to stand out most for many interested consumers, and that’s Apple and Beats' first-ever earbuds equipped with heart rate monitors. Yes, plural. Each earbud has an LED sensor that pulses over 100 times per second, a photodiode, an optical lens, and an accelerometer. That’s the HRM apparatus. The folks at Beats developed an algorithm that takes data from the readings in each earbud to create accurate heart rate measurements. And, sweet Christmas, are those readings accurate!</p><p>To connect the earbuds with your phone or compatible smartwatch, you’ll double-tap and hold either earbud until you hear a chime that lets you know they're now discoverable as HRMs. I tested this with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review" target="_blank">Google Pixel 9</a> and the Polar Flow, Strava, and Nike Run Club apps. I also connected to an Amazfit T-Rex 3. Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, and Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> (and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Watch Ultra</a>, for that matter) don’t support connecting to third-party HRMs like chest straps. Despite that, I got the earbuds to connect to the Samsung Health app as an HRM. I’m still working on getting the app to recognize them for their guided workout videos.</p>

<p>Having used the earbuds for about a week, I’ve found the monitoring excellent! To validate the monitoring quality, during workouts with the earbuds, I also wore a Polar H10 chest strap known for being highly accurate since it receives electrical signals directly from your heart.</p><p>One of the downsides to many optical sensors is their inability to keep up during high-intensity interval training. Your heartbeat changes rapidly, and many monitors will lag behind in their real-time readings by as much as 3-5 minutes, though it's usually 30 seconds or so. In each scenario I put the earbuds through, they matched my Polar H10 beat-for-beat, only occasionally being behind by fractions of a second in their real-time readings.</p><p>In one of my 30-minute stair climber machine workouts, the Polar H10 measured an average heart rate of 136 BPM, with a max of 151 BPM. The Pro 2’s measurements agreed with the max but had an average of 137 BPM. The sauce was my HR data, though. Each graph that showed the changes in my heart rate was almost identical regarding the peaks and valleys.</p><p>During an hour-long interval workout the next day, the data was again reliably in agreement between the earbuds and my chest strap. There was a slight deviation due to how I input each workout type and their duration, but it was within an acceptable range, and the heart rate graphs were in agreement as my beats per minute peaked and dipped based on my activity levels. Even with me handling each workout differently on the apps I was using that day, there was just a 2BPM difference in the average and a 1BPM difference in my maximum heart rate.</p><p>I’m currently working my way back up to longer runs in the 45-minute to one-hour duration, so we’ll see how the monitoring data holds up under those conditions, but during my hour-long, high-RPE weight training, the Powerbeats Pro 2’s held their own against my Polar H10 chest strap.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let’s back up a bit. These Bluetooth 5.3, IPX4, and Apple H2-equipped Powerbeats Pro 2 still come with plenty of Android support through the Beats app. You’ll get one-touch pairing, button customization, firmware updates, Locate My Beats, and the ability to change listening modes.</p><p>This year, you get more ear tips, with mediums on by default and four more options in the box, ranging from XL to XS.</p>
<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 controls are still among my favorites <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/i-tested-7-pairs-of-headphones-for-gym-use-and-this-is-what-id-recommend" target="_blank">in a sea of gym-ready workout earbuds</a> for their responsiveness because they’re mechanical, not touch-based. And in 2025, they still have physical volume rockers on the bridge of each earbud. What’s changed, though, is the ear hooks.</p><p>The Powerbeats were already some of the most comfortable earbuds I’ve worn, but now, with thinner, more ergonomic hooks made with nickel-titanium wiring on the inside, the buds feel lighter and even more comfortable, and they fit great with glasses and a bike helmet on.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yXSjLuHzrfkfaETWEakQ2U" name="beats-powerbeats-pro-2-bike-helmet2" alt="Powerbeats Pro 2 showing how they fit under a bike helmet and with sunglasses on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yXSjLuHzrfkfaETWEakQ2U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The housings of the earbuds have been redesigned; they’re smaller, and yet they fit a lot of tech into them. In addition to the sensors for heart rate monitoring, there are also optical sensors for in-ear detection. Furthermore, the acoustic chambers have also been redesigned. They’ve upgraded the amplifier, and the Apple H2 chip does a solid job of digital signal processing.</p><p>That digital signal processing played out well in how I enjoyed my music. These are earbuds, after all. The Powerbeats Pro 2 have an overall balanced sound that does lean a bit to the warm side of things, with solid bass and sub-bass reproduction, clear highs, and warm mids that give a nice presence to vocals, even in mixes that bury them. Case in point, one of the test tracks I often use that is one of the muddiest, bass-heavy hip hop tracks, Method Man’s “Biscuits,” is reproduced with the vocals and other backing vocal nuances clearly defined.</p><p>I also listened to Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” and “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga” from the Get Out OST. I use those tracks for soundstage, and though the Pro 2’s have a good soundstage, it isn’t the deepest or most expansive.</p><p>Though I’ve stated that they lean toward warm, it’s tracks like “Moanin’” (both Art Blakey and Charles Mingus versions) that show just how much clarity the Pro 2’s have. Instrumentation in the stereo field is easily identifiable and delightfully layered. Art Blakey’s version has horns that shrill when listening with analytical headphones, but the clarity of the Powerbeats Pro 2 is bright without being fatiguing. The warmth makes the upright bassline in Mingus’ version entertaining and engaging.</p><p>For gym headphones, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are highly capable and will help drive your workouts with ease. For everyday carry, they’re just as good. Listening to “Blue Eye Samurai” episode two, the Takio drums are impactful and resonant, while the Spatial Audio functionality of the Powerbeats Pro 2 really brings the anime’s sound design in that mountaintop fight scene to life.</p><p>Back to that digital signal process for a brief moment. It and the amplifier do a solid job of ensuring that bass response and other frequencies sound as satisfying at lower volumes as at high volumes.</p>

<p>Now, one would think that with all of this new hotness built into the Powebeats Pro 2, the effect on battery life would be sizeable, but it isn’t. These numbers are affected by the volume at which you’ll be playing your music, but Apple says you’ll get up to 10 hours of playback on a charge, with up to 45 total hours when you count in case recharges with only Adaptive EQ mode active.</p><p>With sound control modes, they say you’ll get up to eight hours, with 36 from the case. Fast Fuel charging gets you 1.5 hours of playback with five minutes of charging.</p><p>In my own testing, an hour and 15 minutes of streaming music over Bluetooth with ANC activated and HR monitoring burned through between 12% and 15% of the earbuds’ battery on various outings. I haven't been able to kill the battery with ANC on, but based on my tests and the amount of drain I've been seeing, you'll get a little over eight hours with ANC or Transparency mode activated.</p><p>With music playing at roughly 75% from a Google Pixel 9, I burned through continuous playback in a little over 10 hours.</p><p>Despite the new case being 33% smaller (side-by-side, the difference is striking), Beats was able to (finally) include Qi wireless charging in addition to USB-C charging.</p>

<p>Though the Powerbeats Pro 2 are IPX4 water resistant, that’s pretty much the <em>baseline</em> resistance for gym earbuds. That said, I haven’t seen or heard of too many people returning AirPods for wrecking them with profuse workout sweating- both are made by and durability-tested by Apple. Just wipe your Powerbeats Pro 2 down and dry them before placing them back in the case. This will save the earbuds and the charging pins in the case from corroding.</p><p>Let’s talk call quality. In a quiet room, the microphones sound great. Connected to a Pixel 9 and making calls, things got a tad muddy in loud urban areas with a lot of background traffic noise. The earbuds did an excellent job canceling that background noise, though. Even though it was a bit muddy, my voice was still audible, and on every call I made, the folks on the other end said I sounded clear.</p><p>Since Beats are marketed to both iOS and Android users, it would be nice to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">hi-res Bluetooth codecs</a> supported. The Powerbeats Pro 2 supports only SBC and AAC codecs, which is okay but could be better.</p>

<p>The competition in this space is relatively nonexistent. There have been previous efforts to bring PPG sensors and heart rate monitoring to earbuds, but they haven’t been all that successful, as Android Central's Wearables editor, Michael Hicks, found out when he put two pair to the test in 2024. I’d love to see how these fare with him because he's a more hardcore runner than I am.</p><p>Currently, the only real competition Powerbeats Pro 2 has is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-momentum-sport-review">Sennheiser Momentum Sport</a>, but as you can read about in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/earbud-heart-rate-accuracy-test" target="_blank">this article from Mr. Hicks</a>, they didn’t quite leave him feeling too confident in their ability to keep up with his needs for his level of running.</p><p>There are some great options if you're looking for non-HRM fitness-focused earbuds. My next personal favorite is the Beats Fit Pro. They're locked in with the only wing tips I like, and they sound great. If you don't want anything blocking your ears, I really enjoy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review" target="_blank">Nothing Ear Open</a>. Their level of open-ear bass response is a market segment-defining feature.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-beats-powerbeats-pro-2-should-you-buy-them"><span>Beats Powerbeats Pro 2: Should you buy them?</span></h2>
<p><strong>You should buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want an excellent pair of gym and everyday carry earbuds</li><li>You box or engage in other exercises where having the monitor on your ears would be advantageous</li><li>You need chest strap accuracy in your heart rate monitor</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn’t buy it if…</strong></p>
<ul><li>You already own a pair of earbuds you’re happy with and just want a chest strap for around $100</li><li>You don’t like ear hook style earbuds</li><li>You need better than IPX4 water resistance.</li></ul>
<p>This is a product that is very useful in the gym. If you’re into boxing or any other activity, like kettlebell workouts, that makes wearing a smartwatch challenging, I cannot recommend the Powerbeats Pro 2 enough.</p><p>I've been way beyond impressed with the level of heart rate monitoring accuracy, and the sound quality on Android and iOS is very good. Movies come alive with Spatial Audio and there's more than enough bass response to satisfy drum and bass listeners without sacrificing clarity for those into more classical instrumentation. And with all of this tech, you'd think battery life would be horrible, but it's very good.</p><p>For their level of heart rate monitoring accuracy, the ear hooks, their sound profile, and the feature set, they are currently my favorite premium workout earbuds.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola is collaborating with Paris Hilton to bring a limited edition color of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-launch">Razr Plus 2024</a>. The company's latest foldable was launched in June last year and features a massive cover screen and a whole host of AI features.</p><p>Dubbed the Paris Pink colorway, the device claims to strike a perfect balance between "elegance and the glamorous air of Paris Hilton." The device will feature Paris Hilton’s autograph and her iconic “That’s Hot” phrase engraved on the hinge. Talking about its overall look, this new hot pink colorway comes with a vegan leather finish and will also showcase a personalized message from Paris Hilton herself.</p><p>This limited edition gets 10 exclusive Paris Hilton-inspired ringtones and notification sounds and 13 of the icon’s favorite wallpapers, "designed to bring her signature style and energy to the device," according to the company's press release. This includes her iconic spin on the “Hello Moto” ringtone to sound effects like her famous “That’s Hot" tagline.</p><p>This isn't the first time that Motorola has collaborated with this fashion icon. Last year, she was the face of the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 launch, and the company's collaboration with the DJ dates back two decades when the brand invited Hilton to perform the iconic flip of the Motorola RAZR V3. The brand has no doubt been hitting all the right notes when it<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-feel-threatened-by-motorola" target="_blank"> comes to marketing</a> its new phone, and banking on nostalgia by bringing back Paris for its launch felt like a great throwback to the late 2000s.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 was initially launched with a Hot Pink colorway, which has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-sets-trend-for-pink-phones" target="_blank">synonymous with the Moto Razr</a> since its inception. When asked about why the brand chose to "pink it up," Maria Jose Martin, director of North American marketing at Motorola, said, "The original RAZR V3 established pink as a fashionable and desirable colorway for smartphones, and has since then always been closely associated with Motorola and the Razr."</p>

<p>This special edition device will also come with exclusive accessories. To start, the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 gets a vegan leather case in a pink shade that's a few tones lighter than the device itself. This case is coupled with two wrist strap options: Pink Sparkle or Pink Vegan Leather. The case will also sport Paris' autograph on the back.</p><p>Additionally,  each limited-edition package comes wrapped in a custom-designed sleeve and a keepsake. The packaging will also have a personalized message from Paris Hilton. The Paris Pink Motorola Razr Plus 2024 will come with all the same features we saw on the original Motorola Razr Plus, giving users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">access to almost all the apps on its large external display</a>, where users can respond to texts, take selfies, or access Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>, without the need to flip open the phone.</p><p>Lastly, the Motorola Razr Plus Paris Hilton Edition will be available in limited quantities starting Feb. 13 for $1,200 exclusively on<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/ca/en/homepage.html" target="_blank"> Motorola.com</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>The hype around Motorola's upcoming Razr 2025 series is building as early renders of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr Plus 2025</a> (or Razr 60 Ultra in some places) have just surfaced.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus (2024)</a> made waves as one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> on the market, solidifying its spot as a standout in the flip phone segment. But now, the hype is shifting to whispers about its successor.</p><p>Courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-motorola-razr-plus-2025" target="_blank">AndroidHeadlines</a>, we’ve got leaked renders of Motorola’s upcoming clamshell foldable device, codenamed Orion. The shots showcase a dark green color paired with a stitched faux leather back, hinting at a luxurious and polished design.</p><p>What sets the Razr Plus 2025 apart is its huge cover display that works seamlessly with all Android apps—something most flip phones can’t match.</p><p>The leaked images don’t show many big design changes. As per the leaked renders, the right edge houses the volume buttons and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner.</p><p>AndroidHeadlines shared a bunch of pics, but the foldable screen inside is still under wraps. One shot hints at a punch-hole camera and slim bezels. Down at the bottom, you’ve got the SIM slot, mic, USB-C port, and speaker all lined up.</p><p>Further on the hardware front, the leak hints that the upcoming device will stick with its 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display and the standout 4-inch OLED cover screen. Under the hood, it’s expected to run on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, probably the seven-core version tweaked for foldables.</p>

<p>It's also likely that the Razr Plus 2025 will rock a dual-camera setup on the back. Though specifics are still unknown, rumors suggest it could combine a wide-angle lens with a telephoto lens—bringing back a feature that was missing in last year’s model.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2025 is also rumored to pack a 4,000mAh battery, likely keeping the 45W wired and 15W wireless charging speeds from its predecessor. But with the possible shift to a 7-core Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, it’s unclear how battery life will hold up. We’ll have to wait for some hands-on testing to see if there’s any real improvement.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-102">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>NotebookLM Plus is now included in the Google One AI Premium plan, giving subscribers more tools at no extra cost.</li><li>Existing subscribers get NotebookLM Plus at no extra charge, with added perks like Gemini Advanced in Gmail, Docs, and 2TB of cloud storage.</li><li>U.S. students 18+ get a 50% discount on the AI Premium plan, lowering the price to $10/month for a year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has rolled NotebookLM Plus into its One AI Premium plan, giving subscribers more advanced tools without upping the price.</p><p>While Gemini works across platforms, its best features sit behind a paywall. Although the basic version is free, unlocking advanced tools and deeper Google integrations costs $20 a month with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Premium. That price might be steep for casual users, but the plan now includes a supercharged version of Google’s note-taking and research tool, making it a much better deal.</p><p>This means existing subscribers get NotebookLM Plus for free, adding to an already solid package. The plan still includes Gemini Advanced in Gmail, Docs, and other Google apps, plus 2TB of cloud storage.</p><p>Furthermore, Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/notebooklm-google-one/" target="_blank">sweetening the deal</a> for U.S. students 18 and up with a 50% discount on the AI Premium plan. For $10 a month (for a year), students get access to features like turning course materials into interactive audio, creating custom AI-powered study tools with Gemini Advanced.</p><p>One standout perk of the premium plan is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-feature-expands-to-more-languages-and-regions">Deep Research</a>, Google’s AI-powered research assistant. It digs into topics on its own, creating a research plan, analyzing sources, and generating a detailed report with citations.</p><p>After a pilot and its December launch, NotebookLM Plus now offers a major upgrade. Compared to the free version, Plus users get five times more capacity—500 notebooks, 300 sources per notebook, 500 daily chats, and 20 audio generations a day.</p><p>NotebookLM Plus also takes things up a notch with big upgrades. On top of the extra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">audio overviews</a>, bigger notebooks, and more queries, Plus users can now customize sharing settings and track daily views, making it easier to see how engaged your audience is.</p><p>Meanwhile, the regular NotebookLM lets users tap into AI for research and organizing notes. It’s now even more interactive, with new features like analyzing YouTube videos and creating podcast-style summaries, where AI hosts chat with users in real time.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="txrzkVYDwfWq6W7MEWrDsL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-19" alt="Not Bar on the Galaxy S25 Plus with music controls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/txrzkVYDwfWq6W7MEWrDsL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3488" height="1962" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Now Bar only works with apps you enabled in Settings. If you forgot to turn one on, go back and do so to start using the feature.</p><p>When the Now bar is enabled, it will show you updates and controls for apps like Maps, Music, and more. For example, open an app like Samsung Health and start a run. To check your running stats, <strong>double-tap your screen or press the Power button </strong>to view the lock screen. At the bottom, you will see the Now Bar with your activity stats, which you can expand for a fuller view by tapping it. When you expand it, you can see additional options, such as the pause and close options. The Now Bar also shows you how much ground you've covered on your run.</p><p>Other times, it will automatically populate with live updates based on what you're doing or certain events you follow. That includes things like sports games, which will show live scores.</p><p>Every app you enable and open to use with the Now Bar will be waiting for you on your lock screen. Let's say you want to return to using a specific app, but when you turn on your screen, it's not the one the Now Bar is showing. To find the app you're looking for, swipe up on the Now Bar until you find it. If you swipe down or to the sides, nothing happens.</p><p>If you want more options on the Now Bar, long-press on it to see more. You can choose from options such as dismiss or Now Bar settings. However, some apps may not have the function to remove or modify settings while on the lock screen.</p>

<h2 id="making-using-apps-even-easier-2">Making using apps even easier</h2>
<p>The Now Bar feature on One UI 7 is very helpful because it provides important information without requiring you to unlock your Galaxy S25. One upside is that you can even interact with it from AOD (Always On Display), which makes it more convenient. If you think about it, it's great to view data from an app and save battery life in the process.</p><p>It's worth noting that support is still pretty limited, so the list of apps that can take advantage of it isn't expansive at the moment.</p><p>Still, not only do you get a great feature, but you're experiencing it on one of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">Android phones</a>, one with a sleek design and refreshed camera modules.</p>

<p>Motorola recently introduced two new smartphones, and when it comes to the Moto G 2025 vs. Moto G Power 2025, while they might sound identical in name and contain many of the same features, there are some crucial differences between these two phones. What are they, do you need to upgrade to the more premium option, and which one will better suit your needs? We’re here to help with that.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-power-2025-vs-moto-g-2025-design-and-basic-features-2">Moto G Power 2025 vs. Moto G 2025: Design and basic features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="aRZZuiR98SCirkhtobFBuf" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-leaf-green-lifestyle" alt="Someone holding a Leaf Green Moto G Power 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aRZZuiR98SCirkhtobFBuf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1778" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the higher-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch">Moto G Power 2025</a>. It comes in Leaf Green or Slate Gray with a 6.8-inch 2,388 x 1,080 LCD with 1,000 nits brightness and 120Hz refresh rate. That’s a significantly higher resolution screen than the HD+ display on the Moto G 2025.</p><p>With vegan leather on the back, the screen is Gorilla Glass 5, making it much more durable. In fact, this phone also sports both an IP68 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> water-resistance rating and meets MIL-STD-810H certification. This means it can not only be submerged in water but can also withstand high-pressure jets, as well as drops from as high as four feet, temperatures from -4 to 140°F, and 95% humidity.</p><p>The only other phone to have this rating is the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13</a>. It’s a pretty big deal for those who want to use their phone in virtually any setting, from the beach to the boat and while out on adventures. It's definitely an odd but welcome inclusion on an entry-level device.</p><p>The battery is a decent 5,000mAh and the phone supports 30W wired charging with Motorola TurboPower as well as 15W wireless charging. It comes with 128GB built-in storage with no bigger option. But you can expand this to up to 1TB with an optional microSD card. Grabbing a card (or two) and adding that to the bottom line cost is worth it because 128GB might not be enough if you plan to download tons of apps, snap loads of photos, and capture video.</p><p>A rarity nowadays, the Moto G Power 2025 comes with a 3.5mm jack for plugging in wired headphones. These might be a preference or a backup option in a pinch with a pair of secondary wired earbuds or headphones. There are two mics and stereo speakers with support for Dolby Atmos, Hi-Res Audio, and Bass Boost.</p><p>You get a fingerprint read, face unlock, and ThinkShield security along with Moto Secure, Family Space, and Hello UX. Less than 9mm thin, it’s comparable in size to the Moto G 2025, though it is a tad heavier.</p>

<p>Introduced in late January 2025 alongside the Moto G Power 2025, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a> comes in two finish options: Forest Gray or Sapphire Blue. It has a slightly smaller 6.7-inch LCD with a resolution that’s much lower at 1,604 x 720 and the same 120Hz refresh rate. However, Sutrich points out that the new Sunlight Mode improves the phone’s visibility in bright sunlight compared to the previous-generation model.</p><p>You’ll get the same vegan leather back that Nicholas Sutrich says in his review feels lighter than it is, plus Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on the screen, which isn’t quite as durable. This phone also only meets the IP52 specification for a water-repellent design. So, it can withstand splashes of water but can’t be submerged and certainly not function with high-powered water jets or extreme temperatures.</p><p>The battery is similarly 5,000mAh and can last all day, even up to three days for some users, says Sutrich, while it also supports up to 30W fast wired charging. However, the Moto G 2025 doesn’t support wireless charging, so keep this in mind if you use a wireless charger at home, in the car, or even at your desk at the office.</p><p>The built-in storage is limited to 128GB with this phone as well, but you can pop in an optional microSD card to increase this to up to 1TB, a nice feature that is rarely found in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">entry-level smartphones</a> nowadays. Another nicety is the 3.5mm jack, so you can plug in wired headphones or earbuds as well. This is combined with three microphones, one more than in the Moto G 2025, and stereo speakers that support both Dolby Atmos and Bass Boost.</p><p>For security, you get a fingerprint reader, face unlock, and ThinkShield. There’s also NFC, GPS, and dual SIMs, along with 5G connectivity. Both phones include two years of software updates and three years of security patches. This doesn’t compare to more premium devices that are supported for up to seven years, but it’s impressive for budget phones.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-power-2025-vs-moto-g-2025-the-specs-2">Moto G Power 2025 vs. Moto G 2025: The specs</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<h2 id="moto-g-power-2025-vs-moto-g-2025-performance-2">Moto G Power 2025 vs. Moto G 2025: Performance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZcVxUJRotrYb5KjBH7jD3D" name="moto-g-2025-hello-ui-quick-toggles" alt="The optional "modern" quick tiles option in Hello UI on the Moto G 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZcVxUJRotrYb5KjBH7jD3D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking beyond specs, aesthetics, and basic features, which of these phones will meet your day-to-day needs? They are both relatively affordable options, both decent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300">Android phones under $300</a>. But there are some big differences beyond durability that could sway you in one direction or the other.</p><p>Both phones come with a MediaTek Dimensity 6300, which feels like a bit of a downgrade from the Snapdragon processor in the previous generation versions, although that may not be the full story. The Moto G Power 2025, has double the RAM at 8GB, which can be expanded using the RAM Boost feature that converts storage to RAM.</p><p>While the Moto G 2025 has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">RAM Boost</a> as well, it comes with only 4GB RAM. Sutrich has noted in the past that RAM Boost severely impacted the performance of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a> that he’s tried it with, but he finds that it has improved drastically with this device, which he chalks up to the switch from Qualcomm to MediaTek. While he admits that the phone can be sluggish at times, it isn’t as much so as with previous generation models. He enjoyed playing games on the phone, including Minecraft,<em> </em>and notes that the phone handled them well. It’s a “surprisingly good mobile gaming machine,” he says.</p><p>Both run on the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> OS as well as have features like Moto Secure, Family Space, and more. They also work with things like gesture control. Sutrich loves Motorola’s gesture controls, including features like being able to double-chop the phone to toggle the flashlight, double-twist to launch the camera, or double-tap on the back to instantly open a favorite app. “These are small things,” he says, “but they add up to big convenience and quickly turn into muscle memory.”</p><p>So, in terms of the OS and processing power, both phones are quite similar with the Moto G Power 2025 simply having double the RAM to keep up with more demanding tasks and multitasking. They won’t compete with higher-end, more premium phones. But considering both phones are affordable options, it comes down to if you need the extra power you get with the additional RAM.</p>

<p>I’ll preface this by saying that neither phone will take photos that will thoroughly impress you. They take decent photos but won’t hold a candle to the cameras and AI editing capabilities found in the most premium devices. If you just want a phone that can take decent pics for social sharing or posterity, however, they will both fit the bill.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 has a 50MP main camera, an 8MP ultrawide camera with a macrovision lens, and a 16MP front camera with a Face Retouch feature designed to help reduce wrinkles and blemishes. For those who love taking selfies for social media, this is a nice plus.</p><p>There’s also an ambient light sensor, OIS for stable and blur-free images, and Quad Pixel technology for ensuring great photos in various lighting conditions.</p><p>The Moto G 2025 has the same 50MP main camera and 16MP front camera but adds another 2MP Macro camera instead of the much-preferred ultrawide instead. It has similar features like night vision, portrait, pro mode, selfie animation, and gesture selfies. It can also capture videos at 30fps, as can the Moto G Power 2025.</p><p>Sutrich says the Moto G 2025 camera is a step up from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G 5G 2024</a>, and in fact, he finds it to be the best camera he has used in any budget-friendly phone. We haven’t yet had the opportunity to test the cameras in the Moto G Power 2025, but the camera quality on the lower-end model is promising.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PvJPszGKmombzcGNrsF5DL" name="moto-g-2025-back-texture" alt="The lovely vegan leather back texture on the Moto G 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PvJPszGKmombzcGNrsF5DL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the Moto G Power 2025 vs. Moto G 2025, it comes down solely to price. Both are budget phones, with the Moto G Power 2025 coming in at a $100 delta over the Moto G 2025. If you want the slightly larger and much higher resolution screen and more RAM, it’s worth saving the extra $100 to get this one. That's especially so if you plan to watch a lot of videos and will make use of the extra resolution.</p><p>The major reason, however, is for the additional durability. With an IP68 and IP69 rating, you can virtually take this phone anywhere. For someone who might be accident-prone, like a teen or grandparent, it’s worth it for peace of mind. If you’re an adventurer who loves to partake in activities like skiing or surfing and has the phone with you to capture memories, or you’re a field worker, you’ll feel much more comfortable having this ultra-durable device as well.</p><p>With that said, if durability is really a key factor in your decision, along with being able to capture memories on the go, you might be better off with a phone like the OnePlus 13 that sports both IP68 and IP69 ratings as well. It has way better cameras, along with a better processor and more RAM. But it also costs a lot more.</p><p>If durability isn’t a concern and you’re going to use a protective case anyway, the Moto G 2025 might do you just fine. With both devices, you’ll sadly have to upgrade after at least three years or do without crucial security updates once that time elapses. So, either this phone is for someone who just needs the basics or is a transitional phone until you save up for something more expensive. That makes the decision between them even tougher.</p><p>Bottom line: the additional RAM and extra durability of the Moto G Power 2025 are worth the extra dough. But if you don’t think you need either, just go with the Moto G 2025 and start saving now for something more premium down the line.</p>

But considering the price is so low, it's still the better value of the two options in the entry space. </p></p>

<hr>
<p>A potential leak has shed light on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> update timeline for the Galaxy S24 FE, even as the stable version remains elusive for the rest of the S24 series.</p><p>Looks like we might finally have a clue about when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> will get One UI 7. Leaker Tarun Vats dropped a hint that it could land around March 31, 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/one-ui-7-finally-gets-a-rumored-launch-date-on-the-galaxy-s24-fe/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive‼️ Sources say the One UI 7 update for the Galaxy S24 FE might drop on March 31, 2025 📅 I only have information for this device; expect a stable update for the S24 series earlier than the 31st.Repost pic.twitter.com/QaqGXGP1uz<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1888939854534205708">February 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Take this date with a grain of salt, though. While March 31 sounds like a solid target, firmware rollouts can be pretty unpredictable. Development timelines shift all the time, so things might still change.</p><p>Currently, the stable version of One UI 7 is only available on the brand-new Galaxy S25 series. While it’s expected to hit more devices, like the Galaxy S24, down the line, the S24 has been busy testing One UI 7 for the past few months. Interestingly, even with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-february-2025-patch-for-galaxy-s24-arrives-amid-one-ui-7-delays">February 2025 security update</a>, the S24 series is still stuck on One UI 6.1.1.</p><p>If the leak is accurate, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, S24 Plus, and S24 may be first in line for the One UI 7 update, beating the S24 FE to the punch. So assuming the rumors hold up, the main S24 series could get it sometime before March 31.</p><p>Since the Galaxy S24 series has been the only one testing One UI 7 in the beta program, it is a safe bet that the S24 FE won’t be at the front of the line for the stable update.</p>

<p>Juggling chats across a bunch of different apps is a pain, and Google seems to be trying to fix that with a new feature that pulls all your important conversations into one place.</p><p>Originally called "Besties" and later "VIPs," this feature has now been rebranded as "Pixel Besties," according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/whatsapp-google-pixel-besties-vips-integration-apk-teardown-3524461/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. At its heart, it's designed to allow users to create a handpicked list of their go-to contacts—basically, the people they chat with the most.</p><p>As per the outlet, the feature could roll out with the next Pixel QPR update, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> might be the first third-party app to jump on board with the integration.</p><p>Once a contact is added to your "Pixel Besties" list, all your chats, calls, location shares, and even the option to "create new memories" with them will be pulled together into one neat, unified space.</p><p>The latest WhatsApp beta (version 2.25.3.22) hints at a central hub for Pixel Besties, powered by something called com.whatsapp.pixel.besties.provider.PixelBestiesApiContentProvider. This hub will serve as the go-between for apps like WhatsApp, making it easy to share and update stuff like messages and call logs.</p><p>Digging into the code, it looks like the Pixel Besties feature might live in its own app, possibly called "Pixel Relationship" (com.google.android.apps.pixel.relationships). It might even include a home screen widget.</p><p>At first, it’ll presumably pull in data from Google Messages and WhatsApp, but other platforms—especially Google’s and Meta’s Messenger—are likely to join the party later.</p><p>This new find follows the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-whatsapp-video-calls-apk-teardown-3524139/" target="_blank">recent buzz</a> about Google possibly adding a WhatsApp video call button directly into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>. Right now, Google Meet is the go-to for video calls, kicking in whenever you hit the video call button in one-on-one or group chats.</p><p>That move would make chatting across platforms way smoother. But now, it seems like the integration could go even further than we first thought.</p>

<p>As far as affordable yet feature-rich phones go, Motorola is at or near the top of the list. The brand has tons of great phones you can get for less, albeit with concessions when it comes to features, power, and construction. Two models to consider are the Moto G 2025 and Moto G 5G 2024. One is brand new, while the other launched less than a year ago. What makes them different, and which should you get? Or should you upgrade if you have already invested in the Moto G 5G 2024?</p><p>We’re here to help you make that decision in this Moto G 2025 vs. Moto G 5G 2024 comparison.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a>, introduced in late January 2025, comes in Forest Gray or Sapphire Blue with a 6.7-inch super bright ultra-wide HD+ LCD that boasts 1,604 x 720 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. That’s nothing to write home about but will suffice for those who just want a simple phone they can use for communicating and web surfing as well as watching videos and even light gaming. In fact, Android Central's Phone editor, Nicholas Sutrich, calls the display "eye-friendly," particularly for anyone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>.</p><p>With a vegan leather back, the screen is covered by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and employs an IP52 water-repellent design, which means it can withstand light exposure to splashes, but it cannot be submerged.</p><p>Equipped with a 5,000mAh battery, it is capable of wired charging at up to 30W and supports faster charging speeds. You’ll get more than a day of use per charge, says Motorola. However, this phone doesn’t support wireless charging.</p><p>It only comes with 128GB storage, but the good news is that it supports additional storage via microSD card up to 1TB in size. Even when factoring this into the cost, you’re still coming out ahead by being able to store tons of apps, photos, videos, documents, and more in the device with this small add-on investment.</p><p>Another appreciated inclusion is a 3.5mm jack, something that’s rare in new phones nowadays. This allows you to connect a favorite pair of wired headphones or even a backup pair of wired earbuds to use when your wireless ones aren’t working, or the battery is dead (or for those who simply prefer it). It has three microphones and stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support and Bass Boost.</p><p>With access to Google Assistant, the thin and lightweight phone includes other useful features, too, like a fingerprint reader, face unlock, ThinkShield security, NFC, GPS, and dual SIMs. While it isn’t in the name, this is indeed a 5G phone as well.</p>

<p>Last year’s version, the Moto G 5G 2024, comes in only one finish option, Sage Green. It has a vegan leather back that Sutrich says in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G 5G 2024 review</a> “looks as good as it feels,” along with a slightly smaller 6.6-inch HD+ LCD with 1,612 x 720 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, so there’s no huge upgrade there with the newer phone.</p><p>The screen is the same Gorilla Glass 3 and it has a water-repellent description but no official water-resistance rating. The battery is the same 5,000mAh, but it charges much more slowly at a max rate of 18W, though it does support TurboCharging, and Motorola says it can last for over a day. It does not support wireless charging either.</p><p>It, too, comes with 128GB built-in storage with the option to expand up to 1TB via an optional microSD card. It also has a 3.5mm jack, so you don’t have to curse on the airplane when you realize you forgot to charge your wireless headphones and want to enjoy the seatback entertainment system.</p><p>Also thin and lightweight with access to Google Assistant, you get the same fingerprint reader, face unlock, and stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. It only has two mics versus three but also includes NFC, dual SIM, GPS, and, of course, 5G connectivity. Note that this phone, however, has the older Bluetooth 5.1 spec, so you might not enjoy as reliable a connection with other devices like headphones and speakers.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uTof3cXM2BePqoMycbjnxW" name="Moto-G-5G-2024-hero.jpg" alt="The vegan leather back of the Moto G 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uTof3cXM2BePqoMycbjnxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that you have an idea of how these two phones compare when it comes to specs let’s look at how they compare when it comes to performance.</p><p>The Moto G 2025 comes equipped with a MediaTek Dimensity 6300 processor, which may seem like a downgrade from the Snapdragon processor found in the previous generation model. Sutrich says it works well, but it has a tendency to feel sluggish whenever you do anything on the phone for the first time. It has 4GB RAM that you can expand to up to 8GB when using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">RAM Boost</a>, which can actually improve performance a bit. This leverages the phone’s storage, converting it to additional RAM as needed. A feature like this is fairly hit or miss, based on Sutrich’s observations with the Moto G 5G 2024, noted below.</p><p>Running on the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> OS, you get features like audio sharing, enhanced accessibility (ideal for aging grandparents), and smart connect. There are also two years of major software updates and three years of security updates. This is not nearly as good as you’ll get with more premium phones from brands like Samsung and Google. But given the price of this device as an affordable alternative, chances are you’ll be upgrading within the two years anyway. But this means it doesn’t have a high resale value.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TG5rAcAiCrSenzAayCjW2D" name="moto-g-2025-display-lock-screen-customization" alt="Customizing the lock screen on a Moto G 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TG5rAcAiCrSenzAayCjW2D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By comparison, the Moto G 5G 2024 runs on a Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 processor and affords 4GB RAM, expandable up to 8GB, with the RAM Boost option as well. But Sutrich advises not to use it, noting that it results in a worse overall experience. He found that turning on RAM Boost made switching among apps unreliable, even unstable. That said, his experience with RAM Boost the Moto G 2025 was much better, suggesting improvements on Motorola's end on how it handles this feature.</p><p>The Moto G 5G 2024 runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, and you only get one major software upgrade and three years of security. That means once you update it to Android 15, that’s it. While you’ll still be able to securely use this phone for several more years, you won’t be able to update it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>.</p><p>This is an important thing to note because it means the phone has a much more limited life. If you’re getting it for a killer deal as a first phone for a teen, for example, or to test the waters with grandma or grandpa before investing in something more expensive, it might be worth it. Otherwise, this phone may have run its operational course. Indeed, Sutrich says that this phone’s performance is already lacking, so within a few years, once support ends, it will likely feel “painfully sluggish.”</p><p>On the plus side, Sutrich loves some of the cool navigation features of the Moto G 5G 2024, like double-chopping to toggle the flashlight and other similar gesture controls. You can also find these on the newer phone, which Sutrich also notes as a plus.</p>

<p>Neither of these phones is going to capture images and videos that hold a candle to more premium smartphones that have more advanced cameras and camera-related features. But you will still be able to get decent images from them.</p><p>The Moto G 2025 has a 50MP main camera, an ambient light sensor, and a 2MP Macro camera for getting up close with subjects. On the front is a 16MP selfie camera. You’ll get features like night vision, portrait, and Pro mode, and the phone can capture HD video at 30fps. There are also neat features like selfie animation and gesture selfies, perfect for teens wanting to take pics with their besties.</p><p>The Moto G 5G 2024 has the same 50MP main camera but its front selfie camera is half the resolution at 8MP. That’s almost laughable by today’s standards. You’ll be able to get fun Instagram-worthy shots or shoot passable TikTok videos. But this isn’t an advanced camera capture device.</p><p>There’s a similar suite of photo features as well with the Moto G 5G 2024, including portrait, pro mode, auto smile, and gesture selfie. For videos, you can capture the same HD videos at 30fps.</p><p>You can see some comparisons between the cameras below:</p>

<p>Sutrich says Motorola, unfortunately, oversells the cameras on the Moto G 5G 2024, and you won’t get “flawless shots day or night” as promised. You will get decent shots, but he found them all to be soft, even ones taken during the day. He adds that the 2MP Macro camera is basically useless, nothing more than a gimmick, while the selfie camera is weak, delivering similarly soft images in every situation.</p><p>By comparison, Sutrich says the camera on the Moto G 2025 "has significantly improved quality over last year's" model, improving aspects such as dynamic range, fine details, noise in low light, white balance, and even capture speed. However, he laments the lack of an ultrawide camera and wishes Motorola would switch it for an ultrawide.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pVKeCWdtfh5JrPDjcftcYW" name="Moto-G-5G-2024-bottom.jpg" alt="The ports on the bottom of the Moto G 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pVKeCWdtfh5JrPDjcftcYW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Considering these phones cost the same, it’s a no-brainer to go for the Moto G 2025 if you’re buying new. While it moves from a Snapdragon to a MediaTek Dimensity processor, the performance is still enough to meet entry-level needs. Plus, you get faster wired charging, a more durable design, a slightly bigger screen, and a selfie camera that is double the resolution.</p><p>If you’re upgrading, however, the decision between the Moto G 2025 vs. Moto G 5G 2024 is a more difficult one. If you already own the Moto G 5G 2024, you probably don’t need to upgrade to the Moto G 2025 unless you really love it and want something you can hang onto for a few more years beyond Android 15.</p><p>Your best bet is to hold onto the Moto G 5G 2024 for another year, save up, and get something a bit more expensive. If you really want to upgrade now and want to stick with the Motorola brand, go with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch">Moto G Power 2025</a> instead, which was launched alongside the Moto G 2025. It’s a much bigger step up that will afford additional benefits and features. And it’s not much more in price.</p><p>Still, the Moto 5 2025 may rank among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300" target="_blank">best Android phones under $300,</a> given Sutrich's glowing review of the phone, so it's well worth looking at for your next phone. But if you want something a little more robust and prefer to stick with Motorola, we do name the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G (2024)</a> on that list after it received some steep discounts. Otherwise, it might be worth exploring other options if you’re on a tight budget, or wait, save up, and go with something that requires a bit more coin.</p>

<ul><li>Meta’s new Language Technology Partner Program needs volunteers to submit transcribed speech, translations, and written text.</li><li>Contributors get to work with Meta’s AI experts and receive training on open-source language tools.</li><li>The Canadian territory, home to endangered Inuit languages, is already on board.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta and UNESCO are joining forces to advance open-source AI by collecting speech and text data as part of a new program to understand and translate underrepresented languages, making AI more inclusive globally.</p><p>Meta’s new Language Technology Partner Program is on the hunt for contributors to help build its AI. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/02/announcing-language-technology-partner-program/" target="_blank">says</a> it is looking for people to pitch in with at least 10 hours of transcribed speech recordings, pre-translated sentences, and a solid chunk of written content in their native language.</p><p>This data will be the backbone of Meta’s AI development, helping it better understand and translate languages that often get left behind.</p><p>Meta is offering a chance for partners to team up directly with their AI experts, helping weave new languages into open-source speech and translation models. As a bonus, contributors will get hands-on training through workshops, learning the ropes of Meta’s open-source language tools.</p><p>Nunavut, a Canadian region home to at-risk Inuit languages, has already signed on to join the initiative. You have until March 7, 2025, to apply for the Language Technology Partner Program.</p><p>Alongside the new program, Meta is rolling out an open-source machine translation benchmark to test how well language translation models perform. Created by linguists, it currently works with seven languages and is available on the Hugging Face platform, where anyone can pitch in and contribute.</p><p>Meta’s new language program rides on the success of earlier projects., including "No Language Left Behind (NLLB), which cracked the code on translating a ton of languages. Then came "Massively Multilingual Speech" (MMS), which blew minds by transcribing over 1,100 languages.</p><p>It's clear that Meta AI keeps expanding its language capabilities, while also rolling out cool features like auto-translation for content creators. Last September, the company even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate">teased a voice translation tool for Instagram Reels</a>, letting creators dub and lip-sync their videos automatically.</p><p>Big players in translation tech are also stepping up for endangered languages. Google, for instance, brought Inuktut (an Inuit language) on board in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nunatsiaq.com/stories/article/google-translate-adds-inuktut-language-to-its-online-service/" target="_blank">October 2024</a>.</p><p>For its part, Meta pitches these initiatives as acts of goodwill, but let’s be real—the company is also cashing in on the breakthroughs in speech and translation AI.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new OnePlus smartwatch is just around the corner. The company revealed the first full look of its OnePlus Watch 3, which will launch on February 18 in the US, Canada, and European markets.</p><p>In a detailed press release, the OnePlus claims that this new watch is set to blend in with the user's daily needs with a "classic, premium, and durable design." That said, the company is going full throttle on its "Never Settle" mantra by offering the Watch 3 with a whopping 16-day battery life on power saver mode and a prolonged 120 hours of battery on Smart mode. This is a bump from the 100-hour limit on its predecessor.</p><p>However, the company points out that the "actual battery life varies depending on the features and apps used, frequency of calls and messages, number of times charged, and many other factors."</p><p>While it didn't dive much into the specs of the wearable, the presser emphasized the watch will bring "cutting-edge sensors, industry-leading battery life, and advanced health algorithms."</p><p>At its core, the OnePlus Watch 3 is powered by the Snapdragon W5 for its performance chipset and a new BES2800 MCU efficiency chipset. The tech company explains that the increase in power efficiency comes from a 'fabrication technique' of the BES2800 chipset, which is built on advanced 6nm FinFET.</p><p>Additionally, the wearable comes equipped with the OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, in tandem with its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13 </a>series, which helps "boost energy density for long-lasting power within a slim design," the presser adds.</p><p>Talking about battery, this time, the OnePlus Watch 3 comes with a larger 631mAh battery compared to the 500mAh on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, backing up the promise of longer battery life for the device. This larger battery is said to gain its full capacity after a quick 10-minute charge, which will power the watch for a full day's use.</p>

<p>While we kind of get the idea of what the insides of the  OnePlus Watch 3 are said to carry, in terms of design it looks a bit more rugged than the Watch 2. OnePlus Watch 3 maintains the same stainless steel casing from its previous model but comes with a new titanium alloy bezel and PVD coating that ensures it gets through life's wear and tear. The watch has a 2D Sapphire Crystal display that brings a brighter screen to the wearable.</p><p>Furthermore, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/exclusive-oneplus-watch-3-revealed-with-an-apple-watch-style-rotating-digital-crown-and-galaxy-watch-beating-battery-life">OnePlus revealed to TechRadar</a> that the watch will now feature a functional rotating crown, something that was curiously missing with the last model.</p><p>OnePlus Watch 3 will be available in two colors — Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium. The Emerald Titanium will feature a silver titanium bezel and a stainless steel body, as well as a green fluoro rubber strap with a stainless steel buckle. OnePlus says that the Emerald Titanium finish, which was inspired by nature, "exhibits the ideal balance of dynamic athleticism, signifying development and energy." The Obsidian model comes with a black titanium bezel and a stainless steel body, also with a black fluoro rubber strap with a stainless steel buckle.</p><p>We don't have much info on how much this wearable could cost, but interested folks are urged to tune into its launch video via its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://youtube.com/@OnePlus_Europe/videos" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> on Feb. 18 at 8 a.m. ET.</p>

<p>Hi Mark! this is an excellent and timely question that I think a lot of people have, even if they don't understand how any of it works.</p><p>I'm no economist, but I know a bit about manufacturing and have looked into this myself; I'm concerned about it, too. The quick answer for anyone who doesn't want to read the whole article: tariffs and other trade restrictions will make prices go up. It won't be some sort of doomsday situation where even a basic phone costs thousands of dollars, but the companies that make phones will have increased costs and likely have to deal with new restrictions placed by China in retaliation. All of these increases (and a bit more) will be passed on to customers.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-tariff-2">What is a tariff?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:782px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.88%;"><img id="5gdZ995GQ9ApFsmXWKRqyF" name="amazon-boxes-5xas.jpg" alt="Amazon Prime boxes" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5gdZ995GQ9ApFsmXWKRqyF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="782" height="523" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>To try and understand what might happen, you need to know what a tariff is. It's a tax placed on goods that are imported from other countries. Companies that send products to the United States pay these taxes to the government before their goods are allowed into the country.</p><p>If an overseas company sends goods that are valued at $10 each, they would be charged $1 per item with a 10% tariff. Usually, these fees are passed along to the company buying the imported products, so instead of paying $10 each, that company now pays $11 each.</p><p>There have always been tariffs and levies in place, and you've always been paying for them because they are built into the cost of a product. When those tariffs are increased, the fees will trickle down to you, and you'll pay more.</p>
<p>Most countries have what's known as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pimco.com/us/en/resources/education/understanding-the-de-minimis-tax-rule">De Minimis Value</a> when it comes to imported goods. De Minimis is a Latin phrase that means something is so insignificant that it can be ignored, and a country decides what that value is.</p><p>In the U.S., the De Minimis Value threshold is $800. In Canada, it's USD 20. In Australia, it's USD 1,000. It can vary a lot, and it's a way for countries to help balance trading fees with consumer costs. It also means most phones built and assembled in China don't have extra duty fees because their original value is far less than USD 800.</p><p>The current U.S. administration is considering nullifying the current De Minimis exemptions, so a 10% tariff on all goods coming from China, even ones that were currently under $800 in value and exempt, will now be levied. This would be a direct-to-consumer increase on things like phones that are built in and shipped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-camera-specs-and-launch-date-confirmed">directly from China</a>.</p><p>These costs all trickle down to the consumer, too.</p>

<p>I don't think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/north-american-smartphone-market-2025-predictions-expectations">this is as alarming</a> as headlines like to make it sound. I don't think it is a smart move (did I mention that I'm <em><strong>not</strong></em> an economist?), but I can't see the sky falling and people fighting over loaves of bread in some apocalyptic nightmare scenario. The cheap consumer goods you love to buy are simply going to cost a little more.</p><p>The real impact will be on shareholders in the companies importing and selling these products. A 10% tariff on your next phone could mean you'll pay $20 more for it, but 10% of 10 million is a lot of money when it's all added up.</p><p>The initial reactions are not great — stock prices are falling and the market is down over 400 points (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html">as of last week</a>) over fears and anxiety about the proposed trade law changes. It could steady itself, or it could get worse. One certain thing is that the executives from these companies have a lot to say about it and are in positions where their voices make a difference.</p>
<p>You and I complain that a new phone costs a little more. The execs at Qualcomm or Apple complain too, but the difference is that their complaints are to people who can make changes. Those government officials will listen, too. They love having big tech companies in their area and will do plenty of favors and pull a lot of strings to ensure the tech giants get what they want. Is it fair? Nope. It's simply the reality of how U.S. capitalism works.</p><p>These tech giants — even companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s24-ultra-just-broke-new-ground-for-android-flagships">Samsung,</a> which don't import as many things from China — will react if when anything that affects their bottom line happens. They know there is a limit to how much they can increase consumer prices, and when it is reached, any other fees and costs of doing business come from their coffers.</p><p>Love it or hate it, big business controls the economy in the United States and will look out for its best interests. This time, one of their interests (lower costs) aligns with ours.</p>
<p>One last thing I want to mention — you might already be seeing companies talk about how they have to increase prices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1886884088029831655?t=ISED9AEidCo_EsAekxg6OQ" target="_blank">because of these new trade laws</a>. Remember that they haven't paid anything extra yet and are raising prices on goods they already have.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube Music is likely to see some redesign for its Now Playing screen.</li><li>The music streaming service could shift the popular audio/video switcher from top to bottom right below the playback controls.</li><li>The redesign could include the rearrangement of playback controls and other "like," "comments, " and "save" buttons.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube Music has many convenient features. The music streaming service blends seamlessly with its sibling YouTube with a tap on the single interchangeable button right above the album cover on the Now Playing screen. New evidence, however, indicates that the feature is likely shifting.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/06/youtube-music-song-video-switcher/">9to5Google</a>, YouTube Music might soon replace the audio/video switcher with a new native button right above the “Up next”, “Lyrics”, and “Related” tabs. The new “video” button will sit right alongside the other popular like/dislike, comments, and save buttons. For the uninitiated, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming service</a> introduced the feature in 2019, which lets users switch between song and corresponding video without pausing the playback.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="RZDzVhmc2Cysy8MKbJ9xX7" name="youtube-music-redesign-2025" alt="YouTube Music's Now Playing screen redesign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RZDzVhmc2Cysy8MKbJ9xX7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The latest shifting of the switcher icon makes the Now Playing screen top pane settle with just the cast icon. Also, the new change appears to be part of a redesign spotted back in November 2024. It makes the aforementioned like, comments, and save buttons next to the new video button appear right below the playback controls as opposed to the current scenario where those buttons stay on top of the playback controls.</p><p>The redesign rollout still needs to be determined even though it was spotted more than a couple of months ago. Some of the YouTube Music users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/1ijb2mx/change_on_ui/">on Reddit</a> have also noticed the changes. Per the post’s opinions received, users feel the pill-shaped audio/video switcher up top appears more pronounced — although having it right below the controls is handy to reach.</p>
<p>Some other users also point out that having the cast button positioned below the playback controls is more handy than the audio/video switcher. Since the music streaming service appears to be testing the redesign, it could be further changed by the final official rollout.</p><p>In other news, YouTube has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-new-experimental-features-4x-speeds-and-jump-ahead">recently rolled out</a> experimental features for its premium tier users. The notable ones amongst them include the ability to watch a YouTube video at 4x speed. Then there’s another nifty feature dubbed Jump Ahead, which should help users jump to their favorite content even faster.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Super Bowl ads usually have two flavors: sentimental, sappy messages about love and acceptance or corny, celebrity-filled comedy routines that stick in your memory. Google took the first route to great effect, while Meta flopped hard with the second approach. And it was ChatGPT's Super Bowl commercial that really stood out amid the usual fare.</p><p>Having reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> — and as a casual fan of Thor and Star-Lord — I was looking forward to some goofy himbos learning about the world through Meta AI and looking stylish doing it.</p><p>Instead, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/Rp2qgvIbirI">both ad</a> spots fixated on mocking modern art for laughs — which feels a bit mean-spirited when you think about AI stealing art and putting artists out of work — and, more importantly, didn't make it clear to non-tech people what the glasses actually <em>do</em> that's helpful in their daily lives.</p>

<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cqwXxUo_q8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The Super Bowl ad banked too much on star power and not enough on the inherent need people have to learn more about the world around them. I'd have put the glasses on an inquisitive child actor instead, with a parent relieved that someone else is answering "What's this?" over and over.</p><p>It's not like Meta isn't already doing a good job getting these on people's faces. Meta sold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-sold-over-1-million-units-of-ray-ban-smart-glasses-in-2024">one million AI glasses</a> last year and will start <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">selling Oakleys next</a> with the same Meta AI smarts, so this ad seemed like it could jumpstart the journey towards <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-wants-billions-of-ai-glasses-worldwide-is-that-possible">"hundreds of millions" of smart glasses</a> that Mark Zuckerberg wants. But I don't know if anyone watching the ad would have seen a compelling reason to buy the Ray-Bans.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google's Pixel 9 with Gemini Live Super Bowl commercial didn't focus that much on the tech specifics either, but it worked more effectively because of the underlying heart behind it. Where so many other commercials tapped into the political landscape and discussed hate and loving your neighbor, Google focused on familial love and believing in yourself, with some subtle AI thrown in there.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-7e6g11BJc0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The commercial starts with a man practicing for a job interview before reminiscing about his life as a father, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> helpfully prompting certain memories and rephrasing statements to make him sound confident and qualified.</p><p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-incorrect-gemini-response-was-actually-faked-entirely-for-super-bowl-ad">other Super Bowl ads may have inspired controversy</a>, but this one tugs at the heartstrings whether you're a parent or a child of loving parents, and it's bookended by the focus on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> and the simple idea that you can have a meaningful and professionally helpful conversation with your phone. Whether the reality lives up to the ad or not, it was effective!</p><p>The ChatGPT ad pleasantly stood out in a sea of forced sentimentality and hammy joke cameos. Even for folks who know little about AI, the message is straightforward: this technology is about to explode. It's built to help people with a variety of tasks, and AI is a canvas that lets anyone be creative and give life to ideas they couldn't generate solely on their own.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kIhb5pEo_j0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Plus, you can't deny that the visuals looked <em>very</em> cool — a combination of retro and futuristic. When every commercial has a Matthew McConaughey — whose Salesforce Super Bowl <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/s4JNLL7U8H8">commercial</a> was extremely vague about what AI actually does — the ChatGPT pitch to the world stood out more than the rest.</p><p>I also counted a few app and website commercials with celeb or comedian cameos like DoorDash (Nate Bargatze), Homes.com (Morgan Freeman), Squarespace (Barry Keoghan), and TurboTax (Issa Rae) that were all cute and harmless enough, but not necessarily standing out from the pack.</p><p>Then there was the T-Mobile/Starlink ad for the "only space-based network" that'll target 500,000 square miles of U.S. dead zones, with free coverage for T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T customers through July.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HLw6ZovMpLI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>This partnership has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-spacex-starlink-coverage-above-beyond">been in the works since 2022</a>, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile-customers-direct-to-cell-beta-registration">beta launching last month</a>. Frankly, this commercial was very straightforward; it didn't have much of a "wow" factor, or a pithy "Can you hear me now?" tagline. I doubt it stuck in very many people's minds, amidst the Chiefs' epic Super Bowl flop and the Eagles' heroics. And that's a shame, because it's certainly a cool promotion.</p>
<hr>
<p>Our country's collective obsession with Super Bowl commercials aside, I find it interesting to see how different companies are trying to shove AI and smart glasses into the collective consciousness, with varying levels of success.</p><p>We've thankfully moved on from the crypto ads that dominated Super Bowl ads in previous years. AI seems more likely to stick around in adverts for years to come, as different brands all strive to beat <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek</a> and convince you that <em>their</em> AI is the smartest and most helpful.</p><p>Don't be surprised if the biggest tech brands continue to focus on AI at the next Super Bowl. The challenge will be figuring out how to advertise their AIs getting smarter when these ads already make them sound like they have limitless potential.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>As I'm still trying to gather myself after writing my longest review ever, OPPO is over here making me forget all about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. In less than two weeks, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-global-launch-february-20-2025">OPPO Find N5</a> is being officially unveiled during a "Global Launch Event."</p><p>But that's not why I'm excited. I'm excited for the Find N5 to be unveiled so that we can be one step closer to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> finally being introduced.</p><p>I've owned or reviewed every Galaxy Z Fold phone since the Z Fold 2, which has already made me rethink the way I use phones. Instead of being confined to a rectangle of varying sizes only to move over to a tablet or laptop when I need more screen space, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> gives me the best of both worlds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bgGzMBiUX8b7cH9Tj5kZaM" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-12.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 with Z Fold 5 and Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgGzMBiUX8b7cH9Tj5kZaM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I carried a Z Fold with me every day for years, upgrading as soon as I could. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> made me rethink the way that I view foldable phones. Seeing as I don't have access to alternatives from Xiaomi, Vivo, or Huawei, the OnePlus Open opened my eyes to a whole new world.</p><p>And I think it might happen again.</p><p>Admittedly, I would be lying if I were to sit here and say that I wasn't disappointed that OnePlus and OPPO skipped 2024. But it's also a rumored decision that I was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-oneplus-should-delay-open-2" target="_blank">happy to see come to fruition</a>. That's because the OnePlus Open is <em>still</em> just that darn good. Plus, it's not like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 really offered <em>that</em> much of an upgrade over the Gen 2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dS9GZeJta4Bn4kmYb8crCC" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-oneplus-open-face-down.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold and OnePlus Open face-down with screens open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dS9GZeJta4Bn4kmYb8crCC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It has a camera system that still holds up, a software experience that stands out from the pack, and an excellent design. Frankly, if it weren't for Google starting from scratch with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Open might have never been removed from my daily carry. Even still, when you look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">9 Pro Fold</a>, and Open, most people probably wouldn't be able to guess that the Open is the oldest of the bunch.</p><p>The way things are looking with all of the OPPO Find N5 leaks and teasers, we're in for something truly special. I've been doing this long enough that I don't get all that excited as soon as the first leaks and rumors hit the scene. However, all bets are off when teasers start coming from the company, whether it's directly or from the CEO.</p><p>This is exactly what's happened with the Find N5, as Liu Zuohu, Chief Product Officer at OPPO, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-really-hope-the-oneplus-open-2-doesnt-make-the-same-mistake-as-the-pixel-9-pro-fold">kicked things off</a> with a picture of an unfolded Find N5 next to a sharpened pencil. Then, a teaser video was published on Weibo that strategically showed us just how thin the phone really is.</p>

<p>A few days later, OPPO CEO Pete Lau went straight for Samsung as they shared two images of the Find N5 and Z Fold 6 with the screens unfolded. The point of this was to provide a comparison of the display crease, one area where Samsung has fallen far behind the competition.</p><p>Since then, we've been getting daily teasers, one of which confirmed the Find N5 will sport an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PeteLau/status/1887754504160092352">IPX9 water resistance</a> rating, all before revealing that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/oppo/status/1888769858482896973">Global Launch Event</a> will take place on February 20.</p><p>There isn't much that we don't already know about the Find N5 or that can at least be surmised based on leaks and what we've seen from phones released over the past few months. However, one area of intrigue is in the kinds of upgrades we will see from the camera system.</p>

<p>While the OnePlus Open camera hardware still holds up today, I'm really hoping that we don't end up with subpar cameras. Unfortunately, that's likely what we'll get. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/02/10/oppo-find-n5s-about-phone-page-leak-reveals-camera-downgrade-5600mah-battery-8-12-display-and-more/" target="_blank">recent leak</a> suggests that the Find N5 will feature a 50MP main camera, an 8MP "secondary lens, and another 50-megapixel sensor, which could be a 3x periscope telephoto camera."</p><p>For reference, the original OnePlus Open offers dual 48MP sensors for the main and ultrawide cameras, in addition to a 64MP 3x periscope telephoto lens. On paper, the leaked Find N5 specks don't leave me feeling great, but maybe we'll end up with some of the camera magic that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> introduced. And even if the leaked camera specs are real, I have no doubt that the Find N5/Open 2 will still provide better images than what you can get out of the Z Fold 6.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1676px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:36.63%;"><img id="JLbsyMbjNDg47RRTKFKsfj" name="Oppo-Find-N5-Leaks-9.25 AM" alt="Leaked renders of the Oppo Find N5." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JLbsyMbjNDg47RRTKFKsfj.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1676" height="614" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Besides that, the Find N5 is set to become the first foldable phone to be released with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. It's expected to be paired with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, providing ample horsepower. We're also likely to see a 5,600mAh battery, which seems impossible, given how thin the Find N5 is. All while supporting 80W wired charging and 50W wireless charging speeds, blowing both Samsung and Google out of the water.</p><p>Although OnePlus hasn't started teasing its next foldable phone just yet, I surmise that will change soon or perhaps after the Find N5 is introduced. For someone who's already excited about what the Open 2 could offer, I'm expecting my hype levels to be going through the roof. Now I just have to play the waiting game.</p>

<ul><li>An X tipster claims Google is creating a new AI function for Chrome that'll let it take action to help shield you from data breaches.</li><li>If the AI detects that your password may have been exposed, it will inform you, change the password, and save it to your manager.</li><li>Google has been rumored to have several more AI tools in the works, like phishing/scam prevention through AI and a permission change.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly working to push its in-browser AI more by lending assistance to protect your data online.</p><p>As spotted by X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Leopeva64/status/1887877987288097139">Leopeva64</a>, Google is supposedly developing an "Automated password change" AI function (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-chrome-automated-password-change-3524600/">Android Authority</a>). The publication starts by saying Chrome already has a feature like this; however, it only informs the user of the necessity to change their password — nothing more. What Leopeva64 discovered was the ability of Chrome's AI to not only identify a website's data breach but also take action for the user.</p><p>Discovered in a Chrome Canary deep dive, the tipster dug up the following description: "When Chrome finds one of your passwords in a data breach, it can offer to change your password for you when you sign in."</p><p>This will seemingly appear as a pop-up at the top of Chrome on desktop. Upon signing in, Chrome will deliver the alert alongside a "check passwords" button. After your credentials are confirmed to have been exposed, it's likely the aftermath will involve a quick swap to protect your data.</p><p>It's still early, but Google offers a quick glimpse into what happens if the user agrees to let the AI do its thing. According to the tipster, Google says users "don't need to remember" the password it's AI created. The software will automatically throw those newly crafted credentials into your password manager.</p><p>Moreover, the early description states that what the AI creates is "encrypted," meaning no one else should know it but you.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Another AI-powered feature is coming to Chrome, “Automated password change,” the description mentions that “when Chrome finds one of your passwords in a data breach, it can offer to change your password for you when you sign in":https://t.co/zmre2kssWL pic.twitter.com/lg3MsZjItc<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1887877987288097139">February 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Much like the rest of Google's ecosystem, development for new AI in Chrome has continued, like its recently spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-to-use-ai-for-less-intrusive-permission-notifications">permission changes</a>. Tested under Chrome Canary, Google was reportedly working on leveraging its AI systems to create a less intrusive permission notification experience. When used, the notifications would appear "quieter" based on your "browsing behavior."</p><p>With Gemini Nano v2.0 as its base, early tests show that these less intrusive pop-ups will occur when the browser believes you're less likely to grant what a site is asking.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google was testing much-improved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-scam-detection-canary-flag">AI detection software</a> for phishing and scams online. This feature would enable Chrome to "scan" a website to determine its true intentions as some sites show a false face. Google's early test wants to showcase a website's "suspicious intents" (if there are any) before a user clicks on and forks over their sensitive information unknowingly.</p><p>With so much in the works, let's not overlook Chrome's major "Help me write" and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-222-12pm-et-google-chrome-update-brings-help-me-write-and-generative-ai-to-any-website">generative AI update last year</a>. Not only can users open the AI directly and ask it to create something, but the AI can use what's on a webpage to create something for you.</p>

<ul><li>Google's latest Gemini 2.0 experimental models are becoming widely available in the Gemini app for Android and iOS.</li><li>Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental, a thinking model, lets you trace Gemini's thought process.</li><li>The move is another step towards sunsetting Gemini 1.5 Flash and 1.5 Pro.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently announced that it was reshuffling the AI models available in the Gemini app, sunsetting older Gemini models in favor of newer stable and experimental<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini"> Gemini 2.0 </a>models. Some of these changes are beginning to show up in the Gemini app for Android and iOS, with Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental and Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental rolling out today, Feb. 10.</p><p>The widespread rollout was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/10/gemini-2-0-experimental-models-app/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> and was confirmed on Android Central's devices. It makes the stable version of Gemini 2.0 Flash the default AI model for all users, and it's described as being "for everyday tasks, plus more features." This version of Gemini 2.0 Flash <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-stable-version-of-gemini-2-0-flash-is-rolling-out-now-in-the-gemini-app">began to roll out at the end of January</a>, replacing the experimental model.</p><p>Gemini 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are still around, but are described as being the "previous model[s]." Google previously said Gemini 1.5 Flash and 1.5 Pro will stick around for "the next few weeks" in late January, so time is running out for these models. If you want to finish up existing conversation, now is a good time to do so. Replacing them are Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental, 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental with apps, and 2.0 Pro Experimental.</p>

<p>Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is "best for multi-step reasoning," while 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental with apps adds support for "reasoning across YouTube, Maps, and Search." Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental is "best for complex tasks," and requires a Gemini Advanced subscription through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a>.</p><p>The two thinking models are a first for Google, and they help users trace Gemini's thought process as it navigates through a prompt. It first shows you a "Thoughts" section in real-time, which includes the various steps Gemini took to reach a conclusion. When it does, Gemini will provide a "Response" section with a final answer. This can be useful for understanding how AI chatbots reach solutions, and questioning whether further research is needed to confirm the accuracy of a Gemini response.</p><p>Google notes that as preview models, the Gemini 2.0 experimental models lack access to real-time information and some features.</p><p>These models, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-dot-0-updates-and-new-experimental-models-introduction">announced previously</a>, are now widely available for use in the Gemini app. Soon, Google will clean up the list of Gemini models by sunsetting Gemini 1.5 Flash and 1.5 Pro.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is rumored to finally be interested in upgrading a part of its smartphone tech that's become pretty stagnant.</p><p>The rumors stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fnnews.com/news/202502101427175535">FNNews</a> (Korean), which cites information received from an alleged Samsung Electronics "official." According to the publication, the Korean OEM is beginning to research the necessary steps for packing larger, silicon carbon batteries with quicker charge speeds in "future Galaxy models." If true, the future of Galaxy phones could see batteries within the range of 6,000mAh to 7,000mAh.</p><p>The publication's source claims (machine translated), "If silicon anode material is used, the capacity increases, but there is a lifespan issue, so improvement is necessary."</p><p>Information regarding what a future Galaxy phone's charging strength could look like is unknown; however, the publication taps <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.weibo.com/u/6048569942">Weibo tipster</a> Digital Chat Station (DCS). The tipster allegedly posted speculation that "many flagship smartphones this year will support over 7,000mAh and 100W."</p><p>It's unclear <em>if </em>Samsung is aiming for such high charging wattage but, perhaps, that's a ceiling we can hope for. We've just gotten our hands on the Galaxy S25 series, which leads speculation to believe Samsung could boost its batteries by 2026 for the Galaxy S26 trio.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XxyfiGCNgNsQ2HTyRyJeVK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-12" alt="Battery activity results on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XxyfiGCNgNsQ2HTyRyJeVK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When looking at Samsung, the company typically lags behind other OEMs (notably Chinese ones) that have pushed battery/charging boundaries <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">like OnePlus</a>. The company detailed its new Glacier battery technology last summer before rolling it out on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-ace-3-pro-announced-in-china">OnePlus Ace 3 Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. The Glacier batteries utilize a "silicon carbon anode" designed specifically for high-performance devices. This new tech is said to let users go roughly two days without charging.</p><p>Moreover, a quick five-minute charge can reportedly deliver enough energy for two hours of gaming or three and a half hours of TikTok. This new tech arrived with 100W fast charging support, so we're seeing the heights Samsung should (hopefully) aim for.</p><p>Battery tech from Samsung has become pretty stale as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> still rocks 45W charging with a 5,000mAh battery. Those are the same specs as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a>... the S23 Ultra and the S22 Ultra. Basically, we're still stuck in 2019 with the same old battery and the same old charging strength. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-ultra-battery-charging-test-highlighted">a test shows</a> that Samsung <em>did </em>improve its overall battery and charging <em>times </em>this year with the Galaxy S25.</p><p>The Ultra was seen going from 0% to 70% charge in 30 minutes with its 45W charger. A max charge could be obtained in just under an hour at roughly 57 minutes. So, while this battery time trial did see some time shaved off, it's clearly still not enough.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S25 Edge could measure just 5.84mm thick, according to a new leak.</li><li>The thin smartphone is rumored to have a 3,900mAh battery, which is smaller than all three other Galaxy S25 phones.</li><li>Some leaks so far have been contradictory, so it's best to approach Galaxy S25 Edge information with skepticism — for now.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors predicted that Samsung had a thinner <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> variant in the works before Unpacked 2025, but no one quite knew what to expect when the company unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-reveal-feels-desperate">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>. Samsung gave us a quick look at the Galaxy S25 Edge chassis, but didn't reveal any key specifications or other details about the ultra-thin smartphone. However, a new leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/Pdk539SkZ?pagetype=groupfeed" target="_blank">Ice Universe on Weibo</a> shares the phone's thickness and battery capacity — and it's thinner than expected (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/10/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-thickness-battery-report/">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Sharing information from OnLeaks, Ice Universe says that the Galaxy S25 Edge will measure 158.2 x 75.5 x 5.84 mm. That's bigger overall than the base Galaxy S25, which measures 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm, while being significantly thinner. This size would support an earlier prediction that the Galaxy S25 will have a 6.7-inch display. It also tracks with prior Samsung hints that the device could be "around" six millimeters in thickness, as 9to5Google notes.</p><p>As exciting as a sub-6mm Samsung Galaxy phone sounds, you may want to take this leak with a few grains of salt. At least a few predictions about the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge have seemingly already been proved incorrect, including the original report by OnLeaks and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/we-were-right-mostly-the-real-story-behind-the-samsung-galaxy-edge-dual-camera/" target="_blank">SmartPrix</a>, which claimed the device would be thicker and be equipped with an extra camera sensor.</p><p>Since the new information also comes from OnLeaks and SmartPrix, it may not be a sure thing yet. SmartPrix claims Samsung had been testing multiple Galaxy S25 Edge prototypes, and it went in a different direction than the prototype originally reported on.</p>

<p>The newer leak also predicts that the Galaxy S25 Edge will feature a 3,900mAh battery, which would be the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Samsung Galaxy S23</a>. This is smaller than the base Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S25, which both have a 4,000mAh capacity. The drop is certainly due to the Galaxy S25 Edge's thinner form factor, and could be overcome with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-expands-snapdragon-8-elite-lineup-with-new-7-core-variant">binned Snapdragon 8 Elite chip</a>.</p><p>If these leaks are any indication, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is a bit of a wild card. We know it is thin, has a dual-camera system, and not much else. We'll learn more as the phone's official release window approaches, which is expected to be around April 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Honor is upgrading its YOYO Assistant with DeepSeek-R1 for a more intuitive experience.</li><li>DeepSeek-R1 boosts YOYO’s natural language skills, making it more context-aware and human-like.</li><li>The rollout started on February 8 for MagicOS 8.0+ users, but no global launch details yet.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor's users are getting a smarter AI experience thanks to a new partnership with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek</a>.</p><p>The Chinese phone maker is giving its homegrown AI assistant, YOYO, a major upgrade. More specifically, Honor is plugging in DeepSeek-R1’s cutting-edge tech.</p><p>In its announcement, Honor made it clear just how massive its AI assistant has become, with over 130 million monthly active users already rocking it. That’s a huge crowd relying on it every month.</p><p>Now, with the DeepSeek-R1 model stepping into the picture, YOYO is set to gain sharper natural language skills, smarter logical reasoning, and a deeper grasp of context.</p><p>Honor is doubling down on making its AI assistant more in tune with how users think and communicate. The company is zeroing in on natural language processing to help YOYO get better at understanding the nuances of conversation. Think of it as giving YOYO a deeper, more human-like grasp of what you’re saying.</p><p>Plus, Honor is working on boosting YOYO’s logical reasoning skills. So, it won’t just understand what you’re saying but also figure out the “why” behind it.</p><p>DeepSeek’s R1 model, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deepseek-ai-is-crushing-the-competition-and-triggering-an-ai-stock-bloodbath">took the tech landscape by storm last month</a>, is already turning heads. This reasoning-focused powerhouse is outshining even GPT-4o in benchmark tests, which is no small feat. What really sets it apart, though, is that it’s open-source, so developers and researchers can dive in, tweak it, and build on it.</p><p>DeepSeek-R1 runs on an MIT license, meaning it’s free to use in both commercial and academic projects. Its open nature has caught the attention of big smartphone brands like Huawei, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.mydrivers.com/1/1028/1028588.htm" target="_blank">reportedly</a> eyeing it for its own AI assistant.</p><p>Honor users in China can unlock YOYO’s new AI smarts by swiping up from the bottom of their device, navigating to the “AI agent” section, and choosing “DeepSeek-R1” to get started.</p><p>The integration commenced on February 8. Users in China with MagicOS 8.0 or later can access it by updating the YOYO app to version 80.0.1.503 or higher. For now, it’s a China-exclusive, with no word yet on a global rollout.</p>

<hr>
<p>Starting your week is a host of supposed cases for Google's next budget phone for the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>Google is expected to have a "Pixel 9a" up its sleeve this year and a leak by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9a-official-cases-3524391/">Android Authority</a> might've spilled its alleged cases. The publication suggests the cases will arrive in four colors: Peony, Obsidian, Iris, and Porcelain. The cases are said to be "soft silicone" casing, but there's one thing that stands out: a lack of Google's camera visor.</p><p>The rear panel features a colored "G" for Google (depending on the color chosen) and a simple cutout for its camera lenses. Even from an angled view, the supposed Pixel 9a cases don't show any sort of accommodation for the thick visor that Google is known for.</p><p>Additionally, the left side of the renderings shows two bumps for the device's physical buttons. Those will likely be its power button and volume rocker. The opposite side seems relatively clean, void of any bumps.</p><p>The post alleges that Google will opt to deliver a "microfiber lining on the inside of the case," as well. Pricing for the four cases isn't yet known; however, there's speculation that they could sit at roughly $29.99 like the ones for the Pixel 8a.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Pixel 8a, those cases might not offer a raised rear portion, but the placement of the camera visor is completely open. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> offers a horizontal camera visor that runs the span of its rear panel width-wise. So, it makes sense that Google would want to show that off, but things appear different for its next iteration.</p><p>All of this is speculation until we hear from Google, but the latest case leak seemingly doubles down on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">that major Pixel 9a rumor</a> from September. A set of Pixel 9a renderings surfaced, showcasing a budget Pixel without Google's usual camera bump/visor. Instead, the images showed a phone with a dual camera array that's flush to its back panel. Nestled beside that array will supposedly be its LED flash.</p><p>Most other elements appear similar to what we're used to: a flat display, flat sides, and rounded corners.</p><p>A couple of months later came <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-leak-reveal-every-last-spec-of-the-handset">a massive specifications leak</a> that might've told us all we needed to know. The Pixel 9a is rumored to feature a 6.2-FHD Plus display, the Tensor G4 chip, and a 48MP primary camera.</p><p>While Google usually drops its budget Pixel A-series closer to the summer, things could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-9as-exact-release-date-is-already-known-report-claims">kick off in March</a>, instead. Rumors claim the Pixel 9a could debut on March 26 with pre-orders beginning one week beforehand. The device is also suspected to feature two configurations for $399 and $499 (256GB), respectively.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is pushing the February 2025 security patch to the Galaxy S24 in Korea.</li><li>The update should appear for devices in other regions and cellular carriers soon.</li><li>The patch is based on Android 14 and One UI 6.1, and it comes as Samsung faces more One UI 7 delays.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>One UI 7 finally debuted on the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>, but owners of older Galaxy phones are still left waiting. It looks like that wait will continue a bit longer, because Samsung's February 2025 security patch is starting to roll out for Galaxy S24 devices in Korea — and it's built on One UI 6.1 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> instead of One UI 7 and Android 15 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-latest-update-leave-you-disappointed/">Android Police</a>).</p><p>The news of Samsung's monthly update rolling out based on an older version of One UI comes just after a report revealed<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported"> the company needed one more One UI 7 beta update</a> before a public rollout. That's because it found a problem that "causes the display color temperature to appear more yellow than intended," per a Samsung community post.</p><p>The monthly update is appearing for users in South Korea with an update size of about 455MB, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1888783290485850290" target="_blank">Tarun Vats on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. It'll soon arrive for Samsung Galaxy S24 owners in other markets, but may take a while to show up depending on your combination of region and cellular carrier.</p>

<p>As the company details on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb" target="_blank">security updates page</a>, the February 2025 update for the Galaxy S24 includes Google's patches in the Android Security Bulletin for this month. That includes one security vulnerability with a "critical" severity designation and 34 vulnerabilities with a "high" designation. Additionally, Samsung is patching seven issues that specifically affect Galaxy devices.</p><p>There are no new features in the February 2025 patch, and that's unsurprising. Samsung's upcoming One UI 7 upgrade is a massive one, with new features, a visual overhaul, and more. The existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> will feel fresh after that upgrade, but the wait for it has been a long one. Google delivered Android 15 to the Android Open Source Project a while ago, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> still isn't here.</p><p>For now, Galaxy S24 users will have to settle for their February 2025 security patch. When the update becomes available for your device, you can install it by opening Settings and navigating to <strong>Software update > Download and install</strong>.</p>

<p>As part of its sitewide Presidents' Day sale, Amazon is quietly slashing 43% off the Google Pixel 8 (in Hazel), knocking the price down to a mere $399. This last-gen flagship boasts a ton of innovative AI-boosted software features with long software support and cameras that could rival any 2025 phone. If you need more storage, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Unlocked-Smartphone-Advanced/dp/B0CGT5CLJR"><strong>upgrade to the 256GB version</strong></a> and you'll still enjoy a 40% discount. </p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a phone with AI-powered performance, outstanding cameras, and years of guaranteed software support; you don&apos;t mind using a device from 2023. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t mind spending more for the latest and greatest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. </p><p>Despite its (slightly) advanced age, the Google Pixel 8 continues to earn its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">4.5/5-star rating</a> thanks to a seven-year software promise, a suite of innovative AI features, and powerful camera tech that could easily rival any 2025 phone.

The newer phone has slightly faster performance and a bigger battery, but do these improvements justify spending $400 more? The choice is yours, but if you&apos;re simply looking for bang for the buck, this Pixel 8 deal can&apos;t be beat.</p>
