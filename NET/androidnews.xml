The deal even comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost, a standalone value of $35.97. </p>

<p>There are other <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">Kindle e-readers</a> to consider if you want a bigger screen or more features, but if you just need something simple to throw into a bag when traveling, this device is pretty perfect. </p>

<p>Now, to be clear: I&apos;m a big advocate of physical books and I <em>strongly </em>recommend that you spend some money at your local independent bookstore this holiday season — but if you travel a lot like me, it&apos;s hard to beat the convenience of the Amazon Kindle (2024), especially at this price. </p><p>Boot up this e-reader and you&apos;ll get instant access to a vast library of books on a 6-inch, anti-glare display that you can use in any light, thanks to the adjustable built-in screen light. You also get audiobook support via Bluetooth, some incredible battery life, and a durable construction that&apos;s supposed to be waterproof (although I haven&apos;t tested that myself). 16GB of onboard storage also means that you can easily carry thousands of titles with you wherever you go.</p><p>One drawback is that this particular model is ad-supported, which means you&apos;ll have to deal with the occasional banner ad on your lock screen. They won&apos;t show up when you&apos;re reading though, which is good enough for me, but you&apos;ll have to consider if it&apos;s worth paying a bit more to go completely ad-free. </p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a tablet with super powerful performance, or for something you can use as a laptop for work; you want a tablet that comes with a stylus; having a massive screen on your tablet is a priority for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you can afford to buy the new Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra; you want a tablet that's lightweight and easy to transport; you're screen-sensitive and need a tablet with solid PWM settings; you need something that can be used with your cell carrier's network.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a> is so clearly a premium tablet, boasting some of the best specs available on a modern device. While it's normally priced at $1,200, the extra 25% off from Best Buy makes it a solid competitor with lower-level tablets, but without sacrificing performance.</p><p>This model features 256GB of storage or the ability to increase that up to 1TB using a microSD card. This potential laptop replacement's performance is supported by the crazy-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, 12GB of RAM, offering smooth gaming performance, and ease-of-use for power-intensive work applications. Users also love the 14.6-inch AMOLED display, which features a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Additionally, this tablet has IP68 water and dust resistance, and comes with the S Pen stylus, the latter of which has been a big selling point for some buyers over the years.</p><p>It's worth noting that this may not be a great pick for those who prefer a small or affordable laptop, or for those who need a headphone jack. The display also doesn't have good PWM offerings, nor does the tablet have cellular connectivity—both of which could be a dealbreaker for some.</p><p>In any case, if you're a casual user, you may consider going with a more affordable option from Samsung, while those looking for the best of the best need look no further.</p>

<p>The Polar Vantage M3 is the brand's first affordable AMOLED watch, after the $599 Vantage V3 and $749 Grit X2 Pro first shed off the old MIP standard. The $399 M3 shares their 4th-gen Elixir OHR and dual-band GPS, meaning it should offer reliable accuracy on par with Polar's flagships.</p><p>I decided to put this to the test! Despite the rainy weather and coming down with a cold, I took the Polar Vantage M3 on several runs, long walks, and a track run over the past couple of weeks, comparing the results against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>'s dual-band GPS, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS HRM armband</a>, and the Polar H10 chest strap.</p><p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">pitted the Vantage V3 against flagship Garmin and COROS watches</a>, it fell a bit short for GPS accuracy (while still doing better than a GPS-only watch) and was fairly accurate for HR data compared to a chest strap. So I was curious to see how the mid-range Vantage <strong>M3</strong> would do with similar hardware.</p><p>Turns out the Polar Vantage M3 is quite reliable for GPS, but a little less reliable for heart rate accuracy in some cases. Still, the mid-range M3 is already making the flagship V3 look a little overpriced by offering the same experience for less.</p>

<p>I used the Fenix 8 as a location accuracy control group because Garmin's dual-band GPS tends to lead the industry for dependable results in my tests. The mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-gps-and-hr-accuracy-test">COROS PACE Pro</a> did surprisingly well against it in my accuracy test earlier this month, so I had high hopes that the Vantage M3 could do equally well.</p>

<p>I'm sorry that so many of my tests were short jogs — which tend to be too short to reveal discrepancies — or long walks that are usually too slow-paced to challenge the antenna's full abilities. I didn't get to go on a hike for proper elevation testing or accuracy on a tree-obscured route, either.</p><p>From what I was able to test, however, the Vantage M3 did respectably well, always falling closely within the same margins as the Garmin watch for a long run.</p>

<p>If you look more closely at the GPS map between the Vantage M3 (<em>orange line</em>) and Fenix 8 (<em>blue</em>) for my most recent 10K run above, there are a few instances where the Vantage M3 drifts slightly into the street or buildings, with the same unprompted zig-zagging and hard angles as the dual-frequency <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-review">Suunto Race</a>, as well as some issues with underpasses that the Fenix 8 didn't encounter.</p><p>Thankfully, the Vantage M3 has fewer gaffes than Suunto and does perfectly well in normal conditions, sticking to the correct side of my local trail. And for my track run below, it didn't stick perfectly to the first lane, but that's something every watch I've tested struggles with; Polar's result is actually among the best I've seen among dual-band watches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wsEJnPPDbDRcnjtw4k5gDD" name="Polar-Vantage-M3-vs-Garmin-Fenix-8-GPS-accuracy-test-8" alt="A Google Maps satellite view showing how the Polar Vantage M3 (orange line) matched up to a track run completed in lane 1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wsEJnPPDbDRcnjtw4k5gDD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I couldn't do a proper hike, my walk along another nearby trail was illuminating. In the screenshots below, you'll see how the Vantage M3 (now the blue line) does perfectly well on the unimpeded stretches, but under tree cover, you'll see a lot more wavering in short stretches where I was walking straight ahead (and Garmin's orange line is usually more consistent). My total distance was only two-hundredths apart, though, so most people won't mind.</p>

<p>Overall, I think people will be happy with the Vantage M3's location accuracy, especially for its price. What's perhaps more interesting is how Garmin and Polar consistently track running power, training load, and steps per minute differently.</p><p>I'm inclined to trust Garmin over Polar for steps; Garmin has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">won several step-counting accuracy tests</a>, and Garmin, Apple, COROS, and Fitbit all closely matched on total steps and cadence across a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-i-learned-running-20-mile-race-wearing-four-watches">20-mile, four-watch test</a>.</p><p>But I've noticed in the past how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">Garmin training load</a> seems to underestimate walks and overestimate track workouts, while Polar separates cardio and muscle load in a way that feels more sophisticated and accurate to my effort level — aside from the grossly-underestimated track load. And running power has always felt like an arbitrary metric that varies by brand, so I don't put much stock in it.</p>
<h2 id="polar-vantage-m3-hr-accuracy-2">Polar Vantage M3 HR accuracy</h2>

<p>My Polar Vantage M3 heart rate results gave me whiplash. For most normal runs, it delivered consistent HR averages, if all slightly below my external HRMs. But my  track run results were disappointing and my walk data showed the correct averages but was bizarrely wild on the graphs.</p>

<p>For every run except one two-mile jog, the Polar Vantage M3 was 1 bpm short of my optical arm band or my Polar ECG. In the two HR graphs below (hit the magnification button), you can see how the purple Garmin graph sits slightly above the pinker Polar one at most points, aside from when my effort dips and Polar is slower to drop.</p>

<p>There's normally a delay between wrist- and arm-based optical monitors or chest straps, but a solid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> should still average out to the same result in the end. I'd like to see Polar figure out its algorithm to close the small gap, but 1 bpm isn't a major issue and it's still in the right ballpark.</p><p>What's slightly weirder is looking at my two walking activity charts. Polar really struggled to stay close to my fluctuating heart rate for both activities, with a 5–10 bpm gap above or below my actual HR for sustained stretches.</p>

<p>They ended up averaging out to identical or close bpm averages for 6- and 4-mile walks; so again, perhaps you won't care about the difference. But that may have been luck more than everything else; I noticed this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://the5krunner.com/2024/10/23/polar-vantage-m3-review-pros-cons/" target="_blank">5Krunner HR accuracy test</a> did fine for most runs but had bizarrely inflated HR totals for a calm walk. So I'm hoping this is an area where the Polar algorithm can improve with time.</p>

<p>As for my track workout, I can only show a portion of the graph because it somehow got fully misaligned in-between lap pauses about halfway through, so the results were needlessly confusing. This portion gives you a glimpse of what to expect, though: a few beats short at most points, dipping as low as <em>20 bpm</em> under at one point, and overestimating my max by a few beats. Basically, it's all over the place.</p><p>I'm going to do an unpaused track run for my full Vantage M3 review, to avoid any weird issues with flat, skewed results. But even with this incomplete test, I feel like the Vantage M3 could have done much better in that initial snapshot. If I were a serious athlete trying to track anaerobic effort, I'd probably buy an external monitor to pair with my Vantage M3.</p>

<p>There's a new category of AMOLED <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watches</a> that cost about the same as an Apple Watch or Pixel Watch but offer a serious leg up for training metrics, battery life, and accuracy.</p><p>If I had to choose between the COROS PACE Pro ($349), Suunto Race S ($349), Polar Vantage M3 ($399), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Garmin Forerunner 265</a> ($449), I'd have a seriously tough decision on my hands — but I'd also feel like I couldn't go wrong with any one choice.</p><p>With the Vantage M3 in particular, I appreciate its lightweight and thin design, Strava route and Komoot directions integration, full suite of sensors like ECG and skin temp, and default topo maps.</p><p>Its 7-day battery life is on the short side for a running watch, and I'm not the biggest fan of Polar Flow as a companion app, but it doesn't feel like a major downgrade from the pricier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Vantage V3</a>, with similar perks like its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-i-love-polars-manual-vo2-max-and-recovery-tests">useful VO2 Max and orthostatic tests</a> and comparable accuracy. While I've yet to review it fully, the Vantage M3 looks more compelling than the V3 for sheer value.</p><p>I just wish it was a little more accurate for anaerobic runs or low-effort aerobic.</p>

<p>To put this price in perspective, my colleague Harish <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/planning-a-phone-upgrade-this-black-friday-these-are-my-picks">wrote last week</a> that you should wait until Black Friday to buy a OnePlus 12 so it'd drop back down to its previous-record low price of $599. Now that it's $50 <em>cheaper</em> than that, this deal's a no-brainer.</p><p>Aside from a low price, the OnePlus 12 sports fantastic build quality with the best haptics in the business. The screen gets plenty bright <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">without hurting your eyes</a> — unlike the Pixel 9 series and its low-HZ PWM display — and support for great features like Pro XDR, you know you're getting the best image quality <em>and</em> the best display for your eyes.</p><p>If you're worried about camera quality going from a Pixel to a OnePlus phone, don't be. As Android Central's managing editor wrote, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-camera-impressions-why-it-replaced-my-pixel-9">OnePlus 12's camera surprised him</a>, even when directly comparing it to a Pixel. I've taken scores of wonderful photos and videos from the OnePlus 12 over the last 11 months and love using it every day.</p><p>Of course, we can't forget to talk about battery life and charging. OnePlus's Android 15-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">Oxygen OS 15 update</a> is something truly special and made battery life even better for me. I get well over a day from a single charge and never have battery anxiety because the charger that's included in the box — yep, OnePlus doesn't cheap out like Samsung, Apple, or Google — charges the phone from 0-100% in 30 minutes. No joke. It's insane and will blow you away every time you use it.</p><p>If you were on the fence about which phone you should upgrade to this year, stop looking and just get a OnePlus 12. Thank me later.</p>

<p>If this was the year you were planning on jumping to a Pixel — or are upgrading from an older Pixel phone — the Pixel 9 is the one to get. Not only is it the most affordable member of the Pixel 9 family but it comes with the same Tensor G4 processor as all the other more expensive models <strong>and</strong> seven years of guaranteed software updates.</p><p>Most people are looking to cut costs these days, and while buying a new phone doesn't seem like it would help that goal, hear me out. Since the Pixel 9 is supported for the next seven years, you can skip saving money for a new phone and spend that cash on something more worthwhile, instead.</p><p>Of course, you'll want to pick up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">great Pixel 9 case</a> to keep it protected that entire time, so don't forget to do that. My favorite cases are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinborne-Compatible-Aramid-Magnetic-Minimalist/dp/B0D86S45JD/?th=1">Thinborne Aramid Fiber</a> ones which aren't on sale <em>right now</em> but I fully expect them to drop in price on Black Friday proper, which is November 29 this year.</p>

The Quest 3S is sure to be one of the hottest items on wish lists this holiday season, so I'd skip the crowds and grab this Black Friday deal today if I were you. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/meta-quest-3s-128gb-get-batman-arkham-shadow-and-a-3-month-trial-of-meta-quest-included-all-in-one-headset-white/6596934.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a1e659df-e660-4a2c-9121-9877e09d1d00" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest 3S 128GB: $299.99, plus free copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow, three-month trial of Meta Quest Plus, and FREE $75 gift card at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Meta Quest 3S 128GB: $299.99, plus free copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow, three-month trial of Meta Quest Plus, and FREE $75 gift card at Best Buy">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a great deal on an affordable VR headset; you want to play Meta Quest 3 exclusive titles without dropping a ton of cash; you could use $75 to buy more stuff at Best Buy.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you can afford the Meta Quest 3; you want to wait and see what other Black Friday deals go live next week. </p><p>Meta&apos;s attempt at producing the perfect affordable VR headset, the Quest 3S is an incredible pick if you want a cutting-edge virtual reality experience without breaking the bank. </p><p>Comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Meta Quest 3S vs the Quest 3</a>, you&apos;ll notice that the affordable headset really isn&apos;t that different from its pricier big sibling. The two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headsets</a> share the same Snapdragon processor, mixed reality tech, and graphical power, plus you get access to all of the same exclusive games and apps. Sure, you&apos;re taking a hit with display resolution if you choose the Quest 3S, and you&apos;ll have to deal with a narrower FoV, but if you were a fan of the Quest 2 or you&apos;d simply rather not drop $500 on yet another video game console, the Meta Quest 3S is a great deal — <em>especially </em>when you pair it with over $140 of free stuff from Best Buy. </p><p>Can we expect to see more Meta Quest deals as we approach <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday-2024">Black Friday 2024</a>? Probably, but if you want to get your holiday shopping done early, it doesn&apos;t get much better than this. </p>

At it's usual price of $319, we thought it was good value. But this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-chromebook-laptop-14-fhd-touchscreen-laptop-mediatek-kompanio-520-4gb-memory-64gb-emmc-abyss-blue/6531742.p?skuId=6531742"><strong>Black Friday offer slashes the price down to just $159</strong></a>, making it an absolute steal! If you need a secondary laptop at home or need to get your kid their first computer, I'd say strike quickly and scoop this up while stocks last.</p><p>In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-chromebook-review">Lenovo Slim 3 Chromebook review</a>, we loved how lightweight it was and the fairly sharp 1080p display. The MediaTek processor is capable of handling basic tasks, but don't expect to do any sort of crazy multitasking. Battery life is also great, which makes this a good option for students looking to get through a whole day of classes on one charge.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a cheap Chromebook; you need it to be lightweight; you need long battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want to do multitasking; you need a convertible design; you need more than two USB ports.</p><p>Chromebooks are highly versatile devices as they don't need powerful components and are often very affordable. Lenovo makes some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook-students">best Chromebooks for students</a>, and this IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook is worth a look at if you need something for casual use. Surprisingly, the 14-inch Full-HD display has touch input, and a max brightness of 300 nits. It's powered by the MediaTek Kompanio 520 SoC, which is decently powerful, but you only get 4GB of RAM which is not great for multitasking.</p><p>The Slim 3 Chromebook weighs just 1.3kg, making it quite light for a laptop. You even get a 720p webcam with a privacy switch, which is a nice touch. There's 64GB of onboard storage, but this can be expanded using the microSD slot. Some of the things we found lacking when we tested it was the performance and a fingerprint reader. Apart from this, it's really hard to complain when you're paying so little for a full-fledged laptop.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a solid discount on the top noise-cancelling headphones on the market; you're looking for wireless headphones that offer a long battery life; comfortable speaker cups are a major priority for you when shopping headphones.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you'd <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/should-you-buy-headphones-or-earbuds">rather get earbuds than over-ear headphones</a>; you're a casual user and you'd rather go with a more affordable option; you specifically need support for the aptX codec.</p><p>There's way more than one reason why the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are our top pick. To name a few, they have the best-sounding audio and active noise cancellation features on the market, and they offer up to 30 hours of battery life—or up to 45 hours when not using ANC.</p><p>These headphones use a USB-C cable to fast-charge, and you can get about 30 minutes of listening time per three-minute charge. You can also pair them with two separate devices at once, and the Sony Headphones Connect app offers tons of useful features like equalization presets, speak-to-chat, 360 Reality Audio complete with ear shape analysis, and more.</p><p>Sony also added better microphones to this year's model, making call quality substantially better than in previous models. They also come with a useful carrying case, and their gestures are easy to learn and use, along with working well (unlike some competitors).</p><p>There are a few small cons to these, including that they don't feature support for the aptX codec, though they do offer AAC and SBC support, as well as for the Sony LDAC codec. You can't charge while you listen, though the ultra-fast charging also means that this won't be an issue for most.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>We're less than a week away from the official Black Friday phone deals, but many have already launched early discounts leading up to the sale. For one, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24/buy/galaxy-s24-plus-256gb-unlocked-sm-s926uzaaxaa/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung is cutting up to $650 off the Galaxy S24 Plus</strong></a> when you trade in a qualifying device, or $275 off without a trade-in. You can also save an additional $75 when you go with Jade Green, Sapphire Blue, or Sandstone Orange. While the S24 Plus is often passed over for either the smaller base-level S24 or the larger, high-powered S24 Ultra, it's still a decent effort from Samsung—especially at a discount.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Plus has a nice 6.7-inch AMOLED display, 256GB of storage, all-day battery life, and an excellent set of cameras. We also like this phone for its small bezels and overall design, as well as its impressive performance speeds and the promise of seven years of updates. Plus, it comes with the latest Galaxy AI features, which are a selling point for many users.</p><p>Normally, this phone is also pretty expensive, so the discount straight from Samsung is pretty solid, especially for regular enjoyers of the OEM.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want a good deal on a powerful Samsung phone that's normally pretty expensive; you're looking for a phone with excellent cameras; getting through the day without charging your phone is a major priority for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you prefer a compact-sized phone; the price tag is still a little higher than what you'd prefer; you're a casual phone user and don't need something so performance-heavy.</p><p>We liked this year's Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus when it was released, especially because of its improved RAM and display specs. The phone also includes Samsung's latest Galaxy AI features, such as Generative Edit, Instant Slo-Mo, and more.</p><p>The S24 Plus gets its super-powerful performance from the included 12GB of RAM, and from the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor. Its cameras also offer solid video and photo capture, perhaps second only to the Google Pixel lineup.</p><p>We also love this year's display upgrade for the S24 Plus, which offers an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">easy-on-the-eyes display with a PWM rate</a> of 492Hz for those who are sensitive to phone screens. Other noteworth details about this phone are its IP68 water and dust resistance, its inclusion of seven years of software updates, and its all-around great user experience design.</p><p>It is worth pointing out a couple of small quirks with the S24 Plus. For one, there's no S Pen support, so if you want to use the first-party stylus, you'll have to go with the upgraded Ultra model (though the stylus is included with that configuration).</p><p>Additionally, while this phone is smaller than the Ultra with a 6.7-inch display, it's no compact phone, and it may simply be too big for some. In that case, you may want to consider the base-level S24.</p><p>However, if you want a discount on a great Samsung Galaxy device at a serious discount, this deal might be worth checking out.</p>
