                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is rolling out passkeys to its Advanced Protection Program.</li><li>The news was unveiled during the World Password Day celebration, marking a year since passkeys were introduced across Google's services.</li><li>Google is also collaborating with various industry players to extend cross-account protection, sharing security notifications across platforms to enhance overall user security.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google announced today that it&apos;s bringing passkeys to its Advanced Protection Program, which aims to keep high-risk users safe, just in time for the upcoming US elections and amid growing cyber threats.</p><p>The announcement was made during the World Password Day commemoration, a year after Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-next-major-phase-of-passkey">rolled out passkeys as a password alternative across its services</a>. It&apos;s part of the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-m108-passkey-support">broader effort to replace passwords with passkeys</a>, which require only biometric data to unlock your device.</p><p>Google&apos;s Advanced Protection Program aims to shield certain users who face the biggest risks of getting targeted by cyber attacks, including campaign workers, candidates, journalists, and human rights activists, among others.</p><p>In the past, signing up for the program meant you had to hook up hardware security keys as a second factor to prove it&apos;s really you logging into your account. Today&apos;s announcement means that soon, you&apos;ll have the choice to sign up using any passkey alongside your hardware security keys.</p><p>You&apos;ll even get to decide whether to use just your passkeys or pair them with a password.</p><p>Google has also shared a few stats alongside this expansion. As per the company, passkeys have been used over 1 billion times across over 400 million Google accounts. In just the last year, big names like Amazon, 1Password, Dashlane, Docusign, Kayak, Mercari, and Shopify have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/upgrade-to-passkeys-on-pixel-with-google-password-manager">jumped on the passkey train</a>.</p><p>On top of all that, Google is teaming up with even more players in the industry to boost cross-account protection, ensuring billions of users stay safe wherever they roam online.</p><p>With this initiative, Google "shares security notifications" about any sketchy activities on your Google account with other apps and services you use, even if they&apos;re not from Google. This way, those apps and services can beef up security using Google&apos;s intel to keep all your accounts under lock and key.</p><p>According to the search giant, this is super important because cybercriminals usually start with one door to try to access the rest of your precious data.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a> is one of my favorite phones of the year; it has considerable camera upgrades from last year, a gorgeous design that stands out, powerful hardware, and interesting software features. So when Honor announced it was making a Porsche Design variant of the device, I was obviously interested.</p><p>I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/porsche-design-honor-magic-v2-rsr-review">Porsche Design Magic V2 RSR foldable</a> when it debuted, and it had plenty of unique design characteristics that made it distinctive â€” even more so than the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a>, which isn&apos;t a bad phone to look at by any measure. With the Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR, Honor is turning things up a notch, delivering what is possibly one of the best phones of 2024.</p><p>The Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR has custom styling and is available in interesting color choices, and it comes with 1TB of storage and 24GB of RAM, which is just overkill. I used the device as my daily driver for over two weeks, and here&apos;s why I think it is the best version of the Magic 6 Pro.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-pricing-and-availability"><span>Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BpghEY7J3PTnHzSuRPSh9F" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-logo-back.jpg" alt="Back view of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR with Porsche logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BpghEY7J3PTnHzSuRPSh9F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor unveiled the Magic 6 RSR Porsche Design on March 18 in China, and the phone made its debut in the U.K. on May 2. The phone is also headed to the Middle East, Malaysia, and Germany in the coming weeks.</p><p>The Magic 6 RSR is available in a single variant that has 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, and it costs Â£1,599 ($2,004) in the U.K. That&apos;s considerably more than its retail price of 9,999 RMB ($1,380) in China, and a sizeable premium over the standard version of the Magic 6 Pro, which is available for Â£1,099 ($1,378) in the U.K. Honor is running a deal right now that discounts the device by an additional Â£250 ($313), bringing the cost down to Â£849 ($1,064). That said, the standard model has 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.</p>

<p>Design is the biggest point of differentiation with the Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR, and there is a lot to go over. The standard Magic 6 Pro has a pillow camera island (Honor&apos;s words, not mine) that looks great in its own right, and with the Magic 6 RSR, the brand went with a new design that stands out much better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QgQgtnCEhkMTsbJFRH6tJE" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-camera-island-hand.jpg" alt="Camera island view of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QgQgtnCEhkMTsbJFRH6tJE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera module uses Porsche&apos;s "iconic hexagonal structure" that evokes the "essence of precision and high-performance characteristics of sports cars." The camera island is made out of titanium, and it contrasts well with the glass back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pFERLMXh9NMC5sMtFAuiGF" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-magic-6-pro-.jpg" alt="Back view of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR with angled view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pFERLMXh9NMC5sMtFAuiGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is available in two color variants â€” Agate Grey and Frozen Berry â€” and while I wanted to take a look at the grey model, the pink Frozen Berry variant stands out much better. Honor says the color "exudes a sense of boldness and fearlessness, adding an element of exclusivity to the device." I don&apos;t know about the fearlessness, but the color is definitely bold, and it grabs quite a lot of attention. And on that subject, the same color extends to the mid-frame as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yNmetwN3KPkJZXCDRnJHzE" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-ir.jpg" alt="Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR IR blaster against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yNmetwN3KPkJZXCDRnJHzE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I don&apos;t like about the design is that the glass back has a glossy coat, and it is a smudge magnet. If anything, the vegan leather of the standard Magic 6 Pro feels much better to hold and use. The glossy texture continues on the sides too, and Honor should have used a matte coating on both variants.</p>

<p>Although I don&apos;t like using cases with my phones, the glossy back of the Magic 6 RSR necessitates one, and Honor bundles a minimal leather case in the package that does a terrific job. The case makes it significantly easier to hold the device, and it has a much better feel â€” Honor should have used this at the back as standard. And yes, the case has Porsche Design branding highlighted prominently, and there&apos;s even needless stitching along the middle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AzMbono9g3oGVLbnEDZg3D" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-back-angle.jpg" alt="Angled view showcasing back of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AzMbono9g3oGVLbnEDZg3D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, the other unique design trait is the flyline at the back that creates a wedge, and it immediately differentiates the device. There&apos;s Porsche Design branding for good measure, and while I wasn&apos;t initially sold on the color, I&apos;ve grown fond of it in the two weeks I used the device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="r46Qkm5rkUkNbQ2phsU5eG" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-side-view.jpg" alt="Angled view of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r46Qkm5rkUkNbQ2phsU5eG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is still heavy at 237g, but it has good weight distribution, and the curvy profile means it is easy to hold. It retains IP68 ingress protection â€” a must-have feature on a device that costs over $2,000 â€” and while the in-screen module sits a little lower on the screen, it isn&apos;t particularly awkward to access.</p><p>On the whole, the Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR has all the accouterments you&apos;d want in a custom variant, and it is different enough to the standard Magic 6 Pro that it has its own visual identity.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-hardware-and-screen"><span>Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR: Hardware and screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HwdUP8VLAegGj8LzPySfaE" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-home-6.jpg" alt="Home page of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HwdUP8VLAegGj8LzPySfaE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m not going to talk too much about the hardware as the Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR is nearly identical to the standard Magic 6 Pro in this regard. It has the same 6.8-inch 120Hz OLED panel that goes up to 5,000 nits in HDR content, and there are absolutely no issues in daily use.Â </p><p>The panel gets bright, has outstanding color vibrancy and contrast levels, and there&apos;s a decent amount of customizability. What&apos;s different is that Honor is using a dual-layer OLED that guarantees panel longevity, and while the screen is just as bright as the regular variant, it will stay that way a lot longer.Â </p>

<p>The 2800 x 1200 resolution isn&apos;t quite as high as the QHD+ panels that you get on most other phones in this segment, but it holds up well for all daily usage scenarios. Honor eschewed Corning and went with its own NanoCrystal Shield coating, and it does a good job protection the phone â€” it took a tumble onto a tiled surface a week after I started using it, and came away unscathed. Incidentally, I decided to use a case after that incident (that back really is very glossy).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cNujs6X4DVvQqvh3BgbjcC" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-always-on.jpg" alt="Always-on mode of the Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR with phone against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cNujs6X4DVvQqvh3BgbjcC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor&apos;s always-on mode allows you to have the entire screen awake, including the background â€” similar to how it works in iOS â€” or you can switch to just having a clock or a custom style. While the device isn&apos;t quite as bright as its rivals in outdoor use, it shines at media playback, and HDR content in particular is a delight.</p>

<p>As for the hardware, the Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR is powered by the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> as the standard model, and it comes with 24GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage. Look, 24GB of RAM is unnecessary on a phone as you can&apos;t really use that much memory, but I like that the phone has 1TB of storage. I tend to take a lot of videos these days, and storage is a real problem; this is one of the reasons why I don&apos;t like using the Pixel 8 Pro and its pitiful 128GB of storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g5NLCwwVVbH6BzBcovNUTE" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-home.jpg" alt="Home page of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR against colorful background and angled view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g5NLCwwVVbH6BzBcovNUTE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no issues with the Magic 6 RSR in daily use, and the phone handles intensive gaming without breaking a sweat. I didn&apos;t see any slowdowns on my unit, and even with extended gaming, there was no overheating. Similarly, I didn&apos;t run into any issues with connectivity â€” the phone had a stable signal throughout.</p>
<p>The only issue with the hardware is the haptic engine â€” it just doesn&apos;t do anything. This has been an issue on Honor phones for a while now, and even if you enable system haptics, you don&apos;t notice any feedback while using gestures. I was able to manually trigger it while using Gboard, but that&apos;s about it. The vibration motor isn&apos;t active while using the back gesture, navigating the UI, or in any other scenario.</p>

<p>The Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR has the same 5600mAh battery as the regular model, and it uses the same silicon-carbon tech to increase longevity of the battery. You get 80W charging and 66W wireless charging, and there&apos;s 5W reverse charging as well. Honor bundles the requisite charger in the box.</p><p>While I didn&apos;t see any issues with the battery on the regular Magic 6 Pro, that isn&apos;t the case on the Magic 6 RSR. The phone has unusually high battery drain in idle, and it only manages to last a day. It got to as low as 7% with heavy use by the end of the day, and as I don&apos;t charge my phones overnight, I decided to plug it in the next day. However, idle draw is so high that the phone switched off by the time I got up the following day; this hasn&apos;t been an issue on any phone in recent memory.</p><p>Most other phones with 5000mAh battery last considerably longer with the same usage patterns, and while most devices I used in 2024 go up to a day and a half, the Magic 6 RSR is woefully short on all measurable metrics in this area. It still lasts a day, but you will need to plug it in by nighttime.</p>

<p>We have a dedicated camera review of the Magic 6 Pro, so I&apos;m not going to talk about the cameras too much here. The Magic 6 RSR retains the same camera configuration as the standard model, and that means you get a 50MP main camera with an interesting variable f/1.4-2.0 lens and a 1/1.3-inch sensor. It&apos;s not quite as big as a 1-inch sensors in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, but it takes standout images and videos.</p><p>The main camera is joined by a 50MP f/2.0 wide-angle lens, and a 180MP f/2.6 telephoto lens that shoots at up to 2.5x optical zoom. The camera interface is similar to what you get with most brands, with plenty of toggles, modes, and scenes available. What I like about the Magic 6 RSR is that it is able take images of fast-moving objects incredibly well; I put that to good use to take photos of our ten-month-old baby.</p><p>There&apos;s AI-assisted scene recognition as well, and you get three custom styles â€” Natural, Vibrant, and Authentic. The Authentic mode has a vignette to it, so I went with the Vibrant mode. And like with most other phones, you get a decent Pro mode.</p>

<p>This goes without saying, but the Magic 6 RSR takes outstanding photos in daylight scenarios. Shots have plenty of detail and good color rendition, and I don&apos;t have any issues with the quality of the resultant shots. The phone does a magnificent job in low-light situations as well, and while the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Find X7 Ultra have a slender edge in this regard, the Magic 6 RSR gets pretty close.</p><p>Like its Chinese rivals, the Magic 6 RSR does a magnificent job with portrait shots. There&apos;s the option to choose from various focal lengths, and you can adjust the bokeh. The one thing to note is that beauty effects are enabled out of the box in this mode, and it is aggressive â€” you&apos;ll need to disable the mode to get accurate shots.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, the phone does a great job with shots going up to 2.5x, and while there is some fringing with the wide-angle lens, it delivers usable shots in all situations.Â </p><p>While I don&apos;t take many selfies, the few that I managed to take with the front camera had poor color balance and just didn&apos;t measure up to the rear cameras. As a whole, the Magic 6 RSR has one of the best camera packages of any phone today.</p>

<p>The global version of the Magic 6 RSR comes with MagicOS 8.0 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, and it includes all the AI features that Honor introduced, including Magic Portal. But as I got the Chinese version of the device, I wasn&apos;t able to test the feature; ironically, I got two variants of the Magic 6 Pro thus far, but neither has the global build.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="byin7j4ZRKm3nhtUXGfg8G" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-notification.jpg" alt="Gmail notification on Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/byin7j4ZRKm3nhtUXGfg8G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As such, there isn&apos;t much to talk about in this section. MagicOS 8.0 is a definite upgrade, and it brings much-needed tweaks to Honor&apos;s phones. That said, issues from previous version of the interface are still intact; long pressing on an app doesn&apos;t pull up the app info, so you&apos;ll have to go into the settings, go to the Apps list, and manually locate the app if you want to change its notification settings.</p>
<p>The overview pane is also in need of an overhaul, and I don&apos;t like the split notification pane with the toggles to one side and notifications on the other. Other than that, the interface itself is fluid, and you get a good amount of customizability. Honor guarantees four platform updates as standard, but the brand isn&apos;t as quick to roll out those updates.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> continues to be my recommendation if you need a flagship that takes the best photos and videos. The 14 Ultra has a gorgeous design in its own right, and it is the only phone I used this year that outshines the Magic 6 Pro in the imaging section. Coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Xiaomi-Ultra-White-Smartphone-Snapdragon/dp/B0CRFR5BQD">in at Â£1,299</a> ($1,628), it isn&apos;t affordable by any measure, but it costs less than the Magic 6 RSR, and I like its software better. That said, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra only goes up to 512GB, and there isn&apos;t a 1TB model available.</p><p>Of course, there&apos;s the regular Magic 6 Pro to consider. The phone has the same internals as the Magic 6 RSR, and it costs a lot less. You still get terrific cameras, a great design with a leather back, vibrant screen, and incredible hardware. The Magic 6 Pro has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, and it is available for as low as Â£849 ($1,064) as of writing.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-should-you-buy-it"><span>Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C2KoeZXRm6GULRw9nHMnkC" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-back.jpg" alt="Back view of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C2KoeZXRm6GULRw9nHMnkC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You like the look of the Magic 6 Pro and want a custom variant</li><li>You need terrific cameras</li><li>You need a bright AMOLED panel with plenty of customizability</li><li>You need all the extras</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best value</li><li>You need multi-day battery life</li></ul>
<p>If you&apos;re considering the Magic 6 Pro and want something that stands out a bit more, the Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR may just be the phone for you â€” provided you&apos;re ready to shell out the premium. The Porsche Design label continues to carry a premium, and while the Magic 6 RSR has double the memory and storage, it costs Â£500 ($626) more. But if that&apos;s not a consideration, you&apos;ll love what the phone has to offer.</p><p>The design is distinctive, and the hexagonal camera island combined with the color choices allows the Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR to turn heads. I still don&apos;t like the decision to use a glossy coat at the back on the Frozen Berry model, but the bundled leather case solves that issue without obscuring the design too much.</p><p>The rest of the device isn&apos;t too different to the standard Magic 6 Pro; you still get the same terrific cameras, the screen is one of the best around, and it has one of the best hardware packages available today. The battery life isn&apos;t as good as other flagships I used, and the vibration motor doesn&apos;t do much. But outside of that, there aren&apos;t any noticeable issues.</p><p>Ultimately, choosing between the Magic 6 Pro and Magic 6 RSR comes down to pricing; if you don&apos;t mind paying a premium, the Magic 6 RSR is the way to go. It has unique styling and 1TB of storage, and I think this is Honor&apos;s best phone yet.</p>

<ul><li>T-Mobile announced Wednesday that it had completed its purchase of Kaâ€™ena Corporation, which owns Mint Mobile, Ultra Mobile, and Plum.Â </li><li>The company made a commitment to keep Mint Mobile's entry-level plan priced at $15.Â </li><li>Mint and Ultra Mobile users will also get access to select T-Mobile features, like scam screening and free Canada roaming.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As of today, T-Mobile officially owns and operates Mint Mobile, the company announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/t-mobile-closes-acquisition-mint-and-ultra-mobile" target="_blank">press release</a> Wednesday, May 1. T-Mobile closed a $1.35-billion deal to acquire Kaâ€™ena Corporation that was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-mint-mobile-acquisition">originally announced in March 2023</a> but was held up due to regulatory concerns. Aside from Mint Mobile, the Kaâ€™ena Corporation is also the parent company of Ultra Mobile and Plum, and all three brands will be folded under <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-t-mobile-everything-you-need-know">T-Mobile</a>.Â </p><p>T-Mobile finally got approval from the Federal Communications Commission to move forward with the deal last week and swiftly completed the acquisition, which was more than a year in the making. Concerns that Mint Mobile&apos;s budget-friendly offerings might be changed by joining T-Mobile appear to have been settled since T-Mobile is pledging to keep a $15 per month Mint Mobile plan available.</p><p>"We are excited to maintain the unique style and entrepreneurial spirit that make Mint and Ultra truly special, while also finding ways to supercharge their growth and leverage some of the secrets of that success into other areas of our business," said Mike Katz, who is T-Mobile&apos;s president of marketing, strategy, and products.</p><p>While the price of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a>&apos;s $15 plan isn&apos;t changing, it is gaining new features from T-Mobile. Mint Mobile users will now get access to the company&apos;s call screening technology, which identifies calls associated with known scammers with a "Scam Likely" caller ID. Additionally, Mint Mobile customers can use unlimited talk, text, and up to 3GB of data while in Canada for free.Â </p>

<p>Ultra Mobile users will soon get an "enhanced data roaming option" while in Mexico on most plans, too. T-Mobile says that it will keep looking for more ways to add features to Mint Mobile and Ultra Mobile plans over time.</p><p>A few prominent Mint Mobile figures will be joining T-Mobile, including celebrity and former partial Mint Mobile owner Ryan Reynolds. The company says Mint founders David Glickman and Rizwan Kassim will join T-Mobile, leading their respective teams previously under Kaâ€™ena Corporation.Â </p><p>For T-Mobile, closing this deal marks the company&apos;s biggest acquisition since it bought Sprint in 2020.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm announced its FY Q2 2024 financial earnings.</li><li>The company's revenues were slightly up year over year, while net income was up by 37%.</li><li>Qualcomm has been expanding its presence in the PC market while readying new smartphone chips with its new Oryon cores.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm started off the month by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4a01bea9588542baeb69985a30cfbe82/qualcomm/db/773/7396/file/FY2024+2nd+Quarter+Earnings+Release.pdf">posting</a> its fiscal year Q2 2024 financial earnings on Wednesday. While revenue was relatively flat, the company reported $9.39 billion in revenue for the quarter, an increase of 1% over the same quarter in 2023.</p><p>Qualcomm&apos;s headset business, which makes up most of its overall revenue, also saw a 1% increase during the quarter, reaching $8.03 billion. While this may not seem like a large gain, it signals healthy growth in the smartphone industry after a bit of a slump just a year ago. By comparison, Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-fy-q2-2023-earnings">FY Q2 2023 earnings</a> revealed a 17% drop in headset and overall revenue, so the recent numbers are encouraging.</p><p>"We are excited about our continued growth and diversification, including achieving our third consecutive quarter of record QCT Automotive revenues, upcoming launches with our Snapdragon X platforms, and enabling leading on-device AI capabilities across multiple product categories," says Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon in a statement.</p>

<p>During the quarter, Samsung launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>, which is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s latest chipset. While Qualcomm no longer has global share with Samsung&apos;s flagships, Qualcomm CFO AkashÂ Palkhiwala also highlighted the company&apos;s strong presence in the Chinese market, which includes new devices from companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">OPPO</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi</a>.</p><p>"We saw year over year handset revenues from our Chinese OEM increased by greater than 40% in the first half of fiscal &apos;24, reflecting our strong competitive positioning and recovery of demand," Palkhiwala said during the earnings call.</p><p>Amon adds that Qualcomm has "not seen signs of weakness in the Android premium market in China, especially with our OEMs, so a lot of strength really coming from premium devices from Xiaomi or OPPO, OnePlus, Vivo."</p><p>Qualcomm also notes that while its FY Q3 expects to see seasonal dips given the lack of major hardware launches, it looks forward to the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> later this year, which will feature the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">new Oryon CPU cores</a>. Qualcomm is also looking to the launch of new AI PCs powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/what-is-snapdragon-x-elite">Snapdragon X Elite chip</a>, which promises to compete with the likes of Apple&apos;s M-series chips.</p><p>As with the current batch of phone chipsets, Qualcomm is betting big on AI, which it expects will enable more use cases in various devices, be they phones, PCs, or cars. The company highlights its AI hub for developers to help drive this adoption.</p><p>"I want to step back and say, in general, I think AI is going to benefit all the devices," Amon says. "I think AI, when extends to running on-deviceâ€”besides the benefit of working alongside the cloudâ€”they have completely new use cases privacy, security, latency cost, personalization, etc."</p><p>"It&apos;s an exciting tailwind, I think, for our strategy of actually driving computing and connectivity at the edge."</p>

It&apos;s so easy to fill up your Android phone with junk files, but the good news is that there are easy things you can do to regain that space.Â </p><p>The steps are similar whether you&apos;re trying to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-free-space-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">free up storage space</a> on one of the best Android phones or not. In the following guide, you&apos;ll see integrated options and a Google app you can use to help you free up that much-needed storage space.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-check-the-available-storage-on-android"><span>How to check the available storage on Android</span></h3>
<p>First things first, we should check how much space is left on your phone. It&apos;s a good idea to go through and clean stuff up every now and then, regardless of how much space you have, but if you still have a lot of room to go, there&apos;s no sense in going overboard.</p><p>1. Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Storage</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.11%;"><img id="VVU76bCRsB9KCSUfXpwhFh" name="Free-up-storage-space-Android.jpg" alt="Android setting that show storage option" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VVU76bCRsB9KCSUfXpwhFh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2160" height="2400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Judy Sanhz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the very top of the page, you&apos;ll see how many gigabytes of storage you&apos;ve used, along with a percentage to help put things in perspective. Although devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> offer 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB of storage out of the box, you can fill that up astonishingly quickly with junk files if you&apos;re not careful.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-uninstall-unused-apps"><span>How to uninstall unused apps</span></h3>
<p>Unused apps on your Android device take up a lot of storage space. The steps to uninstall an app might differ depending on your phone, but they are not too different.</p><p>With a phone running stock Android, like the Motorola G14, you can long-press and drag the app icon to the top toward the Uninstall option.</p><p>Meanwhile, long-pressing on a Galaxy phone will give you the uninstall option but won&apos;t show it when you drag the app icon to the top. It&apos;s not the quickest way, but you can also go to the Google Play Store > search for the app > tap the uninstall button.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Clearing an app&apos;s data resets it to factory default settings, erasing all personal data and settings.</p><p>To erase app data, you&apos;ll need to do this one app at a time.</p><p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Choose the <strong>Apps</strong> option.</p><p>3. <strong>Select an app</strong> whose data or cache you want to erase.</p><p>4.

<p>When you tap the <strong>Clear storage</strong> option, you&apos;ll get a warning message that this app&apos;s data, including files and settings, will be permanently deleted from your Android device.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-free-up-storage-using-google-files"><span>How to free up storage using Google Files</span></h3>
<p>There are two ways you can access the Files app from Google. You can open the app from your home screen or go to <strong>Settings > Storage > Free up space</strong>.

Apps</p><p>Choose an option and browse through your files. Once you see something you want to erase, long-press on the files, followed by the trash can icon at the top. The Files app also has a Clean option to help you remove unnecessary files such as junk files. To use it, tap the hamburger icon at the top left, and the Clean option will appear first on the list.</p><p>You&apos;ll see suggestions on files you can erase; for example, you can erase:</p><p>1.

<p>All the pictures and videos you&apos;ve captured will always be available in Google Photos. This feature simply removes the local versions that are taking up unnecessary space on your device. However, there is also a way to remove already backed-up pictures and videos on Google Photos.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-erase-backed-up-photos-and-videos-using-google-photos"><span>How to erase backed-up photos and videos using Google Photos</span></h3>

<hr>
<p>Google is in the middle of a wave of layoffs at the office as the company is reportedly letting people go from its "Core" teams.</p><p>The report about Google&apos;s layoffs comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/google-cuts-hundreds-of-core-workers-moves-jobs-to-india-mexico.html">CNBC</a>, who state the company has laid off nearly 200 employees from its "Core" teams. Google confirmed the layoffs, with a spokesperson adding that those affected can reapply for other roles within the company.</p><p>The "Core" teams are responsible for the "technical foundation" behind many of Google&apos;s products and services for security and online safety. The company has also reportedly started a "reorganization" that moves roles to India and Mexico. This was a future Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/23/google-search-boss-raghavan-warns-employees-of-new-operating-reality.html">told employees in March</a> as it hoped to "move closer" to other markets, including Brazil.</p><p>Documents obtained by the publication suggest that Google&apos;s vice president of its Developer Ecosystem, Asim Husain informed employees in their team of the impending layoffs. During a town hall meeting, Husain informed staff that "this was the biggest planned reduction" for the team in 2024.</p><p>Husain said, "announcements of this sort may leave many of you feeling uncertain or frustrated" and added that the cuts "are in service of our broader goals" at the company. AI has continuously been a top priority for Google, with Husain informing employees that they are at an "inflection point."</p><p>Google&apos;s Core teams are said to be affected by layoffs in its governance and protected data group, which works directly with the company&apos;s regulatory side. The group&apos;s vice president, Evan Kotsovinos, informed team members about the cuts, stating there is a strong focus on "moving faster."</p><p>This is reportedly due to an "escalating regulatory focus" on Google.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google for a statement regarding the recent layoffs, but they did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<p>These cuts come at an interesting time, as Alphabet stated in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/alphabet-q1-2024-earnings">Q1 earnings report</a> that it obtained $80.5 billion in revenue with "strong performance" across services. Per its CEO Sundar Pichai, areas like Search, YouTube, and Cloud were stated to have done well in the first quarter. AI was weaved throughout everything Alphabeta talked about as Google&apos;s race to inject more of Gemini throughout its ecosystem.</p><p>Additionally, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-hardware-team-restructuring-merge">announced its reorganization</a> in mid-April, stating that it had merged its hardware teams with its software side. The idea was to bring teams closer together in the same space to quickly create products and services for consumers.</p><p>Moreover, Pichai stated the move will create a "deep AI experience" across all of Google&apos;s devices and platforms.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/alphabet-googles-parent-company-is-going-to-cut-about-12000-jobs">Alphabet cut 12,000 jobs</a>, around 6% of its workforce, early in 2023. The decision was made as Google&apos;s parent company sought to "tighten its belt" and move into a more "efficient" era of spending.</p>

<hr>
<p>Mobvoi is back to shake up the week in wearables with an announcement of an announcement. In a teaser posted to X (formerly Twitter) early Wednesday, the company says, "The future arrives in days," hinting at a new smartwatch reveal. The post doesn&apos;t reveal much, but it includes an outline of a smartwatch that closely resembles the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a>. As such, we could be seeing a successor debut soon or at least a new variant of the current model.</p><p>Yearly smartwatch releases are becoming the norm, with Google and Samsung finding a rhythm with an annual update schedule. Mobvoi released the TicWatch Pro 5 at the end of May 2023, so we&apos;re due for an upgrade if the company is eyeing an annual upgrade. This, plus the teaser&apos;s graphic, seems to suggest that a TicWatch Pro 6 reveal could be just days away.Â </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A New Era Dawns. The Future Arrives in Days. pic.twitter.com/uOxwo2rtxT<a href="https://twitter.com/Mobvoi_Official/status/1785670514955932083">May 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>While casual smartwatch buyers might not recognize Mobvoi or TicWatch as a household name, it&apos;s clear that the TicWatch Pro 5 is a seriously impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a>. Aside from true multi-day battery life, the watch features a clever dual-screen design. Additionally, it is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s best smartwatch chip, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen1 platform</a>, which also powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>.</p><p>The issue that Mobvoi hasn&apos;t been able to solve to date is software support. The TicWatch Pro 5 still doesn&apos;t have official Wear OS 4 support, even as we&apos;re looking ahead to Wear OS 5. TicWatch Pro 5 users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-4-beta-recruitment-opens">beta test Wear OS 4 soon</a> â€” but they have to complete a questionnaire and agree to an NDA. If hardware is the limiting factor here, a new TicWatch Pro 6 could debut with Wear OS 4 and might even include a path to Wear OS 5 when it releases.Â </p><p>Speaking of Wear OS 5, the operating system upgrade is slated to be released this summer, as Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">basically confirmed in its I/O 2024 event schedule</a>. More recently, there have been signs that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wear-os-5-software-testing-spotted">Samsung is testing Wear OS 5</a> right now.Â </p>

<p>Still, this is all mostly guesswork at the moment. Mobvoi&apos;s teaser is likely referencing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-ticwatch-smartwatches">new TicWatch Pro device</a>, but we won&apos;t know for sure until the official announcement in the coming days.Â </p>

<p>It seems that Samsung has started developing its Wear OS 5 software for its line of eligible smartwatches.</p><p>The supposed test firmware was spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MatthewReiter05/status/1784930167539814554">Matthew Reiter on X</a>, which could indicate Samsung&apos;s beginning of Wear OS 5 software testing (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-6-wear-os-5-update-development/">SamMobile</a>). The software, bearing version number <strong>R965USQU1BXD8</strong>,<strong> </strong>was spotted in development for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> series several days ago.</p><p>Moreover, the software seemingly only pertains to the carrier-locked version of the smartwatch in the U.S.</p><p>While more in-depth information about the software is still unknown, Google is slated to talk about the update during I/O 2024.</p>

<p>Google is preparing for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">annual I/O event</a>, which is slated for May 14 this year. We&apos;re expecting a few reveals and insights from the company, one of which will be Wear OS 5, as the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">revealed its preliminary schedule</a> for developer sessions last month. The session is said to contain an early look at the software as its description reads, "Building for the future of Wear OS."</p><p>This is good news for wearables, as it seems Google is getting on top of a yearly release cadence for the major Wear OS software updates.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s apparent development of its Wear OS 5 (likely One UI 6 Watch) skin potentially appearing now makes sense. Last year, the company originally planned to begin its beta for Wear OS 4 in May <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/one-ui-watch-5-beta-officially-delayed">but faced a delay</a>. Testing didn&apos;t <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/one-ui-5-watch-beta-available-now">start until June</a>, so there&apos;s a chance Samsung isn&apos;t looking to repeat last year&apos;s unsightly problems.</p><p>More importantly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-google-reportedly-testing-wear-os-5">rumors have suggested</a> that the software could debut in time for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> series, likely later this summer. There were multiple sightings of an "unreleased Android 14 build" that could indicate the upcoming Wear OS software. Additionally, Samsung is likely jumping to a headstart to ensure that the new watch, powered by the Exynos 5535, can support the firmware properly.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 6 continues a trend that Samsung has become known for with its wearables. The device boasts a slight performance boost over last year's but features a larger and brighter display.

<p>When I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a>, I found that it truly does it all. With a generous number of features, unbelievable battery life, and tons of fitness tracking perks, it&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> going â€” and why it&apos;s still a daily watch for me.Â </p><p>What you&apos;ll probably notice first, though, is the uniquely brilliant display. The TicWatch Pro 5 uses layered display technology, which helps extend the battery life even further. For example, Daily Mode allows you to use all of your watch&apos;s features, but you&apos;ll need to charge it every night. There&apos;s also Extended Mode, which allows you to use essential features and will only require a charge every couple of days or so.</p><p>When it comes to features and tracking, there&apos;s a lot to unpack. For starters, you&apos;ll love having voice-activated Google Assistant, mobile payments with Google Pay, built-in GPS, heart-rate monitoring, activity/sleep tracking, smartphone notifications, and more. While the design is slimmer and more lightweight than previous Pro models, it still comes in a 50mm case. This might be too large for some wrists, so that&apos;s something to think about. The price tag isn&apos;t in the value category, but if you can swing it, this is one of the best TicWatch smartwatches out there.</p>

<p>Based on the price, I was hesitant about how much the Ticwatch E3 could offer. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mobvoi-ticwatch-e3-review">once I reviewed the watch</a>, I quickly realized that it was a fantastic wearable. This is especially true if you&apos;re a budget shopper who doesn&apos;t want to spend a fortune on a smartwatch.Â </p><p>You get the older Snapdragon Wear 4100 chipset which still delivers amazing performance, for starters. The lightweight design will look familiar as it loosely follows what we&apos;ve seen in previous TicWatch E models. You get a 1.3-inch HD display with a large bezel around the watch face. This model is compatible with 20mm interchangeable bands, and comes with IP68 water resistance that&apos;s suitable for pool swimming.</p><p>There&apos;s also a great selection of health/fitness features on the TicWatch E3. You&apos;ll have built-in GPS, activity/sleep tracking, heart-rate monitoring, blood oxygen tracking, and more. There&apos;s also a built-in mic and speaker for Google Assistant and NFC for Google Pay. You&apos;ll also have to accept the mediocre battery life, other than the love-it-or-hate-it bulky bezel. It&apos;ll typically last for two days on a single charge, but you can opt for Essential Mode. This will limit certain features to help extend battery life when necessary.</p>

<p>You won&apos;t find a better smartwatch for your outdoor lifestyle than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ticwatch-pro-3-ultra-gps-review">TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra</a>. Wherever you go, the Pro 3 Ultra can go too. During my review of the watch, I took it on camping trips, cutting down trees on my property, and through various workouts, and it kept going. When you combine this level of durability with unlimited tracking abilities, including proactive sport modes, swim monitoring and swim style detection, a built-in GPS, heart rate sensor, and sleep tracking, there&apos;s not a whole lot that the Pro 3 Ultra can&apos;t do.</p><p>The proactive sports modes allow you to keep going at your own pace without slowing down to mess with your watch. It&apos;s powered by TicMotion, which is Mobvoi&apos;s suite of proprietary AI algorithms. It proactively detects your motion, tracks your swim activities, and provides your fitness records without you having to press or do a thing. The dual-layer display will ensure you always have the important information visible and stretches the battery to up to 30 days in essential mode. Simply get going, and it will follow suit.</p>

<p>It&apos;s been over a decade since the first smart ring was introduced, giving people another option to track their health, but it wasn&apos;t until recently that the tech caught on. Now, there are quite a few different options on the market, but you may find yourself comparing two of the most popular ones at the moment: the Ultrahuman Ring Air and Oura Ring Gen 3.</p><p>You may have tried <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness trackers</a> or one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> to get the job done, but if you don&apos;t want a shiny display distracting you, then one of these smart rings might be the solution since it gives you the info your smartwatch does but without the diversion. So, how do these rings compare? Hopefully this will help you decide on your next wearable.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vMPRBuPqBEmv2StvX6UTHa" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-next-to-regular-ring.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air next to a typical ring to show its size, surrounded by other jewelry." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vMPRBuPqBEmv2StvX6UTHa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to wearables, one question that always comes up is how comfortable it will be. Ultrahuman&apos;s smart ring has a uniform and spartan design, and according to Micheal Hicks&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air review</a>, you don&apos;t feel like you&apos;re wearing a ring but something tech. The design is more functional than stylish, and at 2.5 millimeters thick and weighing just 3 grams, it&apos;s thinner and lighter than the Oura Ring Gen 3.Â </p><p>Overall, it has a sleek look, with a tiny sensor bump at the bottom that makes it more comfortable to wear. The ring is available in Raw Titanium, Aster Black, Bionic Gold, Matte Grey, and Space Silver. Regarding sizes, the Ultrahuman Ring Air goes from a size five to a size 14. You&apos;ll need to try the sizing kit ring and wear it for one day to get the right size, but to speed things up, you can try Ultrahuman&apos;s e-sizing system. The sizes may differ slightly from US ring sizes, and they don&apos;t offer half sizes.</p><p>The Oura Ring Gen 3 features three sensors or bumps that might feel uncomfortable to some but go largely unnoticed. It&apos;s available in a bevy of colors and styles, including matte black, Gold, Rose Gold, Silver, Titanium, and Dark Gray. The ring comes in two designs: the Heritage and the Horizon. The difference between the two is that the Heritage design has a little ridge on the top that is meant to face the dorsal side of your hand, while the Horizon design is fully circular and has a small dimple-type design meant to face the palmer side of your hand.Â Also, the Oura Ring Gen 3 is the heavier of the two models.</p><p>In sizes, the Oura ring one-ups the Ultrahuman since it&apos;s available in sizes six to 13, which is two fewer than the Ultrahuman.Â The Oura ring sizes may differ slightly from US ring sizes, and they also don&apos;t offer half sizes. You can also go to your nearest Best Buy and buy it there, which makes it easier, so you don&apos;t have to wait for a sizing kit to come in the mail.</p><p>The weight and dimensions are 2.55mm, weighing around four to six grams, depending on your ring size. Due to its larger size, using the Oura Ring Gen 3 for activities such as weightlifting may be uncomfortable, as mentioned in Derrek Lee&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3 review</a>. However, it still manages to squeeze in a discreet design and makes quite a statement.</p>
<h2 id="ultrahuman-ring-air-vs-oura-ring-gen-3-sensors-2">Ultrahuman Ring Air vs. Oura Ring Gen 3: Sensors</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3659px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZzZ9w48Ygxh6RbrNi64DRH" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-in-hand.jpg" alt="Oura Ring (Gen 3) in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZzZ9w48Ygxh6RbrNi64DRH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3659" height="2058" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One crucial factor when choosing a smart ring is the sensors. You might get one to track certain things, so specific sensors are necessary. For example, the Ultrahuman Ring Air has sensors such as Infrared PPG (Red, Green, and IR LEDs for HRM and SpO2), non-contact skin temperature, and 6-axis motion. It also uses optical sensors to monitor sleep and all their stages (i.e., REM or deep).</p><p>The Photoplethhysmogram (PPG) sensor will measure your heart rate and oxygen saturation. Still, in Michael Hick&apos;s review, he mentions how the Ultrahuman Ring Air never showed him oxygen levels under 99% or 100%. However, his smartwatch showed him that over the years, his average percentage would be between 96-98%. If this is essential for you, then this could be a reason not to get the smart ring. The smart ring does lack critical data such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 max</a> and respiratory rate. The Ultrahuman Ring is still getting beta features and making improvements in response to the criticism it gets. With temperature readings, the smart ring will give you a precise reading and measure while you&apos;re asleep and awake.Â </p><p>The Oura Ring also has sensors for heart rate, sleep, activities, morning readiness, and blood oxygen. But Oura has a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-resilience-metric-tracks-stress-recovery">Resilience</a> metric you won&apos;t find in its competitor. This metric lets the ring assess your resilience in stressful situations. It&apos;ll track your daytime, overnight, and stress recovery trends during the day.</p><p>Regarding reading your temperature, the Oura ring shows a relative change compared to your baseline. So, to get an accurate reading, you need to wear the ring for at least a few days, and it only measures while you&apos;re sleeping. You&apos;ll also notice that when using the app, the Oura Ring says it&apos;s showing you the body temperature, while the Ultrahuman Ring app will say Skin temperature. Both rings can be worn on any finger, but the company advises you to wear them on the index finger for a more accurate reading.</p>

<h2 id="ultrahuman-ring-air-vs-oura-ring-gen-3-activity-2">Ultrahuman Ring Air vs. Oura Ring Gen 3: Activity</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YfqvMSCCxKbLw7zSnUdfPb" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-showing-logo.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air held in fingertips to show the Ultrahuman logo engraved inside." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfqvMSCCxKbLw7zSnUdfPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both rings detect activity such as skin temperature, sleep, and heart rate. Each smart ring has an app that allows you to get the readings you need. With the Oura Ring Gen 3 app, you can specify your activities, such as a hike and 20-minute spinning class, while the Ultrahuman Ring Air will count two activities as one. The Oura Ring Gen 3 features automatic activity detection, such as dancing or gardening, while the Ultrahuman Ring Air comes in manual and is still in beta. The rings also lack irregular heart rhythm (AFib) detection.</p><p>On the Ultrahuman Ring Air, tap the Movement screen to view your movement information, such as active hours, minutes, and calories burned. The apps for the two smart rings focus on two different things. For example, the Oura&apos;s focal point is recovery and rest. The app makes information such as your readiness score, activity goal, and sleep score easy to read. You can see tips on the best time to sleep and bedtime tips. The app will have sections such as Sleep, Readiness, and Activity.</p><p>The Ultrahuman Ring Air focuses more on stimulants and sleep. It advises when and when not to drink caffeine-containing beverages like coffee. You&apos;ll also see important information about your range. Oura&apos;s app has a better design and is easier to read. The information is in a more logical order than the Ultrahuman app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3589px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="wGoKZDegpdeQkpNxAwUnFi" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-smartphone-app.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring (Gen 3) and the companion app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGoKZDegpdeQkpNxAwUnFi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3589" height="2019" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One big difference between the two rings is that Oura has a $6 subscription attached to it. It&apos;s not required, per se, but you will need it if you want more detailed information about your metrics beyond your sleep score. This can be a deterrent for some, although it&apos;s worth keeping in mind that Oura is constantly improving its ring with new features.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ultrahuman does not require a subscription to view your data.</p>
<h2 id="ultrahuman-ring-air-vs-oura-ring-gen-3-price-and-availability-2">Ultrahuman Ring Air vs. Oura Ring Gen 3: Price and availability</h2>
<p>Both the Oura Ring Gen 3 and the Ultrahuman Ring Air are available to purchase now. The Oura smart ring is priced at $349 for the Horizon design and $299 for the Heritage version.

<p>Oura is a well-established brand that has been in the game for a long time. The app is also easier to understand and navigate, but after your free trial, you have to pay $5.99 a month. Oura&apos;s longer existence might incline people to try it despite the monthly subscription.</p><p>If you don&apos;t want to pay a monthly subscription, you&apos;ll be tempted to go with the Ultrahuman Ring Air. It&apos;s lighter, and its readings provide a lot of information. It&apos;s new to the smart ring area, and it&apos;s a brand that not many may have heard of, which may deter some. It still has things to learn from Oura, but it&apos;s still a very capable smart ring that will get better over time.</p>
