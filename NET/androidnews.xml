<p>In the words of our very own Andrew Myrick, Chromebooks are simple, versatile laptops that can be excellent tools for students and professionals alike. These handy laptop/tablet 2-in-1s are designed to meet most of your needs on the go, like a lite portable workstation. But they&apos;re not ideal for everyone, something that I&apos;ve been coming to terms with over my time with one.</p><p>Since I travel a lot, it only made sense to get one of these sleek things myself. My everyday machine is an HP Victus 16, which is a chunky gal. It is an absolute nightmare to have to take it out of my hand carry every time I&apos;m crossing airport security, which sometimes happens multiple times on a single journey if I have connecting flights.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t expecting smooth sailing because we&apos;ve all heard that ChromeOS has its quirks. However, some people swear by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> and how capable these budget devices really are. After using a Chromebook on and off for more than a year now, I am forced to admit that it&apos;s not all rainbows and sunshine. It fails to meet my needs, and I&apos;ve come to the point where I&apos;m just going to get a Microsoft Surface instead.</p>

<p>ChromeOS has so much potential. It could morph into the perfect love child of Android and Windows someday. But for now, I personally feel like that day is very far off. Students might make do with a Chromebook, but working professionals are going to struggle immensely when working off of one for more than a day or two.</p><p>To be honest, my work as a writer and editor doesn&apos;t require much. But I was amazed at how annoying it was to do the simplest tasks that take me a few seconds on my Windows laptop. The ordinary task of resizing an image to a specific size or sharing files to and from a ChromeOS tablet is unnecessarily frustrating. Who would have thought that I would struggle with something as simple as editing or using the find function on slides?</p><p>Sure, there are a lot of workarounds that gap the bridge between what can and cannot be done on ChromeOS, but honestly, who&apos;s got the time for that when you&apos;re working away from home and simply don&apos;t have the time or resources at hand to put up with fixes?</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I'd rather put up with annoying security checks than feel handicapped while working abroad.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Another problem with Chromebooks is that not all accessories play nice with them. Keyboards and mice need to be prepped to work with ChromeOS. So despite having an amazing Logitech mouse, universal Android styli, and a bunch of cool mechanical Bluetooth keyboards, I was forced to purchase new companion accessories for my Chromebook. This irked me even more.</p><p>Yes, traveling with something as lightweight as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-duet-5-chromebook-review">Lenovo Chromebook Duet 5</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-review">Acer Chromebook Spin 714</a> has its conveniences. But needing to rely on a bunch of add-ons, which also need to be packed and taken along, cancels out the perks of portability. I&apos;d rather put up with annoying security checks than feel handicapped while working abroad.</p>

<p>I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m old-school, lazy, stupid, or a creature of habit because I&apos;d just rather buy a Windows 2-in-1 for my on-the-go work needs. This ties into why I have my eyes set on a Surface laptop — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-go-3">Microsoft Surface Go 3</a>, to be exact.</p><p>You might ask, why the Surface Go 3 specifically? See, it&apos;s the perfect substitute for a Chromebook (or maybe it&apos;s the other way around). All I need is a powerful enough tablet PC with all the apps I need for work, an ecosystem of decent companion accessories that I don&apos;t need to hunt down myself, and an easy-to-use OS that I&apos;m familiar with.</p><p>The Go 3 checks all the boxes for me, and it&apos;s pretty cost-effective, too, even if I compare it with ChromeOS machines. You can buy a keyboard, stylus, and mouse for the device if you want to use it as a laptop. The 2-in-1 can be used as a tablet, too, and because it runs Windows 11, you can use it like any other computer. On top of that, it supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">memory cards for expandable storage</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s a battle of convenience, and Microsoft has won in my eyes. A Surface simply feels more complete than a Chromebook. Of course, when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/best-windows-tablets">Windows tablet PCs</a>, there are a ton of other excellent competitors available that deliver value for money and all of the above.</p><p>Just because Windows 2-in-1s work for me and Chromebooks don&apos;t, it doesn&apos;t mean that they won&apos;t be good enough for you, though. I urge you to try using a Chromebook for a couple of months to find out whether this breed of computer is compatible with your lifestyle and needs.</p>

<ul><li>Apple and Google have partnered to create a new industry spec, called Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers, which will deliver unknown tracking notifications to both iOS and Android users.</li><li>The move comes as the Find My Device continues to roll out for Android users and more Bluetooth item trackers come into the fold. </li><li>Previously, Android users could download an app to scan for unknown Apple AirTags that may be tracking them. Now, there's true cross-platform support. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The prevalence and accuracy of cheap Bluetooth item trackers were intended to make them an easy way to keep track of your belongings. However, they&apos;ve been used for countless nefarious purposes, and personal safety is now a major concern. That&apos;s why Apple and Google have partnered to deliver an industry-wide specification for detecting unwanted item trackers, and it&apos;s called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers/01/" target="_blank">Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers</a>." Now, iOS and Android users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-and-google-deliver-support-for-unwanted-tracking-alerts-in-ios-and-android/">will all receive unknown tracker alerts</a> when conditions are met, regardless of which Bluetooth tracker or platform is used. </p><p>Google and Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-apple-partner-tackle-unwanted-location-tracking">first started work on this project</a> more than a year ago, when the companies announced in May 2024 plans to build an industry standard for unwanted item tracking. </p><p>If either iOS or Android detects that a Bluetooth tracker is moving with a user, they will provide an "[Item] Found Moving With You" notification. The alerts will work with AirTags, Find My-compatible devices, and some Bluetooth trackers compatible with Google&apos;s Find My Device network. Specifically, the brands Chipolo, Eufy, Jio, Motorola, and Pebblebee have all committed to supporting the Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers standard for future products.</p><p>When the notification appears, there will be a few steps that users can take. First, users can ignore the notification if they know about the tracker — like if they&apos;re traveling with a friend and iOS or Android detects their keys. Or, they can see the device&apos;s identifier, play a sound to help find it and take steps to disable it with instructions. </p><p>These steps will vary based on the type of tracker. For example, AirTags can be disabled in seconds by sliding the back cover off and letting the coin-cell battery pop out. </p>

<p>This is an open standard managed by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/" target="_blank">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> , and specifically the Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers working group. That means while Apple and Google are participants, the group works with widespread community and industry insight. Additionally, since it&apos;s cross-platform, more brands and OEMs can support this standard in the future. </p><p>Apple added support for the standard on Monday with the iOS 17.5 update, and Google made the tools automatically available on devices running Android 6.0 or higher. The rollout comes as users outside the U.S. and Canada have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">started to see Find My Device appear on their Android devices</a>, signifying the global deployment of this crowdsourcing network is underway. </p>

<hr>
<p>OpenAI beat Google to the punch today, hosting an event where the company released a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/openai-announces-gpt-4o-promising-gpt-level-intelligence-to-everyone-including-free-users">new AI model called GPT-4o</a>. The timing of OpenAI&apos;s event was not by accident — it came about a day before Google was set to announce artificial intelligence plans and features at the Google I/O 2024 developer conference. However, it looks like OpenAI might spend only a day as the leader in multimodal AI. In a teaser <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1790055114272612771" target="_blank">posted to X</a> (formerly Twitter), we got a look at an unreleased artificial intelligence interface running on an Android phone. </p><p>The main part of the teaser is a video that shows some sort of multimodal AI interface running on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. Visually, it looks kind of like the Pixel Camera app, and the demo shows someone asking it questions about their surroundings. In this case, it&apos;s the Google I/O stage. After correctly identifying that setup was happening for an event, this AI tool also recognized the Google I/O wordmark and explained the details of the developer conference. However, since it&apos;s a pre-recorded video, results have to be taken with a grain of salt. </p><p>Alongside the video, Google says to expect "the latest news about AI, Search, and more" at Google I/O 2024. The main keynote is set for 10 a.m. PT, and we&apos;ll be tracking all the developments in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">live blog</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One more day until #GoogleIO! We’re feeling 🤩.

<p>Gemini has already appeared as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">voice assistant</a>, and as a chatbot that can consume images, screenshots, and more. However, the new part of Google&apos;s teaser is that the interface now supports vision as an alternative to voice and text input. By looking through your device&apos;s camera, this AI interface can answer questions and details about your surroundings. It&apos;s similar to what the Humane AI Pin and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> tried to do with standalone devices. </p><p>However, there&apos;s still a lot we don&apos;t know, like whether this functionality would be built into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> or some other app. The demo seems impressive enough that a supercharged version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gains-more-google-assistant-features">Gemini might be ready to replace Google Assistant</a>, but that&apos;s only speculation for now. </p><p>We&apos;ll gain more clarity on what Google has been working on during Tuesday&apos;s keynote, but for now, this teaser seems to confirm a GPT-4o competitor is coming. </p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re a runner or cyclist looking for personalized guidance and comprehensive data from your smartwatch; you don&apos;t mind buying last year&apos;s fitness watch. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you can afford the Garmin Forerunner 965; you want a watch with an AMOLED display. </p><p>As we noted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-955-review">our glowing Forerunner 955 review</a> over a year ago, the Garmin watch impresses by providing an incredible amount of fitness data for runners in particular, with loads of personalized reports and Training Readiness calculations, super-accurate GNSS tracking with full-color mapping, and days upon days of battery life. </p><p>Sure, the newer Forerunner 965 is arguably a better watch than its predecessor (if you can afford it), but if you want deeply comprehensive running data for less than $500, this is the deal for you.</p>

<hr>
<p>With Google I/O hours away, a few images supposedly depicting the upcoming Pixel 9 series have leaked.</p><p>The set of images was posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rozetked.me/news/33304-eksklyuziv-fotografii-vseh-modeley-google-pixel-9-ot-rozetked">Rozetked</a> (Russian), supposedly depicting an array of live photos for the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 XL (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/mmassive-live-photo-leak-pixel-9-series/">Android Police</a>). Specifications about the devices suggest the base model will sport a 6.2-inch display, the Pro may have a 6.3-inch display, and the 9 XL could see a 6.7-inch screen.</p><p>The publication, which cites an anonymous source, says the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro are the "same size." However, the devices differ in their bezels, as the base model supposedly sports thicker ones compared to the Pro edition.</p><p>The leak continues to say that the displays for the entire 9 series can reach a 120Hz refresh rate.</p>

<p>The alleged live photos give us a much cleaner look at the Pixel 9 series&apos; back panel. The series has been rumored to boast a design change where the camera visor no longer stretches the span of the panel horizontally. These speculated live photos double down on those past rumors, which makes the phones feel more like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>.</p><p>The base model&apos;s camera specs are light, as the publication states it will offer 0.5x and 1x zoom. The Pro and XL models are said to deliver three 50MP cameras with 0.5x, 1x, and 5x zoom capabilities. Additionally, both the higher-end models could debut with UWB support.</p><p>Internally, the Pixel 9 could arrive with a RAM/storage configuration of 12/128GB. The Pro and XL could both feature 16/128GB setups. The entire series is expected to rock the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-samsung-upgraded-tensor-g4-process">Tensor G4</a>, as well. The leak adds that the base Pixel 9 could feature a glossy back panel with "matte frames." This is reportedly different than the Pixel 9 Pro, which will offer a matte back with "glossy frames."</p>

<p>The latest wave of live photos joins <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/alleged-pixel-9-pro-live-photos-surface">an earlier look from April</a> at the Pixel 9 Pro. It was previously rumored that the device would sport a 6.1-inch display, though that&apos;s seemingly not the case now as speculation floats a 6.3-inch display onto the table.</p><p>More importantly, after some rendering confusion, the idea of a potential <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">Pixel 9 XL</a> was theorized in March.

<ul><li>Google already has a partnership with iFixit and Pixel products are given an internal Design for Serviceability Scorecard. </li><li>However, in a Made by Google podcast, the company shared its long-term goal of making Pixel devices more repairable. </li><li>Google wants everything you need to repair your device to be available in your "kitchen drawer."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Right-to-repair is gaining traction, and Google has been a big part of that movement. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-begins-selling-official-googles-pixel-8-series-parts-and-tools-for-at-home-repairs">partnered with iFixit to offer parts, tools, and repair guides</a> for Pixel devices in 2022. Earlier this year, Google officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-publicly-endorses-oregon-right-to-repair-bill">backed the pending right-to-repair bill in Oregon</a>. Now, in the latest episode of the Made by Google podcast, the company elaborated on its plans for making Pixel phones and hardware easier to repair in the future. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shows.acast.com/made-by-google-podcast/episodes/663393aae9604e0012e05efe" target="_blank">podcast</a> featured an interview with Steven Nickel, who is the director of consumer hardware operations at Google. Part of Nickel&apos;s job is to make sure Pixel devices are designed with repairability in mind and to make sure post-sales support is offered to Pixel users. Nickel says he sought out leading right-to-repair initiatives at Google, and it&apos;s clear from the conversation that Nickel believes every Pixel user should be able to repair their devices. </p><p>"We want everyone to be able to do repairs," Nickel said plainly. As for how to reach that goal, he says part of it involves limiting the amount of glue used to seal Pixel phones. </p><p>"I remember going to our repair depot in Japan, and they had just outlined this process really effectively of how to take apart this device," Nickel recounted. "And they had done it by station. There was just one station that all they did was take out all of the glue and scrape it out of there."</p><p>Now, part of Google&apos;s internal process for improving Pixel repairability includes giving each device a "Design for Serviceability Scorecard." Nickel says the score always goes up with each Pixel phone generation, and that&apos;s intentional.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:596px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.67%;"><img id="7hEawpt3ga34ma6jvxG6Ka" name="google-pixel-fold-ifixit-inner-display-replacement.jpg" alt="A look at the internal display replacement kit for the Pixel Fold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7hEawpt3ga34ma6jvxG6Ka.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="596" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: iFixit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google didn&apos;t restrict phone repairs to the parts of the world where Pixel devices are made, deviating from the industry norm, the company says. "It was pretty common back then, and still is, for manufacturers to want to do repair where [the devices] are manufactured," said Nickel. "That never made sense to us." </p><p>Finally, the long-term goal for Pixel repairability is to make fixing the devices a "fixture-less" repair. </p><p>"Fixtures are the tools you need to repair them," Nickel explains. "We want to get to a point where you can reach into a kitchen drawer and be able to replace your screen."</p><p>Google has certainly made progress with Pixel device repairability, but it&apos;s still far from achieving that vision. Currently, Pixel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a> still require specialized opening tools and bits for repairs. The water seal used in water-resistant devices is a specific hurdle the industry appears to be struggling to overcome. However, this interview once again shows that Google is committed to the right-to-repair movement. </p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly experimenting with running ChromeOS on Android devices, though it's unclear if this functionality will ever come to market. </li><li>The company is said to have demoed ChromeOS on Android to its corporate partners at a private event.</li><li>ChromeOS was running on Android using the Android Virtualization Framework, according to the report, and only worked with phones connected to an external display. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Although Google has maintained that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chrome-os-m124-may-update-changes">ChromeOS</a> are two separate and distinct platforms over the years, they&apos;ve also grown closer together in some ways. For example, you can download and use Android apps within ChromeOS. In the future, the reverse might be true. According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-running-on-pixel-3442496/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google is toying with the idea of running ChromeOS on Android phones and has even recently demoed the functionality. </p><p>Previously, it was reported that Google was planning on developing a desktop-like environment for Android that would rival Samsung&apos;s DeX. It looks like another option for the company could be using the desktop operating system it already has—ChromeOS. There were calls by Android and ChromeOS fans to make the latter available on the former, and now there&apos;s a glimmer of hope that it could happen.</p><p>It&apos;s now possible to run ChromeOS on Android, at least internally at Google, due to a new Android feature called the Android Virtualization Framework (AVF). This framework "provides secure and private execution environments for executing code," according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/virtualization" target="_blank">Google&apos;s official documentation</a>. "AVF is ideal for security-oriented use cases that require stronger, even formally verified, isolation assurances over those offered by Android’s app sandbox."</p><p>The first real use case for AVF might come with the ability to run ChromeOS on Android. In fact, Android Authority says that Google is able to run Chromium OS — which is an open-source version of ChromeOS — on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> via this method. It has even shown off Chromium OS on Android devices to other manufacturers it is partnered with, the report says. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="sCh2SmFJ6DPgDyiXwV5c9H" name="acer-chromebook-spin-513-2022-cog-running.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 513 (2022) with Cog app running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sCh2SmFJ6DPgDyiXwV5c9H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The private event saw a Pixel 8 run a Chromium OS variant known as "ferrochrome." It was run using virtualization, which was made possible thanks to the AVF. This functionality also used an external display for Chromium OS output, taking advantage of the Pixel 8 series&apos; new support for display output. </p><p>It&apos;s still up in the air whether ChromeOS on Android will ever be something that leaves the walls of Google. It makes sense that Google would try this out, and it&apos;s reasonable to think that leveraging ChromeOS to offer a desktop environment for Android users is easier than building something from the ground up. Still, Google has maintained that ChromeOS and Android have not merged in the past, and we don&apos;t know whether VMs are something of interest to the company.</p>

<ul><li>A substantial Motorola "Razr Plus 2024" leak seemingly spills all that consumers should expect.</li><li>It's suggested that the device could feature a 6.9-inch display with a slightly larger 3.9-inch cover display alongside RAM and battery upgrades.</li><li>These rumors also confirm a pricing leak that speculated Motorola could keep the price of its 2024 model similar to that of its 2023 edition.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Quite a substantial leak has surfaced regarding Motorola&apos;s upcoming flagship foldable smartphone.</p><p>Information has come to light via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-moto-razr-50-ultra-to-debut-as-razr-2024-in-the-us-check-detailed-specs-and-pricing/">SmartPrix</a> in conjunction with X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1789983910014628206">OnLeaks</a>, who state the Moto Razr 50 Ultra will be called the "Motorola Razr Plus 2024" in the U.S. For specifications, the clamshell is rumored to feature a 6.9-inch pOLED display internally, with a larger 3.9-inch cover display over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">its predecessor</a>.</p><p>It seems consumers are still in for a dual camera array, as the publication states that once it launches, a wide 50MP lens could be paired with a 50MP telephoto. The latter is said to offer 2x optical zoom, while its punch-hole selfie camera is rumored to arrive at 32MP.</p><p>Qualcomm&apos;s recent Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC is speculated to power the Moto Razr Plus 2024. This toned-down chip sits right under the flagship SD 8 Gen 3, though it clocks in at 3.0GHz. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14, </a>with an array of photo and video features powered by AI, is rumored for the device.</p><p>The leaks suggest other notable upgrades, beginning with the device&apos;s RAM. Supposedly, the Razr Plus 2024 will boast 12GB of RAM alongside 256GB of internal storage. Another improvement is rumored to arrive for its battery, as the tipster states the device could pick up a 4,000mAh battery.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey #FutureSquad! Today, I have the complete specs sheet as well as the US pricing of the #Motorola #Razr50Ultra (which will likely be marketed as "Razr+ 2024" in the US) to share with you! 😏On behalf of @Smartprix 👉🏻 https://t.co/7MTNBeLUut pic.twitter.com/IC7CpGnnGc<a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1789983910014628206">May 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The good news here is that the latest leaks suggest that despite the upgrades, the Razr Plus 2024&apos;s price might not change. The device will allegedly hit the market with a $999 price tag, which is the same price that last year&apos;s model launched with, sporting 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p><p>The post adds that Motorola is gearing up for a June launch for the foldable.</p><p>Last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Moto Razr Plus</a> debuted with the same internal display size; however, the latest rumors suggest we&apos;re looking for a slightly larger cover display. The device also debuted with a 3,800mAh battery with 8GB of RAM. With rumors suggesting an upgrade in both areas for (potentially) the same price, it looks like Motorola is staring down stronger competition with Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-display-memory-rumors">Flip 6</a>.</p><p>Regarding pricing leaks, we heard three days ago that Motorola could keep its price similar — at least in Europe. It was purported that the device could feature a €1200 price tag, which closely matched what consumers in the region saw last year. With rumors now suggesting the same for the U.S. market, perhaps this rumor bears weight.</p><p>Additionally, the Razr Plus 2024 had a render leak back in January, which makes us think the device&apos;s design <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-alleged-leaked-render">might not change</a>.</p>

<p>Initially, we expected to see Google introduce some new hardware at I/O 2024, namely the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>. However, it seems that the company had other ideas as the Pixel 8a has already been announced. </p><p>We&apos;re still working through our full review, but you can check out Nick&apos;s initial impressions <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review"><strong>here</strong></a>. In that same vein, Nick gives us his take as to whether you should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">upgrade to the Pixel 8a</a>, or stick with last year&apos;s Pixel 7a. If you decide to take the plunge, there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-deals-how-to-buy">Pixel 8a deals</a> to be found, and in some cases, you can even get Google&apos;s latest phone for free!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb" name="Google-Gemini-app-home-page.JPG" alt="The Google Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1910" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since we aren&apos;t expecting much on the hardware front, we have to assume that Google will put all (or most) of its focus on software. This includes things such as Gemini, and how Google plans to further integrate it into our daily lives.</p><p>However, it will be interesting to see if and how Google responds to OpenAI&apos;s introduction of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/">GPT-4o model</a>. This new GPT model is capable of providing "reason across audio, vision, and text in real time." OpenAI showed off a few rather impressive demos and has already made GPT-4o available. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lots to look forward to @Google IO tomorrow 👀 pic.twitter.com/7HhIWwIlQv<a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1790059401044197468">May 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Although Google hasn&apos;t made any official announcements just yet, the company has started giving us a few teasers. One of which comes from Logan Kilpatrick, the "Lead Product for Google AI Studio." In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1790059401044197468">post on X</a>, Kilpatrick shares a conversation with a Pixel asking it "Hey, what do you think&apos;s happening here?"</p><p>What makes this exciting is that the conversation is being had while Gemini is using the rear camera to see what&apos;s being asked about. Gemini responds stating "It looks like people are setting up for a large event." Kilpatrick then asks "Those big pretty letters on screen, what do those mean." Gemini responds stating "Those letters represent Google I/O, a developer conference held by Google."</p><p>It&apos;s clear that the personal AI race is heating up, and while OpenAI might have seemingly taken a leap forward, Google isn&apos;t just going to sit idly by. </p>

<p>Dustin asks:</p><p><em><strong>Why do phone manufacturers like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, IQOO, etc. send their phones to the FCC for approval if they don&apos;t ultimately get released in the US?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks!</strong></em></p>
<p>This is a really good question, Dustin, thanks for asking. I think a lot of people will be interested in finding out what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-reaches-us-fcc-listing">FCC certification</a> is for and, of course, why companies get it even if they have no plans to sell products in the states. I know I was when I got your email!</p><p>As usual, I like to start with the easy answer and get it out of the way:</p>
<p>FCC certification (for phones and other wireless devices) makes sure the equipment doesn&apos;t interfere with other equipment. For approval, a manufacturer has to set specific limits on all radio signals — both intentional and unintentional — that can be sent out. Other tests do things like ensure the amount of radiation from a device isn&apos;t harmful, but the main goal of certification is to make sure a phone can&apos;t do something like mess with other equipment.</p><p>Any phone sold or marketed in the United States must get FCC approval for either commercial (Class A devices) or residential (Class B) use. If a device has the potential to emit radio signals, like for instance a microwave, it requires something similar known as a Supplier&apos;s Declaration of Conformity filed with the FCC.</p>

<p>Many phone manufacturers will also get FCC approval for devices they don&apos;t intend to sell in the U.S. As Dustin mentioned, it&apos;s common to see Xiaomi (for example) get a phone certified without any intention of selling it here.</p><p>Technically, these devices don&apos;t <em>have</em> to be certified, but doing so is a wise decision. It covers the manufacturer—and you—if you are using one in the U.S., regardless of whether or not it&apos;s sold here.</p>
<p>Thanks to the internet, it&apos;s fairly easy to get your hands on any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, even international ones, no matter where you live. A quick trip to Amazon will get you something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Ultra-256GB-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B0C6QK2QL8">Xiaomi Mi 13 Ultra</a>, and even though it&apos;s a Chinese phone built for the Chinese market, it will work in many places in the States, too.</p><p>Not a lot of people are doing this. There&apos;s no guarantee it will work in your area because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/5g">network support</a>, there is no warranty, and buying it is only half the solution; even after the language is set to English or Spanish, much of the phone is still in Mandarin until a different OS is flashed to the device. It&apos;s easier to buy a phone officially sold in the U.S.</p>

<p>We aren&apos;t most people. If you read about Android or smartphones on the internet, you&apos;re at least a partial nerd, and that&apos;s not a bad thing 😉. A lot of us would love to have some of these phones, even with the extra hurdles to jump through. I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-13-ultra-global-review">Xiaomi Mi 13 Ultra</a> as an example because I would love to have one!</p><p>So, let&apos;s pretend I did shell out the money to import one into my nerdly hands. I certainly want to make sure that it can&apos;t interfere with other devices while I&apos;m using it. Imagine the horror of my phone messing with equipment at a hospital or even causing problems with a TV signal or a Citizen&apos;s Band radio.</p>
<p>This means more than having regrets. You are going to be held financially responsible — the feds take this seriously. So is the manufacturer.</p><p>Xiamoi gets the device FCC certified as a way to cover its own ass, and inadvertently it covers yours, too. the company knows that people with this phone will vacation in the U.S. and that people in the U.S. will buy the product even though it&apos;s not "marketed or sold" in the United States officially.</p>
<p>Government involvement and regulations can be silly, mired in red tape, and often overstep their bounds. In this case, I think what the FCC does — something similar is done in most countries around the world — is a necessary evil. But so is companies getting the certification for products they don&apos;t intend to sell in the U.S.</p>
