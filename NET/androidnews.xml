In theory, being able to set up and use eSIM on Android offers more flexibility. However, getting things up and running isn&apos;t as easy as just popping out a physical SIM card and swapping it over to a new phone. </p><p>Here&apos;s everything you need to know about eSIM and how to get one on your Android phone</p>
<h2 id="what-is-esim-2">What is eSIM?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4273px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="WzFUXy5DtfRHDbAjGqHoyD" name="visible-esim-compatible-android-laptop-close.jpg" alt="Visible phone compatibility web page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WzFUXy5DtfRHDbAjGqHoyD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4273" height="2404" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By using an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/difference-between-sim-and-esim-and-what-future-holds">eSIM</a>, you are essentially downloading all of the necessary carrier data directly to your phone. Previously, this was primarily handled by a physical SIM card provided by the carrier. However, as phones have continued to mature and improve, so has the reliability and versatility of using an eSIM. </p><p>One of the best reasons to use an eSIM is that you <em>shouldn&apos;t</em> need to go into a physical store to activate your phone. You can do it from wherever you are, provided that you have a stable Wi-Fi connection.</p><p>Another benefit of using an eSIM on Android is the option to use multiple phone numbers on a single device. This is great if you are traveling abroad and don&apos;t want to incur roaming fees, as you can simply turn off the physical SIM connectivity and rely solely on the eSIM. </p><p>Thankfully, we haven&apos;t seen any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> ditch the physical SIM card slot. However, the same can&apos;t be said for the iPhone, as Apple removed this option starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-14-pro-review">iPhone 14</a>. </p>

<p>By and large, setting up and starting to use eSIM on Android is a fairly straightforward process. If you purchase a phone from a carrier, then most of the legwork is already done for you. All you&apos;ll need to do is turn off your old phone, turn on your new phone, and go through the initial setup process. </p><p>However, if you already have a phone (or purchased one unlocked), you&apos;ll need to find a carrier, make sure your phone is compatible, and sign up for a plan. Whether it&apos;s because you&apos;re switching to a new carrier with your old phone or want to move your existing number to a different phone, we&apos;ve got you covered.</p>

<p>After making its debut at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-esim-migration-tool">MWC 2023</a>, Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-letting-you-transfer-esims-between-phones">eSIM Transfer Tool</a> is finally available. Meanwhile, Samsung introduced an eSIM transfer tool of its own with One UI 5.1. Unfortunately, not every phone maker or carrier is onboard with offering the ability to transfer an eSIM just yet. However, we hope that will change as pretty much every phone from the past few years includes an eSIM. </p><p>Here&apos;s how to transfer your eSIM from one Android device to another.</p>
<p>1. Go through the steps above for either your Google Pixel or Samsung Galaxy device.</p><p>2. If using a Pixel, tap the <strong>Transfer a SIM from another device</strong> button on the <strong>Connect to mobile network </strong>screen.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9e2w2YqSQzsCFs5paEPaMi" name="iphone-14-pro-max-review-5.jpg" alt="iPhone 14 Pro Max next to Galaxy Z Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9e2w2YqSQzsCFs5paEPaMi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While touted for its versatility and ease of use, not everything is rosy in the world of using an eSIM. For instance, if you have an iPhone 14 or iPhone 15, are using an eSIM, and want to switch to an Android phone, the process is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-android-esim-transfer">a pain in the neck</a>. Even with Google or Samsung&apos;s built-in eSIM transfer tools, the process will likely result in you needing to call your carrier or go into a store.</p><p>But as already stated, there are plenty of benefits to using eSIM, and things should only get better as support for the tech improves.</p>

<hr>
<p>iFixit, a company that has tried to advance the right-to-repair movement by partnership with big tech manufacturers, announced last week that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-samsung-partnership-concludes">it is ending its collaboration with Samsung</a>. The partnership allowed iFixit to distribute official parts and create repair guides for Samsung devices. However, iFixit cut off the deal, saying that Samsung&apos;s "approach to repairability does not align with our mission."</p><p>There&apos;s a lot to unpack here, because iFixit&apos;s decision to back out of the Samsung partnership could have a big effect on consumers. iFixit is the go-to source for reliable original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and aftermarket parts, as well as tools and repair guides, for a swath of consumer electronics products. Is iFixit or Samsung to blame for the breakup? That&apos;s not completely clear, but both sides weren&apos;t perfect. Samsung didn&apos;t set the partnership up for success, and iFixit won&apos;t produce repair guides for Samsung devices <em>at all</em> now that it&apos;s over. </p><p>Regardless of what you think about Samsung and iFixit&apos;s role in the partnership ending, there&apos;s an uninvolved third party that is sitting pretty through all the drama: Google.</p><p>While companies like Samsung may seemingly be uninterested in truly supporting Right to Repair, Google&apos;s approach seems genuine. It&apos;s providing parts and guides as part of its own iFixit partnership, supporting Right to Repair legislation, and more. Samsung&apos;s apparent lack of interest in Right to Repair shows that Google certainly doesn&apos;t have to do all it has done to make repairing Pixels easier and deserves more credit. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WGZFcwvp3vUr2yezPByNfN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-back-titanium-02.jpg" alt="The back of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in the Titanium Grey colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WGZFcwvp3vUr2yezPByNfN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, we don&apos;t know the entire story of how the collaboration between iFixit and Samsung fell apart. iFixit shared some of its side of the story in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/96162/were-ending-our-samsung-collaboration" target="_blank">blog post</a> and a subsequent interview between the company&apos;s CEO and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/samsung/2024/5/23/24162135/ifixit-end-samsung-repair-parts-deal" target="_blank">The Verge</a>. Android Central reached out to Samsung regarding iFixit&apos;s canceled partnership when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-samsung-partnership-concludes">we first covered it last week</a>, but we still have not heard back from the company.</p><p>Even without the additional context, it&apos;s not hard to see why the partnership called the Samsung Repair Hub didn&apos;t work out. Samsung imposed some arbitrary limitations that prevented individual consumers and companies from performing cost-effective repairs. One of the more egregious examples was a Samsung policy that barred iFixit from selling more than seven parts to a customer over a three-month period. This effectively prohibited independent repair shops from benefiting from the deal. </p><p>The other big issue was that Samsung bundled parts together, making repairs cost-prohibitive. For example, to replace the battery on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-ultra-aged-better-than-pixel-6">Samsung Galaxy S22</a>, users would have to pay iFixit a whopping $160 for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/samsung-galaxy-s22-usa-screen-and-battery-genuine?variant=40009041805415" target="_blank">new part</a>. Why? Because Samsung only sells new phone batteries that are pre-attached to a brand-new screen. This is extremely problematic for a few reasons. If you just need to replace a battery, not only are you paying for a screen you didn&apos;t need, but you&apos;re also throwing away a perfectly good display in the process. </p><p>There were probably financial reasons that contributed to the demise of the iFixit and Samsung collaboration, too. For the reasons above, it didn&apos;t make sense for people to buy parts from iFixit, and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if sales were low. </p>

<p>iFixit doesn&apos;t appear to be completely innocent through all this either, and I think it&apos;s fair to wonder whether the company is bitter following the Samsung breakup. Moving forward, iFixit has decided not to make its own repair guides for Samsung products. </p><p>"As Samsung phones are popular devices, we’ve tried to cover them with our in-house repair guides. But as the devices continued to decline in repairability, it made less and less sense," iFixit explained. "Having repair guides is a crucial part of repairability, but if Samsung is just profiting from unpaid work, do they really deserve that credit? We will be turning our limited guide-making bandwidth onto more deserving tech." </p><p>The word choice here is interesting because iFixit alleges that "Samsung is just profiting from unpaid work." But if iFixit&apos;s main goal was to empower people to repair their own devices and help out independent shops, why is it so focused on the finances of creating repair guides? Samsung is one of the largest phone manufacturers in the world, usually trading places as the leader or runner-up in phones sold. The company shipped over 226 million phones in 2023, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/276477/global-market-share-held-by-samsung-smartphones/#:~:text=As%20the%20overall%20smartphone%20market,of%20all%20smartphone%20shipments%20worldwide." target="_blank">Statista</a>, so it&apos;s incredibly disappointing that iFixit seemingly has no interest in helping users repair those devices anymore.</p><p>iFixit wants to make it seem like it doesn&apos;t need to make repair guides for Samsung products, saying that "anyone can make an iFixit guide—in fact, over half of our 100,000+ guides were not written by our in-house team." However, iFixit does make in-house repair guides for plenty of popular products made by companies it does not partner with, including Apple. It seems puzzling that a company claiming to be "pushing the envelope and pulling all the levers we can to make repair universal" would give up on making repair guides for Samsung devices.</p>

<p>I don&apos;t think there&apos;s an innocent party in the iFixit/Samsung fiasco. Samsung should have done more to make the Samsung Repair Hub a viable option for independent repairers, and iFixit should keep making repair guides for Samsung products. But if there&apos;s one company that looks good through all this, it&apos;s Google. </p><p>For its part, Google partnered with iFixit a few years ago and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-publicly-endorses-oregon-right-to-repair-bill">backed a Right-to-Repair bill in Oregon</a> earlier this year. There aren&apos;t any "catches" to Google&apos;s partnership with iFixit, either. You can buy an official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/google-pixel-8-pro-battery-genuine?variant=40272894230631&pk_campaign={PMax:US|Shopping|SSC|FixKits|}&pk_source=google&pk_medium=cpc&pk_kwd=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwu8uyBhC6ARIsAKwBGpQl5z14YmIZEZdusJ2a4Q462QLNfaqzcjRvvc_hlZfd8al3fUunaxwaAluxEALw_wcB" target="_blank">Pixel 8 Pro battery</a> from iFixit, plus all the parts and tools needed to complete the repair, for just $50. </p><p>Google clearly embraces the right-to-repair mission, as evidenced by the company&apos;s words and actions. In a recent episode of the Made by Google podcast, Steven Nickel, the director of consumer hardware operations at Google, talked about the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-wants-to-design-pixel-phones-to-be-repairable-without-special-tools">plan to make Pixel devices more repairable</a>. To say that Nickel&apos;s words make me optimistic about the future of repairing Google devices would be an understatement.</p><p>The goal for Pixel repairability is to make fixing the devices a "fixture-less" repair, he explained. "Fixtures are the tools you need to repair them," Nickel added. "We want to get to a point where you can reach into a kitchen drawer and be able to replace your screen."</p><p>Words are just that—words, but Google&apos;s actions over the about two years of the iFixit partnership prove it&apos;s actually committed to Right-to-Repair. And as the deterioration of the iFixit/Samsung partnership shows, that isn&apos;t a given. Google is doing some good work when it comes to repairability and deserves praise for it. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Pixel 10 series is likely to be powered by Tensor chips made by TSMC and not Samsung.</li><li>New obtained database information by Android Authority seemingly confirms the Tensor G5 (Laguna codenamed) chipset manufacturers.</li><li>Additionally, the Pixel 10 series could finally feature 16GB of RAM as well.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While the Pixel 9 is the next anticipated series from Google, new information already gives exciting details about the successor Pixel 10 series, specifically the chipset that will be powering those models.</p><p>It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g5-chip-testing-preparations">rumored</a> that Google is ditching Samsung for its in-house developed Tensor G5 chip, which likely powers the Pixel 10 series. However, new findings from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/tsmc-tensor-g5-proof-pixel-10-3445056/">Android Authority</a> indicate that TSMC will be producing the upcoming Tensor G5 chip and not Samsung.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:976px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.48%;"><img id="JwJndyz7qAAqXy32tRpCp6" name="Tensor-G5-TSMC-leak.jpg" alt="Tensor G5 by TSMC database leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JwJndyz7qAAqXy32tRpCp6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="976" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication obtained publicly available trade databases that add evidence to the earlier predicted rumors. The databases indicate the companies that ordered goods—Google (as Shipper) and Tessolve Semiconductor (as Consignee) are mentioned—and the description of the goods gives us away some additional details.</p><p>The description broken down by the publication reveals the Google part number, chip&apos;s code name "laguna (LGA)," goods&apos; type, packing type, manufacturer, and the number of tests the mentioned chipset has passed. TSMC is evidently mentioned as the manufacturer, and the packaging technology is InFO POP, which is believed to be associated exclusively with TSMC.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1028px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.37%;"><img id="TVhZDBP2SsF6jw7wJGa4f6" name="Tensor-G5-TSMC-leak-01.jpg" alt="Tensor G5 by TSMC database leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TVhZDBP2SsF6jw7wJGa4f6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1028" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted by the Android Authority report, the other parameters mentioned indicate that Google is still testing the new chip, and it is expected to be at least 16 months away from the official release, which aligns with the Pixel 10 series lineup. The database further mentions the RAM capacity of 16GB, which is an interesting detail to look forward to as it is a significant bump from the current model&apos;s RAM capacity. </p><p>For the uninitiated, the current Tensor chips, including the upcoming Tensor G4 powering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series, are co-developed by Google and Samsung, which has been the case since the first Tensor chip in 2021. </p><p>Parting ways from Samsung suggests Google is gaining more control over its Tensor chips, similar to what Apple does with A and M series chips. It also means that the existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-needs-to-avoid-iphone-15-thermal-issues">thermal problems</a> on Tensor-powered Pixel chips might eventually be resolved and could lead to better overall performance, although we&apos;ll have to wait to see these chips in action to gauge the improvements.</p>

In fact, you may have already been using it as the default messaging app for Android and Wear OS devices. Effectively Google’s answer to Apple’s iMessage service, Google Messages can leverage instant messaging, SMS, and RCS. </p><p>While Google Messages, formerly called Android Messages, has technically been around for the last decade, there have been some notable upgrades. Rich Communication Services (RCS), for example, was added along with end-to-end encryption. Most recently, Google Messages has been enhanced to function akin to other instant messaging services (think WhatsApp and Signal) so you can do things like start group chats, send emoji reactions, and more.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-send-messages-over-wi-fi-data-with-rcs"><span>Send messages over Wi-Fi/data with RCS</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fyQgKdrsP97Hqn6oF2RoHg" name="Google-Messages-lifestyle-widescreen.jpg" alt="Google Messages RCS Chat features on a Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fyQgKdrsP97Hqn6oF2RoHg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the RCS Chat feature in Google Messages, you can send free messages over Wi-Fi using data, ideal if you don’t have an active cellular connection, like if you have turned off cellular while traveling and you’re relying on Wi-Fi alone. It’s pretty simple to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-rcs-chat-features-google-messages">enable RCS Chat in Google Messages</a>. </p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Google Messages</strong>.</p><p>2. Go to <strong>Settings</strong> by selecting your profile icon on the top right.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Messages settings</strong>.</p><p>4. Select <strong>RCS chats</strong>.</p><p>5. Tap the slider beside <strong>Turn on RCS chats</strong> to the right to turn it on.</p><p>6. You may be asked to <strong>Verify your number</strong>.</p>
<p>Since RCS messaging requires having a phone number, you can’t set this up on a phone that you’re using in Wi-Fi mode only without a SIM card, like a device you have given to an older child to use. Without an active cellular number, RCS messaging won’t work. But with one, it’s a great way to continue messaging when you turn off cellular data while roaming or want to conserve your limited amount of voice calling minutes or SMS. </p><p>It’s also a better alternative to SMS, as with any other instant messaging service, since your messages are sent instantly with confirmation of receipt and you can have a seamless conservation with not just one but multiple people. There’s also end-to-end encryptions with RCS messaging, as long as the person with whom your messaging is using RCS Chat as well. </p><p>RCS messaging has been available in the U.S. as well as the U.K. and Spain since 2019 and by the end of 2020, it was made available worldwide.</p>

<p>Bubbles takes an important text conversation and turns it into a movable bubble that appears on your phone’s home screen so you can keep up to date with it at all times, and reply on the fly. It’s great for important conversations so you don’t miss a message and don’t have to click into the Google Messages app every time you need to read the next missive. Whether it’s a message string with your spouse, kids, boss, or even your besties, it’s a great way to prioritize a conversation.</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Google Messages</strong>.</p><p>2. Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Settings</strong> via your profile photo at the top right.</p><p>4. Select <strong>Messages settings</strong>.</p><p>5. Select <strong>Bubbles</strong>.</p><p>6. Select <strong>Selected conversations can bubble</strong> (the wording is Selected only for Samsung Galaxy devices), or <strong>All conversations can bubble.</strong></p><p>7. Go back to the main page.</p><p>8. Wait for a message to arrive in the conversation you want to bubble in Google Messages. Once it does, pull down from the top of the phone to open the Notification window and tap <strong>History</strong>.</p><p>9. Find the message and long-press it.</p><p>10. Tap the slider to the right for Bubble this conversation to turn it on.</p>

<p>Bubbles, it should be noted, are not part of RCS chat, so you don’t have to enable that in order to use them. They’re just a standard feature that has been available with Google Messages for some time. Also, you can eliminate the last few steps when using a Samsung Galaxy phone, as these include a small square with an arrow pointing to the bottom right corner and a message notification that allows you to instantly bubble it to your home screen. </p><p>It’s also worth noting that in order to un-bubble a conversation, you need to reverse these steps and go back to the Settings menu. You can’t simply flick it away, so be choosy about which conversations you bubble and stick to only your most important conversation string.</p>

<p>Like other instant messaging services, you can send more than just text and emojis through Google Messages. You can also send photos and videos. A feature introduced last year allows you to send photos using RCS even faster by scaling down resolution. The trade-off is that the photo is of lower resolution. But when you have a slow Internet or cellular connection, this allows you to send vacation photos, for example, without having to wait for several minutes before they go through. With this option, if you are experiencing lower data speeds, it will ensure your photos zip over to the recipient or recipients in record time.</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Google Messages</strong>.</p><p>2. Open<strong> Settings </strong>by tapping on your profile picture at the top right.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Messages settings</strong>.</p><p>4. Turn on <strong>Send photos faster</strong> by tapping the slider to the right.</p>
<p>You might find that the Send photos faster option is actually already on, as it’s on by default on some phones. In this case, you have already been enjoying it without knowing it! If that’s the case, continue doing what you’re doing and rest assured your photos are being adjusted so they send as quickly as possible. Otherwise, if you want to send images in higher resolution, you should toggle it off.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nvh4Py4UT6CG7cx7uQ7ewT" name="google-messages-rcs-chatting-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Messages RCS chatting on a Pixel 4a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nvh4Py4UT6CG7cx7uQ7ewT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-messages-gets-new-emoji-reaction-effects">Expressive Animations</a> are a neat option in Google Messages, animating commonly used emojis like the thumbs up and down symbols, the laughing emoji, heart, angry, birthday, and more. But many users weren’t too keen on them popping up all the time, especially with these emojis that tend to be used frequently in conversation. Before you get started with Google Messages, you might want to toggle this off so it doesn’t make your everyday conversations a little too expressive.</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Google Messages</strong>.</p><p>2. Open <strong>Settings</strong> by tapping on your profile picture at the top right.</p><p>3. Toggle <strong>Show expressive animations</strong>, depending on whether you want them on or off.</p>
<p>Note that this feature might not yet be rolled out to your specific device, depending on when you read this. But do a quick check, and if it’s there, go ahead and turn it off and you find it to be too much. You can always go back and turn it on when you are up for it. In a perfect world, Google would allow you to choose which emoji become expressive animations, and such customization could potentially be available in the future. Note that turning this feature off won’t impact your Photomoji.</p>

<p>One Time Password (OTP) messages arrive with a special temporary code that expires within a few minutes. They can only be used once and are designed for two-factor authentication. You’ll often see these from sources like a financial institution or when logging into a secure site of some kind. Once you receive an OTP message, chances are you move on to the task at hand and forget all about it. This can add to clutter in your Google Messages. Thankfully, there’s an easy way to set it such that they delete after 24 hours, freeing up space on your phone and reducing clutter.</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Google Messages</strong>.</p><p>2. Open <strong>Settings</strong> by tapping on your profile photo at the top right corner.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Message settings</strong>.</p><p>4. Go to <strong>Message organization</strong>.</p><p>5. Turn <strong>Auto-delete OTPS after 24 hours</strong> to the on position by tapping the slider on the right.  </p>

<p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-customize-swipe-gestures-in-google-messages">customized swipe gestures in Google Messages</a>, you can set what the app does when you swipe left or right on a particular message.

<p>1. Open <strong>Google Messages</strong>.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Settings</strong> via your profile photo in the top right.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Message Settings</strong>.</p><p>4.

<p>You can personalize the look of text bubbles in Google Messages by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-change-text-bubble-color-google-messages">changing the color</a> thanks to this feature that was added in late 2023. It allows you to swap a dull color for something brighter and bolder if desired, or maybe a more muted hue for professional conversations. This can be done by simply changing the theme on your phone, but Google Messages lets you change bubble colors in individual chats, too.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Open a conversation</strong> in Google Messages.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>three dots</strong> in the top right corner.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Change colors</strong>.</p><p>4. Select the color you desire.</p><p>5. Select <strong>Confirm</strong>.</p>
<p>You can choose from nine color options, and the color will change for your messages, with only slight changes for the receiving messages. Keep in mind that this feature is only for RCS chats and may still be rolling out to devices.</p>

<p>Available for use with both SMS or RCS since it was announced in late 2023 (the feature may not yet be available for all Android devices), you can take a photo from your phone, turn it into an adorable Photomoji, then send it to someone in a Google Message. It’s easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-photomoji-google-messages">use Photomoji in the Google Messages app</a>. These are created right from your photo album, so there’s no third-party app needed.</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Google Messages</strong> app.</p><p>2. Open a <strong>conversation window</strong>.</p><p>3. Select the <strong>emoji icon</strong>.</p><p>4. Select <strong>Create</strong>.</p><p>5. Choose an image from your library.</p><p>6. The subject of the photo will be extracted from the image and turned into a Photomoji.</p><p>7. Select <strong>Send</strong>.</p><p>8. To use an already created Photomoji as a reaction within a message, <strong>Long-press on the message</strong>.</p><p>9. Select the <strong>emoji icon</strong>.</p><p>10. Select the<strong> Photomoji tab</strong> (you can also create a new Photomoji from here by selecting <strong>Create</strong> instead.)</p><p>11. Pick the Photomoji from your library and <strong>Send</strong>.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that you can’t crop the image, rotate it, or add filters, so you may wish to crop and/or rotate it in Photos first to the exact look you want and save that version of the photo as a copy to use for the purposes of Photomoji. Once you create and send a Photomoji, it will be saved as a sticker that you can use any time you want, expressing yourself more creatively than with just plain text or even basic emojis.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve tested a few smartwatches with LTE over the years: the Garmin Forerunner 945 LTE, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Pixel Watch 2 LTE. The <em>concept</em> of leaving my phone behind and running free with an on-wrist backup used to tempt me. But my cellular watch experiment made me realize it&apos;s not for me. </p><p>You&apos;ll find dozens of forums and Reddit threads for Apple, Samsung, Google, and Garmin users that are all variations on the same question: Should I buy (or do I need) an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatch-lte">LTE smartwatch</a>? Invariably, you&apos;ll get passionate and logical answers for both "yes" and "no."</p><p>Some people describe the joy they feel of shedding the weight of their massive Ultra or Pro Max phones during runs without losing access to emergency calls and text notifications. They say the call quality isn&apos;t too much different from that of their phones and mention how they love to stream playlists or check directions without anything in their pockets.</p><p>You get just as many people saying they never go anywhere without their phone — making an LTE watch superfluous—and that a watch display is too small to replace a phone&apos;s comfortably when they&apos;d rather use the real thing. </p><p>Others explain that they bought an LTE watch but ended up canceling the extra line—either because their carrier charged way too much in hidden fees or because they realized how rarely they used it. And I&apos;ve heard horror stories from AC writers about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-watch-4-letdown">LTE smartwatches overheating</a>.</p>

<p>My first LTE watch was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-lte-review">Forerunner 945 LTE</a>, part of a care package of Android watches and phones from my EIC in my early days at Android Central. I liked its running metrics, but I never tested the cellular tech. Its safety features, like LiveTrack, felt superfluous when I rarely strayed far from home on runs, and it didn&apos;t have the mic, speaker, or texting features to make it feel worthwhile. </p><p>Since then, aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids">Garmin Bounce</a> for kids, Garmin hasn&apos;t released another LTE watch, despite users clamoring for a cellular version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> or Fenix 7. Perhaps the 945 LTE didn&apos;t sell well enough for Garmin to be confident in the tech, or else the company knows the Garmin Messenger app isn&apos;t popular enough for its iPhone-owning fans to pay for LTE. </p><p>More likely, Garmin wants to double down on satellite tech like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/is-garmin-inreach-messenger-worth-buying">InReach Messenger</a> since Garmin has responded to over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-2023-sos-report-shows-how-satellite-saves-lives">10,000 SOSs</a> across 100+ countries. Satellite fits more with its brand than cellular, which can&apos;t be counted on in areas where serious athletes or adventurers might train. </p>

<p>Back to LTE watches: During my months-long <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> review, I did my due diligence, setting up an expensive cellular line. If ever there was a "standalone" smartwatch that would let me leave my phone behind, I thought that would be it. </p><p>I wasn&apos;t wrong! It works perfectly well <em>sans</em> my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-14-pro-review">iPhone 14 Pro</a>. I answered calls and streamed music over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/airpods-pro-review">AirPods Pros</a>, tapped out texts, glanced at notifications, and enjoyed the lack of weight in my pocket. I could certainly see the appeal of cellular.</p><p>The next time I went running, I kept my phone with me because my combination of dual-band GPS, Apple Music, and cellular use had burned through my watch&apos;s battery life like nobody&apos;s business. </p><p>I prioritize long battery life when picking my favorite watches; daily-charge watches like an Apple or Pixel Watch already feel like a compromise, and LTE usage only makes that worse. You can put LTE on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> with better battery life, but you&apos;ll lose the apps and messaging that make cellular worth paying for. </p><p>Add in the fact that my carrier (AT&T) would charge me about $180 a year for my Ultra 2 line when you add in fees and taxes, and you shouldn&apos;t be surprised that my LTE experiment ended prematurely. </p>

<p>I recently got my hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> LTE, and I&apos;m excited to put it through its paces, but I&apos;m not going to turn on the cellular function this time. </p><p>LTE has its uses, especially on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">kids&apos; smartwatches</a>. Some brands have built-in cellular so you can avoid giving your child a phone too young; others have geo-locked alerts that notify you if your kid leaves a safe zone like home or school. Either way, LTE is essential in this specific use case.</p><p>However, for adult use, an LTE smartwatch is nothing but a diet smartphone. I like the idea of having an on-demand backup for emergencies, but it&apos;s hard to convince myself to fit cellular into my budget when I can just be careful and keep my smartphone on hand and fully charged. </p>

<p>As an athlete, satellite would be more useful to me in a remote emergency. And even that feels like something that sounds great on paper, but very few people will buy into it—just like LTE.</p><p>Apple made a splash with satellite emergency features on iPhones, prompting Qualcomm to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-satellite-android-partners">sell Iridium satellite tech to eager Android brands</a>. But this push died quickly once Qualcomm and friends realized that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-satellite-dies-before-it-could-live">most people don&apos;t want to pay for satellite</a>. </p><p>Satellite on iPhones—just like LTE on watches—burns through battery life quickly and will cost about $180/year once Apple&apos;s free trial ends. People like having that emergency SOS option, but once they have to pay for it preemptively? Usage will drop off to the ultra-prepared and those who live in remote areas. </p><p>I&apos;d want satellite more than cellular in a crisis, but having tested niche satellite-enabled products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-gpsmap-67i-review">Garmin GPSMAP 67i</a>—which makes you pay anywhere from $15–65/month for InReach—I know that I&apos;d rather try to avoid emergency situations than pay so much in the off-chance I&apos;ll run into one. </p><p>Maybe this all makes me irresponsible or short-sighted, and I&apos;d never begrudge anyone who pays for an LTE smartwatch or satellite SOS backups. But I&apos;m guessing I&apos;m in the majority of those that just don&apos;t find it worth the cost.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/sonos-launch-ace-headphones"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Earlier this week, Sonos launched its first-ever headphones, "Ace," which look a bit like Apple&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods-max-review">AirPods Max</a>. However, as a unique feature, an in-house engineered design allows the ear cups to be removed, making them easier to clean or swap out for new colors. These Bluetooth wireless headphones offer wired playback through the lone USB-C port. Out of the box, users will get one USB-C-to-USB-C and a USB-C-to-3.5mm to accommodate accessories that can be connected to the headphones.</p><p>Each cup has 40mm drivers and four microphones, which deliver active noise cancellation (ANC) in the &apos;Aware mode.&apos; The headphones come with Dolby Atmos support and can stream spatial audio content from supported services, including head tracking, wherever available. Later this year, Sonos says it will add "TrueCinema," a new tech that will map the space around you and create a virtual surround sound system to match your room.</p><p>The Sonos Ace comes in two colorways black or soft white, mirroring Sonos&apos; more color with its Era speakers. The company claims that the battery lasts up to 30 hours and will be available for pre-order for $449 starting May 21, with general availability on June 5.</p>

The post states, "despite our best efforts" to deliver a high standard for self-repair, "we have not been able to deliver on that promise."</p><p>iFixit adds that it has tried to get the necessary parts to local shops with reasonable prices while "the design of Samsung&apos;s Galaxy devices remained frustratingly glued together," forcing it to "pre-glue" batteries and screens in bundles, which drove up the repair costs for the consumer.</p><p>The company said that its self-repair service will continue to sell Galaxy device parts when it can, but its in-house guides will no longer exist. Pre-existing information on repairing Samsung&apos;s devices will not be removed, meaning users can still return for help on past devices.</p>

<ul><li>Google created a new version of the Google Weather app in 2023 and started rolling it out on select Pixel devices. </li><li>Though the overhauled Google Weather app appeared on more Pixel phones and tablets running Android 14 later, it was still exclusive to Pixel.

<hr>
<p>Google is slowly but steadily updating all of its core apps to match the Material You design language, and Google Weather received that treatment last year. Initially, the redesigned Google Weather app was exclusive to Pixel phones and tablets, although it eventually reached a select few non-Pixel devices. Now, it looks like the refreshed Google Weather app is finally rolling out widely on more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and tablets.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/23/new-google-weather-android/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> was the first to notice the Google Weather app on more devices, after some users started seeing the overhauled app on their devices and posted to social media. These included phones from Samsung, OnePlus, and Honor. However, it was one user on X (formerly Twitter) that provided the most concrete evidence that the Google Weather app should be available on most Android devices. </p><p>That’s because the user claimed to have the new Google Weather “app” on a Nokia 4.2, which was running Android 11. Through an update to the Google app, this user now sees the same Google Weather design as seen on Pixels devices.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Interesting, my old Nokia 4.2 got the new Google Weather "app" after an update to the Google app, today. This phone is on Android 11. I have never seen the new Google Weather on anything but a Pixel on Android 14, so it must be more widely rolling out. https://t.co/IXeyQvBCTA<a href="https://twitter.com/LBPHeretic/status/1793449748562645263">May 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Aside from the Material You design refresh, users will gain other benefits by getting the new Google Weather app. Of course, the approachable and colorful design is an advantage in itself for some, but there are practical advantages that came with the newly redesigned app, too. These include providing more data and using machine learning to make predictions for rain and precipitation. </p><p>Google sees an opportunity to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-leverage-ai-to-make-weather-forecasting-more-efficient">improve weather forecasting using AI</a> and machine learning and has a research project concerning that very idea. For now, there are consumer-grade features that aim to provide more accurate predictions for precipitations using ML in the updated Google Weather app.</p><p>Since people are starting to see the redesigned Google Weather app on a slew of devices from various brands, it feels safe to say the redesign is rolling out in full force.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is likely prepping for the next foldables release in the anticipated July Galaxy Unpacked event, where we expect the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 models. While there are solid rumors about another Z Fold 6 device, new information hints at an all-new model for next year.</p><p>Prominent display analyst Ross Young has shared some exciting details on X about an all-new Galaxy foldable smartphone likely to be dubbed Samsung Fold 6 Slim. It is believed to sport a bigger display than the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and should also be priced similarly to it. However, there seems to be no S Pen input, as seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hearing about a Samsung Fold 6 Slim, Q4'24, bigger display than the Fold 6.

<p>Young further indicates that the display panel for the Fold 6 Slim will be shipping in Q4 2024, and the foldable phone will likely hit the shelves in the first quarter of 2025, right alongside the Galaxy S25 series. Young also noted that they have the upcoming foldable’s cover and folding screen dimensions, which will likely be produced in their next Foldable Report.</p><p>The new information from Young sounds interesting, especially amid the rumors of a cheaper and more expensive foldable phone, which was hinted to launch alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Firstly, there have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-ultra-second-model-rumor">whispers</a> of a more premium Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra model, which was touted to be heavily priced compared to the current $1799 price tag. </p>

<p>Later on, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-could-make-a-cheaper-galaxy-z-fold-to-bring-foldables-mainstream-finally">speculations indicated</a> an affordable Galaxy Z Fold 6 may also be in the works, which is also expected to be a toned version of the Z Fold 6.</p><p>Meanwhile, another report from South Korea <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-stick-to-two-galaxy-foldables-as-before">indicated</a> that Samsung is sticking to the same two foldables this year, and the lack of differentiating factors is probably the primary reason to ditch its plans to bring an affordable Galaxy Z Fold 6. </p><p>On the contrary, per Young, there is likely a new one coming at least next year, which is encouraging to see as the foldable phone market is clearly on the rise and not the other way around, as more OEMs are expected to debut their first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, too.</p><p>Of course, we should take this with a grain of salt for now, but if Samsung is indeed planning to launch a Z Fold 6 Slim, the phone would probably have to be priced well below the incoming model, which would likely be its "differentiating factor."</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>For better or worse, Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">unleashed its search AI monster</a>. You&apos;ve probably seen it, you might have hated it, and you definitely have seen everyone complain about it. None of that matters — it&apos;s here to stay.</p><p>But it can&apos;t stay in its current form because it&apos;s too easy to break. That&apos;s the problem with AI; once it encounters something that requires a decision, it will make the wrong one as often as the right one. </p><p>So what can be done? Nothing easy, that&apos;s for sure. </p>
<p>Let&apos;s be realistic for a moment. It&apos;s fun to see everyone trying to break the AI and post the screenshots, but it&apos;s not that bad. As someone using it through the early closed beta and the Google Search Labs open beta, I can say you sort of get used to it and often ignore it.</p><p>It&apos;s easy to make Google say stupid things in the AI overview — just ask stupid questions. If you ask "normal" questions like "What&apos;s the weather?" or "Who signed the Manga Carta?" it spits out the right answer every time. If you want to know <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">which Android phone is best</a>, it will give you a summary of one of the most popular reviews.</p><p>In any case, swiping past it is easy enough, and we&apos;ve been doing it to get past the ads, so we&apos;re used to it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:145.63%;"><img id="8tzMcayFAV2KADX9Jp5zH5" name="google-io-2024-gen-ai-search-video-question-ai-overview.jpg" alt="With a video and a user's query, Search's AI will deliver an AI Overview with relevant answers and troubleshooting methods." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8tzMcayFAV2KADX9Jp5zH5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="412" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google will try to say it&apos;s not really an issue because of this, but that&apos;s not true; sometimes, you need an answer to a stupid question. When the AI comes across something it hasn&apos;t been well trained on, it has no idea what is fact versus fiction. The result is telling you to put glue on your pizza or another equally silly answer as a summary.</p>
<p>Those ridiculous ideas don&apos;t come out of thin air. Google has paid a lot of money to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/expanded-reddit-partnership/">scrape places like Reddit</a> for "knowledge," so its AI can try to have answers. If you&apos;ve been to Reddit, you know why this is a problem — Reddit is a cesspool of shitposting, where nonsense is given the same weight as sincere posts and replies.</p><p>If you ask Google a common question that it "understands," you&apos;ll get the right answer. When you ask about eating rocks, you get whatever some idiot at Reddit said about it. To be clear, I&apos;m not mad at the shitposters. I do my fair share of it. But Google AI doesn&apos;t understand the concept of shitposting and treats it as if it were serious. </p><p>This is a prime example of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai-writing-bots-are-like-1000-monkeys-with-1000-typewriters">how dumb AI really is</a>: garbage in, garbage out. We&apos;ve already taught Google Search how to shitpost, and it&apos;s only been out for a few weeks. Now Google has to teach it to stop doing it on company time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:107.13%;"><img id="cj2Nhi387j8P3ovzyjor9a" name="shitposting.png" alt="A social media screenshot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cj2Nhi387j8P3ovzyjor9a.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1157" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s easy to see for yourself. Ignore the cropped screenshots you see and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=african+country+that+starts+with+k&rlz=1C1UEAD_enUS1070US1070&oq=african+country+that&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgCEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBggBEEUYOTIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCDgwODhqMGo3qAIIsAIB&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">ask Google the same question</a>. After the AI summary, you&apos;ll find a link to the source material. Google isn&apos;t making these answers up and often quotes word for word from a page on the internet. When Google tells you Kenya doesn&apos;t exist, it&apos;s because someone at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37145312#:~:text=As%20of%20my%20last%20knowledge,with%20the%20letter%20%22K.%22">Hacker News</a> "taught" it that.</p><p>This is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/googles-ai-overviews-in-search-might-kill-publishing-and-its-going-to-backfire-eventually">real issue for Internet publishers, too</a>. Some inside baseball: specialists work to try and game the system so Google&apos;s search algorithm finds their content and ranks it on the first page of search results. This is an entire industry, and the new AI snippets will disrupt it because the content will not be scraped or weighted the same way. Web publishers said the old text snippets would be doomsday for the same reasons, but it wasn&apos;t.</p><p>Now, SEO specialists will have to try to make sure the first paragraph of any webpage gets picked up by the AI. They&apos;ll figure it out, and instead of nonsense posts from Reddit, the summary will be from some SEO factory blog trying to sell you cheap crap that "everyone in your area can&apos;t live without." </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">how is Google so god damn shitty at its job pic.twitter.com/bdx97oZNv6<a href="https://twitter.com/edzitron/status/1793751541394145771">May 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>So yeah, there&apos;s a lot wrong with AI search for both Google and web publishers. It&apos;s not easy to fix, either, but Google says it&apos;s taking in the feedback. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/24/google-ai-overviews-vast-majority-swift-action/">statement to 9to5Google</a>, a company spokesperson claims that the "vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information," while providing you links to dig deeper yourself in case you don&apos;t trust the AI to do it for you. They also noted that some of the examples circulating the web have been "doctored" or couldn&apos;t be reproduced by employees at the company.</p><p>"We conducted extensive testing before launching this new experience, and as with other features we&apos;ve launched in Search, we appreciate the feedback," the spokesperson told 9to5Google. "We&apos;re taking swift action where appropriate under our content policies, and using these examples to develop broader improvements to our systems, some of which have already started to roll out."</p><p>Of course, the perfect solution is for Google to recognize expertise from typical internet garbage and properly filter out the nonsense to give you the answer. No matter how smart someone claims to be, a computer can&apos;t do that.</p><p>Google doesn&apos;t want to use living, breathing humans to sort through all this either because that would require an army of workers that Google doesn&apos;t want to pay for and be a logistical nightmare. In the end, Google created this mess and now has to spend some of those precious billions of dollars to work out the solution. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/googl/market-cap/">Sundar and the company can afford it</a>.</p><p>In turn, web publishers will need to stop relying on ways to game the system through SEO and write good, accurate content from experts hoping that Google picks it up once it "learns" the difference. That&apos;s good for us, so it can&apos;t come soon enough.</p><p>In the meantime, you just have to scroll on past it.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Messages users are reportedly getting random gibberish texts that contain strings of characters and seem to show up as encrypted content.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> provides default end-to-end encryption, ensuring only the intended recipient can read the messages. However, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/s7drbq/received_an_encrypted_text_message/?sort=new" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-messages-spam-encrypted-rcs-messages/" target="_blank">Android Police</a> shows that people are receiving RCS messages that look like spam.</p><p>These messages mostly look like gibberish, with random letters and numbers in no particular order. They likely appear this way because they couldn&apos;t be properly encrypted.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:337px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.55%;"><img id="uzFZ9aWKogWVg8qZSm4tFf" name="google-messages-encrypted-text.jpg" alt="gibberish text on Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uzFZ9aWKogWVg8qZSm4tFf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="337" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Police)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The original post in the thread is from two years ago, but it&apos;s recently gained a lot of new replies. According to these recent responses, many users are getting messages from outside their area code. That said, our own Derrek Lee confirms he received a similar gibberish message, but it came from within his own area code.</p><p>All the messages include the same legitimate link to Google’s support page on troubleshooting issues with decrypting encrypted messages.</p><p>For those who might not know, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-rcs-chat-features-google-messages">Google Messages uses Rich Communication Services</a> (RCS). It&apos;s a safer texting method than SMS and MMS. Plus, RCS offers end-to-end encryption for extra privacy.</p><p>Something seems to have gone wrong because users are now getting spam-like messages. To clear things up, there&apos;s a difference between the original issue in that thread and what&apos;s happening now. The original post was about a user who got a message from a contact that couldn&apos;t be decrypted. When the contact resent it, everything worked fine.</p><p>This time, the messages are coming from unknown senders, and it doesn&apos;t seem to be an isolated case. The texts are arriving from various countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, Cameroon, Tanzania, and more, according to the report.</p><p>At the moment, there&apos;s not much information on where these posts are coming from, but Android Police believes it might be a rogue spambot. The outlet says this spambot is trying to find and collect active numbers through read receipts, and the gibberish messages we&apos;re seeing might be a glitch.</p>
