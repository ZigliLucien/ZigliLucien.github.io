                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>After Unpacked, Samsung detailed how it plans to improve its customer Care service by partnering with AT&T's Call Center agents.</li><li>AT&T customers can rely on its Call Center to find information and schedule (in-warranty) walk-in repair services for a Galaxy phone.</li><li>Additionally, Samsung's experts can benefit from a new AI feature, which will deliver all the information about a user's call and provide accurate help.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A few upgrades to Samsung&apos;s Customer Care network for Galaxy owners follow quickly behind its latest wave of foldable devices.</p><p>In a press release, the company states Galaxy users can now call upon AT&T&apos;s Call Center agents for help regarding (in-warranty) walk-in phone repair services. The post adds that these services can be done at any one of its 700 Samsung retail or uBreakiFix by Asurion locations across the United States.</p><p>While this newfound phone repair service applies to AT&T customers, Samsung says the quickness of this method often leads to same-day opportunities. Moreover, the Korean OEM&apos;s work with AT&T adds Same Unit Repair (SUR) options to the network&apos;s customers.</p><p>In a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-expands-next-generation-care-att-introduces-new-ai-powered-tools/">blog post</a>, Samsung stated it&apos;s committed to getting a person&apos;s sensitive device back into their hands quickly. Through SUR, repair services will work to get a user&apos;s device fixed to "factory quality condition" and return it without needing a "comparable new or refurbished unit."</p><p>Not only does <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.att.com/story/2024/samsung-unpacked.html">SUR&apos;s availability</a> help cut back on e-waste, but Samsung states users won&apos;t have to worry about backing up data or transfers.</p><p>The other side of this update is Samsung&apos;s AI tools to help its experts handle and resolve your problem. This "next-gen Care" is strengthened by the new Interactive Voice Response (IVR) to help agents understand a user&apos;s reason for calling (intent). The software helps agents identify a customer&apos;s device and the problem to then direct them to the appropriate areas for help.</p><p>The AI can text a user located near them for walk-in service or an authorized repair center using their zip code. IVR also serves as a text-based alternative for customers interested in receiving status updates about a repair ticket&apos;s status.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="3SV5r9aZAmw7eKHxaaesGK" name="samsung-care-ubreakifix-asurion-flagship-stores-featured.png" alt="Samsung and uBreakiFix partnership for device repair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3SV5r9aZAmw7eKHxaaesGK.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="533" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung reiterates the benefits of walk-in repair, such as the ability for customers to seek help if they have a Galaxy S21 device or newer. More importantly, your device can be fixed and returned to you if you&apos;ve scheduled an appointment at 3 PM or sooner.</p><p>Additionally, users can experience "personalized" consultation regarding the repair of their phone.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-ubreakifix-expand-repair-options">Following its expansion</a>, Samsung has continued to push its efforts to bring convenient and easy device repair through uBreakiFix. Last August, both companies upgraded their partnership by adding more repair options to customers. At the same time, the companies started working on opening 50 new repair shops across the U.S. by the end of 2023. That was the start of quicker repairs and same-day service, as Samsung noted at the time.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Head of Mobile Business, TM Roh discussed with reporters following Unpacked the company's plans and estimates for foldable sales in 2024.</li><li>There are hopes that the Flip 6 and Fold 6's advancements in AI and other aspects can boost its sales by 10% over the 2023 series.</li><li>The Flip 5 and Fold 5 shattered pre-order records for Samsung in South Korea, as the brand achieved 1.02 million pre-orders.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Following Samsung&apos;s Unpacked, the company started discussing its hopes for its latest foldables, which involves increasing its sales.</p><p>The company&apos;s Head of Mobile, TM (Tae-moon) Roh, spoke with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240711002000320?">Yonhap News</a> and reporters following the event to discuss sales figures (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_wants_galaxy_z_fold6_and_flip6_to_deliver_10_better_sales_than_their_predecessors-news-63685.php">GSMArena</a>). Roh informed the press that the company aims "to sell 10 percent more of new products compared with the previous model released last year."</p><p>He added, "This time, we&apos;ve introduced products that are more complete and immaculate in every aspect, such as the camera and battery." These aspects may facilitate the "better results" Samsung expects from its 2024 foldable devices.</p><p>Roh then discussed the "user-friendly" features provided through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-boast-ai-upgrades-and-thinner-bodies">Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6</a> thanks to Qualcomm. Both devices feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> for Galaxy SoC in all regions. When the SD 8 Gen 3 debuted, the headliner was its strong focus on boosting the on-device AI capabilities of future flagship devices. The chip then provided boosts to a phone&apos;s CPU and GPU processes.</p><p>Samsung states the chip helps its foldable phones by "optimizing" its AI features and "enhancing" other basic functions.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how well Samsung&apos;s 2024 foldables perform, however, the Flip 5 and Fold 5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-preorders-break-records-south-korea">shattered pre-order records</a> last year. The numbers stemmed from South Korea, where the company amassed a whopping 1.02 million foldable preorders. Among them, the Flip 5 took the crown with 70% of the cut.</p><p>Those sales broke Samsung&apos;s previous highest tallied count of 970,000 pre-order sales for its Galaxy foldable phones on home soil. With Roh estimating (and hoping) for a 10% growth in sales back by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, it&apos;s going to be interesting to see where consumer interest falls.</p><p>However, it&apos;s worth noting that Samsung&apos;s showing of the Fold 6 wasn&apos;t that impressive, leaving some to ponder <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-new-galaxy-z-fold-6">if the upgrade is worth it</a>. Aside from its AI focus, there was little by way of innovation from the Korean OEM&apos;s folding devices. Let&apos;s also not forget that the devices came at an extra cost — roughly $100.</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re not far from Google&apos;s official Pixel 9 series debut, but a recent European rumor claims to have its pricing nailed.</p><p>Information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/google-pixel-9-9-pro-9-pro-xl-et-9-pro-fold-on-vous-devoile-les-prix-francais-et-les-configurations-des-nouveaux-smartphones-55115">Dealabs</a> (French) suggests Google&apos;s upcoming flagship phone series could give consumers a steep pricing hill to climb (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_9_pixel_9_pro_pixel_9_pro_xl_and_pixel_9_pro_fold_prices_leak-news-63684.php">GSMArena</a>). The base Pixel 9 model will reportedly arrive in two internal storage sizes: 128GB and 256GB for 899 euros (~$980) and 999 euros (~$1,089), respectively.</p><p>The publication noted that these alleged prices are slightly higher than Google&apos;s Pixel 8. Even the Pixel 9 Pro could see a price hike as it&apos;s rumored to debut in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB options. Rumored prices for each size are 1,099 euros (~$1,198), 1,199 euros (~$1,307), and 1,329 euros (~$1,449).</p><p>Rumors regarding the other two additions to the Pixel 9 series, the "Pixel 9 Pro XL" and the "Pixel 9 Pro Fold" are<strong> </strong>as follows:</p>

<p>While the publication claims these prices could be the "standard" across Europe, U.S. consumers shouldn&apos;t take them literally — not yet. These prices aren&apos;t a one-to-one conversion between regions, and Google will likely adjust them accordingly.</p><p>Colors were also an object of discussion, with the rumor that the Basel could see Obsidian, Porcelain, Cosmo, and a Mojito (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-summer-vibe-colors-leak" target="_blank">like the Bud&apos;s rumor</a>). The 9 Pro could see Obsidian, Porcelain, Hazel, and Pink for its 128GB and 256GB variants while the 512GB could grab Obsidian and Hazel.</p><p>The recently rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hits-geekbench">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> might see Obsidian, Hazel, and Porcelain for its 128GB and 512GB variants. The 1TB might only grab Obsidian, while the middle size sees the addition of pink. Lastly, the Fold successor may only grab two options: Obsidian and Porcelain.</p><p>Google is seemingly preparing for an interesting expansion of its flagship phone line as, in May, the entire series leaked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/entire-pixel-9-series-live-photos-specs-leak">in a set of live photos</a>. The base model may sport a 6.2-inch display, while the Pro offers a 6.3-inch display and a 6.7-inch screen for the 9 XL. Another notable design choice is that the device will reportedly switch between matte and glossy finishes on the back panel.</p><p>Moreover, the recent string of alleged colorways doubles down on what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-leaked-colorways-wallpaper-theme">we&apos;ve heard previously</a>. It seems that what was formerly known as "Rose" has turned into "pink" here in July. There&apos;s not much wait time ahead of us as Google started emailing users about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">an earlier hardware event</a>, set for August 13.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google will discontinue official support for Android Lollipop OS, which debuted with Nexus 6.</li><li>Also known as Android 5.0, it was widely popular for introducing Material You to Android devices.</li><li>The said OS will no longer receive Google Play Updates, citing that less than one percent of active devices are running it.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you are one of the first owners of a Nexus 6 device, you were likely introduced to Android Lollipop for the first time, and it was surprisingly ten years ago. Google first introduced it in November 2014, and now, the official support is finally ending.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/11/android-lollipop-google-play-services/">9to5Google</a> points out, Google is discontinuing the Google Play Services updates to Android Lollipop devices starting this month. Per Google Spokesperson&apos;s statement to the publication, the reason for putting a nail in the coffin is the percentage of active Android Lollipop devices, which is said to be accounting for less than one percent at the moment. This has been a tradition followed by Google for its past versions of Android.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ThtF8h9HrZficLDkhMHDn" name="google-pixel-6-review-material-you-tinted-icon-gaps.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 Material You Tinted Icon Gaps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ThtF8h9HrZficLDkhMHDn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, the previous iteration of Lollipop, Android KitKat, released 11 years ago, also had less than one percent active devices last July. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/google-play-services-discontinuing-updates-for-kitkat.html">chose to stop</a> the release of Google Play Services. This year appears no different, as more and more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are looking forward to the Android 15 update, which is likely happening after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">Made by Google event</a> on August 13.</p><p>Those wondering if the Android Lollipop devices are losing Google Play Services support will continue to work. Yes, they will; it is just that users won&apos;t be receiving "any new features, important security updates, and may not be compatible with some apps."</p>
<p>The latter&apos;s been the case with most sensitive apps already, like banking apps and popular social media apps, as they only support the previous three or four iterations of Android versions.</p><p>Nonetheless, Android Lollipop, aka Android 5.0, has been special for Google as it introduced Material You for the first time in 2014 to its popular Nexus devices—followed by a nifty update dubbed Android 5.1 the following year.</p><p>As 9to5 notes, dropping official support only means Google will prioritize the latest devices and upcoming operating systems, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. With Lollipop out of the race, Marshmallow handsets will likely be next in the line.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 Olympic Edition happens to be the first smartphone utilizing the Galaxy AI prowess. The previous Olympic Edition was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review">Galaxy S21</a>, which Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-2020-tokyo-olympics-athlete-gift-bag">provided</a> at the 2020 Olympics and Paralympic Games held in Tokyo in 2020. </p><p>As players come from all over the world to participate in the Olympic Games, they can take advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>-backed features like Live translation of calls, Interpreter mode, and Composer mode to take calls, communicate, and send emails at the event. Similarly, the Instant Slow-mo feature can be widely used by players aided by the Photo Assist feature to capture athletes&apos; participation in various games. </p><p>Together, Samsung and Orange are providing an eSIM with 1000GB of 5G data with each special edition of the Galaxy Z Flip 6. The clamshell phone also gets two years of Samsung&apos;s international warranty. Users can also take advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/what-is-samsung-digital-wallet">Samsung Wallet</a>, which comes pre-loaded with an in-app pass for vending machines and an unlimited complimentary public transport access card.</p>
<p>"Additionally, to keep track of the latest Games-time schedules and travel around the Olympic venues with ease, several official International Olympic Committee (IOC) apps such as Athlete 365, Olympic Shop, Paris 2024, Transport Accred App, and IOC hotline will be pre-loaded. "</p><p>Lastly, Galaxy Z Flip 6 Olympic Edition owners can utilize Paris-2024-themed apps such as PinQuest and Galaxy Experience to collect and exchange real and digital pins during the Games.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve tried giving up on smartwatches, honestly. It gets annoying when you have to remember to charge something other than a phone all of the time. But there are a few reasons why I cycle between the Apple Watch Ultra, the Galaxy Watch, and others, and Samsung just gave me another great reason to stick with wearing them with its latest smartwatches.</p><p>I&apos;ll start by saying that I&apos;m a sucker for keeping track of my sleep, as I can look at how long I was asleep and have a pretty idea of how the day is going to go. Instead of wondering why I feel like crap, I already know it&apos;d probably be due to the 3.5 hours of sleep that I&apos;m averaging.  </p><p>However, there&apos;s another potential reason, and it&apos;s one that I&apos;ve been avoiding for years — sleep apnea. For reasons that will become clear momentarily, I never thought that any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> would be capable of detecting sleep apnea.</p><p>In most instances, if you think you suffer from sleep apnea, you talk to your doctor and then perform a sleep study. However, introducing such a feature with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on" target="_blank">Watch Ultra</a> will hopefully remove some guesswork. Instead of going to your doctor and just telling them that you&apos;re tired, you can <em>hopefully</em> use the data from your smartwatch to provide some support to your theory.</p>

<p>It&apos;s the introduction of this functionality that has me actually intrigued about picking up one of these. Over the years, I just assumed that I was put on this planet for the purpose of being exhausted. It wasn&apos;t until I began dating my now-wife that I realized something else might be going on. </p><p>There were several times when she would wake me up in the middle of the night, seemingly for no reason. As it turns out, she was doing it for a good reason: she would wake up in the middle of the night, and it would sound like I wasn&apos;t breathing. </p><p>Things got a little better after I lost about 50 pounds, but according to my wife, it still happens on occasion. The difference now is that if I&apos;m being woken up in the middle of the night, it&apos;s because something might be wrong with our five-month-old son.</p>

<p>If I turn off the "tech enthusiast" part of my brain and think about the potential health benefits and not just because it&apos;s something "new and shiny," a new Galaxy Watch might be in the cards. The only reason why I haven&apos;t pre-ordered one for myself just yet is because the feature is apparently coming to the Galaxy Watch 6.</p><p>When pairing my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a> running the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/first-one-ui-6-watch-beta-hits-us-galaxy-watches">One UI Watch 6 beta</a> with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, it appeared in the "new features" section. However, I have yet to be able to find any mention of it since, so I&apos;m not entirely convinced that it&apos;s going to work. At this point, I&apos;ll probably re-evaluate whether I&apos;ll upgrade or just stick with what I&apos;ve got.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gy2WHbiMy3wRLnjTiLVHBZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-health-sensors-illuminated.jpg" alt="The new Bioactive health sensor on the Galaxy Watch Ultra being illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gy2WHbiMy3wRLnjTiLVHBZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is another reason that could drive me to upgrade anyway, and it&apos;s <em>partially</em> because of the "new and shiny" factor. With the Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra, Samsung introduced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">new and enhanced BioActive sensor</a>. Samsung claims this will offer "more precise readings," thanks to the new array of LEDs paired with an "increased number of green, red, and infrared LEDs."</p><p>On paper, this should result in more accurate and reliable tracking, which should make the Watch 7 a better health accessory than its predecessor. </p>
<h2 id="use-your-noggin-2">Use your noggin</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tB2c39Gh7RymoX9CU9kKo" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-ecg.jpg" alt="ECG on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tB2c39Gh7RymoX9CU9kKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s important for me to note that I called the Watch 7 a health "accessory" and didn&apos;t use a different adjective. You&apos;ll have to dig back into the Android Central archives a bit, but our own Jerry Hildenbrand wrote about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/when-it-comes-to-your-health-dont-place-too-much-trust-in-your-smartwatch">something similar</a>. </p><p>Besides being a fantastic article, Jerry rightly points out that all of these various wearable devices can&apos;t replace actual equipment. I mean that in the sense of the equipment found in your doctor&apos;s office, it is not something you can pick up from Amazon or Best Buy. </p><p>The technology in our devices continues to evolve regularly, even in ways that you might not have known about. Wearable devices are even more prone to dramatic improvements, as there are regulatory hurdles to clear before a company can tell you that a smartwatch keeps track of your heart rate.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>As Jerry says, "If you think something isn't right, go see the doctor and make sure. You can still enjoy your smartwatch even if it's not the caretaker of everything the company that sells it told you it was."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>However, these are also mass-produced on a completely different scale compared to health equipment. Companies need to make as many wearables as they can based on projected sales figures and available components. This is not a bad thing, but it&apos;s just something to keep in the back of your mind if you want to let a smartwatch tell you that everything&apos;s okay when it&apos;s actually the opposite. </p>

<p>Even with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">surprising FDA approval</a>, Samsung&apos;s smartwatch can&apos;t tell you with any degree of certainty that you do, or don&apos;t, have sleep apnea. What it does do is nudge you in the right direction, suggesting that you reach out to your doctor or another healthcare professional. </p><p>I know that this probably sounds like I&apos;m doing a lot of mental gymnastics to justify buying the "latest and greatest." However, that&apos;s not actually the case this time around, as the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra offer legitimate health benefits that aren&apos;t found elsewhere. </p>

Although the Galaxy Z Fold line was once considered the best, that&apos;s no longer the case as the competition continues to impress. Leaving us wondering what could be in store for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. </p><p>Part of this is evidenced by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, which saw very little in the way of any meaningful upgrades. Even still, one could argue that Samsung stands above the rest in terms of the software experience you&apos;ll find on the Fold. </p><p>With that being said, there are a few things that we hope to see Samsung change with its next flagship foldable phone. </p>
<h2 id="we-apos-re-long-overdue-for-better-cameras-2">We&apos;re long overdue for better cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Nkmhx4yX3wXqVzeKdqNx7n" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-4-camera-viewfinder-01.jpg" alt="Looking through the camera viewfinder on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nkmhx4yX3wXqVzeKdqNx7n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s 2024, and Samsung&apos;s most expensive phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, largely relies on the same camera system found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Fold 4</a> from 2022. The only difference that the Fold 6 offers over its last two predecessors is an upgraded ultrawide camera. This sensor retains the same 12MP resolution, but Samsung claims it offers better low-light quality and can record video in 4K at 60fps. </p><p>Meanwhile, the 50MP main wide-angle lens and 10MP telephoto camera remain unchanged. It&apos;s particularly disheartening when you see what Samsung&apos;s cameras are capable of, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. Tack on the exorbitant price tag, and it makes little sense for Samsung to continue using the same camera array.</p><p>We can only assume the reason why substantial changes have yet to arrive is due to the size of the sensors that Samsung relies on. There&apos;s only a finite amount of space beneath the frame of the phone, which also has to account for the multiple layers being used for the inner display. Which leads quite nicely into our next wishlist item. </p>
<h2 id="get-on-moto-apos-s-level-2">Get on Moto&apos;s level</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mc9H6pcxQdLgW4mCZYcbDg" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-03.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 main display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mc9H6pcxQdLgW4mCZYcbDg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It feels as though Samsung is paying closer attention to its Flip lineup than the Fold. One reason for this train of thought is due to the less noticeable crease. However, both devices still fall short of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus</a>, as those display creases are barely even noticeable. </p><p>For someone with experience using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, my brain has practically removed the crease the majority of the time. There is an exception to this, as the Galaxy Z Fold&apos;s crease rears its ugly head whenever I jot down some notes with the S Pen. </p><p>Although it&apos;s been almost three years since Samsung added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">S Pen support</a>, there&apos;s still a feeling of unease when dragging the stylus across the middle of the screen. Plus, the crease always ends up getting in the way, ultimately resulting in using the S Pen less.</p>

The company is arguably the worst offender, and while the Z Fold 6 is a bit better than the Fold 5, it&apos;s still nowhere near usable for those affected by PWM.</p><p>Making matters worse is that Samsung won&apos;t even talk about its display dimming, potentially providing some type of explanation. Meanwhile, other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-interesting-display-tricks">companies like Honor</a> have started using PWM flicker rates as selling points. It&apos;s just a shame when you consider that Samsung does make some of the best-looking displays. </p>

<p>Perhaps one of the reasons why Samsung seems to be focusing more on the Galaxy Z Flip line is simply because of higher sales numbers. Although Huawei overtook Samsung in terms of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/global-foldable-smartphone-market-q1-2024/">Global Foldable Smartphone Shipments</a>" in Q1 2024, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 is largely keeping Samsung from dropping lower.</p><p>There&apos;s a good chance of this being attributed to the more attractive price tag, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-how-it-started-how-its-going">Flip 5</a> retailed for $999, compared to the $1,799 of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-how-it-started-how-its-going">Fold 5</a>. Even with a price increase of $100 for both the Flip 6 and Fold 6, we&apos;re still expecting the Flip 6 to vastly outsell the Fold 6. </p><p>It&apos;s a bit of a contradiction, given the price hike of this year&apos;s Galaxy foldable phones, but perhaps it&apos;s time to see what a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-fe-may-drop-this-key-feature-to-bring-the-price-down">Galaxy Z Fold FE</a> lineup would look like. Samsung could even just rebrand the Z Fold 6 as the Z Fold 7 FE, knock a decent chunk off the price, and it could just be enough to entice people away from slab phones.</p><p>It could be something that Samsung is already considering. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cheaper-galaxy-z-fold-6-codename-potentially-discovered">January 2024</a>, a third Samsung foldable phone appeared in databases, codenamed "Q6A." The Galaxy Z Fold 6 that was just released featured a codename of "Q6," leading to speculation of the potential of an A-series Galaxy Z Fold. Unfortunately, Galaxy Unpacked came and went with no sign or mention of such a device.</p>

<p>More than a year and a half after its introduction, we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-dropped-the-ball-qi2-galaxy-s24">still have yet to see Qi2</a> implemented in Android devices. There was hope this would change with the Galaxy S24 series, to no avail. Six months later, Samsung&apos;s flagship foldables are still sporting the old Qi standard. </p><p>While Qi2 accessories aren&apos;t as plentiful, Apple already beat Samsung to the punch with the iPhone 15 series. We really aren&apos;t sure what the potential hold-up is with the lack of Qi2 adoption. However, we&apos;re also hopeful that will change with Android released towards the end of 2024 and into 2025. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Wireless power sharing, known as PowerShare, used to be a handy feature on Samsung smartwatches for quick charges.</li><li>However, Samsung removed this feature in its latest Galaxy Watch lineup due to a new sensor design, which increased the distance between the internal charging coil and the charging surface.</li><li>The Galaxy Watch 7 series makes up for it with improved health monitoring, thanks to the new BioActive sensor array that tracks Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs).</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like Samsung has different priorities now. The South Korean tech giant&apos;s newest Galaxy Watch series has dropped wireless charging from compatible smartphones.</p><p>In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ae/support/mobile-devices/about-the-galaxy-watch7-series-wireless-charging-and-wireless-power-sharing-features/" target="_blank">support page</a> update, Samsung admitted a shift from its previous Galaxy Watch models. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Watch 7 Ultra</a> do not support wireless charging from a paired Galaxy phone. X user Jordy Verboven was the first to notice this omission (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-say-goodbye-to-wireless-powershare/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So... the #GalaxyWatch7 no longer supports wireless powershare https://t.co/RhOom0aorm<a href="https://twitter.com/JordyV27/status/1811338879900770361">July 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>For the uninitiated, some smartphones have a feature called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-wireless-power-share-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">wireless power sharing</a> that lets the phone&apos;s battery wirelessly charge compatible smartwatches just by placing them close together.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s version of this is called PowerShare, and it has been available on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">beloved Samsung smartwatches</a>, except for the latest models. While not a common feature, it was super handy for a quick charge when you needed it.</p><p>According to the support page, Samsung had to remove this feature due to a design change. The new sensor array required reshaping the rear glass on both Watch models. This change increased the distance between the internal wireless charging coil and the external charging surface, making the previous wireless power-sharing capability impossible.</p><p>Even without wireless power sharing, the Galaxy Watch 7 is a big leap in health monitoring. The new BioActive sensor array is more accurate and provides more detailed health metrics than before, as per Samsung. Notably, it can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">track Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)</a>, giving users valuable insights into their metabolic health.</p><p>Previous Galaxy Watch models consistently featured wireless charging via Samsung&apos;s PowerShare technology. Therefore, the noticeable absence of this feature in the Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra comes as a bit of a surprise.</p><p>The new sensor design also means you have to use the charger that ships with the Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra for the best results. Using older Galaxy Watch chargers can slow down charging and make the device overheat. So, Samsung suggests sticking with the included charger.</p>

<p>From the U.S. listing, we know that the size 10 smart ring will have an 18.5mAh battery, and the size 12 model has a 20.5mAh one. Both take approximately two hours to charge fully, and the ring is said to last for about four days. It also comes with a charger and an out-of-the-box instruction manual.</p><p>While most details seem to have been listed, the price remained missing. We assume that since the ring costs around $299.99 in the U.S., it will come at a similar price range for the Indian market as well, which could be around 25,000 INR.</p><p>When we checked on our end, the listing was taken down and didn&apos;t show up on Amazon&apos;s India site. However, according to another website, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/amazfit-helio-ring-india-launch-prime-day-report/">91Mobiles</a>, the smart ring will likely be launched during the massive Prime Days sale that is set to occur this month in India, likely on July 20.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="which-nas-should-i-buy-xa0-2">Which NAS should I buy? </h2>
<p>The first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you&apos;re going to need. That sets the basis for whether you should get a two-bay, four-bay, or a larger NAS server.</p><p>Synology is the largest manufacturer of NAS servers, and it sells dozens of products across various categories. Synology is known for its high-quality offerings, and its products are built to last. But the defining feature of Synology&apos;s NAS models is the software, with the web-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/synology-diskstation-manager-70">DiskStation Manager</a> setting the standard for this category.</p><p>If this is the first NAS you&apos;re buying and you don&apos;t want to invest a lot of money into a server, the Synology DiskStation DS223j is our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-nas">best cheap NAS</a>. You&apos;re still getting all the best software features that Synology has to offer, and while you don&apos;t get as many drive bays as some devices, it is a great choice for those making their foray into this segment. If you don&apos;t mind spending a little extra cash, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds723-review">Synology DiskStation DS723+</a> is a great choice for most users. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-choose-a-hard-drive-for-my-nas-xa0-2">How do I choose a hard drive for my NAS? </h2>
<p>Choosing the right hard drive for your NAS is just as vital as selecting the right enclosure. Because NAS enclosures are designed to run 24/7, there are NAS-focused hard drives available in the market. These models feature vibration resistance and are designed to handle the stresses of a 24/7 environment, and differ from your regular hard drives.</p><p>Another factor to consider when choosing a NAS hard drive is the speed. HDDs are usually available in either 5400rpm or 7200rpm, and the latter delivers better performance because the spindle moves at 7,200 rounds per minute. I&apos;ve used 5400rpm drives in NAS enclosures tailored for media streaming for years without any issues, but if you&apos;re building a more enthusiast-focused NAS and are looking for better performance, pick a model with a 7200rpm. </p><p>There are several NAS-focused hard drive product lines, with WD Red Plus and Seagate IronWolf dominating the sales charts. With drives starting out at 1TB and going all the way to 20TB, there&apos;s no shortage of options available across either product line. </p>
<h2 id="when-is-prime-day-2">When is Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Amazon&apos;s biggest sale of the year, the 10th annual Prime Day shopping event is scheduled to begin on July 16th and run through the 17th. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-during-prime-day-2">Do I have to be a Prime member to shop during Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Yep, the vast majority of Prime Day deals will only be available to Prime subscribers. If you&apos;re interested in shopping during the sale and you aren&apos;t a member just yet, we recommend taking advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon&apos;s 30-day free trial</strong></a> so you can explore the benefits of Prime Day without paying a cent. Alternatively, you could just wait and see if Amazon&apos;s biggest competitors will launch rival sales that don&apos;t require a membership. </p>
