<hr>
<p>Google is making Gemini Nano more accessible, a game-changing AI model built to run directly on devices, cutting out the need for an internet connection.</p><p>Before this expansion, Gemini Nano was only available for Google’s own apps. Originally launched on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> in December 2023, it later became available on Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series.</p><p>However, this exclusivity didn’t last long, as Google has recently extended access to Xiaomi devices, signaling a major step towards wider adoption.</p><p>Alongside its own apps, Google granted a select group of external partners early access to the on-device AI model, though their contributions are yet to be revealed.</p><p>Google has now made a significant move toward the broader adoption of Gemini Nano by allowing Android developers to experiment with the model through the AI Edge SDK via AICore on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series, as detailed in a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/10/gemini-nano-experimental-access-available-on-android.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>Currently, Google is allowing developers to experiment exclusively with text-to-text prompts. This opens up opportunities for exploring applications like rephrasing, smart replies, proofreading, and summarization within the Gemini Nano framework.</p><p>Future updates for Gemini Nano are expected to introduce support for various modalities, including images, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">expand compatibility to a broader range of devices</a>. Mishaal Rahman, writing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/what-phones-support-gemini-nano/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>, has pointed out potential candidates for this compatibility, including the Xiaomi 14T, devices from Motorola and Realme, as existing Nano-compatible devices from Samsung.</p><p>Although this experimental access allows developers to explore Gemini Nano, it’s important to note that it is strictly for development purposes and not meant for production environments. Developers can access Android AICore (Beta) by joining the AICore system through the Play Store.</p><p>This broader compatibility will enable developers to integrate Nano into their third-party apps, giving them a major AI boost. This could lead to a whole new wave of AI-powered apps hitting the Play Store.</p>

<hr>
<p>Disney has been priming users worldwide for a password-sharing crackdown on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a> streaming service, and that is now officially underway. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/paid-sharing-disney-explainer/" target="_blank">blog post</a> last week, the company outlined its plans to entice account sharers to pay their own way for the service. Part of that effort includes making it clear that, like Netflix, Disney Plus is only intended to work within one household.</p><p>"Your Disney+ subscription is meant to be used within your Household, which is a collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside there," Disney says in the post. </p><p>People outside your household "will need to sign up and pay for their own subscription or be added as an Extra Member to your account for an additional monthly fee to continue enjoying Disney+." </p><p>Many of the policies Disney is now rolling out were piloted in select markets around the world this summer. They&apos;re intended to increase Disney&apos;s streaming revenue, either by forcing password sharers into buying their own plan or pushing account owners to add a paid extra member. Disney&apos;s streaming arm lost money for years, but was profitable for the first time during Q3 2024, when an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2024/08/q3-fy24-earnings.pdf" target="_blank">earnings report</a> revealed that the company generated $47 million in revenue across Disney Plus, Hulu, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-watch-espn-plus-tv-phone-roku-online">ESPN Plus</a>. </p><p>Disney looks to keep that momentum going with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-paid-sharing-enforced-us-launch">the new Extra Member plans</a>, which are available for the Disney Plus Basic and Premium tiers. Subscribers can add a person outside of their household to their plan for an extra $6.99 for Basic plans or $9.99 for Premium plans. At the moment, you can only add one extra member to a plan, and extra members aren&apos;t supported for the bundle that includes Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus. </p><p>The options are widely rolling out for subscribers in the U.S., Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. If users don&apos;t want to add an extra member, they can port a user profile to a new Disney Plus account, as long as it&apos;s not a minor account or a Junior mode account. </p><p>Luckily, there are options for when you&apos;re traveling or relocating. If you get a warning that Disney Plus detects you&apos;re away from your household, you can tap "I&apos;m away from home" or "Update household" to keep watching. This will send a one-time password to the account owner&apos;s email for verification. It&apos;s unclear if any long-term restrictions will be put in place to prevent password sharing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a>, like Netflix&apos;s requirements, which make you connect to a home Wi-Fi network every month. </p>
<h2 id="how-the-new-password-sharing-policies-hurt-families-2">How the new password-sharing policies hurt families</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="XRSDcCBmjPYZU23zJH2oqP" name="Disney-Plus-Hulu-hero.jpg" alt="Disney Plus and Hulu icons side by side on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XRSDcCBmjPYZU23zJH2oqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Disney and Netflix&apos;s actions in the password-sharing crackdown represent a departure from how the services industry has typically treated family plans. Most subscription services, like Apple iCloud Plus or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one" target="_blank">Google One Premium</a>, give you a set number of accounts you can share purchases or benefits with. Steam Families, which lets you share games and media purchased on Steam, works the same way. </p><p>Apple, Google, and Valve let you share content with a set number of accounts, no matter where they&apos;re located. Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">streaming services</a> are throwing this conventional notion of family sharing out the window. Disney and Netflix call their plans for the "household," but they&apos;re really for the property or residence. Families and households take a variety of forms, and members aren&apos;t always living in the same location.</p><p>Netflix and Disney don&apos;t care about that. In fact, they would prefer if multiple family members had to pay for their services. They&apos;ve neared the peak of their revenue streams and want more. If most families already have a Netflix or Disney Plus subscription, how do these companies continue to grow? The answer is: try to break those families up. </p><p>Take me, for example. I live in Arizona, and the rest of my family lives on the U.S. east coast. Most of my family lives together most of the time, but some of my siblings are in college. I was in school not too long ago. It seems crazy for myself (especially when I was still a full-time student), my siblings, and my parents to all have separate subscriptions. This is just my immediate family I&apos;m talking about. </p><p>But that&apos;s exactly what Disney and Netflix want. As a consumer, my first response to these policies is simple: who are Disney and Netflix to tell me where and how I can use the subscription I&apos;m paying for? Especially when prices continue to go up year after year.</p><p>It&apos;s pushing me, and many others, to ditch streamers altogether. I&apos;m only subscribed to one streaming service, Paramount Plus. I love it, but I&apos;ve been completely disenfranchised by the others. In a way, Disney and Netflix&apos;s crackdowns have worked; I don&apos;t share accounts for their services anymore, but now I don&apos;t use them at all.  </p>
<h2 id="these-moves-only-do-one-thing-push-people-toward-piracy-again-2">These moves only do one thing: push people toward piracy again</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="fikXNA3gkgeZeuyAz359XW" name="netflix-spotify-curb-piracy-hero.jpg" alt="Netflix TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fikXNA3gkgeZeuyAz359XW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="532" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The elephant in the room here is piracy. Yes, piracy is illegal, and you really shouldn&apos;t do it. But piracy was rampant in the 1990s and early 2000s before digital music stores like iTunes started popping up. Sites like Napster were ubiquitous for sharing pirated content. The piracy seemed to stop when it was easy to buy media, either through individual online purchases or all-encompassing subscriptions. </p><p>When it&apos;s easy to pay for media legally, consumers have proven over decades that they&apos;ll certainly do it. However, the market has also learned the hard way that users will absolutely pirate content when companies and studios make it difficult to obtain licenses and stream content lawfully. </p><p>As we enter the late stage of the streaming wars, where account sharing is null, digital rights battles remove content from services on a monthly basis, and price hikes happen on a yearly basis, I&apos;m worried the media industry could be making things difficult enough that consumers resort to other ways of obtaining content. </p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 is expected to launch later this year, and while leaks have been surfacing online, the company has shown off what will likely be the phone&apos;s display.</p><p>OnePlus China head Li Jie Louis <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7582893032/OzfthEWo2?pagetype=profilefeed">has teased</a> a new BOE display, which is believed to be the company&apos;s BOE X2 screen. In his recent Weibo post (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/09/front-side-of-oneplus-13-possibly-shown-by-boe.html">Android Headlines</a>), the representative shared and image and more details about the quad micro curved display and what we can expect from it (and likely the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:690px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.07%;"><img id="Wh8grZUqniyxeaS88oVGWE" name="OnePlus-13-BOE-X2-display.jpg" alt="OnePlus 13's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wh8grZUqniyxeaS88oVGWE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="690" height="518" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Li Jie Louis/ via Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It will presumably be slightly curved on all sides, which isn&apos;t that easy to comprehend through the shared image of the panel. Otherwise, it looks like a conventional centered punch-hole display at first glance.</p><p>The curved display also means we might expect a near-bezel-less display, which also seems to be the case with the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-magnetic-charging-leaked-camera-module">OPPO Find X8</a> series from OnePlus&apos; sibling company—although that phone will seemingly have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-series-to-sport-narrow-bezels">flat screen</a>.</p>
<p>Android Headlines further notes that the curved display will measure 6.82 inches diagonally and have a 2K resolution. Users should also remember that the previous iteration of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> display was also sourced by BOE, and it turned out to be outstanding in terms of brightness and streaming HDR content.</p><p>Qualcomm&apos;s upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> chipset will likely power the OnePlus 13, with the chip set to launch later this month at the Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii. As rumored, we are expecting the OnePlus 13 to launch sooner this year, starting with the Chinese market, probably right after the flagship chipset release.</p><p>Speaking of, the upcoming chipset has been spotted in multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-hits-benchmark-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4">benchmark test leaks</a> over the past few weeks. It also includes a OnePlus handset, presumably the OnePlus 13, and the single-core and multi-core results turned out to be promising.</p>

UGREEN&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-200w-review">Nexode 200W</a> has been reliable in this regard over the last two years, and recently, I started using the brand&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-300w-charging-station-review">Nexode 300W charging station</a>.</p>

<p>But when it comes to charging my daily driver phones, I&apos;m starting to rely on wireless charging stands more and more. It&apos;s just convenient to use a wireless charger, and while the downside is that you don&apos;t get much in the way of speeds — they don&apos;t exceed 15W — that&apos;s more than adequate when using iPhones and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-was-wrong-about-the-pixel-9-pro-xl">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p><p>I used UGREEN&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-100w-2-in-1-desktop-charger-review">Nexode 100W MagSafe charging stand</a> in the past, but I switched over to Satechi&apos;s offerings earlier in the year, and they&apos;ve been phenomenal. Satechi makes some of the best charging accessories and hubs, and I use the brand&apos;s products throughout the house.</p><p>When Satechi announced it was coming out with Qi2 chargers, I was obviously interested. There are two products in the series — a 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand that can be used to charge your iPhone, Apple Watch, and earbuds at the same time, and a 2-in-1 stand that charges the iPhone and earbuds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k3SF9GezfrdKNSSQavdtsa" name="satechi-qi2-charging-stand-11.jpg" alt="Satechi Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand back view with iPhone 16 charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k3SF9GezfrdKNSSQavdtsa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both charging stands are made out of metal, and they do a great job powering up all of my Apple products. The rubber feet at the bottom ensure the stands don&apos;t move around on a desk, and the build quality is easily the best of any charging stand I used up to this point.</p>

<p>What I like the most about either charger is that they&apos;re ideal for travel; they fold down flat, and that makes them easy to carry on the road. While I haven&apos;t gotten back to traveling just yet, the 3-in-1 charging stand combined with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-pro-gan-chargers-launch">Nexode Pro 160W GaN charger</a> would be the ideal combination to use on the go.</p>

<p>The 3-in-1 wireless charging stand in particular is great; it comes with a bundled 45W charger with travel plugs for the EU and U.K., and it charges my iPhone 16 Pro Max at 15W alongside my smartwatch. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aEUT9ESjXM429HXDpM2YxZ" name="satechi-qi2-charging-stand-7.jpg" alt="Satechi Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand with smartwatch charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aEUT9ESjXM429HXDpM2YxZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, the ability to charge my Apple Watch along with my phone is a big deal; I usually have to lug a cable around just for the smartwatch, and not having to do that is a relief. While I don&apos;t wear earbuds regularly — my go-to choice is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">Audeze MM-500</a> — I used the stand to charge earbuds I&apos;m testing, and there were no issues in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mLdxSn65LUHXeLGtMqWdwX" name="satechi-qi2-charging-stand-6.jpg" alt="iPhone 16 and iPhone 15 charging on the Satechi Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mLdxSn65LUHXeLGtMqWdwX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like other charging stands, you can use StandBy Mode on the iPhone 16 to view the clock while the device is charging, or set up a digital photo frame. Both stands charged my iPhone 16 Pro Max at 15W, and there were no issues with overheating.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S4anKnfH5KzGbFKcmrKH9X" name="satechi-qi2-charging-stand-4.jpg" alt="Satechi Qi2 Wireless Charging Stands with magnetic connections" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4anKnfH5KzGbFKcmrKH9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Qi2 standard is interesting because it uses 15W as standard, and all chargers need to have magnets to ensure a strong seal with phones. While Satechi&apos;s wireless charging stands are aimed for use with iPhones, I routinely charge my Pixel 9 Pro XL with it, and it does just as good a job, albeit limited to 12W as Google doesn&apos;t offer Qi2 on its devices.</p>
<p>I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thinborne.com/collections/pixel-9-pro-xl-case">Thinborne&apos;s excellent case</a> with my Pixel 9 Pro XL, and the case has built-in magnets that create a good seal with Satechi&apos;s charging stand. You&apos;ll ideally need to use a case with your Android phone; all the devices I tested without a MagSafe case just slid down the stand and weren&apos;t able to secure a connection. </p><p>On that note, Android devices still don&apos;t have Qi2 yet — that should change in 2025 —  and we should see additional products in this category once the likes of Samsung and Chinese manufacturers integrate the standard. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sSDoXeq3WcyDZmJ56e4PCZ" name="satechi-qi2-charging-stand-12.jpg" alt="Side view of Satechi Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand with all devices charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sSDoXeq3WcyDZmJ56e4PCZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 3-in-1 charging station is available for $129, with the 2-in-1 option going for $79. Of the two, I&apos;d recommend getting the 3-in-1 option; the Apple Watch charging puck is a big differentiator, and it&apos;s just convenient to charge three devices at once. If you don&apos;t use the Apple Watch and just want a charging stand instead, the 2-in-1 option is a good value. </p><p>Satechi didn&apos;t leave anything out here, and if you need a reliable Qi2 wireless charging stand, these should be at the top of your list. </p>

<hr>
<p>Reports state OnePlus is finding itself in the hot seat once again in Germany regarding a patent dispute for a familiar problem.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.allround-pc.com/news/2024/patentstreit-oneplus-smartphones-in-deutschland-vorerst-nicht-erhaeltlich">Allround-PC</a> (German), Chinese OEM OnePlus is beginning to grapple with a new patent dispute with InterDigital. The publication states consumers and journalists in Germany have reported that a few of OnePlus&apos; devices (smartphones) are no longer available for purchase in the country.</p><p>It&apos;s stated that this patent dispute mirrors what OnePlus just got itself out of with Nokia. The post says there&apos;s an ongoing legal dispute potentially concerning "5G connectivity and other communication technology." The publication states InterDigital holds "key patents" in both areas, meaning OnePlus may have a familiar trial ahead of it.</p><p>OnePlus offered the following statement to the publication:</p><p><em>"OnePlus places high value on intellectual property rights and fair access to standard essential patents, which is essential for driving innovation in the industry. We will continue to negotiate with InterDigital and wish to resolve this matter in an amicable way. Meanwhile, our commitment in Europe remains unchanged and we will continue to provide excellent products and services to our users."</em></p><p>The company didn&apos;t have much to add about when consumers can see OnePlus phones like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">the OnePlus 12</a>, 11, etc. return. Moreover, online stores and the like have nothing to add, either. The report adds that consumers can still grab products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-is-my-favorite-android-tablet">OnePlus Pad 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">Watch 2</a>.</p><p>OnePlus and OPPO had a long-standing dispute with Nokia in Germany, which involved the latter&apos;s 5G technology. This resulted in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-oneplus-smartphone-sales-ban-germany-nokia-dispute">stoppage of smartphone sales</a> in the country while the three figures worked through the legality of the situation. OnePlus and OPPO were working to avoid an all-out ban in Germany after the Mannheim district court got involved in July 2022.</p><p>Another similarity between Nokia and this InterDigital situation is that OnePus could still sell "accessories" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/oneplus-nord-buds-3-pro-review">like earbuds</a> and watches.</p><p>However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-is-returning-to-europe-after-resolving-patent-disputes">dispute was settled</a> earlier this year with Nokia as the company&apos;s smartphones (like OPPO and Vivo) returned to Germany.</p><p>The company is expected to launch the OnePlus 13 later this year.</p>

<p>Motorola is expanding its business portfolio of phones today (Oct 1) by launching the sequel to its ThinkPhone.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-expands-end-to-end-business-portfolio-with-new-phones-software-and-a-business-edition-package/">a blog post</a>, Motorola welcomed the ThinkPhone 25, highlighting the device&apos;s "military standard" durability. Business workers can take solace in the phone&apos;s Gorilla Glass 7i protection over its 6.4-inch pOLED display. With flat sides and rounded corners, Motorola states the Aramid fiber strengthens the device, helping it take what daily life brings.</p><p>With a patterned back like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/thinkphone-review-the-best-motorola-phone-you-wont-buy">its predecessor</a>, the ThinkPhone 25 features a 50MP primary lens with f/1.8 aperture and OIS (optical image stabilization). Joining it is a 13MP ultrawide lens and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom. The front of the device offers a 32MP shooter.</p><p>MediaTek&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">Dimensity 7300</a> chip handles your tasks, designed with AI and built on the 4nm process. Motorola states the SoC delivers "proven" performance and efficiency for business workers.</p>

<p>Buyers will find 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage available for the ThinkPhone 25. Additionally, Moto has packed a slightly smaller 4,310mAh battery into this year&apos;s model, as opposed to the first iteration. However, the company has continued to <em>include </em>a<em> </em>68W TurboPower charger with the device. The phone can reach a 50% charge in ~11 minutes.</p><p>Moto&apos;s announcement post continues to hone in on the lengths gone for security and software with the ThinkPhone 25. To start, the device includes Moto AI, which powers Moto Secure&apos;s 2-factor authentication. The company states this is a hub for business workers to manage their security/privacy concerns, permissions, a "secret folder" for sensitive data, and more.</p><p>Businesses can onboard the ThinkPhone 25 faster as the device can be pre-configured with policies and settings. Security goes a step further through "eSIM remote provisioning" to minimize security breaches and help businesses "manage user behavior."</p><p>Consumers will also have Motorola&apos;s classic ThinkShield backed by AI-powered security features to protect them from malware and other online harm.</p>

<p>The ThinkPhone 25 launches with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>; however, Moto states that users will receive five years of Android OS updates and security updates, taking owners to at least 2029 in update eligibility.</p><p>The OS consumers will welcome comes installed with a "Clean OS" experience. Motorola says the phone will only contain apps "essential" for work without all the extra (fun) apps that&apos;ll keep you scrolling instead of working. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a> for the ThinkPhone 25 implements a deep pairing between the device and your PC. Users can quickly throw files over from phone to PC or the ThinkPhone 25 can double as a mobile webcam.</p><p>Those interested can pick up the Moto ThinkPhone 25 in Carbon Black with its 8/128GB configuration. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/thinkphone_25_by_motorola_announced-news-64742.php">GSMArena</a>, the device is set to debut in November for roughly €499 (~$549). Android Central has reached out to Motorola for confirmation about its pricing and availability. We will update this article when we hear back.</p>

<p>While users continue to wait on Android 15, there&apos;s already some information about Android 16.</p><p>Mishaal Rahman for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-codename-3486221/">Android Authority</a> received a tip from another developer about Android 16&apos;s potential codename. According to teamb58, a dive into Google&apos;s AOSP seemingly dubs the next major OS "Baklava." This was reportedly a change discovered in Android 16&apos;s early code, which sets "min_sdk_version" to "Baklava" while this year&apos;s (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>) remains as VanillaIceCream.</p><p>Rahman states this is likely a sign of things to come, seeing as Baklava has overtaken SDK version 36 (its true name). He says the honey-sweet pastry will likely stick around until "the SDK is finalized," after which the number "16" should come into play.</p><p>That&apos;s not all, as Rahman adds in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-release-date-rumor-3486336/">a separate post</a> that Android 16 could launch <em>much </em>earlier in 2025. While looking through Google&apos;s Compatibility Definition Document (CDD), Rahman states the company mentioned launching its next Android OS in "25Q2."</p><p>Developer teamb58 can reportedly corroborate this speculation after seeing the timeframe mentioned in "several" AOSP patches. Moreover, Rahman adds that a few Google developers working on Android have mentioned the Q2 2025 window, though they do call the assumed Android 16 (Baklava) "Android W," following with the already established alphabet.</p><p>Rahman suspects Google&apos;s potential shift to an earlier Android release in 2025 has something to do with its "trunk stable project." This project is said to let developers work together on a unified "main branch" of Android, which helps them work on and enable features/APIs for future builds.</p>

<p>Aside from Android 16&apos;s suspected codename, Google&apos;s potential launch of Android 16 in Q2 next year is surprising. <em>Typically</em>, the company brings its next-gen Android software to devices during the second half of the year. However, this year, we&apos;ve missed that. Android 15 has been met with apparent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-it-mean-if-both-google-and-samsungs-android-15-updates-are-delayed">delays</a>. This sees Galaxy users waiting as Samsung wrangles with increasing problems with its One UI 7 (Android 15 skin).</p><p>Google has reportedly had to take Android 15 back into the kitchen to iron out some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-fall-launch-details-rumor">problematic stability issues</a> before releasing it. Instead, the company rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-2-bluetooth-fixes-features-rollout">its QPR beta</a> for the December feature drop. Moreover, rumors speculate that Android 15 will launch this month (October), which will land the OS in Q4 2024 instead of Q3.</p><p>Little else is known about Android 16 aside from speculation, but there was a possible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notifications-quick-settings-panel-android-16-rumor">revamp to its notifications</a> spotted. Notifications could surface in a smaller panel leaving enough room for users to see what they were doing. Additionally, fully expanding the Quick Settings menu could display smaller, circular icons.</p>

<p>The Pixel Buds web app just expanded to Windows and macOS, so you can now manage your earbuds straight from your computer.</p><p>Google&apos;s Pixel Buds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-pixel-buds-pwa-on-chromebooks">web app used to be limited to Chromebook users</a>, making it tricky for people on Windows or macOS to manage their earbuds. But now, Google has opened up access to more devices, so you can easily control your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds</a> on pretty much any computer.</p><p>A recent update to the Pixel Buds support page now includes step-by-step instructions for updating Pixel Buds firmware using the web app (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/29/pixel-buds-mac-windows/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The PWA works with macOS Sonoma 14, Windows 11, and later versions. It offers features similar to those of the ChromeOS version, but keep in mind that it doesn’t work with Safari on MacOS. For the best experience on macOS, it’s recommended to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Chrome browser</a>.</p><p>The web app puts you in the driver’s seat with your earbuds. You can toggle active noise cancellation, switch to transparency mode, and manage conversation detection. It also lets you activate touch controls and customize the equalizer settings to get the sound just right.</p><p>To get started with the web app on your macOS or Windows computer, first pair your earbuds with your system. Then, head over to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mypixelbuds.google.com/" target="_blank">mypixelbuds.google.com</a> and follow the on-screen instructions to unlock all the app&apos;s features.</p><p>In the upper right corner, you&apos;ll find the "More Settings" menu (look for the gear icon), where you can dive into a range of audio customization options like Volume EQ, Mono Audio, In-Ear Detection, and Volume Balance. The interface also shows useful information about your paired Pixel Buds, including their status and model.</p><p>The web page not only lets you control your Pixel Buds but also shows important details like the firmware version. It also allows you to update your earbuds with the latest firmware even if they’re not connected to an Android phone.</p><p>The addition of Pixel Buds PWA support for Mac and Windows is a big win for Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> lineup. This change tackles a major concern that might have stopped some folks from buying them due to limited desktop support.</p>

<p>OPPO is expected to launch its Find X8 series very soon. Until then, a couple of leaks have revealed the device&apos;s design and some interesting specifications ahead of its anticipated launch, including the addition of magnetic accessories.</p><p>While the company had officially teased how the Find X8 device would look right next to the recently launched Apple iPhone 16 series, tipster Abhishek Yadav on X has shared some real-life images of the upcoming handset via Weibo.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oppo Find X8 images from Weibo.#Oppo #OppoFindX8 pic.twitter.com/VXMwVPTzjn<a href="https://twitter.com/yabhishekhd/status/1839593426817372608">September 27, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Per the shared images, we can see the Find X8 from the rear, with its giant circular module featuring a triple camera setup, including a periscope lens. Other images from the tipster have also revealed the device from the front, which indicates a near bezel-less screen — also symmetrical, just like the recent iPhone 16 Pro models. It corroborates with the recent teaser <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-series-to-sport-narrow-bezels">image shared by Pete Lau</a> a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zhou Yibao, product manager for OPPO, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/u/5313402944?layerid=5037628694727278">has shared</a> some more official images of the Find X8, again compared to the latest iPhone 16 Pro series phone.</p>

<p>According to Yibao, the display will be narrow-edged, with all sides in symmetry and a physically equal width. It will also be flat, and the device will be thinner, lighter, and smaller than the previous generation. He also notes that the camera housing will be smaller and protrude less despite featuring the periscope lens.</p><p>Other confirmed specs are IP68/69 water and dust resistance, an alert slider, and a decent 5000mAh battery capacity coupled with 50W wireless charging. Yibao showed off the ability to charge the phone using MagSafe-like magnetic charging accessories, stating that the company plans to make wireless charging standard across the Find series. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/OzcWXkxtJ?pagetype=profilefeed">video</a> posted to the company&apos;s Weibo also showcased the same magnetic accessories working on the iPhone.</p>

<p>According to tipster Chun on X, the chipset powering OPPO&apos;s flagship phone would be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9400-cores-rumor">Dimensity 9400</a>, which is all set to launch soon. The Find X8 series is also set to launch next month. He has further shared that Vivo&apos;s X200 series will utilize the same chipset and launch globally in a month or so. </p><p>For most regions, these two phone series from OPPO and Vivo will at least have 16GB of RAM and a 512GB storage variant released during the launch.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Won't take too long for folks outside of mainland China to taste Dimensity 9400.

<p>Samsung&apos;s devices have always been at the forefront of the Android tablet product segment, and the newly introduced Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is no exception. The uber-premium tablet is specifically designed for resource-heavy workflows and on-the-go productivity—offering everything from powerhouse hardware to full S Pen support—to help you do just that. Of course, the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra has all of that as well, but the latest version does come with a few improvements over the last-gen model.</p><p>So, what are all these upgrades, and how significant are they? More importantly, if you already have the previous-gen model, should you even care?</p><p>Read on, as we take a comparative look at Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra vs. Tab S9 Ultra and answer those questions.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-vs-tab-s9-ultra-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra vs. Tab S9 Ultra: Design and display</h2>
<p>When viewed side by side, the two tablets are nearly impossible to tell apart. Except for being a little lighter and a tad slimmer, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is exactly the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a>. You still get the same well-built aluminum chassis with flat sides, a dual-lens rear camera system, as well as an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. Other standout features—from the crisp quad-speaker array to the magnetic S Pen charging strip at the back—have also been carried forward from the last-gen model.</p>

<p>Flip over the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, and you&apos;ll notice it&apos;s a similar story. The tablet&apos;s business side is all about a gargantuan 14.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen, having a resolution of 2960x1848 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate. It&apos;s exactly the same superb display—complete with vibrant colors and great viewing angles—as the one on the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, but with one key difference.</p><p>The panel now comes with an anti-reflective coating (introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>) that helps a lot in reducing glare and enhancing overall visibility, as noted by Android Central&apos;s Andrew Myrick during his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on" target="_blank">brief hands-on experience</a> with the device. You also get fairly slim (for a tablet) uniform bezels on all sides, with only the notch for the dual-lens front camera setup breaking up the symmetry.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-vs-tab-s9-ultra-hardware-and-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra vs. Tab S9 Ultra: Hardware and cameras</h2>
<p>Complementing the stunning exterior of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra are its top-tier innards, which are easily the best you can find in any Android-based tablet available in the market right now. The flagship slate is driven by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing" target="_blank">MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus chipset</a> that—according to Samsung—delivers an 18 percent boost and a 28 percent jump in CPU and GPU performance, respectively. While we&apos;ll only be able to test out these claims once we review the tablet, it&apos;s worth noting that the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC powering the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra continues to be capable of handling everything you throw at it without breaking a sweat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cAUyEgk2eVmsYftj7McfkY" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-in-hand.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra using Generative Edit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cAUyEgk2eVmsYftj7McfkY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other hardware specifications remain unchanged, with both tablets offering up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of onboard storage. And if you need even more space, you&apos;ll be happy to know that the good ol&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android" target="_blank">microSD card</a> slot is still here.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra has a total of four cameras—two at the front and two on the rear — and all of them have been carried over from the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra. The rear camera system is comprised of a 13MP wide-angle sensor and an 8MP ultrawide unit. On the other hand, the front camera setup is comprised of a 12MP wide-angle sensor and a 12MP ultrawide unit. There&apos;s support for 4K video recording as well.</p>

<p>A tablet—especially one that&apos;s this big—may not be everyone&apos;s first choice when it comes to capturing photos and videos, but it&apos;s good to have the option. We also think the overall quality is going to be more than decent, even if it doesn&apos;t come anywhere close to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera" target="_blank">best Android camera phones</a> out there.</p>

While that&apos;s expected, what&apos;s important is the One UI 6.1.1 overlay, which makes it Samsung&apos;s first tablet to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-ai" target="_blank">Galaxy AI</a> out of the box. Optimized for big screen(s), Galaxy AI introduces features like enhanced note-taking with auto summarization, split-view editing, and PDF translation. Apart from those, you also have goodies such as Google&apos;s &apos;Circle to Search&apos; and generative photo editing. Needless to say, all these AI-powered tools will eventually come to the last-gen model too.</p>

<p>That said, the one thing that might just give the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra an edge over the previous-gen model is software support, as it&apos;s very much possible that it will be covered by the same excellent update policy as Samsung&apos;s newest flagship phones. Conversely, the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra—which was launched with Android 13—is only eligible for four years of updates.</p><p>Now let&apos;s talk about accessories! Yeah, the bundled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-samsung-galaxy-tab-models-support-s-pen" target="_blank">S Pen</a> is great, but Samsung is also offering a number of accessories (e.g., rugged cases, keyboard covers) for the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra through its online storefront. And the best part is that nearly all of them are backwards compatible with the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="anKJbR5PvnxeLuSxrVWhqK" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-dex-mode-setup-16x9.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra review hero 16x9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/anKJbR5PvnxeLuSxrVWhqK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 11,200mAh battery of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra remains unchanged, as does the 45W fast wired charging support. That being said, the use of newer and more power-efficient internals could result in better endurance as compared to the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-vs-tab-s9-ultra-should-you-upgrade-2">Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra vs. Tab S9 Ultra: Should you upgrade?</h2>
<p>There&apos;s no denying that the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets" target="_blank">best Android tablets</a> you can get today. But then, so is the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, even if it&apos;s a bit old at this point. Sure, the refreshed anti-reflective display and the new MediaTek hardware are awesome, but these are only minor updates. Moreover, now that the Tab S10 Ultra is here, it&apos;s only a matter of time before the Tab S9 Ultra sees a reduction in its price(s).</p>

<p>Our suggestion is simple! If you&apos;re planning to get a new premium tablet and money is no object, go ahead and get the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. You&apos;ll get the newest thing in town, along with slightly faster performance and longer software support. However, if you already have the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, an upgrade just isn&apos;t worth it. Even if you decide to take advantage of the pre-order deals and trade in your last-gen tablet (in mint condition), you&apos;ll have to pay $400 out of your pocket, so it&apos;s better to save your money.</p>
