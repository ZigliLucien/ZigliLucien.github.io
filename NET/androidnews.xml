<ul><li>WhatsApp detailed a series of updates for its voice and video calling services.</li><li>Those calling on the web-based app will find a more convenient and easy to use UI when calling alongside better controls in group chats.</li><li>WhatsApp recently rolled out "Message Drafts" to mobile users alongside Transcripts for voice messages.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is detailing several new calling features that users will soon find on mobile and the web-based app.</p><p>The Meta-owned communication service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/improved-calling-this-holiday-season">highlighted</a> the series of updates that will soon hit devices. The updates kick off with the web-based WhatsApp version as the post states users there will find "improved calling." It seems the service is updating the UI experience as it says users calling someone else will find the call button, call link creation, and the ability to dial a number directly more conveniently.</p><p>Selecting call participants is also receiving a bit of holiday cheer as WhatsApp rolls in better control when it groups. According to the post, users can now call specific people within a group chat, instead of ringing everyone simultaneously.</p><p>Video calling is the final area WhatsApp's December update hones in on, beginning with "better quality." The company states calls are "more reliable" and users can enjoy a "higher resolution with a clearer picture" during one-on-one and group video calls.</p><p>This update is rolling out for mobile and desktop users.</p><p>Lastly, the platform detailed additional video call effects. The announcement states users will find 10 new effects, ranging from cute dog ears and nose to an underwater theme and a microphone for singing.</p><p>Users should begin noticing these updates today (Dec 12) and beyond as we end the week. Continue to check to see if your app has an update if you've not seen one yet.</p>

<p>WhatsApp deployed a new update in November that was like the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-whatsapp-message-drafts-rollout">missing piece</a>" for its services: message drafts. These new draft indicators were designed for mobile devices. When writing a text in a one-on-one thread or group chat, and you haven't sent it, users will notice a "draft" label in your messaging list. Places where you started, but didn't finish will be bumped to the top of your list for visibility.</p><p>This is a feature that's been commonly seen in other apps like Google Messages and it's good that WhatsApp is finally onboard.</p><p>Additionally, the platform rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-introduces-voice-message-transcripts">an accessibility update</a> that concerns Voice Messages. "Select" languages started receiving support for Transcripts when receiving a voice message. These transcriptions are said to work with longer audio files and will remain there to return and read later on. WhatsApp adds that the transcriptions are optional and users can turn them off via the settings if desired.</p>

<hr>
<p>Epic Games, creators of Fortnite, have announced a major partnership that will bring its games to "millions" of users.</p><p>Today (Dec 12), Epic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/telefonica-and-epic-games-bring-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-telefonica-devices">detailed its new partnership</a> with Telefónica, a global cellular carrier with strong ties to areas within Europe. Epic states this is the beginning of a "long term" partnership with the service provider as its Game Store will be pre-loaded onto every Android phone it offers consumers.</p><p>Telefónica's Director of Partnerships and Devices, Lorena Itziar Senador-Gómez Lázaro stated, "with this collaboration with Epic Games we strengthen our relationship and go one step further in delivering high-quality, accessible, and innovative digital experiences to our customers."</p><p>Epic calls this a "strategic alliance" as it looks to create a more "competitive ecosystem for Android players." Its statement adds that consumers will now be exposed to more choices beyond the "conventional app marketplaces."</p><p>While Telefónica is quite widespread across Europe, Epic states its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1867152588094771446">pre-loaded app store will concern</a> Spain, the U.K., Germany, Mexico, and Spanish-speaking LATAM on its network.</p><p>Several of the games Android users leveraging Telefónica's cell service will find are Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Rocket League Sideswipe.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Epic Games Store will now be preinstalled on Telefónica Android devices in Spain, UK, Germany, Mexico and Spanish-speaking Latam. This will enable players to bypass many of Google’s misleading scare screens and get to playing Fortnite faster. We’re looking to partner with…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1867152588094771446">December 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The companies are reportedly not content with stopping here as 2025 will hold additional ventures into expanded partnerships. Epic and Telefónica will seek to "bring more benefits" to its Android players across its cellular network.</p><p>What's interesting about this new pre-load partnership with Telefónica is that Epic tried to do this with OnePlus and LG, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-stopped-oneplus-pre-installing-fortnite-its-phones">Google stopped it</a>. Google was reportedly afraid that Epic would "install and update multiple games with a silent install bypassing the Google Play Store."</p><p>When Epic highlights "conventional app marketplaces," we can't help but look to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/now-google-has-removed-fortnite-its-play-store">storied history with Google</a>. Epic sued Google in 2020 after its popular game, Fortnite, was axed from the Play Store after an update gave players a way to buy its virtual currency, V-Bucks, directly through the developer. This infringed on Google's store policy, where it takes a 15% fee for all purchases for apps listed.</p><p>Things then evolved into a series of lawsuits, where Epic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-loses-antitrust-court-battle-against-epic">won a major trial in antitrust court</a> against Google where a judge found the latter guilty of an illegal monopoly in the Play Store. Epic has continued to fight tech companies — think Google and Samsung — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-sues-google-and-samsung-anti-competitive-case">over anti-competitive practices</a> when it comes to third-party developers.</p><p>Where we're at now is the Epic Game Store's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/epic-games-store-arriving-on-android-later-this-year">arrival for download</a> on Android. Epic is more interested in delivering a "fair" experience for games and developers, instead of being content with Google's large 15% to 30% fee during transactions. Moreover, Epic stated it would keep the same 88/12 split for purchases that it has on its PC client. Developers would retain 88% of a user's purchase, with the remaining 12% falling into Epic's hands.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors claim that Samsung could shift to using its Exynos chipset "significantly" inside the Galaxy S26 series.</li><li>Little information is known about the chip; however, previous reports suggest it could be based on Samsung's new 2nm process.</li><li>This rumored followed quickly behind another report that suggests Samsung's Galaxy S25 series could see a sporadic price increase globally.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As we approach the Galaxy S25 series, rumors have surfaced about Samsung's next-generation would-be successor in 2026.</p><p>A new rumor by X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1867062057813807362">Jukanlosreve</a> states that Samsung might bring its Galaxy S26 series in-house for its desired SoC (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-could-double-down-on-exynos/">Android Police</a>). According to the post, the Korean OEM is allegedly planning to use its custom Exynos chips "significantly" within the Galaxy S26 flagship series.</p><p>Little else is known about the chip's specifics; however, there is speculation about where it could be applied. The publication suggests Samsung could utilize its Exynos chip in various regions around the world, but stick to Qualcomm for the U.S. market. If true, then it would be similar to what Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-exynos-will-be-just-fine">done in the past</a> with the S24 series.</p><p>That series saw the Exynos applied to markets in Europe, India, and the U.K.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung aims to “significantly” equip the Galaxy S26 with Exynos chips next year.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1867062057813807362">December 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>We might have an idea about this alleged Exynos focus as there was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-starts-work-on-its-2nm-process-chip">a report in May</a> from a South Korean news outlet. The post alleged that Samsung was preparing to develop a stronger, 2nm process for the eventual Exynos 2600 SoC. The SoC supposedly had the codename "Thetis" internally. The report claimed that Samsung was planning on popping the chip into the Galaxy S26 series.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-2nm-process-production-plans">confirmed</a> it was planning on mass producing a 2mn process chip in 2025, an area where it wanted to take the lead.</p><p>Early reports purported that the chip would deliver a 12% increase in performance, a 25% efficiency boost, and a 5% decrease in "total area."</p><p>A more exclusive shift toward an in-house chip could help Samsung keep its costs in a (somewhat) comfortable light — especially following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-alleged-sporadic-price-increase-rumored">a new report</a>. It was recently rumored that Samsung's Galaxy S25 series, which will use Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, could see a "slight" price jump in South Korea. This was reportedly due to a higher exchange rate between the two companies for the product.</p><p>It was stated that Qualcomm's tech had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-rumored-price-hike-sour">risen by roughly 30%</a> compared to previous generations and it could impact regions sporadically. A price hike has been rumored since September, as it was purported that the latest flagship chip leaped by ~$190 for OEMs.</p><p>Early rumors regarding the Galaxy S26 can always change, so take this with a grain of salt. For now, we have the S25 series to look ahead to during its likely launch in January 2025. What's more, a recent claimed the series could boast <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-qi2-wireless-charging-support-rumors">Qi2 wireless charging</a> support.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amid ongoing FBI investigations into a massive cyberespionage campaign, experts are urging Canadian iPhone and Android users to hit pause on texting between these platforms.</p><p>Last week, a Chinese hacking group known as "Salt Typhoon" reportedly stole tons of Americans' metadata, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/large-number-americans-metadata-stolen-by-chinese-hackers-senior-official-says-2024-12-04/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. In response, the FBI is urging people to stick to encrypted messaging and calls instead of texting.</p><p>While messaging within the same platform is fairly secure, texts between Android and iPhone are vulnerable to attacks, as shown by recent hacks linked to "Salt Typhoon," which is reportedly tied to the Ministry of Public Security.</p><p>The hack reportedly hit at least eight U.S. telecoms, giving Beijing officials access to private texts and calls from who knows how many Americans. The Salt Typhoon hack is said to be behind the attack on companies like AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen Technologies.</p><p>FBI officials say the attacks stole tons of call and text metadata, but not the content. Only a small group of individuals, mainly tied to government or political work, had their private messages compromised.</p><p>These attacks have exposed major security flaws in U.S. communication networks, which are vulnerable to interception since end-to-end encryption isn't standard. That's why companies like Apple and Google recommend using encryption, making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging apps</a> like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> and Telegram more popular than ever.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/canadian-iphone-and-android-users-should-stop-texting-each-other-experts-advise-as-fbi-investigates/article_633d58de-b62b-11ef-8949-4b239047f867.html" target="_blank">Toronto Star</a> reports that Canada’s Communications Security Establishment says it hasn't found any Canadian networks affected yet.</p><p>Experts still think it's "highly likely" Canadian systems have been targeted too. Even without the current attacks in mind, they suggest skipping texts between iPhones and Androids for safety.</p><p>FBI officials also recommend U.S. citizens use phones that get regular OS updates, have solid encryption, and enable phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication for email, social media, and collaboration apps.</p>

<p>A speculative Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16 analysis gives you a better view of which phone is right for you. Whether you're more of a Samsung or Apple fan might tip the scale in one direction when choosing between the two phones. But since the Samsung Galaxy S25 specs are not official yet, we're going to have some fun daydreaming about which phone is better using the available rumors for the upcoming Galaxy phone.</p><p>One rumor we love is about the more powerful processor on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">Android phone</a>. The new processor helps Samsung make its new lineup more appealing. The Galaxy S24 is a great option if you don't feel like waiting, but remember that good things come to those who wait.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-iphone-16-design-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-side-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="Another alleged angled rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has kept its design similar over the years, so it's safe to assume that the Galaxy S25 might also have the typical triple camera stack we expect from Android phones. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design" target="_blank">leaked renders</a>, Samsung will fully unify the design across all three models. The Galaxy S25 might have a similar look to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Rumors suggest the Samsung Galaxy S25 will have a more traditional camera lens with ribbed edges and thicker borders. We're optimistic about the Galaxy S25's design and it having the triple camera design we're used to seeing on Samsung phones.</p>
<p>Rumors also suggest that the Galaxy S25 could have the same colors as the earlier model. The Galaxy S25 could be smaller than the iPhone 16 since the rumored size is 146.94 x 70.46 x 7.25mm. The weight is not available, but since the past three models have a weight of 167 and 168 grams, it's safe to assume that the S25 also follows that pattern. Samsung has not confirmed the IP rating, but the Galaxy S24 rating suggests that the S25 will likely have the same.</p><p>The rumored colors for the upcoming Galaxy S25 include Titanium Black, Gray, Blue, and Silver. There are also rumored thinner bezels users could enjoy in 2025.</p><p>On the other hand, the iPhone 16 only has two cameras stacked on the back of the phone's compact design. It also has a new camera bump, leaving behind the square with offset cameras and going for a more vertical arrangement. It has a revamped ultra-wide camera with autofocus, an action key, and a new hardware button for the cameras.</p><p>This year's iPhone 16 retains the same weight and dimension as last year's model, which is 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm and weighs 170 grams. The iPhone is available in White, Black, Pink, Teal, and Ultramarine. You also get a phone with an IP68 rating, but it's still a good idea to dry it off if the phone ever gets wet. However, avoid spilling harmful liquids such as sugary drinks and cleaning liquids.</p><p>The iPhone 16 has the same aluminum frame as Apple's Ceramic Shield as the iPhone 16 Plus. It also has a frame and glass panel with a matte finish that should help with the grip.</p>

<p>Rumors suggest that Samsung could replace its camera hardware with Sony. The processor may be the more powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset (essentially a rebranded Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip). The Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, with its Oryon cores, will give the S25 a performance jump. However, other rumors indicate that Samsung is saving the Snapdragon processor for the Ultra model and might give the remaining models an Exynos chip.</p><p>According to tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1837452794909086073" target="_blank">Ice Universe</a>, the Galaxy S25 will have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-triple-camera-array-rumors" target="_blank">identical camera setup to the S24</a> model. The camera system could have a 50MP wide primary camera, 10MP telephoto, 12MP selfie, and 12MP ultrawide. The rumored increase in RAM will significantly help if the rumors are true.</p><p>Samsung has held its Unpacked event in January for the last two years, so we might get the official specs shortly. However, if the S25 matches the S24’s specs, we're looking at storage options of 128GB and 256GB and a 4,000mAh battery. On the other hand, other leaks point to a more powerful 5,000mAh battery, sweet! There is also support for wired and wireless charging.</p><p>On the Apple side, the iPhone 16 has Apple's A18 processor, but the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite may not be too far behind in terms of performance. This is very interesting since it's the first time a Snapdragon chip has matched an Apple one, and we're eager to see how the S25 performs against the iPhone 16.</p><p>The iPhone 16 has a 48MP main, a 12MP selfie, and a 12MP ultrawide. In addition to that camera power, it has dual-LED dual-tone flash, HDR, and the ability to record in 4K. Beyond its cameras, you can choose from 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB, but it has only 8GB of RAM across all three options. If you're OK with a standard battery, the iPhone 16's 3,561mAh battery should suffice.</p>

<p>There is usually not much of a difference in screen size between models, but according to yeux122 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223385894570&navType=by" target="_blank">Naver</a>, Samsung may increase the display size to 6.3 inches. The Galaxy S25 may also have the same low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) OLED using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1849655264984826017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1849655264984826017%7Ctwgr%5E42e6327bee39bb711c19c964e7f951ab539d0ade%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gadgets360.com%2Fmobiles%2Fnews%2Fsamsung-25-ultra-plus-display-technology-costs-report-6878388" target="_blank">M13 organic materials</a> as the S24. I hope that the S25 at least has the same sharp display and 120Hz as the S24, along with the Gorilla Glass Victus 2. Rumors also suggest we could be looking at a 2,600-nit brightness level.</p><p>The iPhone 16 has a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED HDR10 display with Dolby Vision, delivering great visuals with a resolution of 1179 x 2556 and a density of 460ppi. Apple protects the display with Ceramic Shield Glass, which the company claims is twice as strong as Corning Gorilla Glass Victus. Furthermore, a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating keeps the screen smudge-free, also on the iPhone 15. If you like scrolling at night, lowering the brightness to a single nit is fantastic.</p><p>Apple also equipped the iPhone 16 static panels at 60Hz, but it does not support always-on functionality. The display can reach a peak brightness of 2,000 nits.</p>

<p>Samsung will equip the latest Galaxy model, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist" target="_blank">One UI 7,</a> with the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review" target="_blank">Android 15</a>. This software upgrade boosts a fresh new look with updated customization options, icons, a new visual style, and more. Reports suggest the new animation will resemble OnePlus' parallel processing in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-just-made-2024s-best-phone-even-better">OxygenOS 15</a>. While Samsung has not confirmed the number of OS updates for the S25, the S24 enjoys seven years, suggesting the S25 might follow suit.</p><p>Samsung will likely add Galaxy AI features, including new and improved ones and additional parental control features. Galaxy AI has excellent features such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14" target="_blank">generative AI wallpaper</a> and generative edit.</p><p>The iPhone 16 comes with iOS 18 pre-installed but only gets five years of updates. Unfortunately, there are two fewer than Samsung offers for the S24 and possibly the S25. You can fully customize the iPhone's home screen, recoloring and changing the app icons. You can switch between light and dark mode, rearrange the quick controls, and more.</p><p>The first batch of Apple Intelligence is available now, with more to come. Apple included features such as Writing Tools, Genmoji, the new Siri, Notification summary, Visual Intelligence, Priority notifications, Recording summary, Chat GPT integration, Image Playground, and more.</p>

<p>Regarding the Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16, which phone you choose depends on whether you prefer the Samsung or Apple ecosystem. However, delaying your decision is a good idea since Samsung has not officially launched the Galaxy S25. Samsung will hopefully release the Android phone soon, but like with every new launch, the phone will likely come with a high price tag.</p><p>Think of it this way: if you wait, you will have more information to help you decide, and the following batches of Apple Intelligence might be out, as well as the official specs for the S25, including the much-anticipated Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. Taking into consideration that Samsung doesn't save it exclusively for the Ultra version.</p><p>You can choose from available specs when you buy the phone and not go on the promise of what it might have. The iPhone 16 has the A18 processor, but we don't know how it will match up against the S25's processor, whichever one it gets.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube TV announced another price hike today (Dec 12), which will see its Basic Plan rise by $10 to $82.99.</li><li>The platform states this will go into effect on December 12, 2024 for new members before hitting "most" existing users on January 13, 2025.</li><li>YouTube TV states this rise in costs is due to "rising content costs," a similar reason given during its previous hike in 2023.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube TV made an announcement today (Dec 12) confirming pricing changes, despite claiming the opposite after an "erroneous" ad.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/YouTubeTV/status/1867236661173612567">a thread on X</a>, YouTube TV explained its mindset and why it has dropped <em>another </em>price hike here in December. In a "message for our members," the streaming service states that it will increase its monthly cost to $82.99 in light of "rising content costs."</p><p>The service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/9285852">published a support page</a> to explain the entire scope of this price hike.</p><p>According to YouTube TV, this updated $82.99 price will affect those purchasing the Basic Plan. The change has occurred today (Dec 12) for all new members. However, "most" existing users will see this change go into effect for their accounts on January 13, 2025. In short, this is a $10 hike from the Basic Plan's former $72.99 charge.</p><p>Another detail to know is that anyone whose membership is paused will see this new price once you've reactivated it. Additionally, if you've received YouTube TV's Basic Plan via a promotional trial or price, the post states this new price will be attached once the promotion expires. Those who've purchased the Basic Plan through a YouTube TV Integrated Billing partner will see this new price applied to their account on February 13, 2025.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A message for our members: we have always worked to offer the content you love, with features to enjoy the best of live TV. To keep up with rising content costs, we’re updating our monthly price to $82.99/mo. (1/3)<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1867236661173612567">December 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>YouTube TV adds that it didn't make this decision "lightly" and states that it may "impact" its users. While the price is set to rise in a month, the post adds that those sticking with the Basic Plan won't lose any content. The Basic Plan will continue to feature 100 plus channels, unlimited storage DVR, six accounts per household, and more.</p><p>What's strange about this announcement is that YouTube TV denied any sort of price increase on Monday (Dec 9), as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://michaelsaves.com/streaming/youtube-tv-raising-prices/">Michael Saves</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/youtube-tv-denies-price-hike-blames-verizon-ad-error/">Cord Cutters News</a>). Verizon had run an ad (albeit a little early) about a discounted YouTube TV price within its new bundle. The post states the listed price for the service was this $82.99 tag instead of the (now old) $72.99 price.</p><p>The publication spotted TeamYouTube on X denying the idea of a price hike earlier this week. However, the social media post has since been deleted.</p><p>YouTube TV states users can check their membership status by heading into their <strong>Settings > Membership</strong>.</p><p>The streaming service has a lengthy history of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tvs-price-increasing-65-month">continuously raising prices</a>. In 2021, the platform's monthly cost rose by $15 to $64.99 per month. Then, in March 2023,  YouTube TV took prices up <em>again</em>, which saw the final price <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-2023-price-increase">double what it started as originally</a>. Prices rose by $8 to $72.99 — and now we're met with a $10 jump today.</p><p>Its words today echo what was said last year, as YouTube TV stated the price hike was because "content costs have risen." It added that the rise in fees can help its team ensure "quality of service."</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Prices go up. It's simply a fact of life, but there's a difference between necessary and expected price increases — like inflation — and corporate price hikes. Over the past decade, it has become harder and harder to tell the difference between the two in the smartphone industry. Sale prices for phones across all price points are rising. It's an unfortunate trend for our wallets that, by all indications, won't get any better when Samsung officially unveils its upcoming Galaxy S25 series next year.</p><p>For context, Samsung might be one of the worst offenders when it comes to outrageous smartphone pricing. The current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> is the most expensive non-foldable flagship Android phone on the market in the U.S. today, with a retail price of $1,299. The prior <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> was cheaper, but Samsung axed the cheaper model with reduced RAM this year, and thus the cost is higher.</p><p>It did something similar with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, raising the price of each by $100 despite minimal improvements. In other words, Samsung is no stranger to price hikes. On top of that, the already-high price of the Galaxy S24 Ultra leaves the brand little wiggle room. How much more expensive can this phone get?</p>

<p>From the beginning, rumors indicated that Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset was more expensive than its predecessors. By nature, that would send shockwaves through the industry. OEMs could either eat the cost or pass the higher fee onto consumers — and I think we all know which option corporations are likely to choose.</p><p>In September, a reliable leaker claimed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-rumored-price-hike-sour">the price of a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> increased by about 20% compared to the prior generation, reaching about $190 — just for the system-on-a-chip. More recently, things have been quiet about Snapdragon 8 Elite and Galaxy S25 pricing. That is until this week when a Korean outlet reported on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-alleged-sporadic-price-increase-rumored">the possibility of a price increase for the Galaxy S25 series in some markets</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.yna.co.kr/amp/view/AKR20241209139300017" target="_blank">Yonhap News</a> (Korean) believes that the higher cost of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, paired with unfavorable exchange rates, could lead to a price hike in South Korea — and possibly other markets. However, a separate report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,147437.html" target="_blank">WinFuture</a> (German) notes that price increases might not affect every region.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the official prices of Snapdragon 8 Elite chipsets aren't public, they appear to be a driving factor behind talk about higher prices during this release cycle. The experts agree: according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/smartphone-asp-rising-on-soc-memory-price-increases" target="_blank">Counterpoint Research</a>, the rising global average sale price (ASP) of smartphones is linked to higher costs for processors and memory. Early Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered phones, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15">Xiaomi 15</a>, have been priced higher as a result.</p><p>Counterpoint Research associates the push for 3nm and 4nm process nodes with the price increases for silicon across the market. Qualcomm is using the 3nm fabrication process for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> and, crucially, its custom Oryon core design. It's the same in-house design that helped the Snapdragon X laptop chip become a fan favorite.</p><p>Interestingly, the Snapdragon X Plus chip helped midrange laptops become more powerful and at approachable price points. Meanwhile, the Snapdragon 8 Elite looks to be a big upgrade over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, but it is doing the opposite for affordability. It's fair to wonder if the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is really worth it if it drives the prices of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series even higher.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="aW5aJXDvAiQnLpfxNZ3NE3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-yellow-grey-s-pen-03.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aW5aJXDvAiQnLpfxNZ3NE3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's not just the flagship phones getting more expensive, either. The SoC and memory costs are driving the global average sale price up <em>overall</em>. The global ASP is projected to rise 3% this year and 5% next year, according to counterpoint. You might be surprised to learn that even with 2024's projected 3% price increase, the global ASP for smartphones is just $365.</p><p>You're not entirely wrong for expecting that figure to be much higher. That's because the ultra-premium sector of the smartphone market, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, is growing rapidly. And more Android phones are joining that category as price hikes continue to happen throughout the industry.</p><p>Counterpoint Research reports that sales of smartphones costing over $1,000 or more increased 18% year-over-year in the first half of 2024. Companies like Samsung continue to raise prices, and shockingly, we keep paying them. Will that change with the Galaxy S25 series?</p>
<h2 id="we-shouldn-t-pay-more-for-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-series-2">We shouldn't pay more for the Samsung Galaxy S25 series </h2>
<p>Based on the latest leaks and rumors, the Samsung Galaxy S25 series will bring quite a few improvements. The Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is as good as advertised, and at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-fcc-listing-details-confirmed">some Galaxy S25 models are projected to get a larger screen</a>. However, many other things will likely be unchanged from the Galaxy S24 series, like the overall design and the camera hardware on certain models.</p><p>Put another way, the Galaxy S25 might be a great phone. It just probably won't be worth more than the Galaxy S24, which was already priced fairly high. The only way we, as consumers, can tell Samsung this is by resisting the temptation to upgrade to the latest generation of Galaxy. If the Galaxy S25 comes at a higher price yet again, I can say with absolute certainty I won't be buying it.</p>

<h2 id="everything-else-you-need-to-know-about-battery-life-and-charging-on-the-pixel-watch-3-2">Everything else you need to know about battery life and charging on the Pixel Watch 3</h2>
<p>Battery life on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> depends on a variety of factors, from usage habits to the number of GPS workouts tracked on a daily basis. Regardless of how you use the Pixel Watch 3, you should get at least a full day of usage on a single charge. Google's official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/13579780" target="_blank">support document</a> explains that the Pixel Watch 3's battery life will last up to 24 hours on a single charge with the always-on display turned on. The company tested battery life based on the median Pixel Watch user's usage habits, and with a mixture of talk, data, standby, and use of other features.</p><p>To get the most battery life out of your Pixel Watch 3, you'll want to enable Battery Saver. This setting will disable the always-on display and a few other features, but will keep tilt-to-wake active. In exchange, the Pixel Watch 3 will last up to 36 hours on a single charge. To turn on Battery Saver, tap the <strong>Settings app</strong> on your Pixel Watch 3, press <strong>Battery</strong>, and flip the <strong>Battery Saver</strong> toggle.</p><p>In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review#section-google-pixel-watch-3-battery-charging" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 3 review</a>, Android Central's resident wearable expert Michael Hicks consistently got up to 48 hours with fairly intensive use, including the always-on display and at least one activity tracked.</p>

<p>Other testers at Android Central had less stellar battery life experience, but still found the Pixel Watch 3 to last longer than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>. This could be partially related to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces">Wear OS 5's efficiency improvements</a>.</p><p>Charging speed will vary slightly between the Pixel Watch 3 (41mm) and the Pixel Watch 3 (45mm). The former has a 307mAh battery, while the latter has a 420mAh battery. It'll take the smaller Pixel Watch 3 about an hour to reach 100%, while the larger model takes 80 minutes to reach full capacity.</p><p>Battery life and charging was a significant downside of early Pixel Watch generations, and while it still isn't outstanding, the Pixel Watch 3 will last a full day on a single charge — even with heavy use — and charges relatively quickly.</p>

While these aren't the first AI features launched by Motorola, these new features under the Moto AI suite aim to help users navigate their lives by improving images and remembering/summarizing content on their devices.</p><p>Motorola phones have access to some of the best Google AI features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, but Moto AI is the company's own take on some popular features specific to Motorola phones. The features are actually built using Google's AI, including Google Cloud Vertex AI, Gemini, and Imagen, thanks to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/motorola-and-google-cloud-bring-generative-ai-to-new-razr-family-of-smartphones-302181887.html">multi-year partnership</a> between the two companies.</p><p>After teasing new features earlier this year, the Moto AI suite was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/moto-ai-open-beta-program">released in beta</a> on select devices in November 2024. Users can test out the latest features and provide Motorola with feedback to help the company improve its AI efforts.</p><p>Here's everything you need to know about the new Moto AI suite, including the various features and available devices.</p>

<p>While some Moto AI features are widely available across <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a>, the select capabilities part of the Moto AI suite are only available on select devices. As of November 2024, the suite is available for beta testing on the following smartphones:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Motorola Edge 50 Ultra</strong></li><li><strong>Motorola Razr Plus 2024</strong>/<strong>Razr 50 Ultra</strong></li><li><strong>Motorola Razr 2024</strong>/<strong>Razr 50</strong></li></ul>
<p>Motorola has not said if it will expand the availability of these features to more devices, although we can likely expect them on future models.</p><p>While the beta program is available globally, Moto AI features are only available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.</p>

<p>Similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, Moto AI is the backbone of a number of features found on Motorola phones. Some of these features are already available on some devices in an official capacity, including the following:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Magic Canvas</strong>: Lets users create images using a text-to-image generator that can be used as wallpapers.</li><li><strong>Style Sync</strong>: Generates a pattern that matches the color and style of images you take or upload.</li></ul>
<p>Moto AI also encompasses features used to enhance image capture on select devices. It powers the Photo Enhancement Engine on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, which improves photos by preserving RAW image data when enhancing an image after it's taken. It also improves stabilization and optimizes shutter speed for features like Action Shot, which allows users to take photos of fast-moving subjects with greater clarity.</p><p><u><strong>Moto AI beta features</strong></u></p>
<ul><li><strong>Catch Me Up</strong>: Moto AI will summarize missed calls and messages from <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging apps</a> like Google Messages, WhatsApp, Telegram, and more so that you can quickly understand the gist of what's happening in conversations you may have missed.</li><li><strong>Remember This</strong>: Save screenshots, notes, and images to your Journal with AI-generated summaries and object recognition technology so that you can recall them later.</li><li><strong>Pay Attention</strong>: Records conversations, then transcribes and summarizes them.</li></ul>

<p>As far as data and privacy, Motorola states that your personal data is saved on-device, but some of it may be shared with the cloud and "into an LLM," noting that the data is encrypted. Here, it will be processed to help generate summaries and descriptions, which will be sent back to the device where it is stored locally, privately, and securely.</p><p>Motorola ensures that the data is not saved in the cloud after it's processed and that it "will only retain your personal information as long as necessary to achieve proper performance of the product or service or other compelling purposes, and to securely delete personal data when those purposes of use have been satisfied."</p><p>You can visit Motorola's device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.motorola.com/hc/apps/privacy/motoai/en-us/">Privacy Statement</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-moto-ai-large-action-model"><span>Moto AI: Large Action Model</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jQV4BRQTfi8sEMHUzn3s5" name="Moto-AI-LAM-Uber-Lenovo-Tech-World-2024.jpg" alt="Moto AI features demonstrated on a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jQV4BRQTfi8sEMHUzn3s5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4036" height="2270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to the Moto AI features currently available, Motorola has also shown off its concept for what it's calling a "Large Action Model" or LAM. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">demonstrated at Lenovo Tech World 2024</a>, the LAM learns a user's behavior and preferences so that it can perform actions with very little input from the user.</p><p>For example, when prompted to order a coffee, the LAM will automatically locate a nearby coffee shop and go through the motions of ordering your preferred drink. The only input from the user will be to confirm the order. You can also prompt the LAM by telling it where you want to go, and it will order an Uber.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aDNuOvoXdww" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>For now, the LAM is just a proof of concept, and Motorola has not disclosed if or when it will launch on devices. Like the new suite of Moto AI features, we can probably expect this to land in beta before becoming more widely available.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-moto-ai-how-to-sign-up-for-the-beta"><span>Moto AI: How to sign up for the beta</span></h2>

Even as a smartphone reviewer, I'll admit it's been a while for me, as well, and the current thought is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-16-and-17-may-not-come-with-fantastic-new-features-heres-why">Android 16 and 17</a> might not change that much.</p>

<p>Enter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">Android XR</a>, the first new version of Android made for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> era. Google says it's built with Gemini at the core, enabling a brand new type of user interface that's driven entirely by the way you interact with Google's multimodal AI.</p><p>As you might have guessed, the XR in Android XR isn't some weird Roman numeral moniker. Rather, it stands for e<strong>X</strong>tended <strong>R</strong>eality and is a new spinoff of Android built to unify XR products — mainly smart glasses and VR headsets — under a new set of standards and tools. It's exactly how Android Auto is built for car infotainment systems, and Wear OS is built for smartwatches.</p><p>It's a huge opportunity for Google to take the reigns and bring technologies together that, so far, are all very different and often feature messy experiences. But is it too little too late for Google to be doing this? The company thinks otherwise, and Gemini is here to prove it.</p>
<h2 id="changing-the-ux-paradigm-again-2">Changing the UX paradigm...again</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF" name="android-xr-video-player-ui" alt="A look at the video player UI of Android XR running on a Samsung Project Moohan headset in mixed reality" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The field of XR is still exciting despite having popular consumer products on the market for a solid decade. Many of the existing UI design paradigms don't feel great in VR — using your laser pointer to select things just feels lazy — but UX designers have made significant headway on this portion of the experience in the last few years with things like hand tracking and eye tracking.</p><p>However, Google says a third method is required for truly natural and seamless interaction between the real and virtual worlds: an AI assistant. This is no secret since a multimodal AI assistant is exactly what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again">makes Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses so special</a>.</p><p>Meta even launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-news-recap-july-26-2024">Meta AI assistant on Meta Quest headsets</a> this summer, but Google aims to take this concept even further than Meta has, utilizing full hand tracking, eye tracking, and the voice assistant to make the UI feel as natural as possible.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google is unlocking the full power of Gemini by giving it the ability to see and hear the world around it, delivering context to you in a potential smart glasses form factor.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In one example, Google showed us a prototype pair of AR glasses that have a small screen in the lens, not too dissimilar to what the company launched with Google Glass in 2014. The big difference is that, with Gemini built in, the person wearing the glasses was able to have a conversation with the AI that helped them navigate a busy street without staring at their phone.</p><p>Gemini's full capabilities become unlocked with a product like this because it can see through the cameras on the glasses, hear your voice, and interact with you as if it were a human instead of a bunch of icons on a display. It takes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps-can-now-determine-your-precise-location-using-live-view-ar">existing AR features of Google Maps</a> and makes them make sense.</p><p>Holding up your phone and looking "through" its screen is fine enough, I suppose, but it also invites criminals to snatch your phone and is generally just kind of awkward. Whether it works as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta's Orion prototype</a> is anyone's best guess, but they sure do look nice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="DRPgjWYXCq5R2PqDAfeiqD" name="Glasses_Translate-google-android-xr" alt="Translating a sign using smart glasses powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DRPgjWYXCq5R2PqDAfeiqD.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Talking to Gemini in Android XR is more like talking to a person rather than a digital assistant because the answers aren't generic. They're extremely specific to what you're doing and what you need in the moment because it can hear and see what you see and hear.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It's an upgrade over what's currently provided on Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses because a screen is involved, allowing Gemini and Android XR to overlay virtual elements onto the real world.</p><p>On the VR side of the house, Android XR will enable more natural interactions with the virtual world as well as the real one, as seen in the previous example. This second example showed a person wearing a prototype Samsung VR headset (called Project Moohan) while watching YouTube.</p><p>Project Moohan is equipped with a Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 — that's a step up from the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 in the Quest 3 and 3S — and is set to debut in 2025 "with more devices to follow," per Qualcomm. It also looks incredibly sleek, giving off vibes from the über-expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-launch-sales-success">Apple Vision Pro</a> rather than Meta's more affordable Quest series.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.73%;"><img id="GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Side-render" alt="An official product render of Samsung's Project Moohan VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5120" height="2700" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The headset itself isn't the notable thing in this example, although it is Samsung's first VR headset since its HMD Odyssey headset in 2017. Rather, the way this person was interacting with the content onscreen was game-changing. Gemini is able to see and understand what's happening onscreen, meaning you can ask it <em>anything</em> and get a context-sensitive response.</p><p>Again, this is more like talking to a person rather than a digital assistant because the answers aren't generic.

<p>In this case, Google has some very good and some very bad things going for it. Let's get the bad out of the way first: Google has a bad habit of starting cool projects only to drop them a year or two later. The list of projects that have ended up like this is endless, and the problem is that several major AR/VR projects are included in that list. Google Daydream and Google Glass are chief among them.</p><p>Google beat Meta to the punch with a standalone VR headset it made in partnership with Lenovo, only to stop supporting it shortly after launch. The company told us it's been at the heart of XR development all along — and that's certainly true with these developments, Google Cardboard, AR Core, etc. — but people have lost faith in Google side projects like this because of failures like Stadia and others.</p><p>Nothing in the company's presentation told me that this could potentially be any different. If it does well, Android XR will go on to become like Wear OS and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a>, two extremely successful Android spinoff platforms that are used by millions of users every day. If it doesn't meet some internal goal within a year or two, who knows what'll happen, although we can all guess based on history.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Meta has charged through despite the investment into XR costing billions, and it has at least partially paid off because the company is the king of the entire umbrella category. The Meta Quest is by far the best-selling family of VR products ever, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> have blown the lid off the smart glasses market to pave the way to successful form factors and adoption.</p>

<p>But Meta isn't exactly loved by people, not just because of its Facebook lineage but because of its handling of developer relations over the years. Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/sherlocking-what-happens-when-big-tech-steals-your-ideas">has shamelessly Sherlocked</a> features from developers over the years — something Google, Apple, Microsoft, and basically every other big tech company is also guilty of — but it has also alienated developers who have nowhere else to turn to since Meta owns the VR market with an 80% market share.</p><p>Recent changes to the Meta Quest store have buried developers underneath a swath of cheap Gorilla Tag clones and promotion for Meta's own Horizon Worlds metaverse platform instead of propping up paid games that used to see more promotion on the digital storefront.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I've talked to many VR developers who are happy with the success they've seen from the Quest platform in the past but have been unhappy with how things have changed this year.

<p>This is where Google can improve and even win developers over with a new way of doing business. I've talked to many VR developers who are happy with the success they've seen from the Quest platform in the past but have been unhappy with how things have changed this year. It's these very people who can build apps for Google's new Android XR platform and potentially give it a win over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-nervous-about-meta-horizon-os">Meta's Horizon OS</a>.</p><p>In fact, Google and Qualcomm have been working with the folks over at Unity to provide full Android XR support in Unity 6, making it easier for developers to port their existing (and upcoming) games to Android XR with fairly minimal effort.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j" name="Headset_GooglePhotos-project-moohan-android-xr" alt="Running Google Photos in mixed reality on Samsung Project Moohan, powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest issue is that this Android XR announcement doesn't come with any hardware commitments. Instead, today's announcement teases Samsung and Qualcomm hardware partnerships — Google likens this to rebuilding Wear OS with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a> — but without a specific price and date for a product, it's hard to feel like Google is in this to win it.</p><p>Qualcomm and Google say they're working with Lynx, Sony, and Xreal to deliver more products in 2025, though, so it's possible that something actually will come of this whole effort this time around.</p><p>I'd like to have faith that Google and Samsung could pull this off — the bones of Android XR are sounding <em>extremely </em>promising — but Google's history of abandoned projects makes me more worried than hopeful right now. Stadia was a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy and I'm just not sure I'm ready to go through another one of those again.</p>
