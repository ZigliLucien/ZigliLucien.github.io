<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Android 15 is finally rolling out to Pixel phones soon and hitting other brands over the next few months.</li><li>The latest version of Android brings better media and camera features, like HDR management, improved audio, and low-light enhancements.</li><li>It also introduces “Private Space” for your apps, easier sign-ins with passkeys, and alerts if apps detect recording.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google announced today that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is finally out, and it’ll be rolling out to Pixel phones in the next few weeks and will reach other devices over the next few months.</p><p>With 2024 wrapping up, it’s no surprise that smartphone OS updates are rolling out. And with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series having made their debut last month, it makes total sense for Google to drop the final version of Android 15 now.</p><p>For Pixel users, that means the latest Android version will hit their phones in no time. Plus, Android 15 is now open-source on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), so other device makers can start bringing it to their devices too.</p><p>Android 15 promises to make things smoother for users, give developers better tools, and step up privacy and security. It also adds new features for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages.</p><p>The new Android version also upgrades your media and camera experiences. It lets you manage HDR settings to prevent SDR content from appearing washed out and adjusts audio levels for better sound. Low Light Boost improves previews and QR code scans in dim lighting, and you get finer control over flash intensity for perfect shots.</p><p>Android 15 also makes multitasking smoother with better large-screen support. You can now save split-screen app combinations and pin the taskbar. Plus, apps now default to an edge-to-edge display when targeting SDK 35 for a more immersive experience.</p><p>Privacy and security are still on Google&apos;s radar with Android 15. Now you get a “Private Space” for your secret apps, sign-ins are a breeze with passkeys, and apps will even give you a heads-up if they catch someone snooping.</p><p>Android 15 is playing nice with app compatibility too. Most changes are opt-in until apps update to SDK version 35, so developers have plenty of time to get their act together.</p><p>As mentioned previously, Android 15 is hitting Pixel devices in the next few weeks. After that, it&apos;ll start showing up on phones from Samsung, Honor, iQOO, Lenovo, Motorola, Nothing, OnePlus, OPPO, Realme, Sharp, Sony, TECNO, Vivo, and Xiaomi over the next few months.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out a few new Android updates to start September, such as music lookup for Circle to Search for on-device sounds and those from other sources.</li><li>Android's Earthquake Alert System arrives for all U.S. states alongside a Wear OS update that brings offline map viewing.</li><li>Google is also bolstering its accessibility feature, TalkBack, and bringing read-aloud functionality to Chrome.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>September kicks off with a handful of new Android features that build upon its experience and a pair of accessibility features.</p><p>To start, Google states that Circle to Search is getting a notable update that adds music lookup. Now, while you&apos;re watching a video, you can tap the new music note icon next to the search box. The AI will listen to the audio, and when it recognizes a song, it’ll show you all the details.</p><p>Google states <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a> can hear music playing directly on your device or from a nearby audio source.</p><p>The results the software displays will include the song&apos;s name and artist, and it will try to provide a YouTube video link.</p>

<p>For your safety, Android’s Earthquake Alert System is now available in every U.S. state. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-earthquake-alerts-expansion/">hopes to warn users</a> about an impending quake <em>before </em>it happens. This alert system piggybacks off crowd-sourced earthquake detection technology to get the job done.</p><p>In 2022, Google announced at I/O that it was expanding its earthquake warnings to several high-risk areas. Now, the alert system covers the entire U.S. You can also check out tips on what to do if you get an alert.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> preparing to arrive in consumer hands, Google is rolling out some new Maps features for Wear OS. The update brings offline map viewing for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>. If you’ve downloaded a map on your phone, you can access it directly from Google Maps on your wearable device.</p><p>Additionally, the feature brings voice search and the ability to "view your surroundings" by tapping your watch face.</p>

<p>Android&apos;s accessibility feature, TalkBack can now offer users a "detailed description" of an image. To do this, Google says the feature now leverages Gemini models on "supported devices" to get it done. The AI model is said to describe the contents of an image for low-vision or blind users.</p><p>Gemini in TalkBack supports photos in your camera roll, those received via text, product images from websites, and social media. Google is also expected to expand TalkBack&apos;s array of features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">for Android 15</a>.</p><p>Lastly, Chrome on Android picks up the ability to read what&apos;s listed on a webpage. Users can set how fast or slow the AI reads alongside a desired language and voice. Google states users can listen to full articles, recipes, and more.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>With smart rings steadily making their way into the mainstream, it makes sense for companies that normally build smartwatches to step into the ring, so to speak. We quite enjoy Amazfit smartwatches, and so we were naturally excited about the prospect of an Amazfit smart ring. However, this first attempt from the company feels very much like that, and not really in a good way.</p><p>With impressive smart rings like the Oura Ring and even those from relatively unknown companies like RingConn and Ultrahuman, the Amazfit Helio Ring feels like a product that has so much potential but fails to quite reach it. It has a number of rather obvious shortcomings while being one of the few smart rings on the market to throw a subscription in your face, even if the company says it&apos;s not necessary.</p><p>That&apos;s not to say there aren&apos;t things to like about the Amazfit Helio Ring, and the company has been adding new features in the time since its launch. The company also smartly leverages AI to merge data from its smartwatches to get a full look at your health and performance. However, the ring feels more like a beta product, and I&apos;m not sure the price tag really matches the value.</p>

<p>The Amazfit Helio Ring was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-launch-ces-2024">announced</a> in January 2024 but did not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-lands-in-us">go on sale in the U.S.</a> until May of the same year. The ring retails for $299, although it can be found at a discount at some retailers, going as low as $199.</p><p>The Helio Ring is available in one color and finish, although it can be purchased in three sizes: 8, 10, and 12.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="QenLxk5ptGPSR2bWpjc76P" name="Amazfit-Helio-Ring-review-11.jpg" alt="The Amazfit Helio Ring on a finger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QenLxk5ptGPSR2bWpjc76P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4036" height="2270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Amazfit Helio Ring may not be the thinnest, slimmest, or lightest smart ring on the market, but the overall design is simple and elegant. I rather like the feel and finish of the titanium alloy, especially with the textured top section that lets you know whether or not the ring is on the correct path. The brushed metal not only looks great, but it handles the trials and tribulations of daily life better than my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> or other smart rings that have options for glossy finishes, as they tend to scuff and scratch very easily. In my time with the Amazfit Helio Ring, I haven&apos;t had to worry about that, despite wearing it during workouts.</p><p>Additionally, neither the weight nor the thickness bothers me. Perhaps I&apos;ve gotten used to the feel of smart rings, but the Amazfit Helio Ring doesn&apos;t feel as heavy as it looks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v3Bv8aqRLQjcM4Vujvednh" name="Amazfit-Helio-Ring-review-06.jpg" alt="The Amazfit Helio Ring with the Zepp app on the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v3Bv8aqRLQjcM4Vujvednh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the actual ring, the Zepp companion app is also quite nice and has a very easy-to-use layout that you can customize to your liking. Each metric gets its own card, and they can be arranged in a way that makes sense for what you&apos;re focused on most; I keep my Readiness score at the top, followed by my workout history for a quick glance at my week, and then a Training Recovery Card, followed by other individual metrics.</p><p>The bottom has just four tabs for quick navigation to your sleep and workout data, as well as your profile. The latter option lets you view and add devices to the app if you have a smart ring and Amazfit smartwatch, and you can dive into each device to enable or disable health features and update the firmware. You can also quickly jump to each device in your app from the Home tab just by tapping their respective icon in the top left corner.</p><p>The app will inform you on how to wear the ring correctly, provide daily use tips, and more so that you can understand the ins and outs of using the ring. Additionally, you can set daily goals like target steps, weight, and sleep. The Zepp app also supports third-party app linking, with popular options like Strava and Adidas Running.</p>

<p>One feature that was added in August was a Find Device function, which will turn on the green LED to hopefully make the ring easier to find. This is a function I first saw on the Samsung Galaxy Ring, and I thought it was pretty genius since I have a tendency to misplace my smart rings. How helpful this is remains to be seen, but it&apos;s better than nothing (looking at you, Oura) since a ring can&apos;t exactly emit any audible sounds.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-amazfit-helio-ring-health-tracking"><span>Amazfit Helio Ring: Health tracking</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Rd6RoLiG5b52gpqoy2WLqL" name="Amazfit-Helio-Ring-review-07.jpg" alt="The Amazfit Helio Ring with the Zepp app on the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rd6RoLiG5b52gpqoy2WLqL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Health tracking is pretty standard on the Helio Ring. It has a PPG heart rate monitor, temperature sensor, and EDA sensor. It&apos;s capable of monitoring blood oxygen levels, stress, and menstrual cycles, which is par for the course when it comes to smart rings. That is to say, none of it&apos;s particularly groundbreaking, but it will give you the information you need.</p><p>Sleep tracking doesn&apos;t feel as detailed as what you&apos;d get on other rings, but I think that&apos;s largely because the information is presented in such a way that makes it easy to see how you slept. You get a sleep score based on the various factors, and so far it closely matches the scores I would get from my Oura Ring and Fitbit. You can also expand the sleep stages graph for a better visual representation of your total sleep time, or you can refer to the individual cards to see how long you were in each sleep stage.</p><p>In addition to heart rate variability, one interesting feature is the Sleep breathing quality, which is currently in beta and can help detect signs and symptoms related to sleep apnea. The Helio Ring will look out for and monitor the number of "episodes" you have during your sleep, which could be handy for people who suspect they may suffer from sleep apnea or are trying to track and lessen their symptoms.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="Q8RGyY5QmiXgoi4ZDgaq2T" name="Amazfit-Zepp-app-tabs.jpg" alt="The Zepp app, home, sleep, and workout" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q8RGyY5QmiXgoi4ZDgaq2T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Workout tracking is pretty basic, which is usually the case for smart rings since these are more focused on health and not exactly targeted for fitness use. However, there are several workouts you can track from the app when using just the Helio Ring, including running, walking, and cycling. I actually like that you can specify if you&apos;re running outside or on a treadmill, and the app will use your phone&apos;s GPS if it&apos;s the former.</p><p>That said, there&apos;s no way to actually track things like lifting weights, which I&apos;m more likely to do than go on a run. That&apos;s where a smartwatch comes in, and it&apos;s something Amazfit is counting on. The company is leveraging some useful AI techniques that will include and de-duplicate data added from an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch">Amazfit smartwatch</a> so that none of it overlaps. That way, you can track a workout on the watch and then track a run later with the ring (or wearing both), and the app will fuse the data.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zoDxAZjaukBRhhVhEUKbY3" name="Amazfit-Helio-Ring-review-13.jpg" alt="The Amazfit Helio Ring next to the T-Rex Pro and Razr Plus 2024 with the Zepp app open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zoDxAZjaukBRhhVhEUKbY3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, I spoke to Gregory Heard, product manager for the Helio Ring, about the differences between using a ring and watch when tracking data and whether one is "better" than another. He says that determining which is "better" sort of misses the point, and that they&apos;re meant to be used interchangably.</p><p>"Generally speaking, both rings and watches are great technologies for understanding your body, encouraging a healthy lifestyle, and tracking your athletic performance, both in real-time and over time," Heard told me in an email. "But they excel in different situations."</p><p>"Many people find watches uncomfortable for sleeping, but rings are a great for this. Conversely, a sports watch is much better for your workouts because it displays all your metrics during activity, and doesn’t have to be tethered to your phone for things like GPS tracking. We consider them different tools for different jobs."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="n4SQJGqqmXNSwdPksBkWDS" name="Amazfit-Zepp-app-workout-tracking.jpg" alt="Workout tracking in the Zepp app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n4SQJGqqmXNSwdPksBkWDS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a smart approach since it&apos;s how I&apos;ve found myself using smart rings. With Oura, the extra data comes from app integrations like Strava, which aren&apos;t always reliable or will duplicate data that the ring has already tracked itself, which I sometimes find frustrating.</p><p>For the purposes of the review, I wore the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazfit-t-rex-pro-review">Amazfit T-Rex Pro</a> for weightlifting and the ring for other things like running and sleeping, and I wasn&apos;t worried about any of the data being duplicated. I like that it even lets you choose which device to use to track your heart rate when you select the Helio-supported workouts.</p><p>Unfortunately, there&apos;s technically no automatic workout tracking, but the ring will log certain activities in your calorie card, which I find interesting. It will tell me if I was walking slow or fast, or if I was doing a light activity.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Helio Ring has many basic health-tracking features but misses out on some big ones or relies on a connected smartwatch to fill in the blanks.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As for step counting, the Helio Ring performed surprisingly well in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">multi-smartwatch/smart ring step test</a>, logging the fewest errors of any other device. There are times when I&apos;ve noticed it will deviate by a few hundred steps when compared to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a>, so I always caution that you should take smart ring step counts with a grain of salt, but overall, I find that it doesn&apos;t suffer as much from the phantom steps that my colleagues have complained about with other rings, where they will find thousands of steps logged while barely having moved during the day.</p><p>The ring has an Auto Emotions Monitor, which will check your emotional well-being throughout the day and help you understand your stress. It reminds me of a very similar feature on my Pixel Watch 2, but I haven&apos;t found this to be particularly useful, and I find it kind of stressful when an app tells me I&apos;m stressed.</p><p>All of this comes together to feed the Readiness score, which takes all your metrics into account to help you determine how best to tackle your day. Tapping on this card will provide you with insight into what contributed to your score and advice on what you can do to maintain it or take advantage of it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-amazfit-helio-ring-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Amazfit Helio Ring: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4198px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Jhyk8V558zFEMR53oK2BGY" name="Amazfit-Helio-Ring-review-05.jpg" alt="The Amazfit Helio Ring on the charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jhyk8V558zFEMR53oK2BGY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4198" height="2361" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, one of the Helio Ring&apos;s biggest downsides is its battery life. While many of the more popular models last seven days or more, the Helio Ring only lasts four days, and even that&apos;s not a given. Toggle on some of the health tracking features, and you&apos;ll be met with a warning that they will "greatly" or "significantly" reduce battery life.</p><p>Four days is much better than many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a>, particularly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">those running Wear OS</a>, but it&apos;s woefully behind other smart rings. Given its size, I&apos;m surprised Amazfit wasn&apos;t able to fit a larger battery into the ring.</p><p>Additionally, when it&apos;s time to charge the ring, the included charging puck is a bit frustrating to use. It&apos;s shaped largely like the one that comes with the Oura Ring, but the divots on the puck to fit the ring sensors make it annoyingly hard to just drop the ring on and charge. I find myself fiddling with it more often than now.</p><p>Another problem is that this ring is only available in three sizes, while other devices are offered in eight or nine sizes. That&apos;s one more than at launch, but it&apos;s extremely limited when smart rings are expected to have a certain fit to work properly. Those with smaller fingers may find themselves out of luck if they&apos;re looking to purchase a model, while those with larger fingers may find it difficult to get a proper fit on the recommended digits.</p><p>In addition, you only get one color and finish, so there isn&apos;t much in the way of selection when buying it. While I like the design, it would be nice to have a silver or rose gold option for anyone who doesn&apos;t care for the gold-esque Titanium color.</p><p>If Amazfit is hoping to sell a lot of these, it certainly doesn&apos;t show.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2310px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:118.61%;"><img id="eJ56iQZVFfZt9n63iRwu9U" name="Amazfit-Zepp-app-subsctiptions.jpg" alt="The Zepp app subscriptions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eJ56iQZVFfZt9n63iRwu9U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2310" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, while Amazfit highlights that there are "no subscriptions required," there are still subscriptions, and the app does a good job of hiding them and popping them up when you least expect it. Want deeper insights into your sleep or access to your weekly fitness report? Sign up for not one, but <em>two</em> different prescriptions. Even the AI chatbot Aura is limited in it functionality until you sign up.</p><p>It&apos;s quite clever to hide these subscriptions in the app, but while they&apos;re not necessary for most functions, it still feels quite disingenuous to have them when most other smart rings, aside from Oura, don&apos;t require subscriptions.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re in the market for a smart ring, there are quite a few to choose from, but the Oura Ring Gen 3 has pretty much set the standard. Despite launching in 2021 and being a bit rough around the edges, the ring has come a long way, adding more and more features throughout the years and essentially being the one to beat. That said, it does get expensive and can go for more than $500, depending on the finish you get. However, it&apos;s much more feature-rich and has a battery that will last about a week.</p><p>If you want something with even more battery life, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring</a> can last up to 12 days on a single charge and comes with a charging case. It also comes in more sizes and finishes, and it supports sleep apnea detection. Unfortunately, you won&apos;t find automatic workout tracking in any form, and there&apos;s no connection to smartwatches that the ring can take advantage of.</p><p>That&apos;s where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> comes in, which is the current newcomer in the smart ring space. While the ring is a bit more expensive and rough around the edges, it does come with the benefit of Galaxy AI and even has unique smartphone gestures that let you capture photos remotely or turn off alarms.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You own an Amazfit smartwatch</li><li>You may suffer from sleep apnea</li><li>You want a ring that will track your stress and emotions</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a smart ring with great battery life</li><li>You have smaller fingers</li><li>You won't own an Amazfit smartwatch</li></ul>
<p>Just like how some of the features are in beta, the Helio Ring itself feels like a beta product. There&apos;s no denying there&apos;s quite a bit of potential here with how the app combines data from a smartwatch to contribute to your Readiness score, but the device just falls behind on some of the most important aspects of a smart ring. Battery life is the biggest thing, and while it&apos;s not terrible, it&apos;s still behind the pack.</p><p>There also just isn&apos;t much choice when buying a Helio Ring, which makes me feel like little thought was put into making a smart ring. That&apos;s surprising, given the company&apos;s impressive lineup of smartwatches.</p><p>As a basic health tracker, the Amazfit Helio Ring gets many of the basics right with a durable design and a fairly accurate step counter. But for this price point, you&apos;d be better off just getting an Oura Ring or even a RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring. However, it may be worth a look if you can get the ring at a discount.</p>

This is an easy way to record your phone calls, but it&apos;s so much more than that. The feature uses AI to generate transcripts of your call and a summary of what you discussed so that you can recall what you talked about later. And the best part is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">it all happens on-device</a>, meaning your private calls remain out of Google&apos;s hands.</p><p>So how do you use Call Notes? And will the person on the other end know they&apos;re being recorded? Here&apos;s how you get started on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a>.</p>

<p>1. Open the <strong>Phone app</strong> and tap the <strong>three dots</strong> in the top right corner, then tap<strong> Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Call Notes</strong>.</p><p>3. Toggle the feature on if it isn&apos;t already.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-call-notes-to-record-and-transcribe-your-calls-2">How to use Call Notes to record and transcribe your calls</h2>
<p>1. Start a call. On your phone, tap the <strong>More</strong> button to expand the menu and tap <strong>Call Notes</strong>. An audible message will inform users on both ends that the call is being recorded.</p><p>2. When the call is over, go to the <strong>Recent</strong> tab in the phone app and tap the call you recorded (calls with AI summaries will have a small blue and purple paper icon next to them). When it is ready, a Call summary will appear in the expanded call entry. (Note: A call must be at least 30 seconds long for the feature to work.)</p><p>3. Tap <strong>View full transcript</strong> to view the Call summary and an AI-generated transcript of the call. You can also play back the call at the bottom of the screen. There are options to copy or send the Call summary or send the file for the recorded call audio.</p>

<p>Depending on the call, the AI-generated summary should include the following information:</p><p>Google notes that there may be inaccuracies or offensive language in the summary, although this is solely dependent on the nature of the call and "doesn&apos;t represent Google&apos;s views." The company also notes that by using the feature, you agree to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai">Generative AI Terms of Service</a> and recommends that users respect the privacy of others.</p><p>For now, Call Notes is only available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a>, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. If you&apos;re hoping to see it on some of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagships</a>, you&apos;re out of luck for now as it&apos;s an exclusive feature for the Pixel 9 family.</p>

<p><strong>Allan</strong> sent in a very detailed issue about Android&apos;s silly decision to remove a quick way to turn off Wi-Fi. The gist of it:</p><p><em><strong>I have an Android Auto WiFi dongle, which auto connects and everything is fine... BUT... when I leave the car and walk away the phone is still connected to the vehicle and the audio is in the car, not on the phone. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>How can I turn off the WiFi temporarily?</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Allan. You&apos;re experiencing something that a lot of people don&apos;t like about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">recent versions of Android</a>. It used to be you could find a quick settings toggle switch to shut off Wi-Fi completely and even place it as a home screen widget. Not anymore.</p><p>There is a way to fix it, but you&apos;re probably not going to like it. I know I don&apos;t because I like to drop a quick answer at the beginning of any explanation. Here it is: Tasker. But <em>not</em> the Tasker you&apos;ll find in the Play Store. I hope you&apos;re ready to get nerdy.</p>
<p>I don&apos;t know why Google changed the way Wi-Fi settings are displayed or why it decided to remove the easy way to shut it off. I&apos;ve been told that the current solution — hiding everything in a Network & Internet section of the settings — is a more elegant solution but I don&apos;t remember anyone asking for Wi-Fi settings to be made more elegant. Google does what Google does sometimes.</p><p>The bigger issue is that with API 29 Google also changed some rules about system settings and connections, making it so an app developer couldn&apos;t just create a switch to turn off Wi-Fi. You can still do it, but making a capable app means it can&apos;t be in the Play Store and it won&apos;t install the normal way.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="pFXYwcWGdmzHcqMGEqZbpU" name="android-12-beta-4-pixel-4-wifi-quick-panel.jpg" alt="Android 12 Beta 4 Pixel 4 Wifi Quick Panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pFXYwcWGdmzHcqMGEqZbpU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, the developer of Tasker has provided the source and an archived Android app that does exactly what you want. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/joaomgcd/TaskerSettings/releases/v1.2.0">Head here and grab the "Toggle Wifi" version of Tasker 1.2</a> and save it to a computer. Yes, you need a computer, too. Thanks, Google.</p><p>That&apos;s the easy part. The harder part is to set up your phone and a computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux all work fine) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.repeato.app/how-to-install-adb-without-the-full-android-sdk/">to use adb</a> (Android Debug Bridge). Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, you can&apos;t sideload apps built on depreciated SDK versions automatically, but you can force install them using the command line.</p>
<p>Once you have everything in order, run the following command:</p><p><strong>adb install —bypass-low-target-sdk-block TaskerSettings.apk</strong></p><p>You can then use Tasker normally and create a switch or routine to toggle Wi-Fi on and off.</p><p>Anytime someone online starts saying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are "better" because it&apos;s so customizable I remember that an app like Tasker has to exist and that Google does everything to keep you from doing what <em>you</em> want if it&apos;s not what <em>it </em>wants.</p>
<p>I know all of this is done with useability in mind. Google really doesn&apos;t want people to be able to easily install old versions of apps that might do unwanted and unintended things. I also know that there could be a switch on your phone in the developer tools section that makes bypasses the target SDK block setting.</p><p>Anyway, this terrible solution will work and you should be able to shut Wi-Fi down completely with a tap then reenable it with another right from your home screen once you&apos;ve done all the work. Good Luck!</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I&apos;ve realized that I am not a folding phone guy. I&apos;ll admit that they are something different and can see why some people want them but for me, they aren&apos;t something I need to buy. Which is odd because I want to be a flipping phone guy.</p><p>I dig the idea of a flip phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a>. For me, the design is 90% there and if things keep getting better every year it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-has-me-almost-ready-for-foldable">won&apos;t be long</a> before I break all of my own rules and spend too much money on one. All I need is for the screen to feel less plasticky and I&apos;m on it.</p>
<p>Seeing TECNO&apos;s concept for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">tri-fold Phantom Ultimate 2</a> made me realize exactly why I like one form factor over the other: a flip phone is a big phone that folds in half, while a folding phone is a big phone that unfolds to get bigger.</p><p>That sounds stupid, I know. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> is not a big phone compared to some of the monstrous things you can buy but it still has a sizable footprint. It was also really cheap and I love cheap things. It&apos;s not too big to carry around, so needing it to fold in half isn&apos;t something I worry about. Still, it&apos;d be cool if I could make it smaller when I put it in my pocket.</p>
<p>Take this idea to an unintentional conclusion and consider a tablet. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Tablets are really good</a> for some things; sitting around and watching videos or playing some goofy game is a great experience on a good tablet. Some people can be productive with one, too, even if I can&apos;t. The screen size makes all the difference.</p><p>One thing nobody does is stick a tablet in their pocket. I mean, if you have really big pockets, I guess you could, but I&apos;ve never seen it nor heard that it&apos;s a popular thing. That&apos;s because a tablet is just too big to fit. That 8-inch or 10-inch screen that&apos;s good at some things is not good at fitting into pockets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1534px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="MzK4y84jrrNu3pBnVBX5tF" name="TECNO-Phantom-Ultimate-2-unfolded.jpg" alt="TECNO Phantom Ultimate 2 unfolded" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MzK4y84jrrNu3pBnVBX5tF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1534" height="863" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Enter something like the TECNO Phantom Ultimate 2—or, really, any thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-executive-director-tri-fold-concept-image">tri-fold device</a>. I picked the Phantom because of its multi-position hinge and a single render that shows it looking like a laptop. It may have a SIM card slot and be able to make phone calls, but it looks like a helluva nice, thin tablet.</p><p>It&apos;s also one that folds up small and is easy to carry around. You wouldn&apos;t need to buy a fancy tablet sleeve and hold it in your hands all day or carry a tech-survival bag around. If you&apos;re doing all that, you can just grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-i-work-chromebook">Chromebook</a> or a laptop and have the bigger screen and a "real" keyboard. Those are thin, and many models fold over to act as a tablet, so it is a win-win.</p>
<p>Maybe I&apos;m missing something because for me carrying around a bag full of tech crap is easy—I just hook it to my wheelchair and don&apos;t notice it&apos;s there. But for most people, I see the allure of having a tablet-sized screen that folds up so it&apos;s easy to carry. The fact that it&apos;s also a phone and can send messages and make actual calls is a big plus, too.</p><p>I think that&apos;s what most people who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">buy a foldable</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Fold</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> want—a "tablet" that folds into a phone-sized package. When tri-fold phones eventually make it into stores I&apos;m guessing a lot of people will look at them in a new light.</p><p>Maybe even me.</p>

<p>With the Pixel 9 Pro now on sale, older Pixels have begun getting big price cuts making them more appealing than ever. The Pixel 7 Pro from 2022 can be found online for around $415, while the top-end 512GB variant is also just on the $500 mark. This makes it incredibly tempting and we wouldn&apos;t blame you if you added it to your cart, purely on impulse. But let&apos;s pause for a moment and think— is it worth buying the 7 Pro in 2024?</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro is easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> today, but so was the Pixel 7 Pro for the longest time. If you had to choose between the Pixel 9 Pro vs. Pixel 7 Pro today, which phone would be the wiser investment?</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-vs-pixel-7-pro-design-and-displays-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro vs. Pixel 7 Pro: Design and displays</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s5vuYtuHk2n3skN466b9P6" name="google-pixel-9-pro-obsidian-display-customize-lockscreen-01.jpg" alt="Customizing the lockscreen on a Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s5vuYtuHk2n3skN466b9P6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a stark difference in design between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and 7 Pro. For a two-year-old model, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a> is still a looker, and I still love the sloping soft edges around the frame and corners. The design is premium, yet subtle. Google went for a sharper and more in-your-face look for the 9 Pro, which I also find really cool. The frame is now flat all around, making it feel more like an iPhone. The new island-style visor on the back for the camera looks futuristic and will be instantly recognizable as a 9-series phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="facKE3u5TaXFrFwXWpMU8R" name="Google-Search-Pixel-7-Pro-01.jpg" alt="Google Search page on a Google Pixel 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/facKE3u5TaXFrFwXWpMU8R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a big difference in the dimensions between the two phones, and that&apos;s because the Pixel 9 Pro is smaller this time around. The 7 Pro&apos;s equivalent would actually be the pricier 9 Pro XL, in terms of size. The Pixel 9 Pro now has a 6.3-inch display, the same as the Pixel 7, but the display specs are that of a true Pro Pixel phone. It&apos;s a Super Actua OLED panel with a 2,856x1,280 resolution, 1-120Hz variable refresh rate, and a peak brightness of up to 3,000 nits.</p><p>The Pixel 7 Pro has a larger 6.7-inch LTPO OLED with a 1,440 x 1,320 resolution, a 1-120Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of up to 1,500 nits. It&apos;s a bit thicker than the 9 Pro at 8.9mm and heavier too at 212g. Both models are IP68-rated for robust dust and water resistance.</p>

<p>If I had to choose between the two purely based on design and size, my vote would go with the Pixel 9 Pro. I love the new bold look, vibrant colors, and the fact that it&apos;s easier to slip into a pocket or use with one hand.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="y93H3D4cqy23Y9spCfaLyJ" name="google-pixel-7-pro-review-7.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 7 Pro back view straight on angle against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y93H3D4cqy23Y9spCfaLyJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999, which is the same as last year&apos;s 8 Pro. It&apos;s a shame though that you still get just 128GB of base storage. Similar to the past trends, $100 more will get you 256GB, the 512GB variant is priced at $1,219, and there&apos;s a 1TB variant (only in Obsidian) now for $1,449. Discounts are a bit slim since it&apos;s a new release, but we should see some offers during Black Friday. The good thing is that 16GB of RAM is standard on the 9 Pro.</p><p>The Pixel 7 Pro is sold at full price on Google&apos;s online store, which is silly, but you&apos;ll find good deals at other retailers. Amazon, for instance, has the 512GB of the 7 Pro listed for just $500, which is a crazy-good price. The amount of RAM is 12GB on this model.</p><p>One of the biggest differences between the two phones is the processor. The Pixel 7 Pro uses the Tensor G2, while the 9 Pro uses the latest Tensor G4. The new processor is definitely a step up compared to the G2. In our experience, we found that the thermals are a lot better compared to the G3. Raw performance is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">still lacking though</a> when compared to the latest and greatest from Qualcomm. If you&apos;re into playing visually intensive games, neither of these Pixels is really cut out for the job.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="37ktKyhTBMCpTz4YZyCttZ" name="google-pixel-9-pro-thinborne-case-01.jpg" alt="A Google Pixel 9 Pro in a Thinborne aramid fiber case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/37ktKyhTBMCpTz4YZyCttZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones promise more than 24 hours of battery life, which I believe is possible despite the difference in battery capacities. The Pixel 7 Pro has a larger 5,000mAh battery which managed to last one full day when we reviewed it. We&apos;ve been getting good battery life from the Pixel 9 Pro too in our ongoing review, despite it having a 4,700mAh capacity. We believe the more power-efficient Tensor SoC is responsible for this. Google also claims to deliver up to 100 hours of battery life if you use the Extreme Battery Saver mode (up to 72 hours with the 7 Pro).</p><p>Charging speeds are also slightly better with the Pixel 9 Pro. Using a compatible PPS charger, the 9 Pro can charge at 27W, compared to 23W with the 7 Pro. Interestingly, wireless charging speeds are similar on both phones using the Pixel Stand (2nd Gen) charger. The 9 Pro only charges at up to 21W wirelessly while the 7 Pro supports up to 23W wirelessly with Google&apos;s own charging stand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-stand-2nd-gen-charger-review">Pixel Stand (2nd Gen)</a>. If you use any other Qi wireless charger, speeds are capped at 12W for both phones.</p>

<p>Pixel phones rarely miss when it comes to image quality, but the newer sensor specs of the Pixel 9 Pro should give it an edge over the 7 Pro when it comes to finer details. Both phones have a 50MP main camera, but the 9 Pro has a wider f/1.68 aperture vs. the f/1.85 aperture on the 7 Pro. The ultrawide gets a big boost in the 9 Pro thanks to the 48MP sensor and f/1.7 aperture. The 7 Pro uses a 12MP sensor with a narrower aperture, but it has a wider field of view. Both sensors have autofocus. The telephoto camera is also 48MP with 5x optical zoom on both phones, but the 9 Pro gets a f/2.8 aperture (vs. f/3.5).</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro takes the video capabilities up a notch with 8K at 30fps support, versus just 4K at 60fps on the 7 Pro. It&apos;s a cool feature to brag about, but not sure many would actually choose to shoot at 8K. The selfie camera gets a major upgrade on the 9 Pro as well, with a 42MP sensor compared to the 10.8MP one on the 7 Pro.</p>

<p>Hardware has always played second fiddle in Pixel phones, and it&apos;s no different today. What really sets the Pixel 9 Pro apart are the new AI features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">&apos;Add me&apos;</a>, which is currently exclusive to the 9 series. That, and the fact that it will be getting seven years of OS upgrades and security patches. Sadly, the Pixel 7 Pro only has a three-year commitment for OS upgrades, which means it won&apos;t get anything beyond October 2025. Security patches will still come through till October 2027.</p><p>Considering how Google is constantly making the Pixel experience better via new feature additions through monthly Pixel Drop updates, you&apos;ll ideally want something that&apos;s supported for at least a couple of years. This could also be one of the reasons for the big discounts on the 7 Pro (apart from wanting to clear stocks).</p>

<p>As much as I want to recommend the Pixel 7 Pro at its current discounted prices, the Pixel 9 Pro is the more sensible buy for the long run. You&apos;ll be paying a steep premium upfront for sure, but you&apos;re set for the next seven years for updates (if you&apos;ll even be using it that long). That&apos;s the kind of peace of mind that I can live with. I&apos;m sure next year&apos;s Pixel series will have features exclusive to it, but those will eventually trickle down to the 9 series.</p><p>The one thing about 9 Pro is that you&apos;ll have to settle for a smaller screen. If you&apos;ve been wanting just that, then great, else the 9 Pro XL is what you&apos;ll want if you need a larger display like the 7 Pro. The Pixel 8 Pro is worth considering if you can find a good deal, but it&apos;s not as compact as the 9 Pro.</p><p>You should only consider the Pixel 7 Pro if you plan on upgrading after a year or two, and are not into gaming all that much. It&apos;s a steal at its current discounted price, and you should grab it before it&apos;s gone. It&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phone</a> under $500 right now, other than the Pixel 8a.</p>

While there are plenty of changes to be found across the board, there is still a lot to be concerned about Google&apos;s plans for its future foldable phones. </p><p>That being said, Google marched forward, seemingly committed to offering an alternative option to Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Fold line. Considering that the options in North America are already slim, I&apos;m happy to see the 9 Pro Fold hit the market, even if it looked exactly like the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. </p><p>Thankfully, that&apos;s not the case here, as Google went back to the drawing board, and not just for the design. There are a bunch of new software features that you&apos;ll only find on Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, all aiming to provide the best Pixel experience that money can buy. </p><p>At the time of this writing, I&apos;ve only had the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in my possession for less than a week, so I haven&apos;t had enough time to come to a final conclusion.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold was announced at the Made by Google event on August 13, 2024 alongside the rest of the Pixel 9 lineup, Pixel Buds Pro 2, and Pixel Watch 3. There are only two configurations available, as the 9 Pro Fold comes with either 256GB or 512GB of storage. These arrive with a price of $1,799 or $1,919, respectively. </p><p>Regardless of which storage option to choose from, everything else about the device remains the same. This includes featuring 16GB of RAM across both configurations. Additionally, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes in two colors, as you can get Google&apos;s latest foldable in Obsidian or Porcelain.</p>

<p>Going into the year, I wasn&apos;t exactly sure whether Google even had plans to release a successor to the Pixel Fold. Part of it was because of how divisive the company&apos;s first foldable phone was. On the one hand, it was great to see Google take this new form factor more seriously. On the other, it almost felt like the Pixel Fold was already out of style.</p><p>As I&apos;ve spent more time with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it continues to blow my mind that this phone comes from the same company. It&apos;s sleek, svelte, relatively lightweight, and is everything that I wanted from the original Pixel Fold.</p><p>Google seems to be laser-focused on creating the thinnest* foldable. Really, it&apos;s just that Google wants something that can help it stand out from the crowd here in North America. Even with reports claiming that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is falling short of expectations, it&apos;s still Samsung&apos;s world that we&apos;re living in. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="vG6w5MfXJNJJ5JKfCZYKmU" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-19.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold using Maps in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vG6w5MfXJNJJ5JKfCZYKmU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That being said, the 9 Pro Fold is a <em>huge</em> step in the right direction. The cover screen is small and wide enough to rely on it more than I anticipated. It&apos;s a "problem" that I had with the original Pixel Fold, along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, as I just don&apos;t find myself unfolding it as frequently as I did with the Fold 6. </p><p>In reality, it&apos;s not <em>actually</em> a problem; it&apos;s just something that I find funny. The best way I can think of to explain this is that the Fold 6 entices you to open it whenever you want to do something more than turn on some lights or respond to a text. whereas the 9 Pro Fold aims to provide a traditional phone experience with the added bonus of offering a larger screen if you want it.</p><p>Speaking to that larger screen, I really just don&apos;t find myself using it all that often, unless I want to play a game or need to do some split-screen multitasking. Well, there is one other reason, but I&apos;ll get to that in a bit. </p><p>That&apos;s not to say that the inner screen is bad, as that couldn&apos;t be further from the truth. You won&apos;t find headlines about the 9 Pro Fold not being able to fold flat or that the crease feels like you&apos;re running your finger across a canyon. It&apos;s just about as perfect as it can get, at least compared to other foldable phones that I&apos;ve used and tested.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, Google&apos;s Tensor series of chips would be able to rival Qualcomm, but we&apos;re simply not there yet. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> in the Pixel 9 lineup doesn&apos;t offer a lot in the way of overly meaningful improvements compared to the G3. Instead, Google opted for the "safe" approach of optimizing it for better battery life and for Gemini. </p><p>Sure, I wish this weren&apos;t the case and that Google was able to really take the battle to Samsung and Qualcomm. But, seeing as this is the hand we&apos;ve been dealt, there&apos;s really not much I&apos;ve found to complain about. Day-to-day tasks are a breeze, battery life lasts all day, and I can play most of the games I want to. </p><p>The only exception to this, that I&apos;ve found so far, is that I haven&apos;t been able to use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">Switch emulator</a>. However, part of this is likely due to the drivers not being compatible with the emulators I&apos;m using. </p><p>It could also just be the emulators themselves, as I haven&apos;t run into any other problems when using the 9 Pro Fold as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">portable retro handheld</a>. Still, it&apos;s rather curious seeing as every other Android phone and handheld I have is able to at least boot into a game, whereas I can&apos;t even make it that far with the 9 Pro Fold. </p>

<p>Something else I&apos;ve noticed about using the phone for multitasking is that Google might have the best split-screen experience on the market. Because of the changes to the design, using two apps side-by-side is basically the same as if you were holding a Pixel 9 Pro in either hand. </p><p>I haven&apos;t found any issues with apps scaling, save for 1Password which still doesn&apos;t seem to know how to handle larger screens that aren&apos;t tablets. It&apos;s really getting to the point that I&apos;m considering making the switch to a different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-password-managers-android">password manager</a> entirely, just because of how frustrating it is.</p><p>Presumably, that was at least part of why the decision to overhaul the design was made. Of course, it&apos;s not the entire story, but I&apos;ve honesty been appreciating and enjoying this way of multitasking. Sure, there are times that I want the more robust options offered by the Fold 6. But, it doesn&apos;t take much to get overwhelmed with trying to place your app windows in the "correct" locations.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of what we do, I actually my review unit actually arrived while I was vacationing at the beach with my family. This meant trying to take as many pictures as possible whenever I could. Many of the best pictures were taken by my wife with her iPhone, but I found one unexpected benefit of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. </p><p>Seeing as my son is just about to be seven months old, he&apos;s only now starting to become more mobile. So I don&apos;t have to worry all that much about blurry pictures while he&apos;s playing with toys on the floor. However, something that we do struggle with is getting him to actually look at the camera. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ig2feRhJcB7YDn6fLWTRMM" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-made-you-look.jpg" alt="Made You Look on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ig2feRhJcB7YDn6fLWTRMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Enter "Made You Look." </p><p>This isn&apos;t a new Android feature, as Android Central&apos;s managing editor Derrek Lee pointed out to me. A similar feature, called "Camera Cartoon" was already available for phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a>. However, "Made You Look" quickly became my favorite feature on the 9 Pro Fold. </p><p>After a few moments of switching between the four different "faces" to see how he would react, I was finally able to get a smile out of him. Arguably just as important, he was actually looking at the camera, as opposed to trying to look at the people walking around the restaurant. </p><p>This turned out to be yet another feather in the cap of why foldable phones can be more versatile than slabs. Not to mention that I&apos;m even more excited to take pictures since I have a better chance of getting a smirk or smile. </p>

<p>The biggest competition for Google is still the Galaxy Z Fold 6. That might be a different story if the OnePlus Open were available from carriers, but alas, it&apos;s not. Samsung still owns the foldable space in North America, and for good reason. Not only is the software experience refined, but you also have the option to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-support-stylus-input">use a stylus</a> with the S Pen. </p><p>Ignoring carrier availability, I would argue that the OnePlus Open provides even stiffer competition than Samsung. Both the Open and 9 Pro Fold offer similar designs, seeing as both devices have cover screens that align better with traditional smartphones. While Open might have better camera hardware, Google still leads the way in image processing. </p>

<p>You probably made it this far and are wondering about all of Google&apos;s other features. Like, how does <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a> perform? What about the photo and video options besides Made You Look? Well, as I stated initially, I&apos;ve only had the 9 Pro Fold for a few days, so I haven&apos;t yet had enough time to put everything through its paces.</p><p>The AI features are only a part of the story, and despite Google leaning more heavily into Gemini, there&apos;s a lot more going on here. I plan to put the new Desktop Mode through its paces, along with trying to see how hard I can push the Tensor G4 before and how it stacks up to the competition. So be sure to keep an eye out, as I&apos;ll be updating this review in the coming weeks. </p>

The Cardio Load score gives you more points for "longer and more strenuous activity," based on both logged workouts and casual, untracked activities. You'll be warned if you're over or undertraining, based on your Cardio Load history.</p>
<p><strong>Target Load</strong> is auto-generated after wearing the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> for 14 days. With this data, it tells you whether your current Cardio Load is above or below where it "should" be to "optimize performance, reduce injury risk, and balance recovery." Overtraining or bad sleep will push your Target Load window lower; long rest or slacking on your workouts will move it higher.</p></article></section>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="mGLzjZMRguzt5mXNtbL5EY" name="google-pixel-watch-3-morning-brief-exercise.jpg" alt="Exercise days in Morning Brief on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mGLzjZMRguzt5mXNtbL5EY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google gave us a glimpse of the new Fitbit Cardio Load, Target Load, and Daily Readiness scores at our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3 hands-on</a> at the Made by Google event. We have the photos above and below to show what they&apos;ll look like on the Pixel Watch 3 and the Fitbit app, along with Google&apos;s description of how they&apos;ll work. Once I can review it for myself, I&apos;ll share more concrete details.</p><p>To get Cardio Load, you only need to wear your Pixel Watch 3; the Fitbit app will then "instantly" show a Cardio Load score based on your activity, and your score will grow after workouts. Google has also confirmed that it will "soon" come to all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">Fitbit devices</a> and users, not just the Pixel Watch series.</p><p>Google uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803105725580">training impulse (TRIMP) method</a> to calculate your Cardio Load. Basically, you get a score based on how long you had an elevated heart rate and which heart rate zone you reached, relative to your body&apos;s maximum heart rate and heart rate reserve.</p><p>Different fitness brands calculate training load using their own methods, but generally speaking, you multiply the duration by your body&apos;s relative HR zone; for instance, 60 minutes in HR in Zone 3 might equal about 180 Cardio Load. The number itself is arbitrary; it&apos;s all about hitting an attainable score for your body&apos;s fitness, and then slowly increasing that number.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="o7JXfP3syzrv9LqmuykoRn" name="google-pixel-watch-3-custom-run-activity-2.jpg" alt="Custom Run Activity on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o7JXfP3syzrv9LqmuykoRn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;ll get most of your Cardio Load from workouts, but Google also specifies that you&apos;ll get some points whenever your heart rate elevates above the norm (like ten unlogged minutes walking the dog or carrying something heavy at home).</p><p>Fitbit will measure how much daily, weekly, and four-week Cardio Load it expects you to attain to stay on track. In the Fitbit app photo above, you can see how the hypothetical athlete ran more than average that day but is "at risk of undertraining" because they hadn&apos;t worked out for the seven days prior. Google calls that bar graph your Training Status, and it&apos;s where your Cardio Load is put into context against past weeks.</p><p>Essentially, Fitbit&apos;s Cardio Load is a long-term training metric that puts less emphasis on hitting your Active Zone Minutes <em>every day</em> and more on recovery and context.</p>
<h2 id="how-fitbit-target-load-works-2">How Fitbit Target Load works</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="sLkyDEujbGwJJKYeMt7nUW" name="google-pixel-watch-3-readiness-score.jpg" alt="Morning Brief Readiness Score on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sLkyDEujbGwJJKYeMt7nUW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fitbit Target Load is the brand&apos;s auto-generated, daily personalized target "based on your recent Cardio Load and your Readiness." To calculate it, Google says you must "wear your watch continuously" for 14 days, so you need to faithfully wear it for sleep tracking before Google&apos;s algorithm will generate a Target Load.</p><p>Google calculates your Daily Readiness based on your sleep duration, resting heart rate (RHR), and heart rate variability (HRV), as these all dictate how well your body recovers after workouts. The higher your body&apos;s Daily Readiness, the higher the Fitbit app will push your Target Load for the day; the reverse also applies if you don&apos;t sleep well or high HRV signals that your body is still tired out.</p><p>Once Google understands your body well enough, you&apos;ll see your Cardio and Target Load on the Readiness & Load tile on your watch, or in the Fitbit Today tab if you choose "Build Cardio Fitness" as your "focus." It also appears in the watch&apos;s daily Morning Brief, as you can see in the photo above.</p><p>So, what do you do with this information? Google will create "AI-powered daily run recommendations" based on your Target Load and recent runs that will theoretically help you hit your Load goal without overtraining. Unfortunately, unlike the free Target Load score, these recs require a Fitbit Premium subscription. Without it, you&apos;ll have to make your own workouts and check afterwards what kind of load it generates.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&apos;m excited to put these tools to the test, particularly Cardio Load. While Target Load sounds very useful and dynamic, I&apos;m not someone who likes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">wearing a smartwatch to bed every night</a>, and I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll be able to do so for two weeks. Thankfully, it doesn&apos;t matter too much because Cardio Load will still tell you if you&apos;re over- or undertraining without sleep data, based on your past training history.</p><p>If these tools work well, that could help make the Pixel Watch 3 one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness watches</a> on the market. We typically only see training load on specialized brands like Garmin, Coros, and Polar; to get it on a proper Wear OS watch is an exciting development.</p>

<ul><li>Xiaomi 14T and 14T Pro are the next upcoming phones from the company, which are likely to launch soon in Europe.</li><li>The standard model is likely to be powered by the Dimensity 8300 Ultra and the Xiaomi 14T Pro may come with the Dimensity 9300 Plus.</li><li>Both are tipped to be coming in three color options. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It is that time of year when we expect a bunch of products from Xiaomi to launch, including phones like the Xiaomi 14T and the Xiaomi 14T Pro. A new leak reveals most of the specs and pricing of the upcoming phones.</p><p>The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-les-prix-et-caracteristiques-des-xiaomi-14t-et-14t-pro-a-paraitre-bientot-59091">Dealabs magazine</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_14t_and_14t_pro_mega_leak_reveals_full_specs_and_prices-news-64353.php">GSMArena</a>) and indicates that the Xiaomi 14T and the Xiaomi 14T Pro are debuting soon in the European region. They will follow in the footsteps of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-13t-series-announced">Xiaomi 13T series</a>, which were announced in Berlin last September. </p>
<p>New information from the outlet indicates that Xiaomi will be offering one configuration for each model. The former is said to feature 12GB of RAM coupled with 256GB of storage and come in Titanium Black, Gray, and Blue color options. Meanwhile, the Xiaomi 14T Pro could come with the same RAM and 512GB of onboard storage and may also be available in the same colorways as the standard model.</p><p>The Xiaomi 14T Pro is tipped to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">Dimensity 9300 Plus</a>, and the standard variant might ship with a Dimensity 8300 Ultra SoC.</p><p>The rest of the specs are also out for the Xiaomi 14T and its Pro variant. Per the publication, both devices have 6.67-inch AMOLED displays with 144Hz refresh rates. Both are also tipped to have a triple camera system, and as seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, they&apos;re likely to also be backed by Leica.</p><p>The Xiaomi 14T may use a 50MP IMX906 sensor coupled with another 50MP telephoto lens and a 12MP ultrawide-angle lens. The Xiaomi 14T Pro might also use a 50MP sensor, but it is a Light Fusion 900 sensor paired with the same 50MP telephoto and 12MP ultrawide-angle lens. For selfies, these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are said to carry a 32MP sensor on the front.</p>

<p>Both variants will supposedly pack the same 5000mAh battery capacity that supports 50W wireless charging for the Pro model; the wireless charging support for the standard variant, however, is yet to be determined. Other similarities include an IP68 rating, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, Bluetooth 5.4, and NFC.</p><p>As for pricing, the leak indicates that the Xiaomi 14T will cost €649, and the Xiaomi 14T Pro costs €899.</p>
