The Google Pixel 8 Pro—which still remains a powerhouse despite having been succeeded by a newer model—can be yours for a mere $599.99 if you buy one during Amazon&apos;s Prime Big Deal Days sale. It&apos;s a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGT9MH6F" target="_blank"><strong>40% discount</strong></a><strong> </strong>that drops the last-gen Google flagship—which usually retails for $999.99—to its lowest price ever.</p>

<p>Even though Google's Pixel 8 Pro is already an easy recommendation for just about anyone, the fact that you buy it at 40% off makes this thing an absolute steal.</p>
<p>Powered by Google's very own Tensor G3 SoC, the Pixel 8 Pro comes with 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of onboard storage. This hardware allows it to make quick work of even the most demanding of tasks with little to no effort. The 6.7-inch LTPO AMOLED panel is a sight to behold, and you get an incredible triple-lens rear camera setup too. Add to that up to seven years of guaranteed OS and security updates, and this is a smartphone that's truly future-proof.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGT9MH6F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="85043c22-01ae-4fd1-b69e-c7985c1e77ac" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> you want a feature-packed Android smartphone with amazing cameras, long software support, and plenty of AI-powered tools to play around with.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> you play a lot of games on your smartphone, or if you prefer the squared-off design of the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>It may no longer be the newest thing in town but make no mistake about it, Google&apos;s Pixel 8 Pro is still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> you can buy. From top-of-the-line hardware to feature-laden software, it offers a laundry list of goodies. And of course, the overall design and build quality are arguably the finest in the business.</p><p>Gracing the front panel of the Pixel 8 Pro is a stunning 6.7-inch &apos;Super Actua&apos; display, complete with a resolution of 1344x2992 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate. The phone is powered by Google&apos;s custom Tensor G3 chipset, and comes with 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of internal storage. Even though Android Central&apos;s Nicholas Sutrich found the gaming performance to be a bit lacking in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review" target="_blank">his review</a>, there are no issues when it comes to everyday usage.</p><p>The software experience is top-notch, and you get a wide variety of genuinely useful tools and AI-based features (e.g., Call Screening, Magic Editor) as well. Google Pixel 8 Pro runs Android 14 and is guaranteed to receive up to seven years of major OS and security updates, so this is smartphone you&apos;ll be able to use for years to come. Then there&apos;s the triple-lens camera system, which as expected from a Pixel, captures some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review" target="_blank">incredible photos and videos</a>. All modern connectivity and I/O options—from Wi-Fi 7 to USB Type-C 3.2—are included in the mix. Rounding off everything is a 5,050mAh battery with support for up to 30W/23W (wired/wireless) charging.</p><p>While all that&apos;s great, the Google Pixel 8 Pro does have a few shortcomings too. The gaming performance, as mentioned before, leaves a lot to be desired, and charging speeds are unimpressive. However, for a smartphone that gets so much right, these niggles can be ignored.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-series-launch">Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ was launched only a year ago</a> back in October 2023. comes with expandable storage in the form of a microSD slot. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> also sports four stereo speakers for loud and crisp audio. It isn&apos;t the most powerful tab in the world, but it&apos;s definitely good enough for everyday moderate use.</p><p>Camera specs are so-so, with an 8MP main camera and a 5MP selfie snapper. A device like this isn&apos;t made for photography, however, so you can let that slide. It comes with Android 13 out of the box, which can be upgraded to Android 14 right away. Samsung&apos;s tablet OS lets you use multiple windows, which is great for productivity.</p><p>The 15W charging speed is nothing to write home about, but the battery is generous, to say the least. You get a gigantic 7,040mAh cell in the Galaxy Tab A9+. This should easily last you a few days with light use. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is a great starter tablet for kids or teenagers.</p>

Among them is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5PFR7DK" target="_blank"><strong>Moto G Stylus 5G (2024), which Amazon has brought back to its lowest price ever with a 38% discount</strong></a>. </p><p>This is Motorola&apos;s best offering for those who want a stylus, though it comes at a significantly lower price point than many of its premium-level competitors. It comes with a beautiful 120Hz OLED display, solid camera performance, and more than a day of battery life. Plus, get 256GB of memory, 8GB of RAM, and a beautiful vegan leather backing that users really like.</p>

<p>This year's Moto G Stylus 5G comes with a comfortable vegan leather backing that makes it feel like a premium phone, and 38% off its already-affordable price is a certified good deal. It comes with 256GB of storage, and it offers a long battery life with quick 30W wired charging.</p>
<p>Overall, we could describe the theme of the Moto G Stylus 5G as "better than its price point," and this October Prime Day has made that more accurate than ever.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1ZFS9GH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4057a830-dcfb-41f9-a1ef-b7dd9791715d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones#section-best-stylus-phone">best stylus phones</a> out there at an economy-level price point; you prefer a phone with a soft, comfortable backing like the Stylus 5G&apos;s vegan leather back; battery life is a majority priority for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;d rather spend more money to upgrade to a phone compatible with a better stylus, or wait for Motorola to hopefully release one; you need something with more than one OS update.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G (2024)</a> is a pretty solid phone for under $400 (in this case, far under $400), coming with a basic stylus that casual users really enjoy. But the things that make this phone so strong for its low price are the comfortable-to-hold vegan leather backing, its impressive 6.7-inch 120Hz OLED display, and its battery life that can easily make it over a day.</p><p>To be sure, some are critical that Motorola hasn&apos;t released a better stylus, as this one doesn&apos;t include some of the more high-performance features found in competitors, such as the Samsung S Pen&apos;s Bluetooth remote capture, pressure, and angle sensitivity levels. Still, it also comes for free with the phone, which can only be said of Samsung&apos;s premium S24 Ultra, so take that for what it&apos;s worth.</p>

<p>The Bose QuietComfort headphones are known for their excellent ANC performance, sound quality, and premium price. The latter doesn't apply for the next two days as you can get it for a stupidly-low price of $199 during Amazon's October Prime Day sale. That's a massive 43% discount, which we haven't seen yet for these headphones.</p>
<p>The QuietComfort headphones promise up to 24 hours of battery life on one charge, very good active noise cancellation performance, solid audio quality, and a transparency mode.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4Z9BZV2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c5943c13-6676-4ea2-ac9d-f6431d65c671" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$349" data-dimension48="$349">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> you need excellent noise cancellation; you want a lightweight and comfortable fit; you need good battery life.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>you need headphones with auto-pause/play sensors; you want a fresh looking design; you need spatial audio support.</p><p>If you&apos;ve been following the premium ANC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones">headphone</a> space, then the Bose QuietComfort headphones look like something straight out of 2015. That&apos;s because Bose has reused the same classic design (with some tweaks) it once had for its flagship model. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-headphones-earbuds-launch">Launched in 2023</a>, this $349 pair of headphones was a hard sell but for $199, we have no trouble recommending them. If you just want a light and comfortable pair of ANC headphones that do what they were made for well, the QuietComfort headphones are the ones to get in this Prime Day deal. </p><p>According to Bose, the QuietComfort is the successor to the QuietComfort 45 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a>. The QuietComfort Ultra is the new flagship which gets additional sensors for wear detection, multiple listening modes, and new tech like Bose Immersive Audio and CustomTune. If you were going to spend $349 on the QuietComfort to begin with, you might as well put that money on the Ultra, which is selling for that exact price during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">Prime Day</a>.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need NAS drives with long-term reliability in mind. I used two dozen IronWolf drives in the last ten years, and haven&apos;t had an issue with any. Most of these drives have clocked over 36,000 hours of continuous use and are still going strong.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want SSD storage instead.</p>
<p>Seagate&apos;s IronWolf drives are among the best you can get; the 12TB model delivers transfers of up to 210MB/s, spins at 7200rpm, has a 256MB cache, and uses CMR tech to record data onto the drive. It has a 180TB/year endurance, you get a three-year standard warranty, and the vibration sensors built into the drive ensure there are no issues in 24/7 usage within a NAS environment. </p><p>I used two dozen IronWolf drives totaling over 150TB in the course of the last decade, and I didn&apos;t have any problems with any of these drives. The long-term reliability in demanding conditions is what makes the IronWolf drives stand out, and it&apos;s no wonder that they&apos;re the best-selling NAS drives globally.</p><p>IronWolf Pro drives have a lot of the same characteristics, but are filled with helium to reduce friction within the drive, and include higher endurance as well as a five-year standard warranty. </p><p>Out of all the choices, the 12TB IronWolf is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-12TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B084ZTSMWF/">ideal option at $199</a> — it gives you the maximum value. The 20TB IronWolf Pro is a great choice, but the fact that you can get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-Enterprise-Internal-Drive/dp/B0CSPCFKR9/?th=1">24TB drive for $399</a> is amazing. </p><p>Sure, not everyone needs 24TB of storage, but as I&apos;ve learned over the years, once you start down this hobby, you&apos;re constantly running out of storage, and it just makes sense to get higher-storage models.</p>

This time around, Amazon has chopped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCC3DSJZ" target="_blank"><strong>25% off the price of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus</strong></a>, marking a solid $150 discount on this mid-range masterpiece. The S9 FE Plus offers a larger screen than the regular S9 FE, though both models include Samsung&apos;s first-party S Pen stylus. And despite being released last year, it&apos;s still a great pick for anyone looking for a tablet within the Galaxy ecosystem.</p>

<p>Amazon Prime Day has gone live with a bounty of great tablet deals, including this one: get the large Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus for 25% off, along with the inclusion of the S Pen stylus. This is a good price for the mid-range tablet, which comes with a huge 12.4-inch LCD screen, long battery life with 45W charging, and a few options for storage.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCC3DSJZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2217cf7b-6cac-4122-abf2-60b99dc2db1c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus: $599.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus: $599.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a tablet that has a large screen; long battery life is an important feature for you when it comes to tablets; you like Samsung&apos;s Galaxy ecosystem and are willing to go with its premium tablet option.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;re a casual user and you&apos;d rather go with a cheaper tablet; you need something with a 5G option, like the S9 FE; you&apos;d prefer an AMOLED display to an LCD one.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe">Samsung Galaxy S9 FE Plus</a> is really similar to its smaller sibling, the S9 FE, though it features a larger 12.4-inch display while the latter is 10.9 inches. Both models come with the Samsung S Pen, which you can use as a stylus or for things like digital drawing.</p><p>The S9 FE Plus comes with either 128GB or 256GB of onboard storage, along with a microSD port for expandable storage of up to 1TB. It also includes 8GB of RAM and a Samsung Exynos 1380 processor, offering decent performance, along with 45W fast-charging and a battery life the company says can last up to 20 hours.</p><p>Notably, however, the S9 FE Plus doesn&apos;t include a 5G configuration like the S9 FE, so if that&apos;s something you need, you might want to consider the smaller version of this tablet.</p><p>While the whole Galaxy Tab lineup includes some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> of all time, we think the S9 FE Plus is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets#section-best-large-tablet-value">best value for a large Samsung tablet</a> available today. Still, Prime Day is also offering discounts on other Galaxy tablets, including the affordable A9 Plus, or the higher-end S9 and S9 Plus, so those might be worth checking out if you aren&apos;t already sold on this mid-level price point.</p>

This is the lowest price we have ever seen for this model, so there&apos;s no way you can miss out on this 48-hour sale.</p><p>I was very excited for one of the XGIMI projectors to go on sale last Prime Day, and my goal was $500. What&apos;s crazy is that you can now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWQB77LX"><strong>get one for $349 only</strong></a> during this Prime Big Deals Day discount period.</p>

<p>In the world of smart projectors, the ones in the sub-$400 price range are really built as cheap as the price tag. That's not the case with the compact little XGIMI MoGo 2. This portable projector comes with Android TV 11, a brightness level of 400 lumens, decent 8W stereo speakers with Dolby Audio, and a USB-C port for power.</p>
<p>This is the <strong>lowest price ever</strong> for the XGIMI MoGo 2 projector, making this an unmissable opportunity.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWQB77LX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b2b84378-1ba8-4f62-a62c-d7384eb31603" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="XGIMI MoGo 2: $499.99" data-dimension48="XGIMI MoGo 2: $499.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need a portable projector with an HDMI port, USB-C port, Android TV, and stereo speakers, all under $400.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a projector with a built-in battery.</p>
<p>The USB-C power port is one of the biggest draws here, in addition to the other specs of the MoGo 2 Pro. If you&apos;re on the go, this tiny projector that weighs only about 1kg can be powered by a 20,000mAh power bank thanks to USB-C input. So you don&apos;t even need to be near a wall socket to use it anywhere.</p><p>Since the MoGo 2 Pro comes with Android TV 11, you can install a variety of apps, although Netflix needs to be installed via a workaround. XGIMI kindly provides step-by-step instructions for this in a pamphlet in the box.</p><p>You can use the projector hands-free with Google Assistant, cast your phone or computer to it via built-in Chromecast, and automatically scale the picture output thanks to auto keystone correction onboard. It&apos;s very much a plug-and-play experience with the MoGo 2 Pro, and it doesn&apos;t run loudly like most generic projectors, making it ideal for people who are new to projectors.</p><p>A smart XGIMI projector was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/if-i-buy-only-one-thing-this-prime-day-it-will-be-this">the one thing I wanted to buy last Prime Day</a>. This isn&apos;t the same model as the one that I wanted, but it is still an excellent projector by all means.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended for:</strong> Beginners who are just getting into the world of fitness, health, and wellness tracking and who tend to get daunted by complicated menus and apps.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need something more robust with advanced features and third-party app access. </p><p>Along with the “unbelievable battery life,” our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-gtr-mini-review">Amazfit GTR Mini reviewer</a> (who says she got about 10 days per charge with heavy use) loves the bright AMOLED display, advanced GPS (perfect for runners and cyclists), preset replies for messages, breadth of sports modes, and the ability to summon Alexa from your wrist. </p><p>She loves that the watch is super thin and lightweight, so you won’t even know you’re wearing it. The Zepp OS 2.0 interface is clean and easy to use, she adds, with no learning curve, something someone unfamiliar with using smartwatches will appreciate. It has limitations, including no third-party app support nor a speaker or mic (when you summon Alexa, your phone needs to be connected and nearby), but you might not even care. </p><p>Introduced last March, this smartwatch isn’t the newest, most powerful and feature-rich smartwatch you can buy. But for beginners, those looking to get something to help them kickstart a fitness or health and wellness journey, it’s a good budget option that doesn’t act like a budget watch. And at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWF33MMB">just $80 during October Prime Day</a>, it’s worth the investment. When you’re ready to move up to something more premium, hand this one down to a friend or family member and they’ll love using it, too.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I have dozens of GaN chargers, and most of them have the same broad design: a wall plug, a square or rectangular chassis, and two or three USB ports. UGREEN decided that wasn&apos;t enough for its chargers, so the brand came out with a unique design that resembles a robot. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-rg-65w-review">reviewed the 65W Uno charger</a> when it debuted last year (it was called the Nexode RG back then), and it continues to be one of my favorite GaN chargers.</p><p>The design is clearly meant to grab attention, and you get dual USB-C ports alongside a USB-A port. There&apos;s also a tiny LED panel that changes based on how much power is going through a charging port. The Uno charger usually costs $49, but it is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0C6DX66TN">selling at just $32 for Prime Day</a>, so if you need a 65W GaN charger that looks quite different to anything else available today, you should buy this right now.</p><p>Need more power? There&apos;s also a 100W variant of the Uno charger, and that&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0D3XR6S47">down to $48 on Amazon</a>. The 100W Uno charger has three USB-C ports and a USB-A port, and the LED panel is much more detailed. Conversely, if you need a single charging port, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0BZHZ56M9">30W Uno charger is just $18</a> — making it a great portable choice.</p>

<p>UGREEN's 65W Uno charger is one of the best around — you get three charging ports, and the cute design is unlike anything else available today.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0C6DX66TN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5abdbb9a-ed7e-4ad6-9b87-ad6955814b63" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$32 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$32 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need a high-quality 65W GaN charger with two USB-C and a USB-A port. The Uno 65W is one of the smallest chargers around, and that design is unlike anything else on the market today.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need 65W charging on more than one USB-C port.</p>
<p>The 65W Uno charger ticks all the right boxes when it comes to charging potential. The main USB-C port goes up to 65W, with the second USB-C port able to hit 30W. The USB-A port goes up to 22.5W, and if you&apos;re charging two devices at once via USB-C, the power budget is split — 45W goes to the main port, and 20W to the secondary.</p><p>With all three ports in use, you get a total power budget of 60W — 45W on the main USB-C port, and 7.5W each for the other two ports. The ports combined with the charging ability makes the 65W Uno one of the best GaN chargers, and it is distinctly smaller than other 65W chargers I used.</p><p>Of course, a big part of the allure is the design; UGREEN styled the charger to look like a robot, and it just looks cute. The magnetic feet hide the charging prongs, and while the LED panel doesn&apos;t show real-time wattage, it cycles through emoji to indicate when a device is charged.</p><p>With the 65W <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0C6DX66TN">charger down to just $32</a>, now is the best time to pick up this adorable GaN charger if you need a reliable way to charge devices on the go. And if you need additional charging ports, the 100W Uno is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook/dp/B0D3XR6S47">terrific choice at $48</a>.</p>
