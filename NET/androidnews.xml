<ul><li>A discovery within Prime Video's recent build may indicate Amazon's development of a multiview mode like YouTube TV.</li><li>The code suggests users can "set up" their multiview alongside various inabilities regarding rewinding and pausing.</li><li>YouTube TV recently rolled out "build a multiview" for users just before the 2024 NFL season, as well as a basic version for mobile.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amazon could upgrade its Prime Video streaming service with a feature YouTube TV subscribers will recognize.</p><p>Per an APK dive by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/amazon-prime-video-multiview-apk-teardown-3499139/">Android Authority</a>, the Prime Video app's latest build holds signs pointing toward a "multiview." Diving into version 3.0.389 showcased strings in the code like "exit_multiview_text." From the discovered code, it seems Amazon plans for a multiview experience that lets users "set up" their ideal content.</p><p>Another piece of code seemingly ties the multiview button to mobile — specifically, Android. Moreover, the code highlights multiview's warnings to users about the inability to rewind, pause, or skip ahead.</p><p>Other strings reference the "Android_Player" on its own, potentially indicating that Amazon may roll this out for TVs <em>alongside </em>mobile devices. Unfortunately, the publication discovery was cut short as more detailed information was reportedly unavailable. We're still left wondering how many screens or "views" Amazon's version of multiview will contain.</p><p>In mid-2023, YouTube TV started a test for a limited number of users that enabled multiview mode for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tv-multiview-streams-additional-content">more than sports games</a>. However, using the mode to watch games from the NFL, WNBA, and College Basketball games was what users typically activated multiview for. Earlier this year, YouTube TV pushed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tv-multiview-mobile-rollout">basic version of multiview to mobile devices</a>, beginning with Apple's iPhone. The mode made a few "pre-determined" options available for users to watch on the go.</p><p>Users were unable to choose which pieces of content they wanted to view, which was a function TV sets picked up in January. YouTube TV rolled the feature out as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-build-a-multiview-spotted">build a multiview</a>." The customization option debuted right in time for March Madness, letting users pick and choose which games they wanted. This custom multiview <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-fantasy-custom-multiview-nfl-sunday-ticket">arrived for NFL Sunday Ticket holders</a> just before the 2024 season kicked off.</p><p>YouTube TV lets users design a multiview with up to four screens (four streams) on game day. It remains to be seen if Amazon's version for Prime Video remains similar or more limited. Additionally, the publication highlighted the company's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-nba-wnba-streaming-deal">11-year partnership</a> with the NBA and WNBA for games, which might be a strong catalyst behind this multiview venture.</p>

Head to the retailer&apos;s site now and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-razr-2024-256gb-unlocked-hot-pink/6583831.p"><strong>order an unlocked Motorola Razr Plus (2024) and you&apos;ll score a straight $250 off</strong></a> your purchase, no strings attached.

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus (2024)</a> impressed us this year with its sophisticated design, upgraded camera tech, and a Snapdragon chip that easily holds its own against Samsung&apos;s popular Galaxy Z Flip 6. The phone also boasts two gorgeous pOLED displays with a vegan leather finish so it&apos;s nice and grippy to hold, plus you get a durable folding hinge that feels much more flexible than the rather-stiff Z Flip 6. As senior editor Derrek Lee put it, "Samsung should really be taking notes". </p>

<p>As part of its early <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-sale-top-android-deals-2024">Black Friday sale</a>, Best Buy is slashing a whopping $250 off the unlocked Motorola Razr Plus (2024). Activate the phone today and you'll score an additional $100 in savings.  </p>
<p>One of our favorite <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> released this year, the Razr Plus (2024) features two glorious pOLED screens with a Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 processor, Moto AI software features, and one of the best folding hinges that we've ever used. </p>

<p>I&apos;ve been waiting for the right time to try the clamshell device myself, and thanks to this Black Friday deal, I&apos;m about ready to place the order. Of course, the big question is this: will the Razr Plus get even cheaper as we approach November 29th? It&apos;s hard to know for sure, but if you use a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel, you&apos;ll see that the current discount totally smashes Amazon&apos;s record low price from last month. It&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-motorola-deals-2024-historic-razr-savings-usd150-off-moto-g-stylus-and-more">best Black Friday Motorola deals</a> we&apos;ve seen so far this year, and that&apos;s saying a lot. </p><p>Best Buy will also give you an additional $100 off if you activate the phone with a carrier, and you might even be eligible to receive some trade-in credit if you send in an old or broken device. Will the deal improve in a few weeks? Only time will tell, but this early Black Friday discount is good enough for me. </p>

<ul><li>YouTube detailed a new experiment for content creators with Dream Track access that lets them "restyle" a piece of music.</li><li>Restyling a song leverages the platform's AI tool for a 30-second clip with a completely new genre and mood based on your description.</li><li>YouTube debuted Dream Track late last year as a feature that can create music in the same style as their favorite artist and recreate their voice.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube is reportedly kickstarting a new test that advances its AI-based generation features for music.</p><p>The platform's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en&msgid=307521359">latest test</a> involves an expansion of its Dream Track AI experiment that a "limited" number of content creators can try (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294891/youtube-ai-restyle-music-creators">The Verge</a>). According to YouTube, this test will let creators "restyle" a song using descriptors via a prompt given to its AI software. The company states it has made a few "official songs" available to creators, courtesy of "select" music partners.</p><p>Creators with access can select an eligible song and "describe how you want to restyle it." YouTube states the AI will generate a remix based on a user's description to create a 30-second clip usable in a Short.</p><p>Since these clips are only usable in Shorts, YouTube states the quick video will credit the original song. More importantly, the platform will note that the music users are listening to is generated/remixed by AI.

<p>YouTube detailed its new experiment, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-watermarks-for-ai-generated-music">Dream Track</a>, late last year. The Shorts-only feature leverages Google's DeepMind "Lyria" model to create instrumentals and vocals. Through Dream Track, the company stated that users could create 30-second snippets of music in the "style of their favorite artists." The AI could sample a popular artist's voice and turn it into something completely new. The idea was to help content creators create soundtracks that help bypass the hassle of paying royalties.</p><p>While it seems useful, a tool such as Dream Track has raised a few eyebrows about protecting a music artist's IP (intellectual property).</p><p>AI has continued to rise on YouTube as the company highlighted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/made-by-youtube-2024-ai-hype-updates">AI generation through Veo</a>. This is another piece of software from Google's DeepMind kitchen that lets users create AI-based backgrounds or "concepts that were once impossible to visualize." Using Veo limits users to a six-second clip for a Short. However, it seems the platform intends users to utilize this software to "fill in any gaps" they may have with a Short.</p>

<p>Eye health has become increasingly more important as our world becomes filled with screens. Most people look at a screen now more than at any other time in their lives, so it makes sense to find a type of display that isn't going to cause you harm.</p><p>However, not every screen type is created equal, making some devices better for specific tasks than others. For this particular project, I’ve been using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">best E Ink tablet</a>, the Boox Tab Ultra, as well as the LCD-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl-is-bringing-its-innovative-nxtpaper-tech-to-more-phones-and-tablets">TCL Tab 10 NXTPAPER 5G</a> tablet, and the OLED-based Honor MagicPad 2. Each tablet’s display works very differently, but all have the same goal: to be better on your eyes for the long haul.</p><p>That's good because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14771535241288783">latest research</a> on light and display flicker shows that some kinds of displays can cause health problems over time, including migraines and eye problems. Thankfully, this same research is pushing companies to make displays that are far more eye-friendly, and three technologies are leading the charge: E Ink, NXTPAPER LCD, and, surprisingly, OLED. Which one is right for you? Let's take a look.</p>

<h2 id="e-ink-2">E-ink</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5a2fSwqFFRf4g7y7pUtYMc" name="oled-vs-e-ink-pixel-structure" alt="Comparing the pixel structure of an Onyx Boox Tab Ultra E-Ink panel with an Honor MagicPad 2 OLED panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5a2fSwqFFRf4g7y7pUtYMc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Each of these three display technologies “draws” the image very differently and even displays light completely differently.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">E-ink displays</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">Best for reading. Made up of physical spheres that are magnetically charged and don't move between frames. Extremely energy efficient since it doesn't need constant voltage to operate and can stay on indefinitely without power. Watching videos and playing games isn't possible on older E Ink models, but some newer devices, like the Onyx Boox Palma, are more feasible.</p></div></div>
<p>E Ink promises to be the most eye-friendly display of all because it doesn’t flicker the way other types of display tech are prone to. E Ink uses positively and negatively charged white or black pigments, which are situated between a clear fluid. You can see this in the image above which shows what the Boox Tab Ultra's display looks like under a microscope compared to the OLED display on the Honor MagicPad 2.</p><p>When an e-reader like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Boox Palma</a> draws an image — like the text in a book or a picture in a manga — the pigments are energized to create a specific level of gray and then stay in place until moved again.</p><p>This means that E Ink displays are extremely battery efficient since they <em>only</em> require power when drawing. LCDs and OLEDs require constant voltage to operate and maintain an image on the screen. Additionally, E Ink “accepts” light similarly to paper, so it’s more viewable as ambient light increases. Reading on the beach with an e-reader is a joy, while it’s nearly impossible with an LCD or OLED.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>E Ink “accepts” light similarly to paper, so it’s more viewable as ambient light increases. Reading on the beach with an e-reader is a joy, while it’s nearly impossible with an LCD or OLED.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>All modern e-readers use an optional frontlight, which means they are lit differently from an LCD or OLED if you choose to turn the light on. A frontlight is typically situated around the edges of the display and points at a downward angle.</p><p>Because of E Ink's unique light-accepting properties, light is then carried across the panel and evenly lit. All <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-tab-ultra-c-review" target="_blank">Onyx Boox</a> e-readers that I’ve tested do not use PWM flickering to dim the light but actual DC dimming to reduce voltage to the light, making it very comfortable on the eyes.</p>

<p>The downside of E Ink is that it’s not inherently designed for color or video content. You can find fast-refreshing E Ink displays like the one on the Boox Palma that allow you to play games and watch videos, but the experience is a little weird since the framerate is low.</p><p>It's not impossible to watch videos or play games on certain e-readers — the Boox Tab Ultra I've used for this article is a great example of one that doesn't refresh fast enough for these use cases — but it's not as nice to view this kind of content an on E Ink display as it is an LCD or OLED.</p><p>Likewise, color e-readers often have a reduced color palette compared to LCD or OLED, meaning they are only ideal for reading.</p>

<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">NXTPAPER LCD</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">TCL's spin on LCD tech includes a diffusion layer to soften the image and a matte layer to reduce glare. It looks more like paper but is not as "authentic" as E Ink. The backlight uses proper DC dimming, ensuring zero light flicker, but TCL's use of color dithering means pixels flicker to artificially deepen the colors. NXTPAPER features three different color modes, including full color and a high refresh rate that's great for videos and games. It's not as energy-efficient as the other two display types because the backlight doesn't have zone control.</p></div></div>
<p>TCL’s NXTPAPER technology is a fairly new riff on older LCD technology. Like traditional LCDs, NXTPAPER uses a grid of tiny red, green, and blue pixels illuminated by a separate backlight to display what you see. The biggest difference is in the various layers that separate the pixels and the light itself.</p><p>TCL has packed a light diffusion layer and an anti-glare filter onboard. This diffusion layer makes it difficult to see individual pixels, even under a microscope, giving the light a lovely “soft” quality that no other display tech has.</p><p>Additionally, TCL NXTPAPER backlights are completely DC dimmed, so there’s no flickering at all. All in all, this is the closest thing you’ll find to the eye-friendly light provided by an incandescent light.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>TCL has packed a light diffusion layer and an anti-glare filter onboard, giving the light a lovely “soft” quality that no other display tech has.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>TCL says this is the Goldilocks display tech as it’s got a wider color range than E Ink but doesn't sport the harsh look of an OLED. The TCL NXTPAPER Tab 10 also offers three different color models that can alter colors on the screen to be a reduced palette or make everything completely black and white.</p><p>The idea here is that one of these three modes is optimal for different types of content, but this tablet has one big downside: dithering. In a nutshell, TCL is using the same color tech on its tablet as it does on its popular TVs, which achieves deeper colors by flickering pixels between two colors. This makes each pixel appear as a color that “doesn’t exist,” similar to how your eyes will perceive a non-existent color when spinning a color wheel.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>TCL NXTPAPER tech is wonderful for all kinds of content but users sensitive to dithering should avoid it until TCL offers the ability to disable color dithering.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In my testing, I've found that this display works very well for any kind of task. Reading on TCL NXTPAPER technology, specifically, is very pleasant thanks to the characteristic soft diffused light. Changing color palettes can help ease eye strain for certain types of content, although I find I use the "color paper" mode less often than the full-color "regular mode" or the black & white-only "ink paper mode."</p><p>The panel is bright enough for indoor use but is very difficult to see outdoors, especially in direct sunlight. It also has rather poor viewing angles and is only perceivably brightest when looking at it straight on.</p><p>This particular generation of NXTPAPER LCD doesn't refresh quite as quickly as an OLED can, though, introducing some motion blur. This is particularly noticeable when scrolling through the OS or web pages but I don't notice it as much when playing games and never notice it while watching videos. This would be the single friendliest overall tech if TCL could provide users the option of disabling color dithering.</p>

<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">OLED</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">OLED produces the deepest colors, highest contrast, and highest brightness of any modern display technology. While that means it's got the best image quality, it's also the harshest to look at for long periods of time, and the use of PWM dimming by many companies means the risk of eye damage is highest with this tech. It's not as energy efficient as E Ink since it has to have a constant current to power, but it's more energy efficient than LCD since individual LEDs provide the light.</p></div></div>
<p>For the better part of the last decade, OLED displays have been slowly replacing LCDs because they look better and are more energy efficient. But the way some companies make their OLED displays — and even LED lights — are causing health problems for lots of people because they flicker like fluorescent lights.</p><p>I've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">written about this topic many times</a>, so it's a subject very near and dear to my heart.  While Samsung OLED panels often feature harsh flickering that makes me dizzy, gives me eye and headaches, and sometimes makes me nauseous, OLED panels from other companies like LG, BOE, Visionox, and Sony (among others) only flicker at low brightness and, even then, flicker at a far higher frequency than Samsung’s OLEDs.</p><p>The Honor MagicPad 2 I used for this experiment uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-enable-dc-dimming-on-the-oneplus-12-and-oneplus-12r">DC dimming</a> technology above 30% brightness and 4320Hz PWM dimming at lower brightness levels. Meanwhile, Samsung’s best tablets use a paltry 240Hz PWM rate at <em>all</em> brightness levels, meaning there’s no escape from the flickering no matter how bright it gets.</p>

Despite this, viewability in sunlight is rather poor since the panel itself is super shiny.</p><p>Honor uses true 10-bit display panels, so there’s no need for color dithering as the TCL NXTPAPER Tab 10 has, but the direct light from LED photons may still trigger headaches for the most sensitive users.</p><p>Interestingly enough, Honor has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magicpad-2-honor-magic-v3-ai-defocus-display">brilliant new technology</a> on this tablet that works under the hood to help prevent and even reverse myopia, according to research. It's limited to only a few apps but promises some interesting potential if it gets rolled out more widely.</p><p>I’ve been using this tablet for everything from watching movies to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/these-gadgets-got-me-through-the-worst-hurricane-of-my-life">working during Hurricane Helene</a> and find it to be extremely comfortable, but I don’t like using OLEDs for reading. Concentrating on the harsher, direct light of an OLED while reading just doesn’t feel good after long periods of time no matter what’s done behind the scenes.</p>

<p>While there’s no direct answer to which display type is “best” overall, one characteristic affects more sensitive users than others: flicker. Many modern displays and lights flicker to achieve different goals, from color accuracy to display brightness; flickering has a purpose.</p><p>However, companies that use flicker this way often seem to forget that human eyes and brains don’t always play nice when strobing lights are involved. Lack of flicker is the main reason these three <em>devices</em>, in particular, are better for your eyes.</p><p>Onyx’s E Ink technology doesn’t flicker at all, yet the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ledstrain.org/d/698-eye-strain-with-e-readers">occasional user</a> will still feel eye strain from certain e-readers. This can be attributed to several potential factors, but the fact is that e-ink is the most comfortable type of display for reading for the largest percentage of users.</p><p>TCL’s NXTPAPER technology has the potential to be the single best overall technology, but TCL needs to offer sensitive users the option to disable dithering completely. If that can be done, the soft, friendly DC-dimmed light from any TCL NXTPAPER device will be an easy recommendation for anyone who wants a great tablet to read on, watch movies on, or even work from.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>OLED has the biggest potential to inflict harm because of its harsher direct light, so use e-readers when possible for daily reading. TCL NXTPAPER has great potential but it's typically found on underpowered devices.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>OLED has the biggest potential to inflict harm because of its harsher direct light. Since the individual pixels on an OLED panel emit light, you’re looking directly at an LED when you view content on an OLED instead of at a diffused light as with other display types.</p><p>There are many ways that companies can use diffusion layers or provide better dimming options to help negate the negative effects of OLEDs. Samsung put a wonderful anti-glare layer on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review#section-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-display-and-design">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, for instance. But the technology feels a bit like the old Icarus story: fly too close to the sun and you’ll probably get burned.</p><p>I've found that e-readers like the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra are best for reading books or manga. When I want to watch a video or play a game, the Honor MagicPad 2 is my go-to solution thanks to Honor's use of DC dimming, an unbelievably good set of virtual surround sound speakers, and a powerful processor.</p><p>I'd love to use TCL's NXTPAPER tech more in the future but the company's use of low-power processors and color dithering put it in an awkward middle ground that means it collects dust more than it sees use.</p>

<hr>
<p>To find out how much news stories appearing in Google News, Search, and Discover encourage readers to use Google products and services, the company will remove them altogether in an extremely limited test. One percent of users in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain won't see news content from EU-based publishers as Google collects data, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/more-data-about-news-results-eu/" target="_blank">announced</a> today.</p><p>The changes come in response to a request from regulators and publishers, and is related to Article 15 of the European Copyright Directive (EUCD). This law dictates how search engines and news aggregators can use news content from publishers in the EU. As part of Google's compliance with the EUCD, it started an Extended News Previews (ENP) program. Essentially, the company pays publishers to show previews or snippets of news content under license.</p><p>Google says it has agreements with over 4,000 publications in 20 countries, and the deals are rooted in how much news content affects search and advertising. "These agreements are based on consistent criteria which respect the law and existing copyright guidance, including how often a news website is displayed and how much ad revenue is generated on pages that also display previews of news content," the company explains.</p><p>However, the EU's regulators and publishers now want "additional data about the effect of news content in Search on peoples’ use of our products." To get the data, Google is removing the news content from EU publishers in Google News, Google Search, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-personalize-google-discover-feed">Google Discover</a> for 1% of users in the previously-listed EU countries. Presumably, it will compare the usage of Google products and services with and without news content present.</p><p>This is a very minor test that only affects a small portion of EU users for a limited time. Results will still appear from publishers outside of the EU, and the removal of EU-based news is temporary. Google says that when the test ends, everything will go back to normal.</p><p>"We intend to use this test to assess how results from EU news publishers impact the search experience for our users and traffic to publishers," Google said in the blog post.</p>

<p>Google details a few updates kids and families can expect to arrive on devices this week.</p><p>The company highlighted features in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/fitbit/fitbit-ace-lte-holiday-updates-2024/">Keyword post</a> that help keep families connected and engaged with healthy habits. Rolling out today (Nov 13), Google states the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a> and the Ace app are picking up "Family Chat." According to the post, families can send each other quick notes and texts via the watch or the app.</p><p>This new "Family Chat" is tied to every member registered in a user's Google family. Additionally, the post states siblings within the family can have their own space to communicate. Private chats between siblings are also rolling out, allowing them to text or call one another from the Ace LTE.</p>

<p>For health, Google states a new wave of exercise engagement features are rolling out via "Family Quests." These colorful (and at times holiday-themed) quests encourage families to get walking to hit their goals and complete tasks. The post highlights an upcoming game for Thanksgiving dubbed "Turkey Berserky." Every completed quest goes toward unlocking rewards and more advanced challenges for the family.</p><p>Joining these Family Quests are "50 extra Daily Quests" alongside "Trivial Tasks" that give kids a fun way to learn about geography and more.</p><p>Seeing progress is always encouraging, which is why Google states the Fitbit Ace LTE receives additional Noodle watch faces.</p><p>Kids don't always have to run around — and that's where the Ace LTE's newest game, Solar Sword, comes in. This new game is available through the Fitbit Arcade. Gamers are tasked with slashing through hordes of monsters invading a village like any (powerful) sword-wielding hero. The company highlights the start of its holiday season savings. Consumers can save <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/fitbit_ace_lte?utm_source=keyword&utm_medium=google_oo&utm_campaign=GS108186">$50 on the Fitbit Ace LTE</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/collection/accessories_wall?utm_source=keyword&utm_medium=google_oo&utm_campaign=GS108186">$20 on its bands</a> through the Google Store.</p><p>This runs from November 21 through December 4. Moreover, if you're purchasing a second Ace Pass annual plan for a sibling, consumers can receive a 50% discount from now until January 31, 2025.</p><p>These updates for the Ace LTE are rolling out today (Nov 13), but it may take a couple of days before it appears for download. In the meantime, Google rolled out an update for kids this summer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-debit-card-school-returns-update">ahead of the 2024-2025 school year</a>. The patch lets parents set spending limits and other features to facilitate "healthier spending" among children. What's more, "School Time" lets parents ensure their kids remain focused on their schoolwork as they implement a set time limiting access to distracting apps.</p>

<ul><li>ZTE's Nubia unveiled the RedMagic 10 Pro series in China, with two models available: 10 Pro and 10 Pro Plus.</li><li>Both models are identical, but the 10 Pro Plus has a bigger 7050mAh battery, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage.</li><li>Both devices use the latest Qualcomm silicon and come with Android 15.</li><li>The devices will be available globally — including North America — starting December 3.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>ZTE's Nubia sub-brand does a good job catering to enthusiasts, and the RedMagic series is always a good choice if you want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming-focused device</a>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic-9-pro-review">RedMagic 9 Pro</a> got a lot right, but Nubia is turning things up a notch with the debut of the RedMagic 10 Pro Plus.</p><p>The device continues Nubia's distinct gamer aesthetic with bold styling and a boxy design. You still get plenty of buttons on the right, an all-screen design that isn't marred by a cutout, and with a sizeable 6.85-inch 144Hz AMOLED panel, the phone is an absolute unit.</p><p>What's immediately interesting about the phone is that the RedMagic 10 Pro Plus has a gargantuan 7,050mAh battery with 120W charging, which is a lot even by 2025 standards. Like other Chinese brands, Nubia uses silicon-carbon battery tech to increase the density, which is how the brand was able to cram a larger battery while retaining the same 229g weight as the 9 Pro.</p>

<p>Similar to other 2025 flagships, Nubia went with Qualcomm's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> on both RedMagic phones. Although the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is still plenty powerful, the new platform has sizeable gains across the board.</p><p>There's also a regular RedMagic 10 Pro that has a 6,500mAh battery and 80W charging, and that model comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. While other brands usually differentiate models with cameras, Nubia isn't going that here — both the 10 Pro and 10 Pro Plus have the same design, same AMOLED panel, and identical cameras. The only difference is the storage configurations and battery size.</p><p>The 10 Pro Plus, meanwhile, comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage as standard. Both devices run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box, and Nubia has unique extras that cater to gamers on the software side of things.</p><p>The devices are now available in China, with an international debut on December 3 — you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.redmagic.gg/pages/redmagic-10-pro-launch">sign up on Nubia's global website</a> if you're interested. The series starts at 4,999 RMB ($693) in China, and it should cost about the same globally.</p>

<hr>
<p>LG envisions a future ruled by flexible displays, and its latest concept screen brings that vision to life. Stretching up to 50% beyond its original size, LG's new stretchable display is pushing screen tech to new limits.</p><p>LG Display recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lgdisplay.com/eng/company/media-center/latest-news?contentId=5362" target="_blank">showed off</a> its game-changing display tech at LG Science Park in Seoul. The prototype screen starts at 12 inches but can stretch all the way to 18 inches. It features a pixel density of 100 ppi across its RGB subpixels.</p><p>While impressive, this falls behind modern smartphone displays like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a>, which sports a 495 ppi screen. So, it’s probably not ready for mobile devices just yet.</p><p>The panel is crafted from the same material found in contact lenses. LG claims this stretchable display has the industry's highest elongation rate, allowing the screen to stretch beyond its usual size without damage.</p><p>Though unconventional, the Korean company sees this stretchable display as a game-changer for innovation in the consumer electronics world.</p><p>The latest concept display is similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/lg/lg-demos-stretchable-high-resolution-display">LG’s 2022 reveal</a>, but this new version takes it up a notch by doubling its stretch. The new display tech isn’t just stretchable and twistable—it also shows a full color spectrum, thanks to microLED tech. Like OLED, it emits light directly, so there's no need for a backlight.</p><p>With its microLED light source, the new display can be stretched over 10,000 times, according to the company. MicroLED's tiny size opens up some pretty unique possibilities, like LG’s prototype.</p><p>Even though flexible displays are already in products like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> and rollable TVs, LG Display hasn’t revealed any plans to roll out its stretchable screen tech commercially yet.</p><p>Nevertheless, the company expects this tech to have plenty of uses, like wearable displays that fit into clothing comfortably and in-car screens that mold to the dashboard’s shape without messing with the design.</p><p>It's likely, though, that these stretchable screens won't hit consumer products anytime soon.</p>

<p>The IP68 rating has been standard on phones for nearly a decade, with Samsung introducing it on the Galaxy S7 series back in 2016. Other brands followed shortly thereafter, and these days, the rating is now a table stakes feature.</p><p>What&apos;s interesting is that most Chinese brands are switching to IP69 on their 2025 flagships. Vivo&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-takes-things-to-a-whole-new-level-with-the-x200-series">X200</a>, X200 Pro, and X200 Pro mini all come with IP69 ingress protection, alongside OPPO&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppos-answer-to-the-galaxy-s25-is-launching-globally-on-november-21">Find X8</a> and X8 Pro. Other manufacturers in the BBK stable are getting in on the action as well, with both the Realme GT 7 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> getting IP69.</p><p>So what is IP69 dust and water resistance, and how is it different to IP68? At a high-level overview, an IP rating guarantees protection against dust and water making its way into a device. The two digits in the rating indicate the degree of protection; the first digit corresponds to protection against solid objects (including dust particles), while the second digit deals with liquids.</p><p>The 6 in IP68 means the device is effectively dustproof. To achieve this rating, the device is housed in a dust-filled enclosure with a steady stream of air blowing in, and it needs to withstand any dust from getting into the chassis after eight hours of testing.</p><p>The second number is interesting, because that&apos;s the key change with 2025 flagships. The 8 in IP68 refers to a device&apos;s ability to be submerged in up to 1.5 meters of water for an extended duration — usually lasting 30 minutes. Most phones conform to this standard, but the iPhone 16 Pro Max is able to be submerged in up to 6 meters of water.</p>

<p>Manufacturers use gaskets around the SIM card slot and sealant inside the chassis to protect the internals against water damage. With IP69, you get the same level of immersion in water, but these devices are also able to withstand high-pressure water jets going up to 1,450 PSI, and tolerate increased temperatures of up to 80 degrees Celsius (176 degrees Fahrenheit).</p><p>Even with an IP68 rating, phones were pretty much resistant to any weather conditions, and IP69 goes one level beyond — it is the highest level of ingress protection available on consumer devices.</p><p>While IP69 has better protection against liquid ingress, it still has the same caveats — it doesn&apos;t cover salt water damage, so if you submerge your phone in a water body with high salinity, you should immediately rinse it with fresh water.</p><p>Just like with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon battery tech</a>, the IP69 rating is limited to Chinese brands, with BBK-owned entities leading the charge once again. It&apos;s unlikely Samsung, Apple, or Google will switch to the standard on their devices. This time though, I don&apos;t think it makes a big enough difference — IP68 protection is still more than adequate.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>This weekend, I ran a 20-mile marathon training race wearing four fitness watches — the Garmin Fenix 8, COROS PACE Pro, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Google Pixel Watch 3. I felt like a weirdo, but it was actually a really useful opportunity to check which metrics are most consistent across brands — and which are most likely to be wrong or random.</p><p>I usually wear two smartwatches at any given time during runs, and I once <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">wore six watches for a step-counting test</a>. Usually, I'm on quiet trails where my absurd tech habits don't attract much attention, but I knew that wouldn't apply during the Run the Parkway race, which had nearly 1,000 runners.</p><p>Thankfully, the mid-40ºF weather let me wear long sleeves, hiding my silly appearance at first. But it started warming up, and my sleeves started activating some watches' touchscreens and messing things up. So I rolled them back and saw spectators and runners alike glancing confusedly at my wrist-laden arms.</p><p>Whatever they thought of my bizarre appearance, I got some great data out of the 20-mile race, summarized in the table below!</p>


<p>I finished the first 13.1 miles at a solid 1:55:31, or 8:49 pace, but my muscle soreness made me walk-jog the last five miles in the 11/12-minute range, skewing my running form stats. But I'm still generally happy with the results as I return to marathon shape for 2025!</p><p><em>Note</em>: My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> randomly stopped my activity by itself due to random touchscreen inputs from my sleeve. I thankfully noticed it quickly and started a new workout, but had to add up and average data from 4.5-mile and 15.4-mile activities, and the final distance probably <em>would</em> have been above 20 miles if not for this snafu.</p>
<h2 id="consistent-data-across-brands-2">Consistent data across brands</h2>
<p>That Apple workout glitch aside, all four watches were pretty close in total distance and pace and were basically in lockstep in areas like average heart rate, steps, cadence, and stride length.</p><p>Despite their different HR algorithms, accelerometer tech, and positions on my arms, they nearly matched when calculating how far and often I stepped — and how hard I was pushing myself — across three hours. That's impressive!</p>

<p>In terms of distance, I immediately noticed that the GPS-only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 3</a> buzzed my wrist that I'd finished my first mile well before the others, then fell into a consistent pattern of marking each finished mile about 0.1 miles before each mile marker. Despite the lack of signal blockage on my route, a GPS-only watch is only adequate at the best of times compared to the dual-band results of my other three watches.</p><p>I already wrote about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-gps-and-hr-accuracy-test">COROS PACE Pro's GPS accuracy</a> compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-has-underwhelmed-me-despite-how-great-it-is">Fenix 8</a>, and that held true here: Like the Pixel Watch 3, it marked me finishing my first mile before the Fenix 8, but then it held the same position for every subsequent mile, beeping about 10 running strides before the Fenix 8 all the way to the finish.</p><p>For elevation data, Apple, Garmin, and Fitbit were all within 5 feet of one another, while COROS slightly overestimated my effort. The PACE 3 did better in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/altimeter-elevation-test-mt-diablo-with-garmin-apple-coros-polar-galaxy-watch">past elevation accuracy test</a>, so I'm curious if the PACE Pro altimeter needs some tinkering. Otherwise, I've found almost <em>any</em> watch with an altimeter gives pretty consistent ascent data.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LWaZFNkWxkKPHBXP3RMjBK" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-COROS-HRM-Google-Pixel-Watch-3-HR-accuracy-comparison" alt="A HR chart showing the results for the Garmin Fenix 8, COROS Heart Rate Monitor, and Google Pixel Watch 3 across three hours." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LWaZFNkWxkKPHBXP3RMjBK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2520" height="1418" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for HR accuracy, I paired my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS HR armband</a> to the Pace Pro for a baseline against the other three watches, and the results were predictable: the Fenix 8 is <em>excellent</em> for optical HR accuracy, while the Pixel Watch 3 is steady but tends to fall a little short for anaerobic heart rates. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 also seemed to do well on average but fell a few beats short of my max HR.</p>
<h2 id="where-fitness-watch-data-diverges-2">Where fitness watch data diverges</h2>
<p>Considering how consistent the results were in some areas, it's a bit surprising how <em>different</em> the four watches' results were in other areas:</p><p><strong>Running power</strong>: Some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness watches</a> calculate the energy put into your run based on factors like speed, cadence, stride length, and vertical oscillation so you can determine your stride's efficiency and your overall effort. You'd think my running power data would have been closer across brands. Instead, Garmin put my effort about 100W higher than the other two that tracked that data.</p><p>I know a lot of runners and experts put stock in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/when-is-running-with-power-superior-to-running-at-pace">using running power instead of pace</a> to determine how well or fast they're running, especially on hilly or windy courses. But I've noticed this variation in running power across brands before, and if they can't agree on my wattage for a <em>flat</em> and <em>non-windy</em> course, it makes me leery of using this metric as my benchmark while running. It's something I want to try and test more in the future.</p><p><strong>Training load: </strong>TL is more of a proprietary data point, even if they all use some form of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803105725580">training impulse (TRIMP) method</a>. So, I'm not surprised that brands differ in how they calculate it. But it's still fascinating to see COROS give me more than double the training load Garmin does with near-identical stats, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Fitbit's Cardio Load</a> falling squarely in the middle. (Apple's TL is all about charts relative to past weeks and doesn't put a number on workouts.)</p><p>For what it's worth, I've noticed in the past that Garmin can be a bit conservative with its training load estimates (especially for long hikes) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">isn't very good at splitting low/high aerobic and anaerobic loads</a> for one activity. Meanwhile, COROS gives out TL like candy on Halloween, overestimating my effort. In this case, I think Fitbit's TL might win the Goldilocks "just right" award here.</p>

<p><strong>Calories:</strong> This is another fitness metric I've been side-eyeing for some time. After <em>any</em> activity where I wear two watches from different brands, the final burned-calorie count is different, no matter how similar the mileage and HR totals are.</p><p>This 20-miler only made the differences even starker, with a 500kcal gap between COROS and Garmin. But you'll still notice a difference for shorter runs or walks, whichever fitness watch you buy. And anyone trying to lose weight or judge their caloric need for the day will make very different life choices based on this data.</p><p>I'd love to figure out which brand is most accurate for caloric burn. But unlike when I'm testing GPS routes against satellite maps or heart rate against arm or chest straps, I don't know of any way a layman can test the results outside of a lab.</p>
<h2 id="finding-a-running-watch-you-can-trust-is-important-2">Finding a running watch you can trust is important</h2>
<p>This experience taught me two things. One, don't tell your boss, "Hey, I'm running a race this weekend; is there anything I should test?" It'll only lead to embarrassment and spending hours the day before charging all your watches. Two, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watches</a> are getting better and more reliable for raw data than ever, matching each other across brands in ways that count.</p><p>Garmin is still my preferred running brand because I've been using its training load, suggested workouts, and recovery data for years, and a lot of runners trust its accuracy. But tests like this make it plain that other brands can be trusted too, at least on the hardware side. And even if watches like the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Pixel Watch 3 are more for "casual" athletes in terms of software, they're getting better and better every year.</p>
