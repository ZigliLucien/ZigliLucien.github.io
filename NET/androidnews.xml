It has an IP67 rating, which means that it's protected against temporary immersion in water and is dust-tight. The Pixel can only be submerged up to a meter for a total of 30 minutes in fresh water.</p></article></section>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:958px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="VroGKCafXrhWXyoLXZExhW" name="Google-Pixel-8a-water-drops-wet-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8a in Aloe covered in water droplets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VroGKCafXrhWXyoLXZExhW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="958" height="539" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the Google Pixel 8a is not waterproof for hours on end, it&apos;s best to use a waterproof <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-cases">Pixel 8a case</a> to protect it from water damage if you take it for a swim longer than 30 minutes. But if you don&apos;t have a case yet, be cautious of how much water lands on your Pixel since an IP67 rating (given by the International Electrotechnical Commission) will protect it if caught in light rain or you splash water from the faucet on it. However, the protection rating doesn&apos;t include corrosive liquids such as sugary or soft drinks. If you drop in the snow or the toilet, your phone should be fine.</p><p>Never take your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> when showering with hot water, and try to avoid highly chlorinated pools or seawater since the IP rating was conducted in a lab and done with fresh water. But if you want to snap a quick picture underwater while swimming, it should be fine. The Pixel 8a has the same protection as its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, but with other apparent upgrades in the specification list.</p><p>The rating always consists of two numbers, the first referring to protection against solids and the second to liquids. The lowest rating for each one is a zero, which indicates no protection, and an X indicates the manufacturer has not provided a rating. But remember that the IP rating can degrade over time as your phone is exposed to impacts, wear and tear, and various temperature changes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="vXQfgQcni7RQ8esY58Vk9k" name="google-pixel-8a-colors-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8a all colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vXQfgQcni7RQ8esY58Vk9k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 8a is only a hair short of its bigger sibling in terms of protection, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, which has an IP68 rating and high protection against dust and water. While the IP68 rating is a high one, it doesn&apos;t make the device waterproof for long periods of submersion, but it allows it to be submerged more than a meter and is more protected against the effects of continuous immersion in water.</p><p>The Pixel 8a&apos;s IP rating doesn&apos;t mean it will perform well in high-moisture environments. There is no similarity between humidity tolerance and IP rating, so if you&apos;re going to be in an area with a high humidity level, it would be best to use a waterproof case to be on the safe side. With an IP rating, there is no confusion as to how much water the device can withstand, and it is more precise than words such as water-resistant and waterproof.</p><p>The Pixel 8a may not have the same rating as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> or 8 Pro, but it has various similar specifications, especially when compared to its smaller flagship sibling. For example, both Pixels have a 120Hz refresh rate and a 2400 x 1080 resolution. Both phones reach 1,400 nits for HDR or 2,000 nits for peak brightness, and they share the same 1-million-to-1 contrast ratio along with 16 million colors. Another great addition to the Pixel 8a is the Tensor G3 chipset and the fact that it gets seven years of system updates up to Android 21.</p>

<hr>
<p>It seems that Samsung is beginning to put together the pieces behind its upcoming One UI 7 software, based on Google&apos;s Android 15.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-ui-7-0-development-started-internally-firmware/">SamMobile</a>, Samsung may have started internally testing One UI 7 as a new firmware build, version S928BXXU2BXE2, was spotted on its servers. The company has allegedly paired this new version with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> in Europe. It was stated that what&apos;s most important with the build is the apparent swap at the end from "<strong>A</strong>..." to "<strong>B</strong>..."</p><p>Samsung&apos;s past suggests that this single character change typically indicates the beginning of a new major OS. We&apos;ll have to wait and see.</p><p>Other phones, such as the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus, have yet to begin testing the supposed One UI 7 software. It should start sometime soon, as the publication notes Samsung usually begins development shortly after Google&apos;s first beta for the next Android software.</p><p>Similarly, a beta program for the upcoming Android 15-based software should start at some point as we&apos;re coming up on the summer months.</p>

<p>One UI 7 murmurings have started ramping up as a Samsung Good Lock developer spilled that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-phones-may-finally-get-a-long-awaited-app-drawer-revamp">sideways app drawer</a> could disappear. This update could lessen its reliance on the Home Up module which, currently, displays all of a user&apos;s apps on pages that scroll horizontally.</p><p>More specifically, the representative stated the team is looking into implementing a "vertical list function" that the OS can utilize without relying on Good Lock.</p><p>Android 15&apos;s development is continuing as expected with Google recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-1-2">rolling out Beta 1.2</a> toward the end of April. This smaller, iterative update was to build on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-1-1">Beta 1.1</a> problems the company aimed to fix. App freezing, odd battery drain issues, crashes, and more were on the docket. While it seems as though Google has made its current test build for Android 15 more stable, there are still problems enrolled users have reported that haven&apos;t been solved.</p><p>We&apos;ve crossed into May, which means we should be moving into Android 15 Beta 2 at any point now. According to Google&apos;s timeline, it plans to reach "Platform Stability" by June before rolling out its stable Android 15 software anywhere from August and beyond.</p>

<p>Google was spotted rolling out a convenient way for users to quickly share information found through Search.</p><p>As discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1787876050112069785">Artem Russakovskii</a> on X, the main Google app on Android has picked up its own way of sharing Search results (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/07/google-app-share/">9to5Google</a>). Users can tap the vertical three-dot icon on the far right side of a search result during a query. This will open a full results page featuring the result&apos;s information at the top and "About this result" beneath it.</p><p>A new "Share" button has joined the row of save, remove result, and feedback options that Google has shown previously.</p><p>Tapping the share option opens Android&apos;s typical sub-menu for tossing links to other places. Users can copy the link directly or quickly hop into Google Messages, post the link on social media, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-19-1pm-et-quick-share-becomes-a-true-airdrop-alternative-with-support-for-all-android-and-chrome-os-devices">Quick Share</a>. Additionally, Artem reiterated the option&apos;s existence on the web version of Search, though users can right-click a result and share that way, too.</p><p>As the tipster notes, previously, users on mobile would have to open a Search result and copy the link that way to share.</p><p>It appears as though the new share button for results in the Google app on Android is widely available. However, it&apos;d be best to give it a little time if you&apos;re not seeing it yet.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Fossil, a fashion and lifestyle company that made Wear OS smartwatches for years, is leaving the market for good.</li><li>The company announced the move in January 2024, but continued to sell smartwatches while supplies lasted. </li><li>Now, there are no more Fossil smartwatches to go around, and there's one less player in the Wear OS smartwatch game. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>About three months after Fossil Group announced it would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-group-quits-making-smartwatches">stop making smartwatches</a>, all the existing stock of Fossil&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fossil-gen-6-review">current Gen 6 lineup</a> has been more or less exhausted (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2024/05/06/its-over-for-fossil-smartwatches/">Droid-Life</a>). You can no longer buy a Fossil smartwatch directly from the company&apos;s online store (save for maybe a few stragglers), and stock is dwindling at third-party retailers as well. Although Fossil says that it will continue to update sold smartwatches "for the next few years," this development clearly marks the end of Fossil&apos;s run as a Wear OS smartwatch maker. </p><p>Fossil is hardly a tech-first company, but it had become a household name in both the Wear OS and hybrid smartwatch categories over the last few years. As a traditional watch manufacturer, Fossil attempted to make smartwatches that conveyed the look and appearance of those classic timepieces. More importantly, Fossil stuck by Wear OS during the times that even Google didn&apos;t seem fully committed to the platform. </p><p>The company&apos;s choice to end its lineup of smartwatches spans the Fossil Group, which affects more than just the Fossil brand. The group also covers smartwatches released under Citizen, Skagen, Diesel, Michael Kors, and Kate Spade. </p><p>Now that Fossil is finished making smartwatches, the Wear OS market has lost a staple brand. It&apos;s the perfect microcosm for the situation affecting Wear OS today. Google and Samsung are more committed to the platform today than at any point in its history, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">Wear OS is better than ever</a>. At the same time, it&apos;s less competitive because third-party OEMs are struggling to compete with Google and Samsung in the open market. </p>
<h2 id="why-is-fossil-done-with-smartwatches-2">Why is Fossil done with smartwatches?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3601px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="AdDq5dTRKcUAvEPbnSePKa" name="Fossil-Gen-6-Wellness-Edition-review-companion-app.jpg" alt="Fossil Gen 6 Wellness Edition with a smartphone running the companion app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AdDq5dTRKcUAvEPbnSePKa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3601" height="2025" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The idea that Fossil is exiting the Wear OS smartwatch market due to Samsung and Google&apos;s combined dominance isn&apos;t exactly speculation, either. In a January 2024 statement, along with the announcement that Fossil&apos;s Gen 6 would be its last, Fossil Group said something to that effect.</p><p>"As the smartwatch landscape has evolved significantly over the past few years, we have made the strategic decision to exit the smartwatch business," said a Fossil spokesperson. "Fossil Group is redirecting resources to support our core strength and the core segments of our business that continue to provide strong growth opportunities for us: designing and distributing exciting traditional watches, jewelry, and leather goods under our own as well as licensed brand names."</p><p>Fossil, talking about how the "smartwatch landscape has evolved significantly over the past few years," is clearly talking about the Wear OS resurgence. Why wouldn&apos;t Google and Samsung&apos;s newfound appreciation for the platform that powers Fossil products be helpful to the brand? Because those companies are building Wear OS, in part, around their own smartwatch hardware offerings. </p><p>Google released the Pixel Watch, for example, in October 2022. Google&apos;s entry into the Wear OS hardware market came about a year after Fossil originally released its Gen 6 lineup. The success of both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> and Galaxy Watch presumably led Fossil to believe it couldn&apos;t compete against the giants. </p>
<h2 id="the-wear-os-and-hybrid-smartwatch-market-now-has-one-less-major-player-2">The Wear OS and hybrid smartwatch market now has one less major player</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TL28cSJRE8wygXmpiTcxmR" name="Fossil-Gen-6-Hybrid-Wellness-Edition-review-outside-rain.jpg" alt="The Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid Wellness Edition on a wet surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TL28cSJRE8wygXmpiTcxmR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fossil&apos;s exit is a shame because while Wear OS is becoming more competitive against the Apple Watch, there is less competition <em>within </em>the smartwatch market. In particular, Fossil was known for making great hybrid smartwatches that combined a traditional mechanical clock with smart features and elements. Hybrid watches are an excellent way to get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">great wearables</a> on the wrists of people who don&apos;t just want a screen. Using the company&apos;s experience as a traditional watchmaker, Fossil made some of the best-looking hybrid smartwatches available.</p><p>Now, the market for high-quality hybrid smartwatches is becoming thin. Just like the broader Wear OS market, the options are better, but there are fewer options. The best hybrid smartwatch today is probably the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-2-and-scanwatch-light-launch">Withings ScanWatch</a> or a Garmin watch, but neither of those perfectly fills the gap left by Fossil.</p><p>In some cases, manufacturers have started supporting Wear OS after seeing the improvements Google and Samsung have made over the last few years. OnePlus added Wear OS to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, and Xiaomi now has Wear OS offerings once again. However, OnePlus and Xiaomi are both very large tech companies, and while their models are still quite new, brands with tech experience and expertise may be better equipped to survive in the new Wear OS market than those like Fossil. </p><p>Bigger tech companies, like OnePlus and Xiaomi, have the resources to compensate for their lack of involvement in Wear OS development. Smaller ones—or brands that specialize in watches or fashion rather than tech—can&apos;t figure out how to integrate the new Wear OS with their own strategies, given there&apos;s no phone or ecosystem to attach it to. Some brands, like Fossil, will choose to pack up and leave instead. </p>
<h2 id="wear-os-is-better-than-ever-x2014-for-google-and-samsung-2">Wear OS is better than ever — for Google and Samsung</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mFx9dLkFoZVkqNrNZqeuz4" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-bay-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mFx9dLkFoZVkqNrNZqeuz4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fossil&apos;s decision to exclude itself from the Wear OS market exemplifies the problem. Google and Samsung, the two companies most responsible for developing Wear OS, aren&apos;t doing enough to help third-party OEMs. Instead, they&apos;re designing and releasing Wear OS upgrades that benefit their own hardware. </p><p>For example, Google is debuting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wear-os-5-software-testing-spotted">Wear OS 5</a> preview at Google I/O 2024. There, it&apos;ll showcase new features to developers, likely on Pixel Watch devices. Then, the Wear OS 5 upgrade is widely expected to debut on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> lineup this summer. Of course, it&apos;ll come to Pixel Watch models later this year as well. Unfortunately, Wear OS manufacturers, not Samsung or Google, likely won&apos;t feel included in this process.</p><p>The issue extends beyond Fossil, too. Mobvoi has clearly struggled to keep up with the pace of Wear OS development — its flagship TicWatch Pro 5 smartwatch still doesn&apos;t have proper Wear OS 4 support (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-4-beta-recruitment-opens">though it&apos;s supposedly coming</a>), even after its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-announced">latest version of the watch</a> launched in May. Is Mobvoi to blame here, or is it just too difficult for third-party companies to support new Wear OS versions without being included? </p><p>For now, that&apos;s unclear. However, it&apos;ll be disappointing if more third-party OEMs leave Wear OS. A market with just Samsung and Google in it, no matter how good Pixel and Galaxy watches get, wouldn&apos;t be great for consumers. </p>

<p>We haven&apos;t dropped our official Google Pixel 8a review just yet, but first impressions suggest that the device will easily rank among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> released this year. </p><p>Starting at just $499 for the 128GB model, the phone boasts the same outstanding Tensor G3 chipset that powers the Google Pixel 8 Pro at half the price, plus you get an upgraded 120Hz AMOLED display and more battery life than any A series Pixel phone to date. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a> also comes with seven years of OS upgrades and the same camera tech that made its predecessor such a winning model.</p><p>Of course, Best Buy isn&apos;t the only retailer offering great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-deals-how-to-buy">Google Pixel 8a deals</a>, but this particular offer is notable for the sheer amount of free stuff you can receive. Instead of offering <em>just</em> trade-in credit or <em>just</em> a free gift card, Best Buy is allowing customers to stack the promos and earn some seriously impressive savings if they&apos;re able to meet all of the eligibility requirements. At bare minimum, you&apos;re getting a free $100 gift card when you buy the phone unlocked, which might be reason enough to choose Best Buy for your Pixel 8a needs.   </p>

<p>Amazon specializes in the budget segment of Android tablets, so the upper-tier Kindle Scribe is a surprise. Despite the lack of the Play Store, the Kindle Scribe is a fantastic e-reader and note-taking E Ink tablet. The price isn't the best, but the battery life and build quality are great.</p>

<p>While most E Ink displays tend to focus on doing one thing, the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C Pro does it all. Successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-tab-ultra-c-review">Tab Ultra C</a>, the Tab Ultra C Pro displays 4,096 colors on its 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 display, which is unusual for most E Ink tablets. Comics can be viewed in full color and you can even draw, highlight, or jot down notes in different shades thanks to the accompanying stylus. The Tab Ultra C Pro&apos;s touch function for the stylus is powered by Wacom, the company that makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-drawing-tablets" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-drawing-tablets">best drawing tablets</a>. It imitates the true blue traditional feel of writing on paper with a pen.</p>

<p>Onyx Boox really took things to the next level by adding more gear under the Tab Ultra C Pro&apos;s hood. This stunningly slim tablet runs Android 12 out of the box so you can actually install and use apps from the Google Play Store. It has 6GB of RAM, 128GB of onboard storage, a microSD slot, a 16MP camera, stereo speakers, a mic, a USB Type-C port that supports fast charging, and a set of speakers. Amazingly, the 4,600mAh battery can last for a week or two with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in full use. The Boox Tab Ultra C Pro is the complete package; it is almost a full-blown <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you want the complete package, you&apos;ll have to pay for it since this tablet isn&apos;t exactly cheap in comparison to "normal" tablets. It also lacks water and dust resistance, which is a bummer, and E Ink displays are famously dim in the sun. We believe you can live with these shortcomings as the combination of features in the Tab Ultra C Pro is just too good. As opposed to the Kindle Scribe, it provides more value and has so much more to offer.</p>

<p>For many years, Amazon has dominated the e-reader market with its Kindle line of reading tablets, and for good reason: Kindle e-readers are excellent devices and their displays have LED backlighting. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-kids-11th-gen-review">Kindle Paperwhite</a> is the absolute <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">best Amazon Kindle e-reader</a>, which makes it the best E Ink tablet for reading.</p>
<p>The 2021 iteration of the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite has IPX8 waterproof certification so you don&apos;t have to worry about getting it wet. You also get five adjustable LED backlights in the Kindle Paperwhite so it&apos;s fairly bright in sunlight. Its 6-inch 300ppi E Ink screen is a delight to look at and replicates paper very nicely. Audible integration makes it the perfect companion for lazy beach days when you want to sunbathe with your eyes closed. You can connect a pair of Bluetooth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> and listen to audiobooks in peace.</p>
<p>Amazon introduced a bunch of different colors for the Kindle Paperwhite so you have a lot of variety. There&apos;s 8GB or 16GB of internal storage, which is enough to store thousands of e-books. The battery life is excellent and you get a USB-C charging port. Amazon sweetened the deal by setting a low price but you&apos;ll need to spend a little extra cash for the ad-free version. If you&apos;re an avid reader, you won&apos;t be disappointed by the Kindle Paperwhite. Some file formats aren&apos;t supported, though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazons-kindle-e-readers-will-finally-support-the-most-popular-ebook-format">Amazon did introduce EPUB</a> compatibility to compensate.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re searching for a more writing-focused E Ink tablet, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/remarkable-2-review" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/remarkable-2-review">ReMarkable 2</a> is your best bet. Built from the ground up for this purpose, the ReMarkable 2 offers a premium writing experience. It has a 10.3-inch e-paper display that cannot display colors beyond black and white. It has Wi-Fi, USB Type-C charging, 8GB storage, a 3,000 mAh battery, and a cool magnetic accessory dock where you can store your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-android-phones-and-tablets">stylus</a>. Notes and other documents can be saved over the cloud, although the companion apps are a little buggy.</p>
<p>The software caters to handwritten notes and processing them for multiple purposes. You can take notes directly on PDF files or use OCR to scan your notes taken by hand. To jot down digital notes, you need to use the compatible stylus. It comes with the Marker Plus that has an eraser on the opposite end, so it functions just like a standard pencil. It&apos;s extremely fun to use.</p>
<p>The downside of getting the E Ink digital notebook from ReMarkable is that you&apos;ll have to break the bank to get one with all its accessories. Mercifully, the price of the ReMarkable 2 writing tablet has decreased quite a lot since its launch, but there&apos;s still the matter of finding one. And there&apos;s another hard pill to swallow as well. Because you can&apos;t access the Play Store on the ReMarkable 2, it&apos;s no good for any other task beyond jotting down notes.</p>
<p>If you&apos;re looking for the ultimate handwriting experience on an e-ink tablet, these pains are worth undertaking though.</p>

<p>The ReMarkable 2 tablet is great for writing, but it is also ridiculously expensive. On top of that, the stylus isn&apos;t even included in its base price. If you want better value, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-note-air-3-review">Onyx Boox Note Air 3</a> is a better buy overall. Onyx Boox tablets beat Amazon, Kobo, and every other competitor easily because they all have the Google Play Store and run Android 12.</p>
<p>The Onyx Boox Note Air 3 has a 10.3-inch black and white E Ink HD Carta 1200 display that has excellent contrast and a lovely crispness to it. It comes with a battery-free stylus that registers 4,096 degrees of pressure and you get native optical character recognition (OCR). This is such a vital feature for any tablet, whether it&apos;s an e-ink device or a full-blown traditional Android or iOS tablet. Unbelievably, the Kindle Scribe doesn&apos;t come with OCR which makes the Onyx Boox Note Air 3 the obvious answer when comparing the two devices.</p>
<p>Apart from the stylus and excellent e-paper screen, the Note Air 3 has all the advantages of e-ink tablets and e-readers as well as a few extras. You get weeks of battery life from its 3,700mAh cell, a USB-C port with OTG support, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, support for tons of file formats, speakers, and even a microphone!</p>
<p>When looking for a writing tablet with an e-paper display, the Onyx Boox Note Air 3 is easily the winning contender. This is saying something, considering the Note Air 3&apos;s foes include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-vs-remarkable-2">Amazon Kindle Scribe and the ReMarkable 2</a>. If you don&apos;t mind the price tag and lack of water resistance, this is the e-ink tablet to get for writing.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">Amazon Kindle Scribe</a> isn&apos;t the best value tablet on this list, nor does it offer the most amazing features and specs. It does, however, have that legendary Kindle build and insane battery life backing it. This thing lasts for several weeks on a single charge, which is exactly what you&apos;d expect from any decent Kindle.</p><p>For Kindle users, the Amazon Kindle Scribe is the perfect e-paper tablet. It doesn&apos;t have the Google Play Store and it doesn&apos;t support a lot of e-book formats. But the Kindle Store has an excellent collection of e-books and Audible brings you audiobooks in a portable form factor.</p><p>Now that Amazon has brought EPUB compatibility to Kindle devices, the Kindle Scribe is a lot more likable. You can easily send files to the e-reader slash tablet using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-send-articles-files-or-web-pages-to-your-amazon-kindle-device">Send to Kindle feature</a> and there&apos;s Bluetooth pairing for audiobooks.</p><p>The compatible Kindle Pen works well, there are no lags, and it feels really good to use. You can get a lot better e-paper tablets for the same price, but those who prefer Amazon&apos;s Kindle ecosystem will be very happy.</p>

<p>E Ink tablet lovers out there on a budget can still get one for a nifty price. The entry-level <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-2022-review">Amazon Kindle (2022)</a> is a budget e-reader sporting a 6-inch 300ppi e-paper display. It doesn&apos;t have many fancy features like a waterproof rating or Sudoku, but it can support a healthy number of file formats and looks brilliant.</p>
<p>It isn&apos;t that bright in sunlight but the adjustable front light is handy for late-night reading. The basic Amazon Kindle has some more no-nonsense specs like 16GB of storage, an insanely good battery life, Wi-Fi, and audiobook support. If you don&apos;t want to use the Kindle app, you can transfer files to the Amazon Kindle (2022) e-reader from your PC.</p>
<p>In comparison to almost every other e-paper device out there, the Amazon Kindle is the winner hands down when it comes to the price. The base model Kindle performs a tad bit slower and it doesn&apos;t have waterproofing, but it is still the best E Ink tablet for reading on a tight budget.</p>

The past two years, in particular, have been monumental for the Pixel A-series, significantly improving the specs and design to closely match that of the more expensive mainline Pixel series.</p><p>But there&apos;s always room for improvement and differentiation, especially as Google continues to hike the price of the phones in some regions. Few rumors for the Pixel 9a currently exist—and there are no leaks at this time—although it&apos;s also possible that Google may ditch the A-series completely. However, we can still speculate on Google&apos;s 2025 mid-range phone by looking at the past to get a clearer view of the future.</p>

<p>Last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1652928398099087360">one analyst noted</a> that the Pixel 8a wouldn&apos;t exist, but that clearly didn&apos;t pan out. So far, we have rumors that the Pixel 9a exists and will feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-display-rumor">a bigger display</a> than the Pixel 8a, but a few trends with the Pixel family seem to be telling a bigger picture.</p><p>This year, it&apos;s said that Google will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">releasing three models</a> of the Pixel 9: the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Additionally, Google is allegedly renaming its second-generation folding phone to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-successor-name-change-rumors">Pixel 9 Fold</a>, meaning it&apos;ll launch four Pixel 9 phones by the end of 2024.</p><p>This would be the largest number of Pixel phone models that Google has launched at once, and it makes us wonder if Google is slowly shifting its strategy of releasing a cheaper A-series phone half a year after the mainline Pixel release.</p><p>Additionally, Google has been slowly increasing the price of the Pixel A-series over the past few years, making it more closely priced to the cheapest mainline Pixel phone than ever.</p><p>If Google is releasing one cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> from the get-go and the price of the A-series continues to rise, why would there be a need for an A-series at all?</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9a-design-and-displays"><span>Google Pixel 9a: Design and displays</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1919px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="kkJ2NWYxQ3nmHRPbGHqbJm" name="google-pixel-9-render-colors-technizo-concept.jpg" alt="Renders of a leaked Google Pixel 9 concept by Technizo Concept on YouTube" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kkJ2NWYxQ3nmHRPbGHqbJm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1919" height="1079" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A leaked render of the Google Pixel 9 Pro </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Technizo Concept on YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Historically, the Pixel A-series uses a similar design to the main series with a few tweaks. In the Pixel 8a&apos;s case, the corners are a slightly wider curve than the Pixel 8 series, making even more of a squircle.</p><p>That means a potential Pixel 9a should look very similar to the Pixel 9, which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-renders-leak">been leaked several times</a> and looks an awful lot like an iPhone. That includes completely flat side rails, a completely flat back, and a completely flat display. Google flattened the display on the Pixel 8 but the Pixel 9 is supposed to finish up the flattening of the series.</p>

<p>More than likely, if Google releases a Pixel 9a, it&apos;ll look a lot like the Pixel 9 leaked renders pictured above. That should also include a matte back, as Google swapped the shiny plastic back with a higher-quality matte one on the Pixel 8a, making it feel more premium.</p><p>YouTube concept artist <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgcq5Cgk_kQ">Technozo Concept has a video</a> of leaked Pixel 9 CAD designs that showcase the phone&apos;s potential design in stunning detail along with a choice of potential new colors. While this video is of the Pixel 9, it gives us an idea of what we could expect from a potential Pixel 9a.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9a-cameras"><span>Google Pixel 9a: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XJrBJTbAnK5LULvLJybsBG" name="google-pixel-8a-official-lifestyle-obsidian-01.jpg" alt="A person holding an Obsidian Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XJrBJTbAnK5LULvLJybsBG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel A-series began with the Pixel 3a and Google used the same camera modules from that phone through the Pixel 6a. The Pixel 7a featured the first camera sensor upgrade in the series&apos; history, and the Pixel 8a uses the same camera modules as that phone.</p><p>That being said, there&apos;s little reason to expect Google to upgrade the cameras on a potential Pixel 9a because it needs to cut costs somewhere to keep the phone&apos;s price reasonable. Given that the Pixel A-series already has the best cameras of any budget-minded phone, there&apos;s little incentive for Google to change things up.</p><p>If a rumor or leak appears showing the opposite, we&apos;ll absolutely be updating this section.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9a should use the same Google Tensor G4 processor as the Pixel 9 is rumored to use. While this is an assumption, of course, it would logically follow that Google would use the same processor in all phones with the Pixel 9 moniker as it has historically shared the same processor across the Pixel line in any given generation since the Pixel 6a.</p><p>That means the Pixel 9a would use the same processor as the inevitably more expensive Pixel 9 Fold and Pixel 9 Pro XL, despite the huge gap in price that&apos;s likely to occur.</p><p>Tensor G4 is rumored to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-samsung-upgraded-tensor-g4-process">only a minor upgrade</a> over the Tensor G3 that&apos;s in the Pixel 8a. Google is not expected to deliver a massive upgrade to its Tensor line <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g5-chip-testing-preparations">until Tensor G5</a>, currently slated for the 2025 release of the Pixel 10 series.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Pixel 9a would likely chip with the Tensor G4 processor, rumored to be only a minor upgrade over the Tensor G3 inside the Pixel 8a.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While Tensor G4 may not deliver big performance upgrades over Tensor G3 if rumors are to be believed, it&apos;s possible that Google could use the newer Samsung SF4P manufacturing process as a way to make the chipset more efficient.</p><p>Samsung has been the manufacturer of Google Tensor processors since the beginning and used this new manufacturing process in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400</a> to increase efficiency and battery life, plus help keep its processors cool enough to match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> in many areas.</p><p>There&apos;s no expectation that Tensor G4 will be quite this powerful but any improvement is always welcome.</p><p>There are no other rumors or leaks about Pixel 9a specs at this time. It&apos;s highly unlikely that we&apos;ll see many major upgrades for Pixel 9a components since Google just upgraded most of the requested items — like the display refresh rate — in the Pixel 8a.</p>

<p>As with any new phone, there are a few things we&apos;d love to see Google improve on the Pixel 9a over existing phones like the Pixel 8a.</p>
<p><strong>A lower-priced option</strong></p><p>The Pixel 6a, 7a, and 8a are all great phones that offer <em>a lot</em> of value, but a $450-500 phone is still financially out of reach for a lot of people. In fact, the Galaxy A-series makes up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-smartphone-sales-q4-2021">the bulk of the sales</a> for Samsung. Google&apos;s Pixel market share <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-market-share-grows-in-us-despite-a-decline-in-phone-sales-overall">continues to grow</a>, and there&apos;s little doubt the Pixel A-series has a big part in this.</p><p>How much more could it grow, then, if Google offered a <em>truly</em> budget-priced model? We&apos;re talking something under $300 that could still offer the Pixel experience, even if it had to cut back on some of the more premium features of the Pixel series — like the <strong>latest</strong> Google Tensor processors or upgraded camera modules.</p>
<p><strong>Further improved Tensor</strong></p><p>We don&apos;t have too much hope for this one given that the Tensor G4 is rumored to only be a minor upgrade over the Tensor G3, but we certainly can wish! But even if Google can&apos;t do much to supercharge the current Tensor architecture without causing problems, having a chip like the Tensor G4 inside a mid-range phone like the Google Pixel 9a is already incredible as it is.</p>
<p><strong>A real dark mode</strong></p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/dark-mode-is-a-lie">Dark mode is a lie</a> on more phones than I&apos;d like. Unfortunately for Pixel owners, the Pixel is one of the worst offenders of this sin. I&apos;d love to see Google give users a proper "lights out" dark mode where the background is completely black instead of this dark grey nonsense Google has been using for years.</p><p>It&apos;ll both be better for battery life and help with the next request!</p>
<p><strong>Flicker-reduction option</strong></p><p>As the nits delivered by displays continue to grow higher and higher each year, more companies are using OLED displays that don&apos;t dim in a traditional way. Instead, they use Pulse Width Modulation (or PWM), and people like me are, unfortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-display-flickering">very sensitive</a> to this kind of display flickering.</p><p>While we have some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">tips and tricks for PWM-sensitive</a> folks, the best solution is for manufacturers to offer a flicker-reduction option. Companies like Motorola and OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">offer anti-flicker solutions</a> on their phones, and we know Google can do it if they really wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>Faster charging</strong></p><p>Google has largely been using the same 18W charging speed for its phones since the inception of the Pixel line. While it upgraded the Pixel 7 and Pixel 8 to 30W, the Pixel 8a still only supports 18W charging.</p><p>Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, which costs the same $499 as the Pixel 8a, offer 100W wired charging at the expense of removing wireless charging. Considering how truly slow (and probably useless) 7.5W wireless charging is, I&apos;d be happy to see wireless charging go away if it meant we could get faster wired charging.</p>

<hr>
<p>If you&apos;ve been holding out hope for a new TicWatch, you&apos;re in luck as the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro has just been announced. This is the latest smartwatch in Mobvoi&apos;s lineup, and at first glance, looks practically identical to its predecessor. </p><p>The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> arrived last year and quickly became one of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a>. This is in large part due to the 90 hours of battery life in Smart Mode, and being capable of lasting for up to 45 days in Essential Mode. Well, Mobvoi has done it again, in kind of a literal sense, as the Pro 5 Enduro offers the same battery life claims. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DJCt7AKaBD92ovXNQNG8XU" name="ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-16.jpg" alt="Weight lifting while wearing TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DJCt7AKaBD92ovXNQNG8XU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mobvoi)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, you would be hard-pressed to notice much of a difference unless you held the two side-by-side. From a design perspective, the only major changes come in the form of the new Sapphire Crystal Glass that sits atop the 1.43-inch AMOLED + ULP Display. This is an upgrade from the Corning Gorilla Glass found on the previous model and puts Mobvoi on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a>. </p><p>The other design change that Mobvoi points out is that the rotating crown has been "entirely redesigned." The crown is ever-so-slightly larger, which makes it easier to scroll through menus and cards. Speaking of larger, the Side Button has also been changed, now matching the finish of the casing, as opposed to the previously used ridged design.</p>

<p>With these changes, the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro is now slightly heavier, as it weighs 44.8g, compared to the Pro 5&apos;s 44.3g. That, paired with the 24mm band, will likely leave many potential buyers out to dry, as it&apos;s simply too large for some. </p>

<p>Many of the other differentiating features of the Pro 5 Enduro are software-related. Namely, you can now use the Ultra-low-power Display to keep track of your workouts while using third-party apps. Mobvoi specifically calls out the likes of Nike Run Club and Strava, allowing you to view various metrics during workouts without actually turning on the OLED display.</p><p>Mobvoi is also introducing "snoring detection" with the Pro 5 Enduro. This is said to offer "valuable insights to enhance users&apos; overall sleep quality and well-being." Unfortunately, there is a "catch," as there&apos;s a "VIP sleep subscription" found within the Mobvoi app. On the bright side, Mobvoi is including a "12-month free VIP sleep subscription" with every Pro 5 Enduro purchase.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="r8C3ZHkQrGyecAar6HafPV" name="ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-05.jpg" alt="Man sleeping while wearing TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r8C3ZHkQrGyecAar6HafPV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mobvoi)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite Mobvoi recently announcing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-4-beta-recruitment-opens">Wear OS 4 beta</a> for the Pro 5, it seems that even the Pro 5 Enduro owners will have to get in line for the update. Out of the box, the Pro 5 Enduro ships with Wear OS 3.5, which is rather disappointing given that we&apos;re hopeful to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">Wear OS 5 at Google I/O 2024</a>. This only puts Mobvoi further behind in a space that&apos;s only gotten smaller now that Fossil has exited the smartwatch market.</p><p>The price is the final potential barrier of entry for the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro. It retails for $349 and is available from either Mobvoi or Amazon starting today. This is the same retail price as the TicWatch Pro 5. However, you can currently save almost $90. While we were hoping for more than one color, it wasn&apos;t meant to be, as the Pro 5 Enduro is only currently available in the "Obsidian" finish. </p>

All of those people are wrong, but it&apos;s not really their fault.</p><p>You can indeed sideload a semi-working version of what the device does on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, but enthusiasts have been able to do similar things since the beginning of the Android explosion. HTC&apos;s Sense UI ran on a <em>lot</em> of Motorola Droids.</p>
<p>This makes it feel like the software is just an app. However, saying it leaves out some things to think about. I think there are a lot of similarities between what the company is doing and the phone in your hands right now. Calling it an app is missing the point.</p>
<h2 id="services-and-features-are-what-sells-phones-2">Services and features are what sells phones</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YcMNVPGPdvh6VTJEcfRgGW" name="imessage-green-bubble.jpeg" alt="An iMessage chat showing blue and green bubbles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YcMNVPGPdvh6VTJEcfRgGW.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> is a hardware-based gateway to the company&apos;s software services. It ties other services like Spotify and Uber together so you can use them through a single interface by talking to the device or tapping a few buttons.</p><p>It&apos;s centered around a custom launcher that runs atop the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">Android Open Source Project</a>. That shouldn&apos;t surprise you because Android powers plenty of devices besides phones; things like car and airplane infotainment systems, network appliances, toys, and even industrial machinery can be found using Android for the "smart stuff."</p>
<p>It&apos;s not difficult to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources">sideload</a> this onto your phone and get a taste of what the company is trying to do. You won&apos;t get everything working, and things that worked one day may stop working the next as Rabbit tries to put Pandora back in her box.</p><p>This is because the company uses the R1&apos;s hardware to authenticate that you&apos;re an authorized user. This means the company can place barriers on any or all of the device&apos;s software features so they only work if you&apos;re actually using the R1. </p>
<p>This is nothing new, and almost every phone manufacturer does the same. If you want to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-camera-v9-2-update">Pixel camera software features</a>, you need to buy a Pixel. If you want to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">Samsung&apos;s One UI</a>, you buy a Galaxy phone. If you want to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-the-real-reason-imessage-isnt-available-android">iMessage</a>, you buy an iPhone. We see software that could potentially run on many devices being exclusive to one brand all the time because it&apos;s being used to make people want to buy them.</p><p>You can sideload some of these features to another phone, but not everything works as expected. It&apos;s easy to install the Pixel camera app onto another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">phone with a great camera</a>, but it&apos;s not the same. The software is looking for specific hardware because it was written that way. Rabbit&apos;s software is doing the same thing.</p>

<p>I&apos;m not defending Rabbit or the R1. I&apos;ve never used it, nor do I want to use it, and I think the idea of a device that duplicates things your phone can already do is really dumb. Other people think it&apos;s great, and I&apos;m not trying to change their minds. Buy the things you like. I&apos;d totally buy a high-end music player built inside the same body as the R1, but many people would think that is silly.</p><p>I&apos;m just trying to explain that what Rabbit is doing isn&apos;t really that different from what Samsung or Apple is doing. That&apos;s the problem with trying to explain tech "stuff" — no matter how hard you try or how many words you write, some people aren&apos;t going to understand what you&apos;re trying to say.</p>
<p>I think that&apos;s what happened here. Yes, you can install the software on your phone. No, not everything works because it&apos;s not just the app doing the work.</p><p>If you really want a dedicated AI device to do what the R1 does, you&apos;d be better off buying one and hoping the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/edzitron/status/1787516008049287440">stays around long enough to support it</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If the Google Pixel series is famous for anything in particular, it&apos;s the camera. But just behind that ranks the immense value presented by Google&apos;s own smartphones, which often debut at lower prices than the competition yet offer more updates in the long run.</p><p>The Google Pixel 8a was just announced, and it&apos;s the crown jewel of value for the company, delivering what looks to be the best Pixel A-series experience yet. The hardware appears to be nearly identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a>, yet the Pixel 8a is $200 cheaper. It certainly makes me wonder why anyone would bother buying the more expensive Pixel 8 at this point.</p><p>But is the Pixel 8a the right phone for you? Let&apos;s start by taking a look at the specs compared to last year&apos;s Pixel 7a to see if it makes sense for you to order a Pixel 8a today.</p>

<p>Based on specs alone, the Pixel 8a is a fairly menial upgrade over the Pixel 7a. You get the Tensor G3, a processor that&apos;s a year newer and runs quite a bit cooler than the Tensor G2 in the Pixel 7a. If you have a Pixel 7a, it doesn&apos;t make any sense to upgrade to a Pixel 8a, though. There&apos;s just not enough change to warrant the cost.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Based on specs alone, the Pixel 8a is a fairly menial upgrade over the Pixel 7a.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Google also upgraded the display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1,400 nits of brightness, although we&apos;re not yet sure if they improved the PWM rate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">as Samsung did</a> with some of its 2024 phones. Comparatively, the Pixel 7a has a 90Hz display capable of 1,000 nits of brightness and has a 360Hz PWM rate at all brightness levels.</p><p>Despite increasing the battery by a little over 100mAh, Google managed to decrease the weight by just over 5 grams. This minor battery size increase, coupled with the slightly more efficient Tensor G3, gives us hope that the battery life might see some improvements.</p><p>Google also swapped out the nasty shiny back of the Pixel 7a with a "matte composite back" and aluminum frame on the Pixel 8a. That shiny fingerprint magnet back on the 7a was easily the most annoying part of the phone&apos;s design, so it&apos;s great to see that directly addressed this year.</p>

<p>However, the most exciting upgrade might just be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">inclusion of Gemini Nano</a>. This makes the Pixel 8a the only phone under $500 to come with Gemini Nano, a big shift from last Fall when Google reserved its upgraded AI assistant and shipped it only with its most expensive phone, the Pixel 8 Pro.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Pixel 8a has all the AI features Google advertises as important for its most expensive Pixel phones.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>That means the Pixel 8a has all the AI features Google advertises as important for its most expensive Pixel phones, including Best Take, Magic Editor, Audio Magic Eraser, Real Tone in video, Guided Frame on both the front and rear cameras, Circle to Search, Call Assist, and more.</p><p>Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-one-vpn-will-be-sunset-later-this-year">by the end of this year</a>, owning a Pixel phone will be the <strong>only</strong> way to get the free VPN by Google One feature. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn">best VPN services for Android</a> all offer better features than Google&apos;s VPN, but you have to pay extra for those services, obviously.</p><p>Considering that most phones in this price range don&apos;t have <em>any</em> of these features adds even more value to the Pixel 8a. Plus, all of these upgrades come without raising the price of the base model — as long as you&apos;re in the U.S. at least.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:716px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="v4xcb6kXnVfxKPm8EQL9c7" name="google-pixel-8a-colors-169.jpg" alt="All of the official color options for the Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v4xcb6kXnVfxKPm8EQL9c7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="716" height="403" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>While it's not unreasonable for Google to raise prices for better products, last year's Pixel 7a already received a price increase in all regions.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>However, some regions, like Canada, are seeing a price increase with this year&apos;s Pixel 8a release. Considering that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-pixel-7a-deals">Pixel 7a deals</a> will often get you that phone for $350 or less, it would be much harder to recommend the 8a in these regions.</p><p>Last year, Google raised the price of its Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro by $100 to offset the company offering seven years of support in addition to a bevy of other improvements, including better hardware build quality.</p><p>While it&apos;s not unreasonable for Google to raise prices for better products, last year&apos;s Pixel 7a already received a price increase in <em>all</em> regions, not just a select few. Being selected as a region to receive increased prices certainly doesn&apos;t feel very nice.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Pixel phones have had a lot of problems over the past few years, but the Pixel A-series has skirted around most of them.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>And there&apos;s really no ignoring the myriad of problems Google has had with Pixel phones and updates over the years. Google&apos;s Tensor line of processors are incredible for many reasons but they have a tendency to run hotter than processors from Qualcomm or MediaTek.</p><p>Just search Google for Pixel overheating, and you&apos;ll find a slew of articles <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/14oyovy/pixel_7_overheating/">and forum posts</a> over the years talking about this issue. Tensor G3 runs cooler, but the processor didn&apos;t improve performance much compared to the Tensor G2 in order to keep it from running hot regularly.</p><p>Google also seems to have a QA problem with some of its updates. Back in October, Pixel 6 owners ran into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-6-storage-bug-android-14">a crucial storage bug</a> that made it nearly impossible to use the phone until a fix was issued. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-internal-storage-access-bug-january-play-system">A nearly identical bug</a> reared its ugly head earlier this year and affected nearly all Pixels, not just the Pixel 6, leaving some users with a useless phone until a patch was issued <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-details-pixel-storage-bug-temporary-fix">over a week later</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.45%;"><img id="Pyzv53fjAQb2Z7gf7Rr39e" name="google-pixel-8a-official-hero.jpg" alt="All Google Pixel 8a colorways arranged around the name of the phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pyzv53fjAQb2Z7gf7Rr39e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1320" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Plus, we&apos;ve seen updates cause <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro-battery-drain-and-network-issues">awful battery drain issues</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-second-april-patch-cell-service-rollout">cellular connectivity issues</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-6-battery-overheating-issues">overheating issues</a>, just to point out a few problems that have amassed over the years.</p><p>The silver lining? Almost none of these issues seem to have affected the Pixel A-series of phones. In the past, that&apos;s because Google changed some key hardware components between a mainline Pixel phone like the Pixel 7 and the budget-minded A-series of that generation — in this example, the Pixel 7a.</p><p>According to our sources, however, Google has apparently used the Pixel 8&apos;s hardware as a base for this phone, meaning it could be susceptible to any update mistakes that might cause problems for the mainline Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro.</p><p>But while these things hold a bit of a cloud over the launch, I still feel more confident than buying a Pixel 8a than a mainline series Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro, mainly because the A-series has long skirted the issues mainline Pixels have faced. Plus, there&apos;s just something satisfying in knowing that you got features once reserved for more expensive phones at a fraction of the price.</p>
