<ul><li>Google detailed two new features arriving for NotebookLM, beginning with a "customize" button to guide the AI hosts in Audio Overviews.</li><li>The other feature lets users listen to their generated audio files in the background while working elsewhere in the app.</li><li>Google is also starting its pilot program for a "NotebookLM for Business."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We've had a little over a month to experience NotebookLM's "Audio Overviews" and Google is taking the next step as it sheds the experimental tag.</p><p>With two new features on the way, the company looks to deliver more ways for users to get more out of their Audio Overviews in NotebookLM. In a Keyword <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-update-october-2024/">blog post</a>, Google states its digital note-taker is receiving a tool that lets users "guide the conversation." Before starting a "deep dive," the post states users can write specific instructions for the AI to adhere to.</p><p>Users will find a new "Customize" button beside the standard "Generate" one. Clicking it will open a floating text box that asks what the AI should focus on. This is likely where users can fine-tune the AI to their needs; however, Google gives a few suggestions.</p><p>Users can tell the AI to focus on a specific source, topic, or audience.</p><p>The other feature joining the fray today (Oct 17) adds background listening. Google says users can start an Audio Overview and then hop out and retain the ability to do other things within their digital notebook.</p><p>Lastly, the post highlights the introduction of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notebooklm.google/business">NotebookLM for Business</a>. Those interested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notebooklm.google/business">must apply</a> as Google says its pilot program has begun. If you're selected, you will gain early access to "new product features, training, and email support." Since this is for business folk, Google states this version of NotebookLM lets users focus on sales via product roadmaps and feature specs.</p><p>Additionally, there are Training & Onboarding tools and more for marketing and product development.</p>

<p>Google debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overviews</a> in NotebookLM in mid-September. The application turns your scribbled notes/research into an audio file read aloud by AI. The feature delivers two AI "hosts," which makes it feel like you're listening to a radio talk show fueled by your research. Google states the AI hosts can summarize the provided material and "make connections" between subjects.</p><p>Users can add follow-up questions to these Audio Overviews and more. However, Google warns that the AI is prone to making mistakes (hallucinating), so it's best to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-notebooklm-limited-launch">backtrack its statements</a>.</p><p>What's more, Google reiterates the app's usage of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-1-5-next-gen-ai-model">Gemini 1.5</a> model. Its performance is roughly 87% better than the original 1.0 model and its ability to deliver "relevant and useful" information has been enhanced.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If there is one thing Android users do better than anyone else, it's making a fuss over things that aren't really mysterious or misleading. Thanks to internet brand rivalry and one-sided loyalty to a company that doesn't even know you exist, every little thing can quickly become a scandal.</p><p>The latest example of this is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> (and every Pixel phone before it) doesn't support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/text-message-exploits-are-scarier-than-ever-but-you-can-protect-yourself-with-these-tips">Android 15's stingray protections</a>. No, not the swimming, fishy kind of stingray; the small device designed to capture your SMS messages and phone calls.</p>
<p>The heart of the issue is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-mobile-network-security-pixel-3490909/">these settings did appear in beta builds of Android 15</a> on the Pixel, even though they did nothing because the phone's hardware or configuration doesn't support it. When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> proper came around, they were gone. As they should have been because they are not supported.</p><p>That's it. Nothing more. Many phones don't support these features, but because the Pixel comes from Google, who worked on ways to fight this, some folks think there is some sort of conspiracy afoot or something. I don't work for Google, but I can assure you there isn't. When and if the feature can be supported, the settings will appear.</p>

<p>This is worth noting because if you are interested in the protections offered here, you should know which phones actually support them. If you're like everyone else who wasn't going to use them anyway, feel free to say "huh" and move on to the next thing without any guilt over not participating in the outrage. This is why beta builds exist â€” to catch mistakes like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/335438231?pli=1">exposing an invalid setting before a product comes to market</a>. If not having this feature influences your buying decisions, don't buy a Pixel phone, and you're good.</p><p>There is something to think about here, though: what does phone security mean, and can complaining really make a difference?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N7Nvx7CVWYiToqZw8BHgM9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-translate-messages-official-01.jpg" alt="An official Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus promo image showcasing the message translate feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N7Nvx7CVWYiToqZw8BHgM9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For some people, being an active target of phone hacking is a valid concern. The rich, the famous, the leaders of the world, these folks have to worry about someone getting into their phones and digging for information they do not want to share. Smart people with these needs have a professional manage their communication devices and use hardened and/or strictly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-business/1000">locked down devices</a> that are a lot safer than the phone you bought off Amazon. Others need to depend that their phone has the latest patches against remote exploits and features like stingray protection.</p><p>Most likely, you don't fall into any of these groups and are like me: just an average person who still doesn't want anyone to see anything I don't want to share. Security is still important, but not in the same way and not for the same reasons. We need protection from ourselves.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vBh9sfJXpxS7PQfMzmHdx5" name="google-pixel-9-vs-oneplus-12-15.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 vs. OnePlus 12 back view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBh9sfJXpxS7PQfMzmHdx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For us, the most important part of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-important-are-android-security-patches">security-focused patch or update</a> is the things that keep some random bit of code from doing things it shouldn't be allowed to do because we clicked OK on the wrong thing. Maybe we followed a link we shouldn't have, and something got downloaded. Maybe we installed an app that tries to do things it shouldn't. Maybe someone installed something when we weren't looking. This happens far more often than when foreign spies actively target our devices or SMS messages, but it can have the same result.</p><p>When the company that made your phone holds these security updates from you, and you get upset, that's a lot more productive than crying foul when a phone doesn't support a thing it was never advertised as supporting. Neither may make a difference because the companies involved rarely care about anything but profits, but our continued complaining might; even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/we/smartphones-moto-g-75-5g/p?skuId=631">Motorola now sells phones</a> that get software support for six years or more.</p>
<p>Maybe being outraged is the right call. That's for you to decide, and I'll decide where to focus my displeasure. Complaining about a thing long enough can make a difference.</p><p>Just complain about the right thing â€” Pixel phones (and all phones) should support some security issue Google found important enough to make part of Android itself. A setting that was in beta software but missing from the release build is a different story.</p>

<hr>
<p>On Thursday, Oct. 17, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company's second major reorganization of 2024.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/changes-knowledge-information-gemini-app-deepmind/">a blog post</a>, Pichai explained the reorg to the public and Google staff, with AI at its core. The post states that "AI moves faster than any technology before it," and it seems Google's leaders are interested in "simplifying" the structure behind the creation process. To achieve this, Pichai states a couple of its AI teams will see new homes, beginning with the Gemini app team.</p><p>Led by Sissi Hsiao, the Gemini app team will now merge with Google's DeepMind team, spearheaded by Demis Hassabis. Moving quickly is the goal, as Pichai states merging these two teams should quicken the deployment of new AI models in the app. Additionally, Google is interested in improving the "feedback" loop.</p><p>The other reorganization sees Google moving its Assistant teams into its recently created Platform & Devices team. The company wants to bring its "AI-powered home initiatives into one team and focus on improving user experience."</p><p>The remainder of Google's reorg sees notable members finding new (and familiar) roles. Pichai highlights Prabhakar Raghavan's return to computer science as he becomes the new Chief Technologist. Raghavan was formerly involved in the Knowledge & Information team, which helped facilitate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overviews-test-expansion">AI Overviews</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, and shopping capabilities <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-new-search-feature-lets-you-find-objects-using-a-mix-of-text-and-images">with Lens</a>.</p><p>In this new role, Raghavan is expected to "provide technical direction and leadership."</p><p>Additionally, Nick Fox is shifting into a lead role (SVP) in the K&I team to handle Search, Ads, Geo, and Commerce-related products.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-hardware-team-restructuring-merge">first reorganization this year was detailed</a> by Pichai in April. That restructuring created the Platform & Devices team we've seen the Assistant team move into today. The P&D team merges Google's Android and hardware teams under one roof to drive "computing forward." Pichai saw this as a chance to further the company's hardware, software, and AI efforts.</p><p>Google also shifted several of its research teams into the new Platform & Devices world to "deepen" the AI experience across all of its devices. Those teams involved are responsible for computational photography and on-device intelligence.</p><p>Google has doubled down on its on-device capabilities through Gemini as it introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-flash-model-access-expands">1.5 Flash model</a> in May. This "faster" model is optimized with a bigger context window so Gemini can understand complex queries quicker and answer them without much waiting. Then there's the extreme amount of AI packed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on#section-google-pixel-9-series-tons-of-new-features">into the Pixel 9 series</a>, which brings notable features. Users picking up the phones will find tools like Pixel Screenshots, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>, and more.</p>

<ul><li>A supposed rendering of the OnePlus 13 surfaced, showcasing a previously rumored change to its circular camera array and (perhaps) a textured back panel.</li><li>Another image, which is an alleged live image, shows off the device in white.</li><li>The OnePlus 13 may pick up a new BOE "X2 screen" at 6.8 inches with 2K resolution.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Images of the OnePlus 13 surface and point us toward a few design changes for the next flagship.</p><p>The latest rumors are two-pronged, with known <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1846936302538608802">X tipster OnLeaks</a> showcasing a rendering of the phone alongside a real-life image. The first image shows the phone in a seemingly official capacity against a blackwood beam. The supposed rendering displays the phone with a familiar rear design; however, the circular camera array differs slightly from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>.</p><p>For one, it seems the LED flash has found its way <em>into </em>the array, instead of sitting as an outlier top left. Moreover, this is likely due to the other design change, which removes the shiny "hinge" piece. It was more aesthetical than anything as the piece "connected" the array to the shiny OnePlus 12 frame.</p><p>With it gone, the OnePlus 13&apos;s rear array sits on its own and its apparent Hasselblad camera branding sits outside the housing, too. The device&apos;s predecessor offered a smooth "matte" backing, but the OnePlus 13&apos;s version seems textured.</p><p>Perhaps another change is the lack of curvature with the phone&apos;s back panel. It seems relatively straightforward until it hits the corners. Then, the device flattens out on the sides with rounded corners.</p><p>OnLeaks tacked on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1846937690358378742">supposed live image</a> of the next OnePlus phone alongside the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-and-x8-pro-specs-leak">OPPO Find X8</a>. This photo shows the phone in white, and with a better glimpse at that slight camera array change.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Alleged first #OnePlus13 picture currently spreading over Chinese social media... pic.twitter.com/bBeNkVDrU5<a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1846936302538608802">October 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>This alleged look at the OnePlus 13&apos;s rear panel echoes what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-oneplus-13-leaks-point-to-redesign-and-upgraded-fingerprint-sensor">we heard in March</a> about that "hinge." The tipster stated the Chinese OEM was moving to remove that side piece that connected the camera housing to the side rails. Having the "hinge" there didn&apos;t harm anything, though it&apos;s likely OnePlus is looking to give the device a (small) refresh.</p><p>Earlier this month, OnePlus head, Li Jie showed off a new BOE display called the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-display-sourced-by-boe-surfaces-online">X2 screen</a>." Jie shared an image of this new display, but rumors quickly surfaced from other sources, claiming it could measure 6.8 inches with a 2K resolution. Enjoyable brightness and outstanding streamed HDR content are also expected as OnePlus leaned on BOE for a previous device.</p><p>Other internal leaks claim the OnePlus 13 will feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-memory-config-price-rumors">24GB of RAM</a>. Early rumors claim this device will be the only one to offer such a large memory size. What&apos;s more, this 24GB variant could be the device&apos;s top configuration â€” and a price jump for it is expected. The OnePlus 13 will likely rock Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 SoC and launch earlier this time.</p>

<ul><li>A report claims Samsung is interested in boosting the capabilities of its on-device Galaxy AI to "predict" a user's needs.</li><li>This potential AI update is rumored to remove a user's need to dive into their settings as the AI will handle all their needs.</li><li>Samsung's Head of Mobile, TM Roh mentioned that its R&D personnel were focusing hard on AI as the "AI phone" has become the brand's new main business.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors surface regarding Samsung&apos;s alleged interest in superpowering its Galaxy AI with the ability to "predict" what you want.</p><p>A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20241013000049">ETNews</a> (Korean) claims Samsung is working to improve its Galaxy AI so much that users never need their settings menu (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-phones-replace-settings-menu-ai-predictions/">SamMobile</a>). The publication states the Korean OEM is looking to improve the "touch points" of its Galaxy devices with this AI upgrade.</p><p>These key points supposedly concern a user&apos;s keyboard and camera. Through this, rumors state Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> could advance to a point that it can "predict" what a user wants and deliver it to them without much manual input. The report adds that this is a new "AI software strategy" that Samsung is beginning to pursue, so more concrete details are unknown.</p><p>It also added that Samsung will look to "transform" the user experience on its Galaxy devices through its on-device AI.</p><p>What&apos;s curious is how far this could stretch beyond leaving the settings menu in the dust. The publication reiterates Bixby&apos;s voice command function to handle a user&apos;s task. More importantly, it notes that Galaxy phones don&apos;t have a way to "analyze" a person&apos;s habits for more practical uses.</p><p>A major update like this would be a dramatic shift for Samsung&apos;s AI, but we&apos;ve heard similar teasers from the company&apos;s Head of Mobile, TM Roh. Following its summer Unpacked event, Roh highlighted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discusses-the-ai-phone-future">Samsung&apos;s R&D&apos;s newfound focus</a> on advancing Galaxy AI. Roh stated Samsung sees the "AI phone" as its main business following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sales-of-samsung-flagships-are-reportedly-surging-despite-an-overall-dip">its recent success</a>.</p><p>Samsung sees the future of AI becoming "multi-modal" as it continues to work on it. Moreover, these changes could force the company to switch up its hardware to support its AI ambitions. Such changes could include improving the on-device sensors and larger screens.</p>

<p>Aside from Galaxy AI, Samsung is also interested in boosting the capabilities of its assistant, Bixby. TM Roh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-bixby-gen-ai-overhual-confirmed">detailed Samsung&apos;s plans</a> to "advance Bixby with application of Gen AI technology." The company&apos;s Head of Mobile did not explain the specifics behind this major Bixby update; however, user convenience was mentioned. Roh added that generative AI features are a "strong motivator" and "driver" for consumers to purchase its Galaxy devices.</p>

<p>At around 11 a.m., you realize there's a new pain in your leg that you haven't experienced before, so you make a quick phone call to the doctor, and, in a minute, your robot companion emerges from the closet, entirely remote-controlled by your doctor. They can run scans, have a full conversation, and even perform exams, all without you having to leave your home and go through the irritating task of trying to find transportation across town.</p><p>Later in the day, that same robot is driven by your 10-year-old grandson who just sat down with you at your dinner table. You have a very real, human conversation with them, despite living several states away, including videos of his latest whittling project and tales about what happened at school recently.</p><p>Nothing replaces full face-to-face human interaction, but the ability for a fully remote-controlled robot that can be embodied by anyone with a VR headset like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> is a future I want to fully embrace. Tesla's "We, Robot" event this week helped me realize that this idea is something fully possible right now with the right technology and it, once again, proves to me that VR is the future of virtual human interaction.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk took the stage earlier this week at an event called "We, Robot," unveiling new Tesla vehicles and giving a surprise look at the latest generation of Tesla Optimus robots. While Musk branded the robots as autonomous and hyped up the capabilities, it was found that they were partially remote-controlled by employees wearing VR headsets.</p><p>As expected, many cried foul, but I look at this very differently. Instead of worrying about whether Tesla can actually launch autonomous robots by the end of 2025, I think the company needs to embrace its remote-controlled strategy fully.</p><p>Optimus robots, remotely controlled by humans using advanced VR rigs, are the perfect way to deliver at-home care for the elderly, injured, disabled, folks with special needs, and more. While many science fiction universes have fully autonomous robots that perform these tasks, we're nowhere near this reality without significant safety issues.</p><p>Instead, certified trained individuals â€” along with people you permit â€” could feasibly help multiple people throughout every workday, providing meaningful human interaction when humans need it most. Here's a short clip of it in action:</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is a person controlling it, like in the video below.

<p>Much like remote-controlled drones, robot operators would be able to see through the robot's "eyes" by wearing affordable VR headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>. Moving the arms around could be done entirely with the motion controllers included, although I could imagine plenty of scenarios where more specialized controllers or gloves would make more sense.</p><p>The current generation of robots utilizes a hybrid AI operation model, where operators move the robot around and the AI handles the actual task of making the legs and arms operate as we would expect a bipedal creature to move.</p><p>Tesla also says that some tasks can be fully automated, and I imagine routines could even be programmed to make</p>

<p>Communication would be granted through a secure platform that includes multiple layers of security, including local authorization codes, phrases, or buttons that must be pressed to grant final access to the robot for the remote person.</p><p>And, of course, there would need to be some sort of giant red "off" button or emergency override locally to ensure nothing bad happens. All of this is hypothetical, but it's built entirely on real-world solutions that exist today.</p>
<h2 id="vr-as-more-than-gaming-2">VR as more than gaming</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="akykQECuueaCBhZu8xonCK" name="Meta-Quest-3S-lifestyle-mixed-reality-01.jpg" alt="An official lifestyle image of someone playing a mixed reality game on a Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/akykQECuueaCBhZu8xonCK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg and plenty of other folks in the VR industry have told us that VR is about more than gaming for years. Some of the focus has been around a broader entertainment or next-generation social networking angle, but I think the most powerful form of virtual human interaction can be achieved through a mix of VR headsets, virtual worlds, and remote-controlled robots for real-world interaction.</p><p>And while this sounds like it could be too costly for most households to afford, Musk says he can deliver on the robot vision for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267225/tesla-robotaxi-optimus-we-robot">around $20,000-$30,000 "long term".</a> Given that long-term care or hospice can cost thousands of dollars <em>every single month</em>, the idea of getting a competent human-assisted robot in your home for the cost of a few months in one of these facilities starts to sound quite affordable.</p><p>Aside from the sheer convenience of being able to "summon" healthcare workers and loved ones to your home at any given moment, remotely operated robots could be a huge boon for overburdened healthcare workers who normally might only have time for one or two remote patients per day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1871px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="sYdvUtbKN3CfRbwn7hCMRY" name="Tesla-optimus-robot-folding-laundry.jpg" alt="Someone remote operating a Tesla Optimus robot to fold laundry" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sYdvUtbKN3CfRbwn7hCMRY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1871" height="1052" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tesla)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Being able to claim a 4-hour shift and spend a solid hour with each patient by quickly porting between robots means workers would spend less time on exhausting commutes and more time caring for patients.</p><p>As I've learned from my own remote-only job, it also means they can have more time at home and with their own loved ones instead of wasting it away on a highway or at an office.</p><p>Tesla is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/unreal-software-engineer-virtual-reality-teleoperation-tesla-bot-227959">currently hiring virtual reality teleoperation positions</a> for Tesla Bots, and the description of the job sounds awfully similar to what I'm envisioning here. The biggest difference, of course, is that this particular job also includes designing the remote systems that'll make the robots work on a wider scale, but future positions will almost certainly just be for certified workers to safely operate the bots remotely.</p><p>If the purpose of making household robots is to enhance the lives of the people who own them, I can't think of a better way than to have that robot be the remote embodiment of people you trust and love. The possibilities here are nearly endless and it could easily be extended to help all sorts of people with disabilities, special needs, or even just remote socializing during times of loneliness or crisis.</p>

OnePlus India is hosting an online event on October 24, where OxygenOS 15 will make its debut.</p><p>OnePlus says that it conducted "extensive research and deep user insights to create a new generation of software that embodies the iconic Never Settle spirit." As with everything else in the tech world, OxygenOS 15 will include a host of AI features, and while the manufacturer didn&apos;t go into any details, it is likely to roll out a similar feature-set as its rivals.</p><p>What I&apos;m interested in is the retooled animations, which according to OnePlus makes the upcoming interface smoother than ever before. Legacy OxygenOS builds did this incredibly well, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oppo-coloros-13-review">switch over to ColorOS</a> negated some of those advancements, and I&apos;m excited to see if OnePlus is able to differentiate itself in this regard again.</p><p>There&apos;s also a new visual design, and again, we&apos;ll need to wait and see if the manufacturer can move away from the overt styling that has been the default in the last two years. With OxygenOS 15 set to debut in just a week&apos;s time, we don&apos;t have to wait too long. If history is any indication, the initial builds will be beta versions while OnePlus sorts out the inevitable bugs, with a stable build available sometime before the end of the year.</p><p>While OnePlus didn&apos;t go into detail regarding device availability, there&apos;s a good chance that OxygenOS 15 will be initially limited to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> â€” that&apos;s what the manufacturer did the last four years. I&apos;ll have the OxygenOS 15 build installed as soon as it becomes available, so stay tuned.</p>

While several brands rely on USB&apos;s standard Power Delivery, Chinese manufacturers use their own tech instead, delivering significantly higher charging speeds on their phones.</p><p>OPPO&apos;s SuperVOOC is the industry leader in this area, with the brand able to push battery charging to as much as 240W. That&apos;s an outlier, but on most OnePlus and OPPO phones available today, you&apos;ll see 65W and 100W charging as standard, allowing these devices to fully charge their batteries in under 30 minutes.</p><p>To put that into context, Samsung uses 45W charging on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, but the device takes over 60 minutes to charge the battery â€” more than twice as long as the OnePlus 12. The best part is that you don&apos;t get any downsides to 100W fast charging; I used OnePlus and OPPO devices based on the 100W tech for three years now, and long-term battery degradation is in line with other phones.</p><p>So here&apos;s everything you need to know about the SuperVOOC charging standard â€” how it evolved over the years, how it works in the latest devices, and how it&apos;s different to other fast charging solutions.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-evolution-of-fast-charging"><span>Evolution of fast charging</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JhLS9K5sxJhX3XYDWDjfp" name="vooc-50w-9.jpg" alt="OPPO 50W mini SuperVOOC charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JhLS9K5sxJhX3XYDWDjfp.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO introduced its VOOC charging tech back in 2014, and if you&apos;re curious, it is an abbreviation of Voltage Open Loop Multi-step Constant-Current Charging. VOLMCCC doesn&apos;t quite have the same allure, so OPPO shortened it to VOOC. In the early days, the standard went up to 20W (5V/4A), allowing devices at the time â€” like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-6t-review-six-months">OnePlus 6T</a> â€” to charge up to 60% in just 35 minutes, a sizeable achievement.</p><p>Then came SuperVOOC in 2006, going up to 50W by pushing 10V at 5A, but not many devices used this standard. The biggest upgrade came in 2019 with the debut of VOOC 3.0, which made 30W charging standard across most OnePlus and OPPO devices. The tech switched to 5V/6A to deliver faster charging, with devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-7t-review">OnePlus 7T</a> going up to a 70% charge in just 30 minutes.</p><p>The next evolution occurred in 2020 with SuperVOOC 2.0, which introduced the 65W standard that&apos;s still in use today. It moved the charging tech to deliver 10V over 6.5A, introducing the ability to fully charge devices in under 40 minutes. When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-8t-review">tested the OnePlus 8T</a> that year, I saw that the battery charged in just 38 minutes, a record at the time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PWEWReVRD6GBcwAbT9oSHo" name="warp-charge-1.jpg" alt="Warp Charge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWEWReVRD6GBcwAbT9oSHo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus used OPPO&apos;s charging tech from the very beginning, but because it was set up as a standalone entity, it changed the moniker. The 20W standard was called Dash Charge, and with the switch to 30W came Warp Charge. And when 65W charging became available, the manufacturer went with Warp Charge 65.</p><p>There was a derivative of this â€” dubbed the 65T â€” on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-2022">OnePlus 9 Pro</a>, which allowed the device to maintain a sustained voltage for an extended duration, and it unlocked a full charge in under 30 minutes. The biggest advantage to the SuperVOOC standard is that it doesn&apos;t overheat your device; that&apos;s because most of the charging circuitry is built into the wall unit.</p><p>This is why you can only get the quoted charging speeds only when you use a SuperVOOC charger; while USB PD also has 65W charging, the voltages are different, so you don&apos;t get the same benefits.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-does-supervooc-work"><span>How does SuperVOOC work?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zjY4VD6kHAZUFb2iDhHeV" name="vooc-50w-4.jpg" alt="OPPO 50W mini SuperVOOC charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zjY4VD6kHAZUFb2iDhHeV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A standard smartphone battery is highly reactive, which is why phone companies have several safeguards built into the charging circuitry. Lithium-Ion batteries are able to take in more power initially, tapering out as the charge builds. It is on this principle that fast charging works.</p><p>Qualcomm&apos;s Quick Charge technology delivers a higher voltage to the battery to expedite charging time. Quick Charge 5.0 is fully compliant with the USB-C Power Delivery (PD) spec, and while some manufacturers like ASUS use Qualcomm&apos;s solution, most brands have switched over to USB PD instead.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vjgsruLQUtYCb8dkYdQJKH" name="OnePlus-Nord-N30-5G-super-vooc-charging-02.jpg" alt="Charging a OnePlus Nord N30 5G with the red cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vjgsruLQUtYCb8dkYdQJKH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung, for instance, switched to USB Power Delivery&apos;s Programmable Power Supply (PPS) spec starting with the Galaxy Note 10 series, offering 45W charging. This is still the case on its latest devices, but most of its mid-range phones still use a 25W standard.</p><p>SuperVOOC&apos;s differentiation comes by way of using a dual-cell battery; the OnePlus 12 has a 5400mAh battery, but it is made up of two 2700mAh cells. This way, the 100W charge is split over both batteries at the same time, allowing the device to charge in under 30 minutes.</p><p>The key difference between SuperVOOC and other charging standards is that while USB PD uses higher voltages to charge batteries, OPPO instead focuses on delivering a higher amperage. For instance, USB PD pushes 20V at 3.25A to send 65W to devices, whereas SuperVOOC delivers 10V at 6.5A to attain 65W. But because all the associated circuitry is in the wall unit, you&apos;ll get all the advantages of fast charging without any of the downsides (overheating).</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-supervooc-100w-charging-your-phone-in-30-minutes"><span>SuperVOOC 100W: Charging your phone in 30 minutes</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="idULYP7YsgEfrRmJhvUaGK" name="oneplus-12-31.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 next to OnePlus 9, OnePlus 10, and OnePlus 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/idULYP7YsgEfrRmJhvUaGK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the main benefits of SuperVOOC is its ability to keep temperatures low while charging. The fast charging option allows you to watch videos or play games while the phone is charging, with no net drop in speeds. That isn&apos;t the case with other charging solutions, as the higher voltages invariably lead to the phone reverting to normal speeds to prevent overheating.</p><p>With SuperVOOC 100W, you can easily charge a phone battery in under 30 minutes, and it is a proven technology by this point â€” I used it on dozens of phones. There&apos;s also a SuperVOOC 150W standard, but that was available on just a few devices, and while OPPO showcased SuperVOOC 240W as well, it isn&apos;t practical on its flagships.</p><p>Like other charging standards, SuperVOOC takes more than twice as long to go from 50% to a full charge, and that&apos;s to prevent damage to the battery (and more importantly, you), with the wall charger limiting output after hitting 70% and going even lower after reaching 80%. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, the phone goes up to 72% in just 15 minutes, but takes an additional 15 minutes to go the rest of the 28%.</p><p>The dedicated microcontroller unit inside the phone constantly monitors the charge level to determine the desired amperage to be delivered. This is a good thing, because it ensures that everything doesn&apos;t burn down when you plug your phone in overnight. Of course, the main downside is that you&apos;ll need to use OnePlus and OPPO&apos;s bundled chargers to get the full charging potential.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Q9TmqfkQgaSaymw3FWzGQ" name="Anker-Prime-battery-plugged-in.jpg" alt="An Anker Prime 27500mAh battery pack charging up multiple devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Q9TmqfkQgaSaymw3FWzGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, OPPO has licensed the technology to third-party vendors like Anker, and the charging brand is delivering SuperVOOC 65W on select power banks and chargers, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG">Prime 27,650mAh power bank</a> that goes up to 250W. This is a huge deal, as it allows you to get all the advantages of the charging tech on the go.</p><p>An additional thing to mention here is that while you get 100W charging in most regions, OnePlus limits the chargers to 80W in North America. This has to do with voltages again, so if you&apos;re using the OnePlus 12 in the region, you&apos;ll only be able to use 80W. In real-world use, that means the device will take roughly eight additional minutes to charge.</p><p>A key update introduced in 2022 is the ability to increase battery longevity. Even with SuperVOOC 100W, OPPO is guaranteeing 1600 charge cycles before battery degradation, and that&apos;s a huge achievement. Also, the best part about using the SuperVOOC 100W charger is that it doubles as a USB PD charger as well, going up to 65W. So if you have other devices that leverage PD, you can charge those easily.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-airvooc-50"><span>What is AIRVOOC 50?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="xnWKmULGTxijyaohXXXwb3" name="oneplus-8-pro-warp-wireless-charging-notification.jpg" alt="OnePlus Warp Charge 30 Wireless Charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xnWKmULGTxijyaohXXXwb3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-8-pro-review-second-opinion">OnePlus 8 Pro</a> became the first device from the manufacturer (globally) to offer wireless charging, and in usual OnePlus fashion the company outfitted the phone with 30W wireless charging. AIRVOOC 30 â€” also called dubbed Warp Charge 30 Wireless on OnePlus devices â€” could deliver up to a 50% charge in just 30 minutes, allowing it to become a standout option in the wireless charging segment.</p><p>To deliver sustained 30W wireless charging, OnePlus used two charge pumps and clever charging tech. The charger coil itself sends 20V at 1.5A (netting 30W) to the first charge pump, which then halves the voltage to 10W while boosting the amperage to 3A (once again creating 30W). The second charge pump halves the voltage yet again to 5V, with the amperage doubled to 6A. That 5V at 6A charge leads to 30W, and it&apos;s this charge that&apos;s sent to the charging coil on the back of the phone.</p><p>OPPO is using this technique because there&apos;s no way to safely deliver a 6A charge directly from the induction coil on the wireless charger to the one on the phone. That would create a lot of heat and inevitably burn things down, so it&apos;s instead relying on two charge pumps. The technology is very interesting, and it continues to be one of the best wireless charging solutions around.</p><p>With the OnePlus 9 series, OnePlus introduced 50W wireless charging, and this is still the same tech that&apos;s used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a>. It is called AIRVOOC 50, and the tech is able to charge a device in under 45 minutes, but you&apos;ll need to use the dedicated wireless charger, and that&apos;s no longer available in most markets.</p>
<hr>
<p>OPPO continues to lead the way with its charging tech, and SuperVOOC 100W allows you to easily charge your phone in under 30 minutes â€” and do so safely. With the Find X8 and OnePlus 13 set to launch soon, it is interesting to see how the charging tech will evolve in the coming years.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio has proven time and again over the last two years that it can venture into new categories and do a great job; whether it&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-r7-review">all-in-one behemoth that is the R7</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-sp3-review">SP3 active speakers</a>, or even something unconventional â€” like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-kb3-hifi-audio-mechanical-keyboard-review">KB3 mechanical keyboard</a>.</p><p>Fiio&apos;s latest entry is into network streamers with the debut of the SR11. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hifigo.com/products/fiio-sr11">retails for $109</a>, and that&apos;s quite decent when you consider what&apos;s on offer â€” the SR11 is meant to be a network streamer that can be easily connected to existing audio gear. As such, there&apos;s no built-in DAC, and you will need to pair it with another device. In this instance, I used it with the brand&apos;s excellent K11 R2R DAC â€” a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k11-review">variant of the K11</a>.Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Z7naaJdAjfK87HNngMAtuW" name="fiio-sr11-1.jpg" alt="Fiio SR11 network streamer with RGB logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z7naaJdAjfK87HNngMAtuW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While network streamers are still in their infancy, WiiM has an early lead in this segment on the back of terrific launches. I&apos;m a huge fan of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/wiim-amp-review">WiiM Amp</a>; it is an all-in-one device with the ability to power passive speakers, and all the connectivity you could ask for. While the Amp is costlier at $299, the WiiM Mini goes up against what Fiio is offering, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Mini-Multiroom-Preamplifier-Assistants/dp/B09HC5GRKY/">coming in at $89</a>, it is an even better value â€” and you get a built-in DAC.</p><p>Where the SR11 is aiming to differentiate itself is Roon integration. I previously talked about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/roon-has-transformed-how-i-listen-to-music">Roon transformed my music library</a>, and if you use the service and need a reliable way to connect a stereo or other audio gear to your network, the SR11 is a great starting point.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sxVZsTsBqY4yzPsxutgZtY" name="fiio-sr11-8.jpg" alt="Fiio SR11 design showcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sxVZsTsBqY4yzPsxutgZtY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As always, let&apos;s start with the design. Fiio is known to reuse the same design where it makes sense â€” we&apos;ve seen that extensively in the past with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k5-pro-review">K5 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k7-review">K7 DACs</a> â€” and the brand went the same route with the SR11. The network streamer uses the same chassis as the K11 DAC, so you get the same squat profile with an LED panel at the front, and the dimensions are identical.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BxovDHPWYR5ZKjnFPGY7AY" name="fiio-sr11-6.jpg" alt="Fiio SR11 volume and control knob" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BxovDHPWYR5ZKjnFPGY7AY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The SR11 uses an aluminum chassis as well, and that&apos;s good to see in an affordable device. The build quality is just as great as the K11, and the Fiio logo at the top lights up â€” this can be disabled if you&apos;re not keen on RGB lighting. There&apos;s a control knob at the front that can be used to adjust the volume, and it is the default way to navigate the settings. It is a bit finicky as you have short and long-press controls, but if you&apos;ve used a Fiio DAC in the past, you will be familiar with the system.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ufh82JNjH2MYqjkcAFzevX" name="fiio-sr11-5.jpg" alt="Fiio SR11 panel showing real-time connectivity status" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ufh82JNjH2MYqjkcAFzevX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically, the SR11 combined with the K11 R2R creates an affordable stack that rivals significantly costlier products, and it is a terrific combination. Setting up the SR11 is a bit of a bother as it lacks Bluetooth, so you can&apos;t just pair it with your phone and use Fiio Control to connect it with your home network. I&apos;d recommend going the Ethernet route; that&apos;s how I usually connect any network-enabled streamer, and it is significantly easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YFbYTUyaQh4qHaGZekJ5LZ" name="fiio-sr11-12.jpg" alt="Fiio SR11 with iPhone 16 Pro Max next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YFbYTUyaQh4qHaGZekJ5LZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you set up the SR11, using it is relatively straightforward; it immediately showed up as an AirPlay device on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in streaming songs to it â€” whether that&apos;s in Spotify, Tidal, or Apple Music. While it&apos;s good to see AirPlay, it doesn&apos;t include AirPlay 2 integration, and it misses out on Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect.</p><p>You don&apos;t get any Chromecast integration either, and that makes the SR11 effectively useless with Android phones â€” unless you have Roon. It shows up as a Roon endpoint, and you can use your Android device to cast music to the streamer this way. Otherwise, this isn&apos;t the device to get â€” you should consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Pro-Chromecast-Multiroom-Compatible/dp/B0BJDY6D1W">$149 WiiM Pro instead</a>; it has much better connectivity, but you don&apos;t get Roon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7vBFGVVfuCtQUSEQxRoZVX" name="fiio-sr11-3.jpg" alt="Fiio SR11 back view showing connectivity" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7vBFGVVfuCtQUSEQxRoZVX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another feature that&apos;s missing is DLNA; Fiio is limiting that to test builds, and I don&apos;t really understand why that&apos;s the case. Essentially, you&apos;re not getting as much in the way of connectivity, with the device aimed to be used with iPhones, or if you have Roon.</p><p>Because there&apos;s no built-in DAC, the SR11 doesn&apos;t need much in the way of power, and it is powered over USB-C. There&apos;s a wall plug bundled in the box, but you can use it with any source as long as it delivers 10W of power. You also get USB-C and USB-A out, as well as optical and coaxial. There&apos;s an antenna that does a good job delivering a strong signal, and of course, you get Ethernet.</p>

<p>I like the fact that Fiio bundled a remote with the device; it makes it much more convenient to use than the control knob. This is what I do with the K19 DAC as well, and I&apos;m glad to see the remote included on a budget product. Connecting to another DAC via USB is as straightforward as it gets, and you can use just about any device.</p><p>The SR11 goes up to 768kHz/32-bit when using Roon (over USB), and AirPlay is limited to 44kHz/16-bit. I didn&apos;t see any issues in either mode, and the SR11 does a good job as a network streamer; it recreates the sound without adding any unwanted dynamics, and that&apos;s what you need in such a device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3DtgQSS3xHoY3LWdw3T3xZ" name="fiio-sr11-13.jpg" alt="Fiio SR11 and K11 R2R DAC with audio connected" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3DtgQSS3xHoY3LWdw3T3xZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When paired with the K11 R2R DAC and Beyerdynamic&apos;s excellent DT990 Pro, the SR11 is able to deliver its full potential. You get an energetic bass with neutral mid-range and a vibrant treble, and as a source, the SR11 does what it needs to â€” get out of the way.</p><p>I don&apos;t have any problems recommending the SR11, but it has its limitations. There isn&apos;t an easy way to set it up, it misses out on Chromecast connectivity, and you don&apos;t get Spotify Connect. But if you have an iPhone or use Roon and want an affordable streamer to connect to an existing stereo system, this is a great choice.</p>
