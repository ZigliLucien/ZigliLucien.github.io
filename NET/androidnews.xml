<p>The IP68 rating has been standard on phones for nearly a decade, with Samsung introducing it on the Galaxy S7 series back in 2016. Other brands followed shortly thereafter, and these days, the rating is now a table stakes feature.</p><p>What&apos;s interesting is that most Chinese brands are switching to IP69 on their 2025 flagships. Vivo&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-takes-things-to-a-whole-new-level-with-the-x200-series">X200</a>, X200 Pro, and X200 Pro mini all come with IP69 ingress protection, alongside OPPO&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppos-answer-to-the-galaxy-s25-is-launching-globally-on-november-21">Find X8</a> and X8 Pro. Other manufacturers in the BBK stable are getting in on the action as well, with both the Realme GT 7 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> getting IP69.</p><p>So what is IP69 dust and water resistance, and how is it different to IP68? At a high-level overview, an IP rating guarantees protection against dust and water making its way into a device. The two digits in the rating indicate the degree of protection; the first digit corresponds to protection against solid objects (including dust particles), while the second digit deals with liquids.</p><p>The 6 in IP68 means the device is effectively dustproof. To achieve this rating, the device is housed in a dust-filled enclosure with a steady stream of air blowing in, and it needs to withstand any dust from getting into the chassis after eight hours of testing.</p><p>The second number is interesting, because that&apos;s the key change with 2025 flagships. The 8 in IP68 refers to a device&apos;s ability to be submerged in up to 1.5 meters of water for an extended duration — usually lasting 30 minutes. Most phones conform to this standard, but the iPhone 16 Pro Max is able to be submerged in up to 6 meters of water.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rhZdGXZmNiwnbHdHAigLWS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S22-Ultra-SD-Card-SIM-tray.jpg" alt="A Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra with its SIM tray ejected next to an SD card" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rhZdGXZmNiwnbHdHAigLWS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Manufacturers use gaskets around the SIM card slot and sealant inside the chassis to protect the internals against water damage. With IP69, you get the same level of immersion in water, but these devices are also able to withstand high-pressure water jets going up to 1,450 PSI, and tolerate increased temperatures of up to 80 degrees Celsius (176 degrees Fahrenheit).</p><p>Even with an IP68 rating, phones were pretty much resistant to any weather conditions, and IP69 goes one level beyond — it is the highest level of ingress protection available on consumer devices.</p><p>While IP69 has better protection against liquid ingress, it still has the same caveats — it doesn&apos;t cover salt water damage, so if you submerge your phone in a water body with high salinity, you should immediately rinse it with fresh water.</p><p>Just like with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon battery tech</a>, the IP69 rating is limited to Chinese brands, with BBK-owned entities leading the charge once again. It&apos;s unlikely Samsung, Apple, or Google will switch to the standard on their devices. This time though, I don&apos;t think it makes a big enough difference — IP68 protection is still more than adequate.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>This weekend, I ran a 20-mile marathon training race wearing four fitness watches — the Garmin Fenix 8, COROS PACE Pro, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Google Pixel Watch 3. I felt like a weirdo, but it was actually a really useful opportunity to check which metrics are most consistent across brands — and which are most likely to be wrong or random.</p><p>I usually wear two smartwatches at any given time during runs, and I once <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">wore six watches for a step-counting test</a>. Usually, I'm on quiet trails where my absurd tech habits don't attract much attention, but I knew that wouldn't apply during the Run the Parkway race, which had nearly 1,000 runners.</p><p>Thankfully, the mid-40ºF weather let me wear long sleeves, hiding my silly appearance at first. But it started warming up, and my sleeves started activating some watches' touchscreens and messing things up. So I rolled them back and saw spectators and runners alike glancing confusedly at my wrist-laden arms.</p><p>Whatever they thought of my bizarre appearance, I got some great data out of the 20-mile race, summarized in the table below!</p>


<p>I finished the first 13.1 miles at a solid 1:55:31, or 8:49 pace, but my muscle soreness made me walk-jog the last five miles in the 11/12-minute range, skewing my running form stats. But I'm still generally happy with the results as I return to marathon shape for 2025!</p><p><em>Note</em>: My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> randomly stopped my activity by itself due to random touchscreen inputs from my sleeve. I thankfully noticed it quickly and started a new workout, but had to add up and average data from 4.5-mile and 15.4-mile activities, and the final distance probably <em>would</em> have been above 20 miles if not for this snafu.</p>
<h2 id="consistent-data-across-brands-2">Consistent data across brands</h2>
<p>That Apple workout glitch aside, all four watches were pretty close in total distance and pace and were basically in lockstep in areas like average heart rate, steps, cadence, and stride length.</p><p>Despite their different HR algorithms, accelerometer tech, and positions on my arms, they nearly matched when calculating how far and often I stepped — and how hard I was pushing myself — across three hours. That's impressive!</p>

<p>In terms of distance, I immediately noticed that the GPS-only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 3</a> buzzed my wrist that I'd finished my first mile well before the others, then fell into a consistent pattern of marking each finished mile about 0.1 miles before each mile marker. Despite the lack of signal blockage on my route, a GPS-only watch is only adequate at the best of times compared to the dual-band results of my other three watches.</p><p>I already wrote about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-gps-and-hr-accuracy-test">COROS PACE Pro's GPS accuracy</a> compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-has-underwhelmed-me-despite-how-great-it-is">Fenix 8</a>, and that held true here: Like the Pixel Watch 3, it marked me finishing my first mile before the Fenix 8, but then it held the same position for every subsequent mile, beeping about 10 running strides before the Fenix 8 all the way to the finish.</p><p>For elevation data, Apple, Garmin, and Fitbit were all within 5 feet of one another, while COROS slightly overestimated my effort. The PACE 3 did better in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/altimeter-elevation-test-mt-diablo-with-garmin-apple-coros-polar-galaxy-watch">past elevation accuracy test</a>, so I'm curious if the PACE Pro altimeter needs some tinkering. Otherwise, I've found almost <em>any</em> watch with an altimeter gives pretty consistent ascent data.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LWaZFNkWxkKPHBXP3RMjBK" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-COROS-HRM-Google-Pixel-Watch-3-HR-accuracy-comparison" alt="A HR chart showing the results for the Garmin Fenix 8, COROS Heart Rate Monitor, and Google Pixel Watch 3 across three hours." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LWaZFNkWxkKPHBXP3RMjBK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2520" height="1418" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for HR accuracy, I paired my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS HR armband</a> to the Pace Pro for a baseline against the other three watches, and the results were predictable: the Fenix 8 is <em>excellent</em> for optical HR accuracy, while the Pixel Watch 3 is steady but tends to fall a little short for anaerobic heart rates. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 also seemed to do well on average but fell a few beats short of my max HR.</p>
<h2 id="where-fitness-watch-data-diverges-2">Where fitness watch data diverges</h2>
<p>Considering how consistent the results were in some areas, it's a bit surprising how <em>different</em> the four watches' results were in other areas:</p><p><strong>Running power</strong>: Some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness watches</a> calculate the energy put into your run based on factors like speed, cadence, stride length, and vertical oscillation so you can determine your stride's efficiency and your overall effort. You'd think my running power data would have been closer across brands. Instead, Garmin put my effort about 100W higher than the other two that tracked that data.</p><p>I know a lot of runners and experts put stock in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/when-is-running-with-power-superior-to-running-at-pace">using running power instead of pace</a> to determine how well or fast they're running, especially on hilly or windy courses. But I've noticed this variation in running power across brands before, and if they can't agree on my wattage for a <em>flat</em> and <em>non-windy</em> course, it makes me leery of using this metric as my benchmark while running. It's something I want to try and test more in the future.</p><p><strong>Training load: </strong>TL is more of a proprietary data point, even if they all use some form of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803105725580">training impulse (TRIMP) method</a>. So, I'm not surprised that brands differ in how they calculate it. But it's still fascinating to see COROS give me more than double the training load Garmin does with near-identical stats, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Fitbit's Cardio Load</a> falling squarely in the middle. (Apple's TL is all about charts relative to past weeks and doesn't put a number on workouts.)</p><p>For what it's worth, I've noticed in the past that Garmin can be a bit conservative with its training load estimates (especially for long hikes) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">isn't very good at splitting low/high aerobic and anaerobic loads</a> for one activity. Meanwhile, COROS gives out TL like candy on Halloween, overestimating my effort. In this case, I think Fitbit's TL might win the Goldilocks "just right" award here.</p>

<p><strong>Calories:</strong> This is another fitness metric I've been side-eyeing for some time. After <em>any</em> activity where I wear two watches from different brands, the final burned-calorie count is different, no matter how similar the mileage and HR totals are.</p><p>This 20-miler only made the differences even starker, with a 500kcal gap between COROS and Garmin. But you'll still notice a difference for shorter runs or walks, whichever fitness watch you buy. And anyone trying to lose weight or judge their caloric need for the day will make very different life choices based on this data.</p><p>I'd love to figure out which brand is most accurate for caloric burn. But unlike when I'm testing GPS routes against satellite maps or heart rate against arm or chest straps, I don't know of any way a layman can test the results outside of a lab.</p>
<h2 id="finding-a-running-watch-you-can-trust-is-important-2">Finding a running watch you can trust is important</h2>
<p>This experience taught me two things. One, don't tell your boss, "Hey, I'm running a race this weekend; is there anything I should test?" It'll only lead to embarrassment and spending hours the day before charging all your watches. Two, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watches</a> are getting better and more reliable for raw data than ever, matching each other across brands in ways that count.</p><p>Garmin is still my preferred running brand because I've been using its training load, suggested workouts, and recovery data for years, and a lot of runners trust its accuracy. But tests like this make it plain that other brands can be trusted too, at least on the hardware side. And even if watches like the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Pixel Watch 3 are more for "casual" athletes in terms of software, they're getting better and better every year.</p>

<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> update is rolling out again for Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 users, meaning Wear OS 4 is on its way out.</p><p>The past month hasn't been easy for Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a>. When Wear OS 5 was pushed to the Pixel Watch 1 and 2, it caused some serious problems, like bricked devices and blank screens. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-1-and-2-users-will-have-to-wait-for-wear-os-5">quickly paused the update</a>, but since then, there’s been little word on when things will get back on track for the Pixel Watch series.</p><p>Finally, the wait is over—updates are finally back for all Pixel Watch models. The November update (version AW2A.241105.012) is rolling out to the Pixel Watch 1, 2, and 3. While it marks the continuation of the Wear OS 5 update for the earlier models, it looks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> is just getting a regular security patch this time.</p><p>Google started rolling out Wear OS 5 to the original Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 in September, but had to pull the update shortly after users reported serious issues.</p><p>In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/307540908" target="_blank">community post</a>, Google confirmed the November 2024 update for all Pixel Watch models and dropped an unexpected tidbit. While detailing the update for all three Pixel Watch models, it also revealed that the next major update won’t come until March 2025, meaning a lengthy three to four-month break between updates for the series.</p><p>Verizon’s Pixel Watch models are getting in on the Wear OS 5 update too. For the Pixel Watch 2, the changelog notes that it fixes an issue where watch faces wouldn’t load after a reboot.</p><p>Not only does the update fix the watch face loading issue, but it also throws in the November 2024 security patch for good measure. The original Pixel Watch changelog doesn’t bother to mention this fix, but the update's back, so it seems like Google has finally sorted it out.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is apparently giving Gemini Live the power to understand documents, so it could soon take over managing and working with your files.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-live-files-3498551/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the latest Google app beta hints that users will soon be able to upload files straight into Gemini Advanced while using Gemini Live.</p><p>In the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> chat interface, users can upload files, with Gemini Advanced subscribers getting the added bonus of having the AI analyze or edit those files.</p><p>But in a recent dive into the Google app's beta (version 15.45.33.ve.arm64), Android Authority found some interesting code. It points to the possibility of file handling capabilities coming to Gemini Live soon, with a new "Talk about attachment" feature suggesting a fresh way to interact with documents users upload.</p><p>Code found in the Google app suggests that Gemini can detect file uploads, whether they're done directly or via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a>. Once it picks up on it, Gemini will nudge you to switch to Gemini Live, where you can chat about what you want to do with the file.</p><p>Additional code in the Google app points to options like "Open Live with attachment," suggesting that Google might steer users to Gemini Live after uploading a file.</p><p>While it's not set in stone, it looks like Gemini Live will likely center around interactive chats, helping users dig into the main points of their documents in a more conversational way.</p><p>The option to tweak or modify attachments will likely stay a feature reserved for Gemini Advanced users in the standard chat interface.</p><p>At the moment, the feature is inactive, and it's still unclear how Gemini Live will interact with files. There's no official release timeline, and it’s not being tested yet. This gives plenty of space for the feature to develop, and we're looking forward to seeing how it shapes up.</p>

<hr>
<p>This morning, many T-Mobile customers found that they couldn't connect to the network. The carrier appeared to have dealt with a network outage in certain parts of the U.S., with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/t-mobile/">Downdetector</a> seeing a spike in outage reports on Tuesday, Nov. 12. However, reports seem to be easing as service returns for affected users.</p><p>The reports seem to have started around 2 p.m. EST, and it seems the outage was mostly concentrated throughout the state of Utah, although it may have affected other areas as well. Local news in Salt Lake City <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.abc4.com/news/local-news/is-t-mobile-down-for-you-utahns-report-outage-throughout-the-state/">reported</a> that users across the state appeared to be affected by the outage.</p><p>Meanwhile, users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TMobileHelp/with_replies?lang=en">flooded T-Mobile's X account</a> to complain about the lack of service, with most appearing to reside in Utah. That said, reports indicate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1gpsm4d/outages_on_tmobile/?sort=new">things are slowly improving</a> for many who are now able to connect once more to the network. Downdetector reports have also been trending downward quite sharply.</p>

<p>The outage appeared to have affected other carriers that rely on T-Mobile's network. That includes Metro by T-Mobile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi-Wireless</a>.</p><p>T-Mobile has not publicly commented on the outage on its social media accounts but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://kutv.com/news/local/major-event-impacting-cell-towers-in-st-george-knocks-out-internet-service">told one news outlet</a> that a "major event" was causing the outage (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/live/t-mobile-is-down-the-latest-on-the-major-outage">Tom's Guide</a>). Apparently, a switch went out, as noted by a representative, but it has since been repaired, and service is "slowly coming back." T-Mobile disclosed as much to Android Central, saying that a facility in the Salt Lake City area "had a brief mechanical issue that impacted connectivity for some customers in that market, but this is now resolved and service is restored.</p><p>By the looks of it, affected T-Mobile users should have service restored by the end of the day. If you're still having issues, it may help to power cycle your phone.</p>

<ul><li>Google highlighted the start of Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1 to Pixel testers on Reddit.</li><li>The update contains the November security patch and a list of known issues users may encounter.</li><li>The QPR2 update is expected to arrive as the March 2025 feature drop while we brace for a much earlier Android 16 launch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The next major Android 15 update enters its first beta as Google drops the details to enrolled testers.</p><p>Google posted its announcement via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1gpt8p6/android_15_qpr2_beta_1_now_available/">the Android Beta subreddit</a>, informing users that they can begin downloading Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1. Enrolled testers will find QPR2 Beta 1 as version <strong>BP11.241025.006</strong> when downloading. The update is available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">latest Pixel 9 series</a>, the original Pixel Fold, the Pixel Tablet, and the Pixel 8 down to the Pixel 6.</p><p>This patch includes the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-pixel-november-update-squashes-the-first-round-of-android-15-bugs">November 2024 security patch</a> for Pixels. Additionally, Google delivered an advisory for this looking to exit the Beta Program following Android 15 QPR1.</p>
<ul><li>If you prefer to leave the Beta program and receive the public stable release of Android 15 QPR1 in December, you can do so without wiping your device by opting out and <strong>not installing</strong> <strong>today’s QPR2 Beta 1 update</strong>*. If you opt-out of the program* <strong>after</strong> installing Beta 1 or any future updates, all user data on the device will get wiped per usual program guidelines. <strong>Opting out will trigger a ‘Downgrade’ OTA. Ignore this update and wait for the Android 15 QPR1 public release instead.</strong></li></ul>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1gpt8p6/android_15_qpr2_beta_1_now_available">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>If you do not wish to leave, Google states that those in the previous QPR beta will automatically grab QPR2 Beta 1 and those that follow. The update should appear within 24 hours, but you should continue to check throughout the week.</p><p>The company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes">official changelog</a> detailed a few "general advisories" testers should be aware of. Among them, Google states your Pixel could experience battery, stability, and performance problems. If so, it's recommended that you submit bug reports and feedback via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta/feedback">appropriate channels</a>. The log also states that some of your apps "may not function properly" in the beta.</p><p>While Google didn't explicitly state what's new, Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-qpr2-linux-terminal-3498872/">Android Authority</a>) discovered that QPR2 adds a "Linux Terminal" app. The new tool is reportedly tucked within "Developer Options" in the Settings menu. After getting it to surface, Google's on-device description states the Terminal app lets developers "run Linux terminal on Android." Rahman states developers can "configure, run, and interface" apps using an instance of Debian.</p><p>Moreover, Google's patch notes reiterate the "16KB boot mode" in the Developer Options page. This option already existed in QPR1, but it only concerned the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro. With QPR2, this has extended to the Pixel 8a.</p><p>Google prepared us for Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1 earlier this month, stating it was on the way. The company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-teases-upcoming-android-15-qpr-2-beta-1">announcement</a> states the patch will "build on top of" the Android 15 QPR1 update, which is expected to the December feature drop. The QPR2 beta is expected to debut as the March 2025 feature drop.</p><p>Speaking of 2025, Google highlighted a much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-gemini-android-studio-sdk-updates">earlier arrival of Android 16</a> in October. The post confirmed that the next major OS will arrive in Q2 2025, giving us April to June as a potential launch timeframe.</p>

<p>With its two glorious AMOLED displays, a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, and nearly-invisible folding hinge, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> was easily one of the most impressive Android phones released this year. The only problem is that it was also one of the most expensive. Thanks to Samsung&apos;s Black Friday sale, the innovative foldable is more accessible than ever before.</p>

<p>Pick up the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 in <strong>White</strong> or <strong>Crafted Black</strong> and you'll get a straight $200 off plus up to $1,200 off with a trade-in during the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024-early-deals-and-how-to-prepare-for-the-big-sales">OEM's Black Friday sale</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> ever built, the AI-powered Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 boasts two stunning 120Hz displays, an ultra-efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, and seven years of guaranteed OS updates. </p>
<p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-navy/6586742.p">Best Buy - $1,899.99</a> | <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Handsfree-Interpreter-Manufacturer/dp/B0D18VM66K">Amazon - $1,378.22</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uakaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="04d36997-ea33-4acf-9757-a5393cb674b9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 256GB: $1,899.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 256GB: $1,899.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>I realize that this kind of offer isn&apos;t for everyone, but it&apos;s worth noting that Samsung is being surprisingly generous with its trade-in credit during the sale, <em>especially</em> if you&apos;re thinking of sending in an old Samsung phone. The Z Fold 5 and S24 Ultra will get you the full $1,200 off, for instance, while foldable phones dating back to the Galaxy Z Fold 3 will earn you a whopping $1,000 off the price. </p><p>I dug up my old Galaxy S20 FE and was surprised to see that I was eligible to get $500 off the Z Fold 6, which is way better than the paltry $50 usually offered on the site. </p><p>It&apos;s your call, but if you&apos;re a fan of trade-in deals, this Black Friday offer from Samsung is tough to beat. If you decide to go this route, your purchase will also include a bunch of free subscriptions to online services, such as three months of YouTube Premium, and two free months of Adobe Lightroom. It&apos;s the gift that keeps on giving!</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out the Chrome 131 update for iOS and iPadOS with deeper integration for the company's services.</li><li>The changes will make it easier to use Google Chrome, Drive, Photos, and Maps on an iPhone or iPad.</li><li>By giving users more options to enter the Google ecosystem with their iOS device, Google may end up making it easier for iPhone users to switch to Android down the road.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/chrome-ios-updates-november-2024/" target="_blank">announced</a> today that it's rolling out Google Chrome 131 on iOS and iPadOS, which includes major upgrades to how the browser works with the company's other services. The update brings four key functions that Android users already have to the other side of the walled garden, and could make it easier for iPhone and iPad users to enter the Google ecosystem. These changes are rolling out gradually, with some features being limited to U.S. users for now.</p><p>The upgrades coming to Chrome 131 for iOS aim to help Google's portfolio of services more competitive with Apple's own offerings. For example, when iPhone users start to run out of storage, they are often prompted to buy more iCloud storage as part of a monthly subscription from Apple. Now, Google is providing a different solution in Chrome 131 for iOS. Users can save files directly from a website in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Chrome</a> to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a> cloud storage, eliminating the need to first save to their device storage.</p><p>New context menus will give users the option to save files to Google Drive instead of the native iOS Files app. Additionally, it is possible to upload photos directly to Google Photos with another context menu. Files that are uploaded to Drive from Chrome for iOS will be stored in their own folder.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JrKXwbCDgPRcQvBc8x4kmb" name="Save-to-Drive" alt="Google Chrome 131 updates for iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JrKXwbCDgPRcQvBc8x4kmb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google, like Apple, limits how much free storage space users can access in the cloud. You get 15GB of storage from Google and only 5GB from Apple, so there is a clear benefit to saving certain files directly to Google Drive. However, once that free space runs out, Google would probably rather you pay for extra storage space with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> subscription rather than an iCloud Plus plan.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NT8wo84xn54WAxVa9svRAc" name="Chrome-131-Maps-Drive" alt="Google Chrome 131 updates for iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NT8wo84xn54WAxVa9svRAc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this update, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-search-ads-video-function-update">Google Lens</a> receives a boost. Users can now search using photos, screenshots, and text — all at the same time. This functionality is already on Android, but it's available in Chrome 131 for iOS for the first time. Additionally, <strong>Shopping Insights</strong> will tell people in the U.S. whether they're getting a great deal. This includes providing an easily-accessible price chart that shows whether the current sale price is really a fantastic discount using months-long price histories.</p><p>Finally, Chrome 131 for iOS adds support for quick <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a> previews. When you see an address on a website, one tap will open a map of the location and provide the most important details. From there, you can press again to get directions to the address in Google Maps. This feature is rolling out gradually over the next few months, so you may not see it immediately.</p><p>These Chrome 131 features are nothing new for Android users, but they may end up making it easier for iPhone users to make the switch to Android. After you become used to relying on Apple services, like iCloud Drive, iCloud Photos, and Apple Maps, it can become hard to switch. With Chrome 131 for iOS, Google is giving iPhone and iPad users an alternative way to get into the Google ecosystem with Chrome integration for Google Drive, Photos, and Maps.</p>

<ul><li>A dive into a Google Home app "test version" highlighted several strings pointing toward CO/smoke detector support.</li><li>Various strings of code detail alerts for users about their home's dangerous air quality and sensor testing.</li><li>More devices have been added to Google Home since Matter support arrived, but its Nest app has been the only way to control its CO/smoke sensors.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google could have plans to incorporate new sensors that protect users from dangerous air conditions at home.</p><p>Google is reportedly developing new sensor support for the Home app, per a deep dive by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-smoke-carbon-monoxide-sensors-apk-teardown-3498759/">Android Authority</a>). According to the tipster, various strings in a "test version" of Google Home suggest the app will implement support for CO (carbon monoxide) and smoke detectors.</p><p>This support will reportedly be joined by a series of new alerts delivered to a user's phone. The code showed signs of alerts that inform users if "smoke levels are too high." Additional alerts were discovered, informing users of dangerous CO and smoke levels detected by the sensor and to exit the home into "fresh air."</p><p>The Home app will seemingly let users test their sensors to ensure its functionality is good to go.</p><p>More importantly, the publication notes the existence of Google-created smoke and CO sensors under the "Nest" moniker. However, consumers with them can only utilize their functions via the Nest app. It's speculated that the app's hidden code could indicate upcoming integration between the Nest app and Google Home. If true, that would remove the necessity for this additional app and bring everything under the Home app's roof.</p>

<p>Consumers are undoubtedly familiar with the term "Matter," the new industry connectivity standard for linking smart home devices. In 2022, Google boarded the Matter train with the Home app as it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-nest-matter-rollout-android-fast-pair">rolled out support</a> for the Home Mini, Hub Max, Wifi Pro, and Nest Audio. The company then expanded support for more smart home devices and brands.</p><p>It's not specifically mentioned that these air quality sensors will be wrapped in the Matter standard, but it's possible. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-2-upgrade-details">Matter 1.2 upgrade</a> includes smoke and CO detector support as the CSA honed in reducing the amount of app "hubs" consumers need to control their devices. It's likely that Google's potential inclusion of its smoke and CO sensors <em>within </em>the Home app — not in a separate Nest app — will continue that "centralized hub" idea.</p><p>Unfortunately, without more concrete evidence, it's unclear if/when Google will roll this out. The post wonders if the company has a "future Nest Protect" in the pipeline for this support, but that's just speculation for now.</p>

It requires the app developer to use the <strong>MediaRecorder API</strong>, and few apps support it. That's why an input switcher in Android's system-wide media dialog would be useful, but as the second screenshot shows, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> currently only supports changing audio output. The final, far-right screenshot serves as an example of how audio switching might work in Android 16, which could add a separate section for changing your audio input.</p><p>Rahman notes that although the Android 16 media switcher was visible, it didn't work properly. Changing the system audio input didn't allow the use of an external microphone on an Android phone. Since the early version of the dialog references "<strong>This computer</strong>" instead of "This phone," Rahman suspects that this feature is designed specifically for PCs that run Android.</p><p>Being that Android 16 is quite far away, it's unclear whether this version of the media switcher will make it into the update's public release, or which devices will be supported. System-wide support of external microphones would be extremely helpful for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">high-end tablets</a> and PCs that run Android, and slightly less so for phones. However, a default switcher would eliminate the need for developers to use the MediaRecorder API, thus making the experience of using external audio inputs on the platform more consistent and streamlined.</p>
