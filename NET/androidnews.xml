When you first set up Wallet, it automatically scans your Gmail and picks up information on passes you might already have in emails. But even if it's not able to detect a certain pass or you don't see the 'Add to Google Wallet' option for a new online pass, there's a simple way to manually do it.</p><p>We'll also walk you through how you can add a new custom pass to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> via an image of a pass that you may have on your phone. Wallet automatically fills in all the pertinent information that would be needed and saves it as a card. The next time you need to scan your subway pass or a membership card at the gym, you can simply fire up the app and tap on the card you need, without worrying about the physical card or jumping through multiple apps. It truly is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">best Android apps</a> from Google, today.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-make-a-custom-pass-in-wallet-via-a-barcode-or-qr-code-2">How to make a custom pass in Wallet via a barcode or QR code</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Google Wallet</strong> app.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Add to Wallet</strong> button with the '+' symbol in the bottom right corner.</p><p>3. Choose the type of card you want to add. We've selected '<strong>Loyalty card</strong>.'</p><p>4. Next, you'll see a list of popular options for your region.</p><p>5. For this example, we've chosen <strong>'Watsons Malaysia.'</strong></p>

<p>6. Now, you can either manually enter your member ID and save it, or use the 'Scan your card' option.</p><p>7. Scanning is always better as it's a lot quicker. Simply point your camera's viewfinder to the barcode or QR code on the card and it should be done in a second.</p><p>9. Your newly added card should show up on Wallet's main page.</p>

<p>1. Follow the instructions above till the second step.</p><p>2. Here, choose the '<strong>Photo</strong>' option which should be separated from others by a wavy line.</p><p>3. If you have a physical card you wish to scan, hold the phone directly above it and <strong>press the capture button</strong>.</p><p>4. You can crop & rotate, add a filter, retake, or delete the photo if needed.</p><p>5. To add a photo of your card from your image gallery, simply press the <strong>symbol on the left</strong> of the shutter button to browse your gallery for the image of your pass.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.33%;"><img id="9mHR2eyrf9Z5YXt3fcJvWT" name="add-custom-pass-google-wallet-2" alt="Google Wallet screenshot showing adding pass by photo method" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mHR2eyrf9Z5YXt3fcJvWT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1200" height="880" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Your card must have a barcode or QR code for it to be successfully added to Wallet.</p><p>Another thing we noticed was that if your pass or card has both a barcode and a QR code, the app gets confused and warns you about there being too many codes. An easy fix is to simply cover one of the codes and then try rescanning.</p>

<h2 id="manage-all-your-passes-from-google-wallet-2">Manage all your passes from Google Wallet</h2>
<p>Google Wallet has had a rocky history, with it first being an exclusive app for Nexus phones for contactless payments to eventually being killed off in favor of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pay">Google Pay</a>. The Wallet app is here to stay though, at least for the foreseeable future as Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-changes-june-shutdown-announced">shuttered the Google Pay app</a> in the U.S. as of June 2024. Apart from peer-to-peer payments, the current Wallet app can do pretty much everything else.</p><p>You can store debit and credit cards in Google Wallet and Google just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-supports-42-additional-banks">added dozens of new banks</a> in 2024 alone. If you do plan on adding your banking cards, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-lock-down-google-wallet-cards">make sure it's secure</a> so it's not misused in the event you lose your phone. Other than adding your loyalty cards and boarding passes, you can also use Wallet to store additional items like digital car keys, corporate office passes, hotel keys, and so on. It's amazing how much use you can get out of a single app.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 are rumored to sport larger displays than their predecessors.</li><li>Samsung's upcoming Z Fold 7 could offer an 8-inch main display and a 6.5-inch cover screen.</li><li>Meanwhile, the Z Flip 7 is also in line for a bigger screen, with a 6.85-inch foldable display and a 4-inch cover screen.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Foldable phones are already big when unfolded, but next year’s Samsung foldables might push those limits with even larger screens.</p><p>Display industry expert Ross Young has shared some exciting updates on Samsung’s next-gen foldables. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Flip 7</a> are rumored to come with bigger screens than their current versions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-upgrade-been-waiting-for/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). Interestingly, Young suggests the Fold 6 SE might have set the stage for the Fold 7, hinting at a fresh direction for Samsung’s foldable lineup.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fold 7 should have same display sizes as Fold 6 SE. So, Fold 6 SE will basically become the Fold 7. Flip 7 should grow from 6.7" to 6.85" and cover display should be around 4".<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1863671122249818428">December 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 SE stands out with its slimmer design, a 6.5-inch cover screen rocking a consistent 21:9 aspect ratio, and a roomy 8-inch inner display, which is bigger than the standard Fold’s 7.6-inch screen.</p><p>If you’ve been eyeing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">larger Special Edition Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> that was limited to South Korea and China, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is your global ticket.</p><p>If the Z Fold 7 follows the Special Edition’s lead, we’re in for a serious screen upgrade. The main display will stretch to 8 inches, beating the Z Fold 6’s 7.6-inch screen, and the cover screen will jump to 6.5 inches—bigger than the 6.3-inch one on the previous model.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 could be getting a screen upgrade too. Rumor has it the clamshell foldable's display will stretch to 6.85 inches, up from the 6.7-inch one on the Z Flip 6. Plus, the cover screen is tipped to grow to around 4 inches, way bigger than the 3.4-inch screen on its predecessor.</p><p>Samsung has been sticking to the same display size for its foldables for a while now. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a> did give the cover screen a tiny stretch, but it didn’t really change much.</p><p>While some of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">favorite foldable phones</a> went for bigger screens, Samsung kept it steady. But come 2025, it looks like the South Korean tech giant is finally jumping on the bigger display bandwagon with their next foldables.</p>

                    <p><p>Samsung’s cautious approach with the Fold 6 has made it a solid flagship, but it's starting to feel a bit behind. While it performs well and has handy S Pen support, the lack of major upgrades in display size and camera tech might not keep up with the rapid changes in foldables.</p></p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13</a>, fresh off its China debut, finally launches outside its home turf. The flagship phone has landed in India  in 12GB+256GB (₹51,999) and 16GB+512GB (₹56,999) configurations.</p><p>The global version sticks to the same top-tier specs as its Chinese version. It’s got a 6.82-inch 144Hz LTPO AMOLED display, a 6,000mAh battery, and serious durability with IP68 and IP69K ratings. Plus, 120W fast charging keeps it speedy all around (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/12/03/iqoo-13-launches-in-india-snapdragon-8-elite-6000mah-battery-ai-features-and-4-years-of-os-updates/" target="_blank">Gizmochina</a>).</p><p>Under the hood, it's powered by a Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC paired with iQOO’s second-gen SuperComputing Chip Q2, which is designed to boost game resolution and frame rates more efficiently. Thanks to this chip, the phone can push gameplay up to 144fps on compatible games, even if they’re capped at 60fps.</p><p>The iQOO 13 brings a unique flair with its "Monster Halo" light strip circling the rear camera module. Taking a cue from Nothing’s design, this isn’t just for show—it handles notifications, call alerts, charging status, and even bumps along to your music. You can customize it with 12 colors and six breathing styles.</p><p>It packs a powerhouse camera setup with three 50MP sensors—a Sony IMX921 main, a telephoto, and an ultrawide lens. For selfies and video chats, there’s a 32MP front camera.</p>

<p>The camera is loaded with cool features like long exposure, slow-mo, Supermoon mode, tilt-shift, live photos, and even an Ultra HD Document mode for crystal-clear scans.</p><p>iQOO's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> takes things up a notch from the iQOO 12 with a beefed-up VC cooling system—17% more cooling area, 10% better heat dissipation, and a 26% boost in efficiency.</p><p>The iQOO 13 runs on Funtouch OS 15, built on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. iQOO promises four years of major updates and five years of security patches, setting a strong standard for long-term support.</p><p>Sadly, the iQOO 13 isn’t hitting the US market since iQOO and Vivo don’t sell their devices there. For those who can snag one, it’s available in two sleek colors: Legend White and Nardo Grey.</p>

I've tried other fitness earbuds both professionally and casually; none of them match my OpenFits for casual, forget-they're-there comfort. And thanks to this going-going-gone Cyber Monday sale, they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SHOKZ-OpenFit-Headphones-Microphone-Compatible/dp/B0BYSQDWRT"><strong>31% off ($124) for Cyber Monday</strong>.</a></p><p>Shokz specializes in bone conduction headphones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/shokz-openrun-pro-review">OpenRun Pro</a>. Even though they leave your ear canals fully unobstructed, the through-bone sound has always been an adjustment for me, which is why the OpenFit's dolphin shape directing traditional speaker sound into your canals without blocking them was such a revelation for me! They'll <em>never</em> fall off, and they keep you aware of your surroundings during races or on busy trails with zooming cyclists.</p>

<p>If that cost is a little too high for you, its newer, cheaper sibling is also on sale: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openswim-pro-and-openfit-air-review">Shokz OpenFit Air</a>, which has a rebalanced design that's supposed to feel slightly more comfortable and a new sound balance that's especially good at mids and highs. As a downside, it has shorter battery life and less pronounced bass. At <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SHOKZ-OpenFit-Air-Headphones-Resistant/dp/B0CRTMHVTJ"><strong>$99 (17% off), the OpenFit Airs</strong></a> are a solid compromise.</p>

<p>True audiophiles would probably scoff at the OpenFits sound quality compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">best workout headphones</a> from brands like Jabra and Jaybird — many of which are on sale for Cyber Monday, too. But that's not my priority: With traditional earbuds, I always have to worry about them falling out of my ears unless I find the perfect cups, and all it takes is one fall to mess up an earbud's sound for good.</p><p>With the Shokz OpenFits, not only will they stay hooked no matter how hard your feet pound the pavement, but you'll eventually forget they're even there! Once I'm in the zone, I just <em>experience</em> the sound of my playlist while my ear canals relax and feel the wind passing me by.</p><p>While the sound isn't as loud as traditional earbuds, they're more than loud enough to hear everything clearly at the middle volume. And these OpenFits easily lasted for my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-i-learned-running-20-mile-race-wearing-four-watches">20-miler race</a> with battery to spare, and after you get used to their presence, you'll forget that the OpenFits are even there as you settle into the zone.</p><p>That's why I'd recommend at least trying the OpenFits if you're a runner. If you're like me, you'll have trouble going back to regular earbuds after that!</p>

<p>Maybe you haven't had time to check out all of the different Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, but I've got one more for you. This deal is absolutely crazy, and I don't know how it managed to fly under the radar, but Lenovo is on a different level with its last-minute "Doorbuster" deals.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-300/ideapad-slim-3i-chromebook-gen-8-(14-inch-intel)/83bn001aus"><strong>IdeaPad Slim 3i Chromebook Plus is $300 off</strong></a>, with FREE shipping. It normally retails for $550, meaning that this sweet, sweet Chromebook can be yours for just $250.</p><p>No, there's nothing super-fancy about the Slim 3i Chromebook Plus, and it's not even the latest Chromebook to be released by Lenovo. So by that logic, you might be wondering why I'm even talking about it. It's simply because you're getting an excellent Chromebook Plus model, from Lenovo, for just $250.</p>

<p>What makes the Chromebook Plus branding so great is that it helps weed out the potentially frustrating Chromebooks from the good ones. Google has a set of requirements that a Chromebook needs to meet in order to qualify for that branding, and the Slim 3i Chromebook Plus does just that.</p><p>It sports a 14-inch FHD touchscreen display, that even has an anti-glare coating which is great for those that need to work on the go. It's also powered by the Intel Core i3-N305, paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and even has a backlit keyboard.</p><p>But wait! There's more!</p><p>Battery life is rated to last for up to 11 hours, but we'd venture to guess you can squeeze even more out of it. And if not, fear not, thanks to the 65W charger that takes you from 0-80% in just one hour. Knowing how good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Lenovo Chromebooks</a> are with battery life, I have a feeling you might only end up charging this once every three to four days, if not longer.</p><p>Oh, and I didn't even mention that the Slim 3i Chromebook Plus has a bunch of ports! There's a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, an HDMI 1.4 port, a 3.5mm audio combo jack, AND a Kensington lock slot.</p><p>Again, all of this for just $250. I mean, what more could you really ask for?</p>

<p>When you're building out a smart home, it's important to focus on the basics. That includes things like smart bulbs or displays. Once all of that's picked out, you might want to add some pizazz around the house, and that's where Nanoleaf's Shapes Hexagons Smarter Kit comes in.</p><p>The panels can be combined and arranged to create different shapes, and you can even connect other Nanoleaf Shapes panels together. But what's <em>really</em> crazy is that Amazon has a Cyber Monday deal that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Nanoleaf-Shapes-Hexagons-Smarter-Panels/dp/B08N62R79Z/"><strong>knocks a whopping 50% off the price</strong></a>. Normally, these retail for $200, but for $100, they're a steal.</p>

<p>I've been using these smart lights for over a year, and they're a great addition to my home office. As you can see in the picture above, I actually have the Hexagons and the Triangles. This is just because of the way everything is laid out, but I could combine them to create different patterns to have a bit of fun.</p><p>Something else that I really enjoy about Nanoleaf's smart lights is that they're compatible with basically every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/these-smart-plugs-saved-me-hundreds-and-now-theyre-half-off-ahead-of-cyber-monday">smart home platform</a>. This includes Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and even Apple HomeKit, which is simply wonderful so I don't have to worry about the headache if I decide to move to a different smart home platform.</p><p>If you're not convinced that this Cyber Monday is actually that good, let me point out that it's been in and out of stock all day long at both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Nanoleaf-Shapes-Hexagons-Smarter-Panels/dp/B08N62R79Z/">Amazon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nanoleaf-shapes-hexagons-smarter-kit-7-panels-multicolor/6426520.p?skuId=6426520">Best Buy</a>. Not to mention that you can't even get the Hexagons Smarter Kit directly from Nanoleaf, as it's been sold out for a few hours now.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Garmin's deal event began well before Cyber Monday, but there's <em>very</em> little chance these rare deals last past midnight. You can save $100 or more on most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a>, so you have your pick of the litter. But as someone who's reviewed every major Garmin watch of the last few years, I have one main Cyber Monday recommendation for serious runners: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0BS1T9J4Y"><strong>$100-off Garmin Forerunner 265</strong></a>, currently at its <strong>all-time low</strong>.</p><p>Ideally, I'd recommend the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner%C2%AE-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0BS1XZY7T"><strong>Forerunner 965 for $100 off</strong></a>, my all-time running watch favorite, but the Forerunner 265 costs $150 less with this deal, and I think you get diminishing returns for the pricier models. The 265 gives you all of the essentials and more, at a price more people can afford. That's why the Forerunner 265 is our #1 pick for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">best running watch</a>.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need guidance on whether to run low-aerobic, high-aerobic, or anaerobic workouts on a given day — or take a rest day — based on your training load breakdown and training readiness. You care about long battery life and coaching more than apps and maps, and you want reliable GPS and HR data.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want the Forerunner 965's extra 10 days of battery life, built-in topographical maps, and extra training data like Hill score. Or, you want a watch that <em>looks</em> more expensive and attractive.</p><p>If you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-vs-265">Forerunner 965 vs. 265</a>, the pricier model jumps from 13 to 23 days of battery life, adds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-september-2023-update-forerunner-instinct-watches">Hill and Endurance score metrics</a> and real-time stamina, and generally looks better with a larger display and titanium bezel. These are all great perks, but not enough to justify spending $499 for most runners.</p><p>By contrast, the Forerunner 265 still delivers essentials like daily suggested workouts and training load ratio, guiding you on what kind of workouts you should do to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">improve your VO2 Max</a> without overtraining yourself.</p><p>I switched out my Forerunner 265 for the 965, then wore <em>that</em> for over a year before switching to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>. But in both cases, the <em>software</em> I depended on didn't change, only the hardware. Everything I need to improve as a runner is available on the 265; so if you're a runner considering Garmin for the first time, or who's worn an older Garmin like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-55-review">Forerunner 55</a> for years, then the Forerunner 265 will be more than enough to make you happy!</p><p>As a side note, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner%C2%AE-Smartwatch-Advanced-Long-Lasting/dp/B09WTP57Z5"><strong>Forerunner 255 is $249 ($100 off)</strong></a>, and that watch is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-vs-255">near-identical to the 265</a> aside from the MIP display instead of AMOLED. If you can accept its lower resolution, you're getting Garmin's best tracking and training tools for a much more affordable price.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of years, I've been completely enamored by trying to turn anything I can into a retro gaming machine. I was hoping to find a good deal on something like Walmart's Onn. 4K Streaming Media Player, but no dice. Then, I saw Jerry's article that talks about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/build-your-own-nas-on-black-friday-cyber-monday-and-save-hundreds">building your own NAS with a Raspberry Pi</a>, and it gave me the "AHA" moment I needed.</p><p>Now that the Raspberry Pi 5 has been out for a little over a year, we don't have to deal with inventory shortages. This makes for the perfect brain of a retro gaming station, and one that you can even take with you when visiting family for the holidays.</p><p>On top of that, there are quite a few deals on different Raspberry Pi 5 kits, such as the Turbo Cooled Edition from Vilros, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Vilros-Raspberry-5-8GB-Starter-Kit/dp/B0CTT6X2ZJ/"><strong>which happens to be</strong> <strong>20% off</strong></a>.  This kit includes the 8GB Raspberry Pi 5, and almost everything else that you'll need to get up and running.</p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="facf7755-c3f9-4247-8146-4dbcb476fea2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Vilros offers a bunch of different bundles and Starter Kits, but the Turbo Cooled version is one of the cheaper Cyber Monday deals out there.

<p>Although the Vilros Starter Kit includes a case, it doesn't really do much to invoke the "retro nostalgia" that I'm looking for. Geeekpi is here to do exactly that but with an added bonus. See, you could get away with just loading everything up onto the microSD card, but once you start playing more demanding games, there's a potential for some bottlenecking.</p>

Not only does it look like an NES, but it even includes an expansion board so you can add an NVMe SSD to your Pi 5. Plus, it makes all of the ports easily accessible in the event that you need to plug in some peripherals. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/GeeekPi-Raspberry-Active-Cooler-Game5Pi/dp/B0DKHKD7MT/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4e5e3b34-0cc8-4569-8990-d15030056a5f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="GeeekPi Game5Pi Case with N08 Board: $24.99" data-dimension48="GeeekPi Game5Pi Case with N08 Board: $24.99" data-dimension25="$">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>With the Geeekpi Game5Pi Case, not only can you make the Pi look like an NES, but it also includes an M.2 NVMe SSD Peripheral Board and a cooler. NVMe SSDs are pretty cheap as it is, and there are still some last-minute deals, such as<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0CN9CD9JF"> saving $15 on a 1TB M.2 2230 drive</a>. However, the real benefit is the increased read/write speeds compared to when you were to stick to the included microSD card.</p><p>The only thing missing now is a way to actually play those games. When it comes to controllers with retro vibes, few can match up to the lineup that 8BitDo can provide. I was hoping to see either Bluetooth versions of the SN30 Pro or Pro 2 on sale, but couldn't find a deal on either one. Not all hope is lost, as the SN30 Pro Wired Controller is on sale for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/8bitdo-sn30-pro-usb-gamepad-gray/6475680.p">a few bucks off over at Best Buy</a>.</p>

<p>It also helps that the Geeekpi case includes front-facing USB-A ports, otherwise, it might be a bit more of a nuisance to go the wired route. But hey, you could always get a couple of these and huddle around the TV with your family just like we used to do when we were kids!</p><p>And that's pretty much it! Once everything arrives, just head over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://retropie.org.uk/">RetroPie</a> website, so you can enjoy a retro-themed operating system. Then, load up the microSD card or NVMe with your library of retro games, and be on your merry way!</p>

<ul><li>The latest Firefox update introduces a longtime iPadOS feature that will make Android foldables and tablets just as good for web browsing as iPads.</li><li>Firefox for Android version 133 will now load desktop sites by default on big-screened Android devices.</li><li>The change might make Firefox more appealing than Chrome, which only defaults to desktop webpages on "premium" Android tablets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Firefox for Android is gaining a highly-requested feature that will make the experience of web browsing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Android foldables</a> and tablets better. The latest version of Firefox for Android, version 133, loads webpages in desktop mode by default on all large devices, including foldables and tablets. Mozilla announced the change in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/android/133.0/releasenotes/" target="_blank">release notes</a> for Firefox for Android v133, as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/02/firefox-android-desktop-websites-tablets-foldables/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>"Desktop mode browsing is now enabled by default for large devices," the release notes explain. "This can be controlled via a preference under Settings in 'Site settings' previously named 'Site permissions.'"</p><p>The change is significant because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/firefox-announces-extension-support-for-android">Firefox</a> becomes the first major Android browser to load desktop sites by default on all big-screened Android devices. This matches functionality Apple has made available on iPadOS for years; iPads go a step further, presenting themselves as macOS clients to web providers. Firefox's widespread, and default, support for large Android devices will make it a top option for people who want the best browsing experience on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/are-foldable-phones-actually-better-than-tablets">tablets and folding phones</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BPAY9T9qMoxUh4BjGcnUMk" name="split-screen-apps-on-pixel-9-pro-fold.jpg" alt="Split-screen multitasking on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BPAY9T9qMoxUh4BjGcnUMk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Not even Chrome supports this Firefox feature on foldables. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Chrome supports desktop pages by default on "premium" Android tablets, limiting the experience. It also doesn't support default desktop sites for folding phones, even on the best ones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>While the behavior change for desktop sites on large Android devices is certainly the highlight of Firefox for Android v133, there's one other change worth noting. Clipped content in Private Browsing mode will now be treated as "sensitive content," and on Android 13 or higher devices, Firefox will mask clipboard notifications for privacy.</p><p>Importantly, Firefox doesn't appear to be limiting the default preferences for desktop sites to high-end devices, like Chrome has done since 2023. That means you should be able to start using desktop mode in Firefox without activating it manually on your Android foldables and tablets starting now, after you update to Firefox for Android v133.</p>

<hr>
<p>The suggestions carousel for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> is poised to make a comeback, bringing a longtime Google Search feature with it, if a recent APK teardown is any indication. The team at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-im-feeling-lucky-3504715/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> discovered the reversal in <strong>version 15.48.33.sa.arm64 beta</strong> of the Google app. In addition to suggestions making a return, the APK teardown revealed a new option for Gemini: <strong>I'm feeling lucky</strong>.</p><p>For the uninitiated, "I'm feeling lucky" is a way to use Google Search that is intended to randomize your experience. You can type in a prompt, and instead of pressing <strong>Search</strong>, clicking "I'm feeling lucky" will automatically open the webpage that would've been at the top of the search results for your query. It's a bit of a gamble, since the top result isn't always the best one. That's why, as the name suggests, it requires a bit of luck.</p><p>Another way to use "I'm feeling lucky" is to click the button before entering a Google Search query. After doing that, you'll get a completely random prompt, usually directed to a niche Google Search feature. For example, a common "I'm feeling lucky" redirect is to Google Doodles, which is the home for artistic renditions of the Google logo.</p><p>The version of "I'm feeling lucky" set to make an appearance in Gemini is more like the latter. It'll come up with a completely random Gemini prompt to run, and users will learn more about what Gemini can do in the process. You can see what that looks like in the example screenshots from Android Authority below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1374px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.80%;"><img id="XK2jFkZCu7hQxUHo5gXKr7" name="Gemini-Feeling-Lucky" alt="A screenshot of the new "I'm feeling lucky" prompt in Gemini." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XK2jFkZCu7hQxUHo5gXKr7.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1374" height="1014" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the above example, Gemini's "I'm feeling lucky" prompt highlighted a Gemini Extension with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tasks-best-gmail-feature">Google Tasks</a>. The sample request involved asking Gemini to set a reminder, and the AI chatbot did so using Tasks integration. At the end, Gemini suggested going live with voice, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">pushing users to try Gemini Live</a>. It all appears to part of an effort to help users understand the type of tasks the assistant can help with, all while having a bit of fun.</p><p>While the suggestions carousel — which included sample prompts for Gemini — was removed in October, it's back in the Google app beta with "I'm feeling lucky" at the forefront. This option is at the front of the carousal, all the time. Even though the rest of the carousel's options shuffle around, "I'm feeling lucky" is persistent.</p><p>This feature was spotted as part of an APK teardown, so it's not certain that Google will bring back either the suggestions carousel or "I'm feeling lucky," or both. However, it could be a neat way to show off Gemini's potential while making a clever callback to an iconic Google Search feature.</p>
