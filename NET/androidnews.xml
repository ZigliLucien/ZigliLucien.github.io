After nearly a decade of semi-custom designs, Qualcomm is once again leveraging a fully custom architecture, and that is immensely exciting. </p><p>As you can imagine, Qualcomm is touting heady gains across the board with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and with a node shift to 3nm, the chipset may just be one of the best we&apos;ve gotten in recent years. Here&apos;s everything you need to know about the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and how it compares to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> and MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9400. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg" name="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-8-Elite-clock-speeds-memory" alt="A graphic showing the Snapdragon 8 Elite's 2 power cores (4.32GHz) and six performance cores (3.53GHz), plus the SoC's cache (24MB L2) and memory (5.3GHz LPDDR5x)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, Qualcomm is changing how it uses cores in the Snapdragon 8 Elite, with the platform featuring eight performance cores as standard. You don&apos;t get the usual efficiency cores that do a bulk of the mundane tasks, with Qualcomm emulating MediaTek in this regard. If you want to know more about why Qualcomm ditched efficiency cores with this generation, my colleague Michael Hicks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-snapdragon-8-elite-doesnt-need-efficiency-cores-to-last-longer">talked to Qualcomm engineers</a> about why it&apos;s a big deal.</p><p>Let&apos;s take a look at how the Snapdragon 8 Elite compares to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9400:</p>

<p>Qualcomm significantly boosted the clocks of its cores, with the main cores now going up to 4.32GHz — nearly 1GHz more than that of the 8 Gen 3. This is because of the node shift to 3nm; Qualcomm is finally using TSMC&apos;s 3nm node, and that allows the manufacturer to deliver increased frequencies while still maintaining stable thermals. </p><p>Qualcomm is also touting heady gains on the gaming side of things, along with a new neural engine, and AI-assisted tweaks to its imaging platform. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-heading-back-to-custom-designs-with-oryon-cpu"><span>Heading back to custom designs with Oryon CPU</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Infographic" alt="The final Qualcomm infographic for the Snapdragon 8 Elite showing its overall performance gains compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Qualcomm has been switching up the core configuration of its chipsets, and the Snapdragon 8 Elite comes with the biggest shift in this regard in nearly a decade. Because of the use of second-gen Oryon cores, Qualcomm is able to deliver incredible gains, with the brand touting a massive 45% gain in performance over the 8 Gen 3 in single-core and multi-core workloads.</p><p>What&apos;s also interesting is that the 8 Elite is 44% more efficient while performing the same workloads as the 8 Gen 3, and that&apos;s more than a generational increase. Qualcomm used semi-custom design in recent years, where it would basically license Arm cores and add a few custom features, while retaining Kryo branding.</p><p>However, with the Oryon cores, Qualcomm is using Arm&apos;s architectural license; it takes the instruction set from Arm and then builds the core from the ground up, allowing it much better flexibility. The return to custom cores gives the Snapdragon 8 Elite a sizeable advantage, and close the gap to Apple&apos;s silicon.</p><p>In fact, this is similar to Apple&apos;s approach with its A series chipsets, and although Qualcomm used to do the same in the past, we haven&apos;t seen fully custom cores from the chip vendor following the Snapdragon 805. Qualcomm is once again able to deliver custom designs thanks to its acquisition of Nuvia back in 2021.</p><p>What does the switch to the custom architecture entail? Well, Qualcomm is touting incredible gains in performance over the 8 Gen 3, and that should make a difference in real-world use. Qualcomm is just using two core clusters this time, and that allows the brand to tailor tasks with better efficiency — we got four clusters last year.</p><p>Another factor to consider is the 4.32GHz frequency on the main cores; this is considerably more than previous years, and while the cores only go up to the maximum frequency in very short bursts, it should still make a difference.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-taking-gaming-to-new-heights-with-adreno-gpu"><span>Taking gaming to new heights with Adreno GPU</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2542px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:128.17%;"><img id="MKMTxRHWBnBpTNK43vhYYh" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Inside-View" alt="A photo of a phone's internal parts, with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo sitting in the middle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MKMTxRHWBnBpTNK43vhYYh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2542" height="3258" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the gaming side of things, the Snapdragon 8 Elite switches up the naming convention once again, with Qualcomm just going with Adreno branding without any model numbers. Again, we get heady figures, with Qualcomm touting a 40% increase in performance. What is much more interesting is that the GPU is 40% more efficient at the same tasks as the 8 Gen 3.</p><p>The GPU also includes increased video memory, and there&apos;s a 35% uptick in ray tracing along with the ability to use Unreal Engine 5’s Nanite engine. All of these features are undoubtedly great, but what I&apos;m interested in knowing is how phones with the platform handle sustained gaming; this has been an issue on the 8 Gen 3, and while there was no shortage of power, it led to overheating and thermal constraints.</p><p>It remains to be seen if those issues have been mitigated with this generation, and if we actually get usable titles that have ray tracing enabled.</p>

<p>You can&apos;t go two minutes in the tech industry without a mention of AI, and Qualcomm is rolling out several upgrades in this area as well. The Hexagon NPU has a 45% increase in AI performance, along with 45% better efficiency per watt. It integrates multimodal AI engines, including Gemini Nano.</p><p>While I don&apos;t see the point of mobile AI just yet, what is interesting is how Qualcomm is leveraging machine learning into its imaging platform. The Spectra AI ISP now includes limitless real-time semantic segmentation, and that should deliver better portrait shots. You get to see these benefits in videos as well, and that&apos;s just great.</p>

<p>Xiaomi is a launch partner for Qualcomm, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-snapdragon-8-elite-keynote-announcement">Xiaomi 15</a> is the first phone to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite silicon globally. OnePlus isn&apos;t far behind with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, which is launching in China on October 31. </p><p>Honor is debuting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-magic-7-series-is-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-and-it-comes-with-an-on-device-autopilot-ai">Magic 7 series</a> with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and we have ASUS, Nubia, iQOO, and other manufacturers getting in on the action. We usually need to wait until the end of the year to get devices based on Qualcomm&apos;s latest silicon, but it looks like some device makers are targeting an early release, so we don&apos;t need to wait to get hands on the Snapdragon 8 Elite. </p>

<p>Xiaomi is a launch partner for Qualcomm, and the Xiaomi 15 is the first phone to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite silicon globally. OnePlus isn&apos;t far behind with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, which is launching in China on October 31. </p><p>Honor is debuting the Magic 7 series with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and we have ASUS, Nubia, iQOO, and other manufacturers getting in on the action. We usually need to wait until the end of the year to get devices based on Qualcomm&apos;s latest silicon, but it looks like some device makers are targeting an early release, so we don&apos;t need to wait to get hands on the Snapdragon 8 Elite. </p>

<ul><li>The floating bottom bar in Google Chat now has a pill shape instead of a circular design, along with a bit of extra width.</li><li>The color scheme has been upgraded with Dynamic Color, enhancing contrast and overall look in Google Chat.</li><li>Plus, the last icon switched from the @ symbol to three dots.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After introducing a floating bottom navigation bar to Google Chat around a year ago, Google is now sprucing it up to match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Material You</a> vibe.</p><p>The floating bottom bar, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-new-navigation-bar">debuted about a year ago as part of a bigger Google redesign</a>, just got a fresh new look. Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/21/google-chat-floating-bottom-bar-material-you/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this refresh makes everything feel more cohesive and visually appealing in the app.</p><p>Prior to this update, the floating bottom bar had a circular shape that helped you spot the active feed. It featured four icons and a button to start a new message. Now, it’s been reshaped into a pill-like design and widened a bit.</p><p>While this change might take up a little more screen space, this refresh gives it a style that jives better with how other Google apps work.</p><p>The fresh design <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-ai-gemini-summaries-update">debuted along with Gemini summaries</a>, which are now popping up in Google Chat's Home view. Just long-press a thread on your phone, and Gemini summaries will help you get up to speed on any missed conversations. The AI assistant will provide three bullet points summarizing the key points.</p><p>For those using Google Chat on desktop, a 'Summarize' button shows up when you hover over a conversation thread. Clicking it works like the long-press on mobile, giving you a quick summary of the chat.</p><p>Another upgrade is the new color scheme. The background of the floating bottom bar now uses Dynamic Color, letting it blend in nicely with your device's color palette.</p><p>This change boosts its contrast with the rest of the Chat interface, making everything look nicer together. Also, the last icon has swapped out the @ symbol for three dots. All these tweaks come together to create a more stylish and unified user interface in the app.</p><p>Right now, though, the floating bottom bar design is unique to Google Chat, but at least the recent updates have made it look good enough to hang out with the other Google apps.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has rolled out a bunch of new security features for its Messages app that use on-device AI to fend off spam, shady links, and other digital junk.</p><p>As part of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">top messaging app</a> picked up some upgraded scam detection, zeroing in on catching fake delivery and job offer scams.</p><p>If it detects a potential scam, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> will either toss it into the spam folder or alert you with a warning. It uses on-device machine learning to catch these tricks while keeping your chats private, according to the search giant's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/5-new-protections-on-google-messages.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>. This update is currently being tested by beta users who have activated the spam protection feature.</p><p>Next up, Google is rolling out smart alerts for potentially risky links. These malicious URLs can cause serious trouble, from installing harmful software to sending users to fake phishing sites.</p><p>The messaging app will alert users when they get links from unknown sources and filter out messages with such links. Currently, Google is testing this feature with users in India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore, with plans to roll it out globally later this year.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning that while many scam texts come from abroad, they’re not all international. Google has revealed that users will soon be able to automatically hide messages from international senders not in their contacts. Those messages will go straight to the "Spam & blocked" folder. This feature is currently being tested in Singapore and will roll out to more countries soon.</p><p>The latest safety upgrades also bring smart alerts that automatically blur nudity in images. If users try to share explicit content, they'll get a warning about the potential risks. This feature will be enabled by default for users under 18, while adults will have to opt in via the Android settings.  This update is expected to roll out in the coming months for Android devices running version 9 or later.</p><p>Scammers don’t only rely on international numbers; they often impersonate real businesses or even friends. To combat these tricks, the Messages app is launching a contact verification system that uses each contact's public key to confirm their identity, checking sender credentials via a QR code or registered phone number.</p><p>Let’s hope Google speeds up the rollout of these new features. After all, over a billion people are counting on Google Messages to keep their daily chats flowing, as per the company.</p>

It may not be the newest kid on the block any more, but if you want a smartphone for under 500 bucks, this deal on the Pixel 7 Pro is an awesome choice. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCQVFQHD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="729fcdbc-7457-448c-8b51-79cb7d03a35a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999" data-dimension48="$999">View Deal</a></p></div>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2024-early-discounts-and-how-to-prepare"><em><strong>See our guide to the best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday 2024 (so far)</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>That&apos;s a truly remarkable discount on a device that we considered to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> that money can buy back in 2022. While the Pixel 7 Pro has since been replaced by newer models, it&apos;s got a larger AMOLED display than the similarly-priced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>, plus awesome cameras, the still-capable Tensor G2 chipset, and software support through October 2025, at least.</p><p>The only issue with buying the Pixel 7 Pro in 2024 is that you won&apos;t get as many OS and security updates as you would with a newer phone, and that curved screen that Google later abandoned may not be for everyone. It&apos;s also worth noting that this discount is coming from a third-party seller at Amazon, so I can see it disappearing shortly after I hit that Publish button.</p><p>Still, the Pixel 7 Pro has stood the test of time and will likely go down in the smartphone history books as one of the best phones that Google ever produced. Getting your hands on one of these devices for under $500 seems like a no-brainer, and it isn&apos;t even Black Friday yet.</p>

<h2 id="which-retailer-has-the-best-black-friday-samsung-deals-2">Which retailer has the best Black Friday Samsung deals?</h2>
<p>It depends on what you&apos;re looking for! Pretty much every retailer under the sun will be launching holiday sales as we approach Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend, so you&apos;ll want to be vigilant and look around before committing to one retailer (or you could simply bookmark Androidcentral.com for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">comprehensive deal coverage</a>). </p><p>That being said, if you are hoping to buy unlocked Samsung devices, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart will probably be your best bet. If you&apos;re willing to make a trade-in or update your wireless service, consider checking with your phone carrier or Samsung itself to see what offers are available. </p>
<h2 id="should-i-shop-on-black-friday-or-cyber-monday-xa0-2">Should I shop on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? </h2>
<p>The biggest discounts on devices such as smartphones, TVs, and video game consoles usually go live on Black Friday, while Cyber Monday is typically a better time to purchase smaller items like accessories and smart home tech. With that being said, some devices will sell out before Monday hits, so don&apos;t wait to buy if something catches your eye. </p>

<h2 id="when-will-black-friday-sales-start-2">When will Black Friday sales start?</h2>
<p>Although no retailers are naming it as such, the Black Friday sales have pretty much already begun. In the coming days, you&apos;ll see retailers across the web launching sales to get shoppers ready for the holiday season — the big question is whether these offers will improve as we near November 29th. Needless to say, if you&apos;re looking for a Samsung deal this holiday season, bookmark this page: I&apos;ll keep updating this guide with new offers as they go live. </p>
<h2 id="what-samsung-deals-can-i-expect-during-black-friday-2">What Samsung deals can I expect during Black Friday?</h2>
<p>If Amazon&apos;s recent Prime Day sale (aka Big Deal Days) is any indication, you can expect the return of record-breaking discounts on the Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6, and the latest lineup of Samsung smartwatches. Samsung smart TVs are also likely to receive some major discounts, and if we&apos;re lucky, we might see the first batch of price drops on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> and Galaxy Tab S10 series of tablets. </p>

<ul><li>Google Translate has an Instant Translate feature that converts text from one language to another as you type.</li><li>Currently, if you use Instant Translate, you don't have access to some Google Translate tools.</li><li>A future update may bring the full slate of Google Translate features to Instant Translate mode, providing a more straightforward experience.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Translation apps, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-adds-110-new-languages">Google Translate</a>, are getting reliable enough that you can use them as a real-time translator. Part of that is due to features like Live Translate, which translates speech across languages, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-googles-live-translate-feature">Instant Translate</a>, which converts text from one language to another. </p><p>However, if you use Instant Translate, you'll lose out on a few major Google Translate features. With an upcoming software update, Instant Translate could gain full feature parity with the regular Google Translate mode.</p><p>The feature was spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-translate-richer-seamless-instant-translate-apk-teardown-3492801/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, who demonstrated the new Instant Translate functionality in the YouTube video below.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GPqJFw9bEL0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The changes were picked up in Android Authority's teardown of the APK for <strong>v8.20.71.687383449.1</strong> of the Google Translate app. While there's no guarantee that this functionality will be released to the public, it's clear that Google is testing big changes to Instant Translate. After the team at Android Authority managed to activate the feature, they saw all the Google Translate UI elements in Instant Translate mode. </p><p>When you use the default Google Translate mode in the mobile app, you have a lot of features at your fingertips. You can translate text, of course, but the user interface packs many more tools. For starters, the output can be spoken and copied. There will also be definitions and grammar suggestions that will help you understand the way words and phrases differ across languages.</p><p>The unfortunate part of using Instant Translate is that all these tools go away when this mode is activated. It'll convert text from one language to another as you type in real-time, but the above actions — from speaking to copying — are unavailable until you exit Instant Translate. That is, for now. The upcoming version of the Google Translate app could bring all the above functionality to Instant Translate mode, making it one of the best ways to use the app. </p><p>We'll have to wait and see if these changes to Instant Translate are available to users of the Google Translate app soon. In addition to the new functionality for Instant Translate, the report notes that Google Translate may add the ability to recover a recently deleted translation. </p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm announced new Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite platforms with Oryon CPU tech and 3X/ 12X CPU and AI performance over previous versions.</li><li>Snapdragon Cockpit Elite enables AI tricks like an LLM assistant trained on the car manual and zonal audio.</li><li>Ride Elite supports up to 40 cameras and sensors at once for self-driving cars, plus behavior-learning tech to take automatic actions based on your preferences.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Whether or not you have any interest in owning or riding in a self-driving car, Qualcomm says that its automaker clients want to pack their cars with more AI technology. With its new Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite, the company is promising ambitious, futuristic AI capabilities that hover between exciting and science-fiction.</p><p>Available starting in 2025, the 2nd-gen Cockpit Elite uses the same Oryon CPU tech found in its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> CPUs—which were announced yesterday at the Qualcomm Summit—with 3X the CPU performance of the last Snapdragon Cockpit. It also sports a Hexagon NPU with 12X-boosted AI and an Adreno GPU capable of supporting an absurd 16 4K displays simultaneously in one car, as well as "real-time ray tracing" and "immersive 3D experiences" for "critical visual information."</p><p>I asked the Qualcomm team why any car would need that much graphical power; they explained that this allows your car's infotainment display to span the entire front dashboard while still leaving processing power for TVs on seatbacks for passengers and graphical augmentations on your side mirrors.</p><p>Presumably, non-autonomous vehicles wouldn't need as many distracting screens, but luxury automakers would have that option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DZHqzrNr8zvEkHstLNKj9" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-cockpit-elite-zonal-audio" alt="Graphic showing "AI-enabled zonal audio" and what the Snapdragon Cockpit/ Ride Elite SoC looks like." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DZHqzrNr8zvEkHstLNKj9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The boosted CPU supports simultaneous tasks like navigation, music, calling, and gaming simultaneously. But the flashy star of Cockpit Elite, unsurprisingly, is the AI tech.</p><p>Qualcomm says its Hexagon NPU is "built to handle Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters." Each car's specific hands-free assistant would be trained on the car's manual so you could, for example, ask what a warning light means.</p><p>Snapdragon Cockpit Elite would also "learn and adapt to your preferences," Qualcomm claims, and even "take actions automatically." This part of the presentation felt looser on hard details; I asked what exact preferences the AI could learn, and heard examples like your car routing you home without your input if you usually do so at that time. It could also recognize which backup route you like to take during heavy traffic, or guide another driver (like your spouse) towards your usual parking spot.</p><p>In addition, Snapdragon Elite would recognize the number of passengers and change its usual patterns accordingly, like preventing phone notifications if someone else could hear them or using "zonal audio" to localize relevant audio to the driver while focusing on music for the passengers.</p>

<p>Qualcomm also announced the Snapdragon Ride Elite, which essentially pairs with Cockpit Elite as a single SoC for self-driving cars.</p><p>Ride Elite supports up to 40 sensors, including multiple 16MP cameras with 360º FoV and passenger-facing infrared cameras. It's meant to capture signs, lanes, and objects clearly, as well as recognize passenger gestures.</p><p>It simultaneously supports radar/lidar point-cloud processing, automotive security when parked, and other behavioral AI tricks like auto-rerouting around accidents, self-guided parking, and opening your sunroof depending on the weather.</p>

<p>All combined, the Qualcomm Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite seem to promise smarts that are good enough to power the talking AI car from Knight Rider. We'll have to see how much a powerful SoC like this costs, both for automakers and for consumers, and whether the ambitious AI promises actually lead to helpful automation for drivers.</p>

<hr>
<p>YouTube Music could be working on support for clamshell foldable phones to refine its user experience.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-music-now-playing-widget-galaxy-z-flip-cover-display-apk-teardown-3492702/">Android Authority</a>, the YouTube Music mobile app&apos;s latest version (v7.24.51) holds clues that point toward a "FlipWidgetProvider." The publication conducted an APK teardown of the app and found a string that directly mentions a widget for a "flip" device, which is reportedly confirmed to be Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip series.</p><p>The post states the app&apos;s code shows that the "music player" widget can be enabled via <strong>Settings > Cover Screen > Widgets </strong>once YouTube rolls it out. Users may find this useful as such a widget isn&apos;t supported on the Flip series. However, it <em>is </em>on your standard slab phone like the Galaxy S24 series for the home screen. The widget gives options like play/pause, skip forward/back, and thumbs up/down options.</p><p>With its expected arrival on the Flip series&apos; cover display, users can have enhanced access to their music <em>without </em>opening the phone. Considering the size of the Galaxy Z Flip cover display, this widget will give users more mileage. Speaking of, it&apos;s unclear which devices will grab YouTube Music&apos;s widget support.</p><p>The widget will likely debut on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>; however, it&apos;s unclear how far back Samsung is willing to go.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hTUG84r5j64bMjQgCgnSjF" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-apps.jpg" alt="Apps on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5's cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hTUG84r5j64bMjQgCgnSjF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung dubbed the larger screen of its Flip series the "Flex Window" when the Flip 5 launched in 2023. It was clear from the beginning that the "window" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-initial-impressions">needed to be more flexible</a>. Users couldn&apos;t open any app they wanted on the cover display. Samsung implemented a "curated, optimized experience," limiting your options. Originally, the Flip 5&apos;s cover screen supported the following apps: Google Messages, Samsung Messages, WhatsApp, YouTube, Netflix, and Google Maps.</p><p>The ability to open more apps was tucked behind Samsung&apos;s Good Lock app launcher. The launcher gave users control over almost every app they had. This YouTube Music widget with Flex Window support will likely give users a more refined music control experience.</p><p>In other news, YouTube Music was busy rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-youtube-music-extension-rollout">a Gemini Extension</a> for desktop and Android users. Users will find a series of suggested commands for the AI for music lookup, album discovery, or specific radio genre. After Gemini locates the song, users are thrown into YouTube Music for the playback or continuous radio stream.</p>

<hr>
<p>After teasing us with the announcement that Circle to Search is coming to its phones, Motorola is finally launching the feature on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">2024 Razr series</a> via a new update rolling out now.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> and the more affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a> are currently receiving a new update, which seems to be a regular security and stability update at first glance. The update release notes only mention the September 2024 security patch and stability improvements, but nothing else. However, after I finished installing the update, Circle to Search was live on both phones.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> is a simple way to search what's on your screen by pressing and holding the navigation bar and circling or selecting specific items. The feature works with images, text, and even audio, and it can translate what's on your screen in a pinch. Think of it as a more accessible Google Lens.</p><p>The feature has been exclusive to Pixel and Samsung phones since its launch earlier this year but has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-steps-up-to-challenge-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-6-with-this-ai-feature">recently started arriving on more phones</a>.</p><p>Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-is-finally-catching-up-to-samsung-with-these-ai-features">previously stated</a> that Circle to Search would be available on its devices, but the company neglected to state which devices would get the feature or when. We asked for clarification, but so far we have not received an answer. That said, it appears the 2023 Razr models have not received Circle to Search after receiving the most recent software update.</p><p>As for the models that did receive it, the feature is enabled by default, so you can start circling and searching after the phone reboots. To disable Circle to Search, navigate to <strong>Settings > Gestures > System navigation</strong>, where you'll find an option to toggle the feature off.</p>

<p>The update comes in at 1.05GB for the Razr Plus but just under 1GB for the Razr 2024.</p><p>Aside from Circle to Search, I also caught that the quick settings menu has a very pronounced fading effect when swiping out of it, something I didn't notice before. Otherwise, I haven't noticed anything else of note.</p>

<p>Curiously, this is the first update I've received since the phone launched in July, and that's not from a lack of checking. Motorola, while not being the best with timely updates, is usually good at keeping its bi-monthly cadence, which was the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>.</p><p>It's possible the company was preparing to add the feature and thus delayed the update. Still, it's nice to see the feature being added so quickly after other OEMs like Honor are also getting Circle to Search.</p><p>In the meantime, Motorola is also preparing to add <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">new Moto AI features</a> to its phones. At Lenovo Tech World 2024, the company revealed that these features were currently in beta and being tested with a small group of Razr 50/Ultra and Edge 50 Ultra users. However, the beta would be extended by the end of the year for more users.</p><p>These features will be able to summarize your notifications, remember conversations, recall images, and more. Motorola is also testing a Large Action Model (LAM) that essentially navigates apps on your behalf, doing things like ordering coffee and booking an Uber, although this is only a proof-of-concept at the moment.</p>

<p>Now that Circle to Search is live on the Razr, hopefully Motorola's update cadence will improve. We also expect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> to arrive on Motorola phones at some point, but Motorola has been pretty mum regarding its update plans. So far, at least one Motorola phone has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-edge-50-fusion-gets-android-15-beta">already received the Android 15 beta</a>, which is a good sign.</p>
