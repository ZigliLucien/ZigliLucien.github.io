<ul><li>The Google Home team held an AMA on Reddit, and users chimed in heavily to voice their displeasure and curiosity about the app's development.</li><li>The team teased that there's more to come for Google Home on the web, stating "additional controls" are on the way.</li><li>A Google Home member stated that there is a "vision and roadmap" behind their development of the app and its features, but specifics weren't stated.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google Home team held an AMA (ask me anything) on Reddit, answering questions about its web availability and devices. While many users took the opportunity to complain, the Google Home team provided a bit of insight into the future of the platform.</p><p>Several product and engineering managers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/were_the_team_behind_the_latest_updates_to_nest/?share_id=D99o-RHMpgSW0jKzLr3MR&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1">were on deck to reply</a> to users&apos; questions as things got underway. One user had a lengthy post, asking questions about Google Home&apos;s controls on the web, devices, and the removal of Assistance in favor of Gemini. Jacqueline, a product manager, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/comment/kx16o89/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">responded by stating</a>, "We&apos;re working on bringing additional device control to Google Home for web."</p><p>The team didn&apos;t have much more to say about what sort of controls users could expect, but the new additions would appear in a Public Preview first. The Home team declined to comment any further about AI in its devices.</p><p>Topics turned into questioning about when Google would bring an offline mode to the Home app. Team member Daniel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/comment/kwztl8z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">said</a>, "We&apos;re focusing first on routing more of your interactions locally (thanks to Matter!) to get the reliability and latency benefits." The post added that once Google feels it has a "significant" amount of your traffic operating locally, it will shift to focus on bringing "powerful" offline capabilities through the app.</p><p>Cohesiveness, or lack thereof, was another talking point for one user. Google Home&apos;s Daniel took the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/comment/kwzx5cr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">lead once more</a>, stating that the team has a "vision and roadmap" to help them navigate the process of software and product development.</p><p>Daniel mentioned the Home team&apos;s need to create a brand new UI experience to accommodate its new camera protocols and acknowledged that it could cause "frustration and pain" for the user.</p><p>We&apos;re still left wondering what Google Home&apos;s current roadmap is for app development, as they did not share further.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/were_the_team_behind_the_latest_updates_to_nest">We’re the team behind the latest updates to Nest devices and Google Home for web - ask us anything!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome">r/googlehome</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Despite the Home team declining to divulge its roadmap, mentioning the Matter connectivity standard for smart homes is a good starting point. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-2-upgrade-details">Matter 1.2 upgrade</a> launched in October 2023, bringing with it support for nine device types. Moreover, the Matter standard helps smart devices communicate with one another (locally) instead of running through a company like Google.</p><p>Meanwhile, the latest Google Home update arrived for its web app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-for-web-getting-camera-history-and-clip-editor-in-new-update">earlier in March</a>. The update brought camera history and a clip editor to web users, which were highly requested features the community pushed for. The latter enabled users to chop down and save clips that their cameras have recorded for other uses.</p><p>The update also brought the availability of the Public Preview testing space for Home web users to test new features.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Meta/Oculus Quest 2</a> may be a bit outdated at this point, but it still ranks among the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headsets</a> that money can buy. Now just $199.99, the Quest 2 boasts an ultra-immersive 90Hz display, 6GB of RAM, and up to 2.5 hours of battery life on a single charge. You'll also get access to nearly all of the same <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a> that are available on the Meta Quest 3, but at a much lower cost. </p>
<p>Pick up this acclaimed headset from Best Buy and you'll also get over $150 worth of free extras, including a pair of Logitech headphones that'll make your VR experience feel much more immersive and lifelike. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/meta-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb-gray/6473553.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="82cedc8d-4af7-4b43-8218-9ba14152e29f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.99" data-dimension48="$249.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>I&apos;m no mathematician, but lets break down the numbers here. For a single payment of $199.99, you&apos;ll be getting the 128GB VR headset, a pair of Logitech Chorus Off-Ear Headphones designed specifically for the Quest <strong>(a $99.99 value)</strong>, a three-month subscription to YouTube Premium <strong>(a $41.97 value)</strong>, and one month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate <strong>(a $16.99 value)</strong>. Add it all up and you&apos;re looking at over $150 worth of free stuff, and that&apos;s without counting the Meta Quest 2&apos;s new low price. No kidding. It&apos;s no wonder we&apos;re calling this the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-oculus-quest-2-prices-and-deals">best Meta Quest 2 deal</a> of the month.</p><p>Sure, the Quest 2 is a bit old at this point, but it&apos;s an excellent choice if you&apos;re new to the world of VR gaming and you want to try out a great headset without a major investment. That said, if money is no object, you&apos;ll definitely want to upgrade to the newer Meta Quest 3 for $499. Looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-quest-2-vs-quest-3">Meta Quest 2 vs Meta Quest 3</a>, the Quest 3 improves upon its predecessor in all of the areas where it counts, from speed and responsiveness to its lighter construction. </p><p>But if you&apos;re a casual gamer and you just want a fun VR experience with access to loads of games, this Quest 2 deal is for you. </p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s Care Plus team has started notifying users of the impending availability of unlimited battery repairs for eligible devices and certain plans.</p><p>An email received by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-care-plus-battery-repair-3429615/">Android Authority</a> shows that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/samsung-care-plus/">Samsung Care Plus</a> is planning to introduce support for unlimited battery repairs in May. The email states that those who have purchased Samsung Care Plus with Loss and Theft protection or the standard Care Plus plan are eligible for unlimited battery repairs.</p><p>More importantly, your device is only eligible for a battery repair if its charging capacity drops below 79%. Samsung states this can be confirmed through a diagnostics check and if it&apos;s below that line, your battery will be replaced. Of course, Samsung will only handle repairs during an active coverage period.</p><p>Speaking of, the email adds that users can mail in their devices or walk into a Samsung store for battery repairs. The company adds that your device will remain eligible for a battery repair as part of your plan so long as there is no "additional damage."</p><p>With this new support beginning in May, Samsung states consumers will be charged an extra $2 per month. Your payment method of choice will be charged on May 1, 2024, serving as "confirmation that you accept these changes and that you wish to continue."</p>

<p>Walk-ins for battery repairs are a welcome sight as Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-batteries-plus-expanded-partnership">expanded its partnership</a> with Batteries Plus last October. The expansion saw 35 stores across the U.S. convert into Samsung Authorization Service Centers. This allows consumers to enter and speak to Galaxy device professionals for insight into what&apos;s wrong with their devices. Moreover, the partnership included support for foldable device repairs.</p><p>But this email notifying users of unlimited battery repair goes hand-in-hand with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-brings-back-a-battery-feature-it-had-previously-removed">returning One UI feature</a>. One UI 6.1 has brought back the "since last charge" screen, giving users more insight into what apps are soaking up power and how long their battery has left. The "Today" page has remained, letting users check in and see how apps affect their battery daily.</p>

<ul><li>The latest WhatsApp for iOS update brings a handy new feature to the messaging platform.</li><li>Users, post the update, can double tap the screen to skip/rewind a video for ten seconds.</li><li>The feature is widely popular on YouTube and Twitter, and chances to venture into the Android version of WhatsApp are likely.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp has a new nifty feature rolling out to iOS users this week that should make video watching on the messaging platform hassle-free.</p><p>Early this week, WhatsApp on iOS, bearing a <strong>24.6.77</strong> version number, brought in a new handy feature that allows users to quickly forward or rewind a video by double-tapping on the edge of their screens (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-for-ios-24-6-77-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>). The feature has been quite popular in leading <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps#section-best-video-streaming-apps">video apps</a> like YouTube and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps#section-best-social-media-apps">social media apps</a> like X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.61%;"><img id="XHcn5SZ6eRtJH4Jk47crhj" name="whatsapp-ios-update-24677.jpg" alt="WhatsApp new iOS update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XHcn5SZ6eRtJH4Jk47crhj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="277" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During the playback of videos, double tapping on either edge of the video would fast-forward or rewind the video by ten seconds.</p><p>For now, the feature is official on WhatsApp for iOS. The feature&apos;s rollout to Android devices is still unclear; however, the video control was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-23-24-6-whats-new/">featured earlier</a> in WhatsApp beta for Android in November 2023. It was seen as functional in the beta version, albeit the feature didn&apos;t see the light of day in the stable version of the app.</p><p>With iOS users now receiving the functionality, we could soon see it on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and tablets, too. It would be one handy feature to see amongst several others that have popped up over the past few weeks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="VjUaunhuWYZ7g8t2fTpQoj" name="whatsapp-beta-video-double-tap-feature.jpg" alt="WhatsApp video double tap feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VjUaunhuWYZ7g8t2fTpQoj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="280" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">WhatsApp for Android beta previously found testing double tap feature </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of the latest WhatsApp features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-to-add-one-minute-video-status-updates">include</a> Instagram-like longer status updates, which are also found in the app&apos;s latest beta for Android devices. Another feature seen in the works is the ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-beta-prepares-optional-link-preview">hide link previews</a> shared in messages on WhatsApp.</p><p>WhatsApp on Android is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-testing-transcribe-voice-notes-feature">testing the ability</a> to transcribe voice notes within the chats, which is very helpful in certain scenarios where users are unable to hear the voice messages and want to read them instead. The interesting aspect of the feature is that they are still end-to-end encrypted and don&apos;t leave the device. Notably, the feature is already live on the iOS platform.</p>

<p>Samsung is the brand to beat when it comes to timely software updates, and the South Korean manufacturer has done an incredible job in this area over the last three years. It is also the only brand other than Google that rolls out monthly security updates, and what&apos;s particularly great is that Samsung lavishes the same level of attention on its mid-range Galaxy A series as its flagship Galaxy S and Galaxy Z portfolio.</p><p>With Samsung guaranteeing four Android OS updates to its flagships and Galaxy A devices, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> over the last three years are eligible to receive the stable One UI 6 update. </p><p>Like last year, the stable build will roll out to the Galaxy S23 series, followed by the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5, and then make its way to last year&apos;s flagships and then the Galaxy A series. Here&apos;s the full breakdown of Samsung phones that will make the switch to the Android 14-based One UI 6:</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="N9VwacMCg3Z2Vx4bv9todm" name="one-ui-6-2.jpg" alt="One UI 6 full-size notification pane against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N9VwacMCg3Z2Vx4bv9todm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The One UI 6 beta is slowly going out to more users, so if you&apos;re interested in trying out the latest features before they&apos;re officially released, now is the time to do so. That said, the beta is still rough around the edges, and I ran into a lot of bugs and crashes in the week I used it. So if you&apos;re thinking of using it on your primary phone, you should hold off until Samsung rolls out a few updates. </p><p>As for the new features, there&apos;s a lot to talk about, with Samsung making several changes to the visual design. The most noticeable is the notification pane, which now has two large toggles for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth that sit above the rest of the quick toggles. This makes it easy to access those two radios, and while they have large tiles, they&apos;re not as massive as the Pixel. </p><p>I like the change, and the best part is that a single pull-down still surfaces the six toggles — you only see the larger tiles with the shade fully down. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6dxkNeWDxpHhJG7U97zSSm" name="one-ui-6-1.jpg" alt="One UI 6 notification pane with six toggles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6dxkNeWDxpHhJG7U97zSSm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here&apos;s what Samsung has to say about it: </p><p>"One UI 6 makes a compelling first impression with its beautiful simplicity. Many elements have been tweaked to create a more modern look and feel, such as the impactful new default font and the new emojis on Samsung Keyboard. The Quick Panel has been revamped with an updated layout that makes it effortless for users to access their most used features."</p><p>"It is easier than ever to adjust screen visibility on the go as the brightness control bar is available by default in the compact Quick Panel. Furthermore, there is also a new instant access option to the full Quick Panel, providing faster access to settings with a single downward swipe at the upper right corner of the screen."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Wpwmqd9RdN6Ct9qGZBkEWo" name="one-ui-6-9.jpg" alt="Lock screen customization in One UI 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wpwmqd9RdN6Ct9qGZBkEWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another key change is the ability to customize the lock screen based on Modes and Routines, so you can set up different lock screens according to time and day. There&apos;s more customizability to the lock screen itself when it comes to styles and fonts. </p><p>One UI 6 also gets a new camera widget that lets you launch a particular mode with just a press of a button. So if you like to take portraits, just create a widget, put it on your home screen, and press that to launch the camera in that mode: </p><p>"One UI 6 is loaded with great new ways for users to customize the Galaxy experience based on their own habits and preferences, so it feels even more like an extension of themselves. For instance, it is now possible to set different lock screens according to specific Modes and Routines, such as a calming photo of a forest in Sleep Mode. There is also a new custom camera widget, which lets users preselect a camera mode and a storage location — like portrait mode and a folder just for headshots."</p>

<p>There&apos;s also a new system-wide font that looks cleaner than its predecessor. The settings page still looks the same, but the battery section has been moved into its own sub-menu. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FBuRTH4No6PxsquibzXwN" name="one-ui-6-11.jpg" alt="Media player card in One UI 6 notification pane" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FBuRTH4No6PxsquibzXwN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the subject of visual changes, there&apos;s a large media player card that sits in the notification shade, and like the Pixels, it has a squiggly seek bar along with large album art. </p><p>These are just some of the changes that are live in One UI 6 right now; Samsung is sure to add more features to the Android 14-based build over the coming weeks. </p>

<p>Predicting when your phone will get the One UI 6 update is down to a few factors, like the duration of the beta program. Traditionally, Samsung has offered beta builds for just over two months before rolling out the stable update, but with One UI 6, it&apos;s still too early to talk about the stable release.</p><p>What we know is that Samsung tends to roll out the stable update to its Galaxy S and Galaxy Z phones before the end of the year, so you won&apos;t have to wait too long to switch to the Android 14-based One UI 6 on your phone. I&apos;ll share further details once Samsung confirms plans for the One UI 6 stable build, but for now, if you&apos;ve got an eligible device, the best way to take a look at all the new features is by installing the One UI 6 beta.</p>

<p>The Galaxy A54 builds on the strengths of its predecessors, offering one of the best all-round packages in the mid-range category. With the phone set to be among the first to pick up the One UI 6 beta, now is as good a time as any to switch from an older Galaxy device.</p></p>

Its Accentum line focuses on more affordable and mid-range headphones aiming to deliver a similar audio experience without paying a premium for the best, represented by the Momentum line.</p><p>The Accentum Plus Wireless headphones are an update over the previous Accentum, with the "Plus" meaning a set of changes and upgrades. The two share a lot in common, so the differences won&apos;t be major, so are they worth the extra money you have to pay for them? Let&apos;s find out!</p>

<p>Sennheiser launched the Accentum Plus headphones in February 2024. They start at $230, putting them in mid-range territory among both its own and competitor headphones. They come in black and white.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-sennheiser-accentum-plus-wireless-what-s-good"><span>Sennheiser Accentum Plus Wireless: What's good</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rJiNiPpccfx8HRTRvEHckd" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Accentum-Plus-case.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Accentum Plus inside carrying case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rJiNiPpccfx8HRTRvEHckd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s worth pointing out that the Accentum Plus headphones are a little different from the Accentum, a pair Sennheiser launched only months prior to these. The key differences with the Plus are you get a 3.5mm jack for wired playback (though you can also do it through the USB-C port as well), touch-sensitive controls on both earcups, support for the aptX Adaptive Bluetooth codec, and you get a nice carrying case for easier transport and protection.</p><p>Otherwise, the two use many of the same internal components, including the 37mm drivers, so they will technically sound the same, except aptX Adaptive gives you hi-res audio from sources offering it, along with personalized sound you can&apos;t get with the regular pair. Other nuances also apply to separate the two, particularly through Sennheiser&apos;s Smart Control app, which I&apos;ll touch on further down.</p><p>A lack of physical buttons and little in the way of design treatments give the Accentum Plus a pretty bland appearance, but that&apos;s not surprising for Sennheiser. Even the company&apos;s flagship and high-end headphones lack unique styling, so if you&apos;re looking for something flashy, even the white variant may not cut it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.58%;"><img id="7kmEfrazZQJNbZi2dtmwrb" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Accentum-Plus-screenshots-2.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Accentum Plus screenshots from Smart Control app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7kmEfrazZQJNbZi2dtmwrb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1466" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Smart Control app offers a fair level of customization worth diving into to get the most out of the Accentum Plus. It&apos;s easy to choose any of the EQ presets or create your own, but I would argue that Sound Personalization takes it to another level. My one gripe with it is that Sennheiser forces you to open an account to access it (which also requires data access for some reason), but the company claims the sound profile you create can apply to all of its headphones and earbuds supporting the feature.</p><p>The process doesn&apos;t feel intricate but it manages to breathe life into the flatter default sound signature, and to my ears, it sounds a lot more like what I would expect from Sennheiser at this price. Don&apos;t expect these headphones to hit the resonance and clarity of the company&apos;s best, though they won&apos;t disappoint once you tinker with the tools available.</p><p>There&apos;s a balance here that only gets easier to appreciate the more you listen to your favorite tunes. Highs and mids don&apos;t feel constrained or over the top, while bass complements both nicely without muffling out the rest of the audio spectrum. Unlike its flagships, Sennheiser knows mid-range headphones like these compete with many others in a similar price range, so the bass response will be more noticeable here off the bat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.58%;"><img id="BqErTpXG3cHR9o3chZBweb" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Accentum-Plus-screenshots-1.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Accentum Plus screenshots from Smart Control app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BqErTpXG3cHR9o3chZBweb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1466" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Active noise cancelation (ANC) is either manual or dynamic, leaving the microphones to deal with background noise as it comes. Or you can just turn it on manually and leave it, as is. While it&apos;s okay, the ANC isn&apos;t going to feel stellar in every situation, where it may struggle to sufficiently dampen the heavy rumble of a subway train and screeching tracks, for instance. It&apos;s on par with what a mid-range pair of headphones should be, so you can rely on it to do its job well enough in most situations.</p><p>It helps that they&apos;re pretty comfortable to wear as well, fashioning a tight seal around the ear to keep all audio from seeping out. There&apos;s a sizeable cushion on the headband to help with longer listening periods; I didn&apos;t have to adjust them on my head all that often. Speaking of which, if you want to automate things a little more, you can use the Sound Zones feature to set up profiles that apply based on the ambient noise around you. This way, ANC shifts depending on how loud or quiet it is around you.</p><p>Touch controls on the right earcup are generally responsive, thanks in large part to the larger surface area. Swipe forward to skip a track, backward to go back one. Swipe up to raise the volume and down to lower it. Tap once to play/pause, or twice to enable/disable ANC. Look inside the right cup and you see a convenient wear sensor that automatically pauses playback when you remove the headphones and plays when you put them back on.</p>

<p>If you choose to listen to audio through a wired connection — be it USB-C or the 3.5mm Aux-in jack — you will get the same audio quality, for the most part. It&apos;s just that the other connections won&apos;t apply, including multipoint, which uses Bluetooth to stay connected to two devices simultaneously.</p><p>Battery life holds up well throughout, reaching the 50 hours Sennheiser claims on one charge. More impressively, I hit that number with a minor bump in volume while I listened to tunes and podcasts using Sound Personalization. A quick 10-minute charge in a pinch can deliver up to five hours of playback.</p>

<p>The Sennheiser Accentum Plus Wireless headphones sound good for their price, but there is a slightly elevated response at the high end of the spectrum that could introduce sibilance into certain tracks. You may notice it with some genres more than others, like how the pitches you normally hear in rock music have a sharper finish. Subjective as it may be, I suspect it will be noticeable in a majority of the EQ presets and Sound Personalization settings available.</p><p>If you&apos;re thinking of wearing them for a run or at the gym, I should warn you that the Accentum Plus headphones have no IP rating, so no official protection. That&apos;s not to say that they&apos;ll fall apart or die out with minimal water contact, but there&apos;s no telling how durable they might be with repeated exposure to rain or sweat.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> include a number of options, most of which will cost more than the Accentum Plus. Among them are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sennheiser-momentum-4-wireless">Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless</a> headphones, a sonic upgrade with better ANC — and the price to match. The regular Accentum headphones miss some of the features noted above, but also sell for considerably less if you&apos;re cool with what they don&apos;t have.</p><p>Outside of Sennheiser&apos;s own options, you could consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/skullcandy-crusher-anc-2-review">Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2</a>, especially if you want more bass and are okay with sound that isn&apos;t quite as clear as the Accentum Plus. Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/anker-soundcore-space-q45-review">Anker Soundcore Space Q45</a> headphones are much cheaper and offer real bang for the buck, including a deep supporting app with plenty of customization.</p><p>There aren&apos;t many headphones with IP ratings, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/treblab-z7-pro-review">Treblab Z7 Pro</a> headphones are good cheaper alternatives to the Sennheiser Accentum Plus Wireless in that aspect. You get IPX4 splashproofing, both wired and wireless playback, touch controls, and a surprisingly full-bodied sound. The fit is comfortable and you get 45 hours of playback.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want good, balanced sound</li>
  <li>You want extra customization and personalization</li>
  <li>You want a comfortable fit</li>
  <li>You like having a carrying case</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want something more rugged</li>
  <li>You want something bass-heavy</li>
  <li>You have a tighter budget</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The Accentum Plus Wireless are really the next best thing to getting the more premium Momentum 4 Wireless within Sennheiser&apos;s lineup. Mind you, you could get the regular Accentum and still get much of what&apos;s available here, even if you lose out on the case, wired playback, and better sound quality. The size and fit are otherwise exactly the same.</p><p>Either way, the Accentum Plus Wireless shine when you customize them in the Smart Control app, potentially pushing them further than you might otherwise expect.</p>

<p>When you&apos;re searching for a robust lifestyle smartwatch that&apos;s also equipped with solid fitness tracking and smart features, the Amazfit GTS 4 is the best Amazfit smartwatch you can buy. It&apos;s easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">best cheap smartwatches for Android</a>. It looks similar to the GTS 4 Mini but it comes in a larger case. It also cuts back on the bezel, so you get a larger display area. The rotating crown allows for smooth and easy UI navigation, too. As is the case with most smartwatches, the overall battery life will vary depending on usage, but you can expect eight days with typical use. The battery-saver mode allows you to stretch the battery life up to 16 days.</p><p>There are several key features that make this watch so desirable, including built-in dual-band GPS, heart-rate monitoring, blood oxygen tracking, stress monitoring, sleep tracking, and so on. There are also over 150 sports modes such as outdoor running, walking, outdoor cycling, treadmill, pool swimming, and elliptical. It also has both online and offline voice assistants with Alexa, which can be mighty convenient at times. Whether you&apos;re starting a workout or asking a general question, your watch will respond quickly and efficiently. Since the GTS 4 has a mic and speakers onboard, you get replies on the watch. This also means you can answer phone calls right from your wrist.</p><p>While NFC payments are quite popular on smartwatches these days, they&apos;re not available on the U.S. version of this watch. Another drawback is that other than Amazfit&apos;s native apps, there is no third-party app support. This means you can&apos;t access any of the cool Wear OS apps found on the Google Play Store. If you want something chunkier with a little more battery life, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-gtr-4-vs-gts-4">Amazfit GTR 4 might be better</a> for you.</p>

<p>When you want a solid set of smartwatch features but don&apos;t want to break the bank in the process, you may want to take a look at the Amazfit Bip 3. It offers the lovely rectangular design that many users have come to prefer. You get a 44mm polycarbonate case that&apos;s not too large or bulky, which weighs in at 33 grams. It has a 1.69-inch full-color TFT display, so it won&apos;t be as sharp as a watch with an AMOLED display. The Bip 3 is available in Black, Blue, and Pink.</p><p>The 14-day battery life is as long as some of the more expensive Amazfit watches on this list, which is impressive. When you compare that to competitors that last for a day or two, this is a great accomplishment. There are 60+ sports modes to choose from on the Amazfit Bip 3, including outdoor running, treadmill running, and outdoor cycling. You&apos;ll also find some rather unique sports modes such as yoga, cricket, table tennis, and basketball.</p><p>There are some disadvantages to the Amazfit Bip 3, including clunky notifications that are spaced out and hard to read at times. You also won&apos;t have music storage on the watch. When using the Alexa built-in feature, it relies on your phone&apos;s connection, which isn&apos;t always as seamless as it should be.</p>

<p>The Amazfit GTR 4 is a superb choice for users who don&apos;t want to sacrifice their love of fashion just because they&apos;re buying a smartwatch. You get a classic yet modern design that&apos;s perfect for daily wear, with a lightweight aluminum case and a bright 1.43-inch AMOLED display that&apos;s easy to navigate. It has a rotating crown on the side for easy navigation.</p><p>While there are some other Amazfit smartwatches with better battery life, the GTR 4 still does a good job. It claims up to 14 days, but with notifications enabled, always-on mode, and background health tracking, you&apos;ll likely come closer to eight days of juice, which isn&apos;t bad at all. It comes with a 5 ATM water resistance rating and excellent fitness tracking that includes over 150 sports modes. Some other features include heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, blood oxygen monitoring, and more.</p><p>To put it simply, if you&apos;re seeking a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatch</a> that&apos;s still very aesthetically pleasing, you&apos;ll likely be quite happy with the Amazfit GTR 4. Much like any other Amazfit smartwatch, you can&apos;t answer text messages as there&apos;s no on-screen keyboard. You can, however, answer calls since the GTR 4 has speakers and a microphone.</p>

<p>At almost 48mm in diameter, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-t-rex-ultra-review">Amazfit T-Rex Ultra</a> is not messing around. The polycarbonate watch body is available in two unique color options, including Desert Black and Sahara. The 1.3-inch AMOLED display has a touchscreen for easy navigation. There are also four side buttons that you can use to navigate that watch if that&apos;s your preferred method. The best thing about this design, especially for outdoor enthusiasts, is its military-grade durability. This is easily one of the toughest watches out there as it has passed 15 military-grade tests as opposed to 12 on the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazfit-t-rex-review">Amazfit T-Rex</a>.</p><p>No matter where you&apos;re headed or how long you plan to be there, this is also one of the best Amazfit smartwatches for long battery life. With typical use, you can expect this beast to last for up to 20 days. Those who will be heavily using their smartwatch can expect to average around 12 days. In continuous GPS mode, the battery life will last for 28 hours, and you can get as much as 80 hours from the endurance GPS mode. You also get an incredible water resistance rating. The Amazfit T-Rex Ultra can handle a depth of up to 100 meters, also known as 10 ATM water resistance.</p><p>Speaking of tracking, most users will be happy with the health and activity features of the Amazfit T-Rex Ultra. You&apos;ll have over 160 sports modes to choose from, including the basics such as outdoor cycling, treadmill running and trail running, and walking. You can also record more specific activities such as hiking, climbing, hunting, and more. During a workout, you&apos;ll also be able to track your route with the built-in advanced GPS. You&apos;ll have heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and blood oxygen monitoring.</p>

<p>For serious runners out there, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-cheetah-pro-review">Cheetah Pro</a> is well worth considering as the Amazfit watch that will best suit your needs. Firstly, the GPS features are beyond what most smartwatches can offer, with the GPS antenna able to pick up 100% of satellite signals, as opposed to the 50% that most watches can manage. As a result, the Cheetah Pro will let you track your route far more accurately than other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running smartwatches</a> on the market. Its slew of features including 24hr monitoring of various metrics and multiple triathlete modes make it well worth the price tag too, with over 100 apps to choose from and multiple face options, allowing you to tailor the watch to suit your needs. </p><p>There are arguably a little too many features here though, with hidden menus and an overwhelming amount of options that don&apos;t work quite as well as they should, which gives the sense that Amazfit could have benefitted from a little more streamlining here. While running though, the watch comes into its own, boasting an impressive 14-hour battery life and super lightweight design. The price tag is competitive too, with the amount of features justifying a purchase for serious runners. </p><p>The touchscreen is bright and impressive too, but is a little inconsistent during use. Overall though, the Cheetah Pro is very impressive, but is a little more niche than other offerings on this list. If you are into running though, this is definitely the watch for you.</p>

<p>If you need all the fitness tracking and smartwatch features you can get, you&apos;ll love the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-gtr-mini-review">Amazfit GTR Mini</a>. This new-and-improved model comes in a large 43mm case, which makes it one of the bigger watches in the Amazfit lineup. It comes in a sturdy stainless steel body combined with reinforced plastic, which keeps it light without the strap. The watch comes with a 20mm interchangeable silicone sports band that can handle all of your intense activities. You can use the touchscreen on the 1.28-inch AMOLED display to navigate your watch or you can use the side button if you prefer.</p><p>The Amazfit GTR Mini gives you seven days of battery with typical usage. You also have several different GPS modes to choose from depending on what type of activity you&apos;re doing and how long you need your battery to last. You&apos;ll have 5 ATM water resistance, heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and local music storage.</p><p>There&apos;s an unprecedented amount of sports modes on this watch — easily over 120. All of the basics are present, including walking, treadmill, trail running, cycling, and swimming. There are also more specific sports modes for serious athletes, like multisport, triathlon, football, rowing, tennis, climbing, and so on.</p><p>You&apos;ll also be able to measure your fitness level, recovery time, and training load. It&apos;s perfect for athletes who want to improve their performance. Some users might appreciate the generous size, but it may not be ideal for those with tiny wrists. Finally, the lack of speakers and a mic is a bummer on a wearable of this magnitude. The smartwatch also lacks third-party app support. You won&apos;t find an app store, but it does offer widget options, including a stopwatch, compass, alarm, and weather.</p>

<p>When you&apos;re entering the smartwatch world for the first time, you may not want to be overwhelmed by features that aren&apos;t beneficial to you. If you want a great starter watch, consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-gts-4-mini-review">Amazfit GTS 4 Mini</a>. It&apos;s not too expensive yet it&apos;s still loaded with features that will help you learn the ins and outs of owning a wearable. It offers an attractive design in a rectangular-shaped case that&apos;s made of aluminum. You also get a brilliant AMOLED display and touchscreen that&apos;s perfect for quick navigation.</p><p>Similar to the other options on this list, the battery life on the Amazfit GTS 4 Mini can vary depending on usage. It should last for up to a week with typical use. It weighs less than 20 grams, so it&apos;s one of the lightest wearables on the market. If you&apos;re a fitness enthusiast or you simply have a tiny wrist, this is one of the best Amazfit smartwatches you can buy. Speaking of which, you get great health and fitness features, including GPS, heart-rate monitoring, activity/sleep tracking, 120+ sport modes, and blood oxygen monitoring.</p><p>Considering the low price tag, you probably won&apos;t be too surprised to learn about some of the drawbacks. For starters, there&apos;s no support for third-party apps. This might not be a deal-breaker for beginners, but it&apos;s still worth noting. You can control your smartphone&apos;s music, but you won&apos;t have storage on the watch for songs. If you can live without these extras, you may have just met your smartwatch match.</p>

<p>Amazfit doesn&apos;t have many ultra-premium smartwatches, but the ones it does make are superb for fitness tracking. The Amazfit Falcon is one such watch and it gives you every imaginable health and fitness feature under the sun. We went <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-falcon-hands-on">hands-on with the Falcon</a> and were impressed with its high-grade titanium chassis and superb battery life.</p><p>The Amazfit Falcon has military-grade resistance to nature&apos;s elements, so you can partake in any sort of rigorous outdoor activity with ease. It uses Zepp OS 3.0 which comes with a ton of advanced features for working out, over 150 sports modes, and health monitoring such as blood oxygen levels and heart rate. The smartwatch has an AI coach built-in to help you achieve your fitness goals.</p><p>Although the Amazfit Falcon is incredibly expensive, it could be the right fit for a sports professional or military personnel. It has a touch screen but you can navigate the wearable using the two side buttons as well. Amazfit really went the extra mile with the Falcon, which is why it has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazfit.com/blogs/news/amazfit-creates-the-worlds-first-chatgpt-empowered-watch-face">world&apos;s first watch face coded by ChatGPT</a>. This doesn&apos;t make up for the lack of third-party apps, but it&apos;s nice to see an Amazfit smartwatch one-up the likes of the Galaxy Watch 5 and Pixel Watch. Samsung and Google&apos;s wearables have to rely on a roundabout way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-put-chatgpt-on-galaxy-watch-pixel-watch-wear-os">get ChatGPT on Wear OS</a>.</p>

<p>Amazfit has a smartwatch for just about everybody. Whether you&apos;re focused on fitness, fashion, or a bit of both, you can find a model that will have everything you need. However, if you&apos;re looking for the absolute best Amazfit smartwatch, we highly recommend the GTS 4. It has a sleek design, is packed with fitness tracking features, and you can&apos;t beat the battery life.</p><p>To recap, the Amazfit GTS 4 is equipped with over 150 sport modes, built-in GPS, sleep tracking, heart-rate monitoring, blood oxygen tracking, Amazon Alexa built-in, and a microphone and speaker so you can answer calls. It&apos;s not the type of watch that you&apos;ll have to charge every night, either. In fact, you&apos;ll likely only have to charge this watch every week or so depending on how heavily you use your device and its key features.</p><p>Regardless of what your preferences are, it&apos;s more than likely that you can find an Amazfit smartwatch to meet them. Whether you&apos;re a professional athlete looking to track your workouts and improve endurance, a runner training for the next big 5K, or a first-time user who&apos;s just getting started in the smartwatch world, there&apos;s bound to be a fitness-focused wearable from Amazfit that&apos;s perfect for you.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s decision to support the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 series</a> with seven years of full OS upgrades both drew praise and criticism. Some applauded Google for committing to the lengthy level of support that will hopefully keep Pixel phones running for longer. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">others were skeptical</a>, wondering what a Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro would even look like in 2030. </p><p>We finally have an answer, as Google&apos;s Vice President of Devices and Services, Seang Chau, spoke about the promise on the latest episode of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/made-by-google-podcast">Made by Google podcast</a>.</p><p>According to Chau, Google&apos;s shift to using custom Tensor processors in recent smartphones partially enabled it to offer better software support. It started with the initial increase from three to five years of support and now from five to seven. </p><p>"After we got a couple more years of Tensor under our belt, and we&apos;re really being able to figure out how to best do those updates," Chau said, "...we got a lot more comfortable saying we can go to that seven years and be able to deliver to our customers that extended time."</p><p>The choice to offer a seven-year promise was no accident, either. Google looked at how long the original Pixel remained in use and found that there were still a significant number of active users until roughly seven years after its initial release. This was the basis for Google&apos;s decision to go with seven years of support. "So if we think about, okay, we want to be able to support Pixel for as long as people are using the device, then seven years is about that right number," said Chau. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g9Bi4RbHqqdWBpSRdhqiWg" name="android-15-logo-devices.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g9Bi4RbHqqdWBpSRdhqiWg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The chipset is one of the most complex factors in supporting older devices with new software, according to Chau. However, other reasons Google thinks it can deliver this long of a promise are its continuous lab testing and beta testing thanks to Android&apos;s new Quarterly Platform Releases (QPRs). </p><p>"Now that we have these beta programs year-round, we have much more confidence that we&apos;ll have a reliable update for users on a quarterly basis because we have a lot of beta testers," Chau said. </p><p>Finally, Chau discussed how Google will determine which features are supported on legacy hardware. This has been a hot topic lately since the company originally withheld Gemini Nano from running on the Pixel 8 on-device. It later reversed course and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">plans to bring Gemini Nano to the Pixel 8</a> after further testing. </p><p>The uncertainty was related to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>&apos;s limited amount of RAM, which is why Chau says Pixel feature additions over the years will be rooted in software. Ideally, new features later on won&apos;t require new hardware to work. </p><p>Google&apos;s public comments about the Pixel&apos;s new seven-year update promise give us some insight into the reasoning behind it. However, only time will tell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-android-21-look-like-on-pixel-8">what these Pixel phones will look like in 2030</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Bluetooth is 24 years old and it&apos;s come a long way since the days of me carrying a phone, PDA, and MP3 player, wearing a mono single-unit earpiece with a boom that sat along my cheek. Its primary function was making phone calls with my phone (a novel concept today). Much of the progress consumers have experienced comes from manufacturers like Apple finding a good way to slingshot sound from one wireless earbud to another or Qualcomm splitting a stream in a way that allows more than one person to listen at a time. But the meat of it all comes from a group of people known as the Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group).</p>
<p>Those are the people who formally announced<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://vanilla.tools/new-le-audio-standard-bluetooth-will-enable-audio-sharing-and-more"> <u>Bluetooth LE Audio</u></a> at CES back in 2020. By 2022, the Bluetooth SIG finally completed the list of specifications, fully fleshing out its feature set. Those specs brought with them the potential to deliver some exciting advances to those who use Bluetooth earbuds and headphones. Part of that potential relied on equipment manufacturers&apos; cooperation of course. Today, in 2024, we’re still waiting for that potential to be fully realized. So, where exactly are we? What do we have today, and what&apos;s still to come? Let&apos;s dig into that!</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-low-energy"><span>Low Energy</span></h3>
<p>Bluetooth operates on two different radios. The Classic Bluetooth radio uses more power to do things like push higher bitrate streams and extend the range of connected devices while the Low-Energy radio has traditionally been used for slower connections in things like IoT devices.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Low Energy used to mean low-bandwidth. Bluetooth LE Audio changes that, in a meaningful way.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>LE Audio changes some of that. Improvements have been made that allow the Low-Energy radio to transmit better-sounding audio at longer distances so the battery in your headphones <em>and</em> the battery in your phone will last longer. There are reports on the web from users who have noted an increase in the battery life of their Bluetooth earbuds when connected to phones that support LE Audio. Remember, whenever we’re talking about Bluetooth technology and codec support, both the sending (your phone) and receiving device (your earbuds) must support the same codec for its features to work.</p>
<p>Despite reports on the web detailing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/1804kzf/looking_for_earbuds_that_support_lc3_le_audio/">how people are interacting with these technologies</a>, it’s still in its infancy in terms of adoption. The hope is that greater support will bring greater innovations in this space. The Bluetooth SIG says that this means brand new use cases for Bluetooth equipment can be created, so look out for some cool new ideas from companies that make speakers and headphones should LE Audio support become more ubiquitous.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-lc3-codec"><span>The LC3 codec</span></h3>
<p>An audio codec is a piece of equipment or software that can encode or decode (or both) a digital data stream. Bluetooth uses software algorithms that compress and decompress a digital <strong>audio</strong> data stream on the fly to turn a digital saved file into sound.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EpfjJk9LgLuqLtsYkoouyD" name="" alt="Bluetooth codec comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EpfjJk9LgLuqLtsYkoouyD.jpg" mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EpfjJk9LgLuqLtsYkoouyD.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Bluetooth SIG)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are plenty of Bluetooth audio codecs. The one most people are familiar with is aptX from Qualcomm, but Bluetooth itself has relied on the SBC (subband codec) to provide "reasonably good audio quality" at a medium bitrate with the bandwidth limitations of Bluetooth in mind. Vendors can use other codecs and audio profiles, but support for SBC is mandatory.</p>
<p>LE Audio comes with the new LC3 codec. It&apos;s a low-power and low-complexity (this means the algorithms used to encode and decode it aren&apos;t going to need a lot of processing power) codec that aims to provide high-quality audio even at low data rates. But two years after finalizing the spec, we still have yet to see the LC3 codec widely supported. Manfred Lutzky, head of audio communications at Fraunhofer IIS had this to say after initially testing it:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Extensive listening tests have shown that LC3 will provide improvements in audio quality over the SBC codec included with Classic Audio, even at a 50% lower bit rate. Developers will be able to leverage these power savings to create products that can provide longer battery life or, in cases where current battery life is enough, reduce the form factor by using a smaller battery.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Whether or not audio quality is better than SBC at lower bit rates may be up for debate, but the promise of longer battery life has stood up to scrutiny.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-multi-stream-audio"><span>Multi-Stream audio</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1851px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zrxdxuaRR72RXnRjtQEnpG" name="samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review-14-wide-color.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zrxdxuaRR72RXnRjtQEnpG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1851" height="1041" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">true wireless earbuds</a> are cheating. The audio for both ears is sent to one of them, then the channels are separated with the audio destined for the other earbud slung around your head. That&apos;s why even the best true wireless earbuds can get out of sync or stutter from time to time.</p>
<p>That&apos;s some great innovation from hardware manufacturers, but an even better way to do it would be to allow Bluetooth to operate with more than one data stream at a time, and that is exactly what Bluetooth LE Audio can do. It enables transmission of multiple and independent streams that can be synchronized at the source device (think your phone) and sent to one or more sink devices, like headphones or speakers or whatever.</p>
<p>This will also make things like taking a call or using a voice assistant better. Right now, if you&apos;re listening to music through your phone and get a call, the music mutes completely and the same thing happens when you press a button to call Google Assistant or Siri.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Imagine saying Hey Google where is the next gas station without missing the prompt to take the next turn from Maps.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Multi-Stream audio means that music can be quietly playing — or something important like navigation directions can, too — while you screen a call or ask Google where the next gas station is. This is another area where hardware makers can find new ways to make use of Bluetooth LE Audio.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-auracast-standard"><span>The Auracast standard</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mweFGVKnsdobmxdQd3nT9C" name="Bluetooth-Auracast-hero.jpg" alt="Bluetooth Auracast audio sharing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mweFGVKnsdobmxdQd3nT9C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bluetooth SIG)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What was once known as Audio Sharing, Auracast enables transmission of multiple and independent streams that can be sent out from a source device like one of Samsung’s Neo QLED TVs, then sent to multiple “sink devices,” like their Galaxy Buds2 Pro earbuds. Or exchange that TV for a smartphone, use it as a source, and broadcast audio to a room full of people wearing earbuds or headphones that support Auracast.</p><p>Created with public broadcast in mind, Auracast can do some exciting things beyond just sending audio to multiple sources in your home. An example would be a big screen at the airport playing the news and one or more Bluetooth broadcast channels in multiple languages that everyone can connect to in order to hear it. Or Bluetooth at the movies or a drive-in, which could offer a truly premium audio experience for the blockbuster you&apos;re seeing on the screen. My favorite, is broadcast audio at a museum so that you can easily connect and take a self-guided docent tour.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-hearing-aids"><span>Hearing aids</span></h3>
<p>Bluetooth LE Audio can do a lot of things. And it now can do them on an all-new category of device — a hearing aid.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>A codec is what's used to turn a file of data into sound and now your hearing aid can use one, too.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Imagine all the benefits of Bluetooth LE Audio with Auracast and none of them interfering with the primary use of a hearing aid, which is being able to hear the world around you through sound amplification. You could listen to that big screen at the airport or take a phone call and <strong>still</strong> hear the person sitting next to you or a car horn or anything else that&apos;s happening without feeling isolated.</p>
<p>Seeing any new technology that provides safety, entertainment and productivity for people with special needs is wonderful. While this probably won&apos;t be the thing everyone talks about when discussing Bluetooth LE Audio, it may well be the most important thing.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-availability"><span>Availability</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="fHPk6BnKGtcrRpetTmYDGR" name="sony linkbuds s.jpg" alt="Sony LinkBuds S support Bluetooth LE Audio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fHPk6BnKGtcrRpetTmYDGR.jpg" mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yNvYqZGN73y4yxuT26D4rd.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By now you&apos;re probably wondering two things: what products is this in that are actually for sale now, and will my old Bluetooth gear work with my new?</p>
<p>As of March 2024, the list of devices compatible with Bluetooth LE audio isn’t very long. Based on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/experience-immersive-intelligent-sound-with-galaxy-buds-series-latest-updates">press release</a>, Samsung’s phones like the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Galaxy Z Fold 5, Galaxy S23, Galaxy A54, as well as select older devices will get LE Audio with Auracast broadcast support in One UI 6.1. The Galaxy S24 already supports the standard. Sony’s Xperia 5V supports LE, as well as Google’s Pixel 7, and Pixel 8 series. ASUS Zenfone 10 has been confirmed, but you’ll need a pair of earbuds that also support it to get the full benefit and the choices aren’t many when you look at the multitude of Blueooth-enabled earbuds and headphones on the market.</p><p>You won’t get it with Apple’s earbuds, and some Sony products like the WH-1000XM5 rely on their own LDAC codec instead. But it is out there! Among those confirmed at this time would be the OnePlus Buds Pro 2, Sony’s INZONE gaming buds, WF-1000XM5, and Linkbuds S, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds2 Pro, and the Earfun Air Pro 3.</p>
<p>And yes, your existing stuff will still work even if you buy something with these new capabilities. If you get new headphones with Bluetooth LE Audio, they will work with your current phone and vice versa. This is because the Bluetooth SIG <em>does</em> force manufacturers to provide interoperability with legacy equipment in order to be certified. Flex those muscles, SIG.</p>
<p>We&apos;re excited about Bluetooth LE Audio and all that LC3 and Auracast can offer, but with people holding onto phones for years, and manufacturers having to adopt the technologies it could still be a few years until we see if these advancements will have as profound an impact on personal wireless audio devices as we’d like to see.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-19-1pm-et-quick-share-becomes-a-true-airdrop-alternative-with-support-for-all-android-and-chrome-os-devices">Quick Share</a> was previously a Samsung-exclusive feature.
