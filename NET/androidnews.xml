<p>If you love Pixel phones, you might have your eye on the new Google Pixel 9. While it might not be worth an upgrade if you just bought the Google Pixel 8, even the 7, it’s a solid upgrade model for something older from either Google or another Android brand. With a gorgeous screen, fast and wireless charging, plenty of RAM, and seven years of support, you can’t go wrong.</p></p>

<p>If you were already impressed with the Google Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, you’ll be even more pleased with the company’s newest variations of each. When comparing the Google Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 9 Pro, the differences are much like they are with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-vs-google-pixel-8-pro">Pixel 8 vs. Pixel 8 Pro</a>. However, both phones also feature stunning upgrades from previous generations of models.</p><p>We’re here to help you choose a device from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> to upgrade to if you’re looking to trade in your old Pixel for a new one or perhaps make the switch to these branded devices for the first time.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Q7GuZrc2wXEKQJNz4D6HxV" name="google-pixel-9-rose-display-01.jpg" alt="The bright vibrant display of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL next to a bouquet of flowers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q7GuZrc2wXEKQJNz4D6HxV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro look relatively similar. But there are some details worth noting about how they differ in basic specs. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9, which comes in Obsidian, Porcelain, Wintergreen, or Peony, has a 6.3-inch Actua OLED display that boasts a 1,080 x 2,424 resolution at 422 ppi. The refresh rate is from 60-120Hz, adjustable based on the application, and the screen is covered with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a>. Get up to 1,800 nits brightness in HDR and 2,700 nits peak brightness. </p><p>The glass screen is complemented by a polished back with a satin metal finish frame that is IP68 water and dust-resistant. The screen also has a fingerprint-resistant coating. The phone comes with 128GB or 256GB storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6988px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NXEiLRpjZ3uQCusqLLfGPD" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-official-photo-4.jpg" alt="An official press photo of people making a selfie with the Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NXEiLRpjZ3uQCusqLLfGPD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6988" height="3931" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Available in Obsidian, Porcelain, Hazel, or Rose Quartz, the Pixel 9 Pro is made with the same scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover glass with a polished metal frame, but it has a silky matte back. It, too, meets an IP68 rating, has a fingerprint-resistant coating, and a 6.3-inch display. However, the screen is much higher in resolution than a Super Actua LTPO OLED screen with a 1,280 x 2,856 pixel resolution at 495 ppi. </p><p>You can adjust the frame rate from 1 all the way up to 120Hz with the Google Pixel 9 Pro, which can presumably lead to a smoother experience as well as improved battery life. Get up to an impressive 2,000 nits brightness in HDR or a whopping 3,000 nits peak brightness. </p><p>Both phones are identical in dimensions and weight, and both have a 4,700mAh battery that affords the same 24+ hour battery life that can be extended to up to 100 hours using the Extreme Battery Saver mode. Both also support fast charging, so you can get back up to more than half charge in just 30 minutes. This is when using the Google 45W USB-C charger, it should be noted, which is sold separately in both cases. Both are also Qi-certified, so you can use them with wireless chargers. Both include Battery Share for using the phone to charge other compatible devices, like Google Pixel Buds. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro both include features like fingerprint unlock, face unlock, and pattern PIN and password. Both also have stereo speakers, three microphones, noise suppression, and Spatial audio support. With both phones, you get seven years of OS and security updates as well as frequent Pixel Drop updates, so you can confidently hold onto either of these phones for many years to come. </p><p>Bottom line: the main difference when it comes to look and feel is that the Google Pixel 9 Pro has a silky matte back versus the satin finish and a much higher resolution, brighter, and smoother screen.</p>

<p>Before diving further into the features and functions of these phones and how they compare, let’s look side-by-side at the specs.</p>

<p>There are some notable differences here that could sway you in the direction of the Google Pixel 9 Pro or confirm that you will find the Pixel 9 sufficient.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro-features-functions-and-performance-2">Google Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 9 Pro: Features, functions, and performance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="no7QVAxMzTCCHcyZQH6SSd" name="google-pixel-9-pixel-studio-02.jpg" alt="Generating art using the Pixel Studio app on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/no7QVAxMzTCCHcyZQH6SSd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let’s get down to what makes these two phones different when it comes to performance. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9 devices launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, are powered by the Google Tensor G4 processor, and come equipped with 12GB RAM. Also, with Android 14, the Google Pixel 9 Pro boasts a much more powerful 16GB RAM. </p><p>With both phones, you also get Google VPN along with end-to-end security designed by Google. This includes multi-layer hardware security, tensor security core, Titan M2 security co-processor, anti-malware and anti-phishing protection, and spam protection for phone calls and messages. </p><p>Both offer safety features, including satellite SOS, emergency SOS, crisis alerts, car crash detection, safety checks, and more. There’s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, Bluetooth 5.3 with dual antennas for enhanced quality and connection, NFC, Google Cast, and built-in GPS. One difference between them is that, along with all the other sensors they include, the Google Pixel 9 Pro adds a temperature sensor. It also adds an ultra-wideband chip for accurate ranging and spatial orientation. </p><p>So, both these phones offer comparable specs when it comes to performance. The main differences you’ll find relate to the screen refresh rate and display itself, as noted above, along with the fact that the Google Pixel 9 Pro has more RAM. If you’re a serious mobile gamer, then you might want to opt for the step-up phone. Otherwise, both offer specs comparable to those of the performance department.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro-how-good-are-the-cameras-2">Google Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 9 Pro: How good are the cameras?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Lpe8pzAR77rLv3XNeojouJ" name="google-pixel-9-camera-add-me-feature-hero.jpg" alt="Using the new Add Me feature on a Google Pixel 9 to add someone to an existing photo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lpe8pzAR77rLv3XNeojouJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cameras are somewhat different between these two phones, with the Google Pixel 9 Pro being an expected step up in this department. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9 has a 50MP wide camera with up to 8x Super Res Zoom alongside a 48MP Quad PD ultra-wide camera lens with Macro Focus. Its front camera is just 10.5MP, but it has autofocus and a 95-degree ultra-wide field-of-view. It offers all the usual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> editing features, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>, Magic Eraser, Best Take, Photo Unblur, and Portrait Light. </p><p>The rear camera of the Google Pixel 9 can take 4K videos with a digital video zoom of up to 7x, while you can also take 4K videos from the front camera. Enjoy features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a>, cinematic blur, slo-mo, and more. There’s stereo recording, speech enhancement, wind noise reduction, and audio zoom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="9nn9cCSwAJSpyTVUqMnFnR" name="google-pixel-9-pro-official-lifestyle-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro official lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9nn9cCSwAJSpyTVUqMnFnR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro has a much more sophisticated camera system. The main camera is also 50MP wide, but it allows Super Res Zoom to be up to 30x, thanks to the addition of a third lens. This is complemented by a 48MP Quad PD ultra-wide camera with Macro Focus along with another 48MP Quad PD telephoto camera. While the Google Pixel 9 has a single-zone LDAF (laser detection autofocus) sensor, the Pixel 9 Pro’s is multi-zone. </p><p>The front camera on the Google Pixel 9 Pro is a 42MP dual PD selfie camera with autofocus and a larger 103-degree ultra-wide field-of-view. Along with the usual camera features you’ll find in the Google Pixel 9, the Google Pixel 9 Pro adds a few more. This includes the option to take high-res photos up to 50MP and use Zoom Enhance. </p><p>For video recording, the Google Pixel 9 Pro can capture videos at up to 8K resolution, powered by Video Boost, and with Super Res Zoom up to 20x. Along with the Audio Magic Eraser, you also get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">Video Boost</a>, as noted, as well as Night Sight Video and Super Res Zoom Video. </p><p>For content creators, the Google Pixel 9 Pro is clearly the better option. This is especially so if you tend to shoot selfie photos and videos, like livestreaming, and if you take snapshots from farther away, like at sporting events, concerts, or scenic shots. We won’t know for sure how these cameras compare and perform, however, until we get our hands on the phones to test them out. Stay tuned for our reviews.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DVEdsb9wpdwVpsKE3f8dnB" name="google-pixel-9-pixel-screenshots-01.jpg" alt="Using the Pixel Screenshots app on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DVEdsb9wpdwVpsKE3f8dnB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are slight differences when looking at the Google Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 9 Pro that might suggest you’ll want to get the better of the two. The main one is the improved cameras, especially the front camera, on the Pixel 9 Pro compared to the Pixel 9. If you shoot a lot of content, you might prefer the Google Pixel 9 Pro, which has advanced features, particularly when it comes to zoom shots. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro also has a brighter and potentially more responsive screen along with more RAM to afford a smoother experience during intensive tasks like gaming. The additional storage options are a bonus as well, especially since neither phone offers expandable storage via memory card slot. </p><p>But the Google Pixel 9 might be sufficient for most. The 12GB RAM is nothing to scoff at, and while the refresh rate goes from 60Hz to 120Hz versus all the way down to 1Hz, you might not notice this if you’re constantly multitasking on your phone and need that high refresh rate most of the time anyway. Just keep in mind that the battery could potentially drain faster on the Google Pixel 9 because of this. </p><p>With seven years of updates along with Feature Drops for both phones, you can be confident with either one. If you feel you want more, including a bigger device, opt for the also new Google Pixel 9 Pro XL instead.

Due to its larger size, the 45mm Pixel Watch 3 can&apos;t use them. Don&apos;t worry, there are loads of excellent screen guards available for both sizes of the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>Screen protectors are mainly made of tempered glass or plastic. You should pick the material of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> screen protector based on your use case. If you&apos;re clumsy and tend to bump into everything around you, it&apos;s a good idea to stick with glass screen protectors. I myself prefer glass because I could trip on air. But if you&apos;re a stable person with a good sense of spatial awareness, a plastic screen guard for your Pixel Watch 3 is okay too.</p>

<p>All of the best Pixel Watch and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-2-screen-protectors">Pixel Watch 2 screen protectors</a> can fit your next-gen Pixel Watch 3, but only if you get the 41mm case size. Sadly, the variety of accessories for the larger 45mm Pixel Watch 3 isn&apos;t as wide as compared to the regular old 41mm size. You can&apos;t even use older Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 bands on the 45mm variant, which is such a shame.</p><p>So, if you&apos;re rocking the 45mm Google wearable, you&apos;ll have fewer choices to pick from when getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-bands">Pixel Watch 3 bands</a> and screen guards. That being said, the situation with screen protectors for the watch is a lot better than watch bands, because a lot more of them are available for both 41mm and 45mm sizes.</p><p>The EGV 6 Pack for the Google Pixel Watch 3 is filth cheap and it gives you six, very high-quality TPU films to protect your wearable. These screen guards are made of durable TPU, so they are scratch-proof, capable of self-healing, and ultra-thin. The thinness ensures high touch response, even with the screen protector on your Pixel Watch 3.</p>

<p>The lovely Google Pixel Watch Active Band now comes in two sizes to accommodate the Pixel Watch 3, 41mm and 45mm. You can get this comfy fluoroelastomer band for any occasion. It's waterproof and very resilient. I wear it on a daily basis and it doesn't get itchy, sweaty, or cause fatigue.</p></p>

<h2 id="depending-on-the-pixel-watch-3-size-you-bought-your-choice-of-bands-varies-2">Depending on the Pixel Watch 3 size you bought, your choice of bands varies</h2>
<p>How I wish Google had figured out a way to use the same bands on both the 41mm and the 45mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-color-google-pixel-watch-3-should-you-buy">variants of the Pixel Watch 3</a>. They couldn&apos;t make this happen so now, anyone with the larger 45mm smartwatch is stuck with far fewer options when it comes to the best Google Pixel Watch 3 bands.</p><p>I highly recommend the Google Pixel Watch Active Band as the best overall band. And although you get this band in the box, I still suggest getting one more color to round things off. The Active Band comes in a couple of colors, but not all of them are available on the 45mm wristbands. Still, this is the most comfortable Pixel Watch 3 band hands down. You feel no fatigue or irritation even after wearing the band all day long and fleuroelastomer plays nice with sensitive skin. Also, the band&apos;s waterproof and it doesn&apos;t get dirty easily.</p><p>Style and pizzazz can be found in the Caseology Pixel Watch 3 lineup of wristbands. Both the Caseology Athlex Band and Caseology Nano Pop look sporty, are waterproof, and have an ergonomic wear experience. Swapping your existing strap with Caseology&apos;s bands is easy thanks to the spring action pin connector. And the best part is, if you&apos;re a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> owner, you can grab a matching phone case to compliment your Pixel Watch 3 band.</p><p>Want even more choices?

<hr>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly "considering" if it should break up Google following the illegal search monopoly ruling. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-13/doj-considers-seeking-google-goog-breakup-after-major-antitrust-win?leadSource=uverify%20wall&embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> report, the DOJ reportedly looks at two potential divestments.</p><p>According to those close to the subject, if the DOJ continues this idea, it will push Google to divest its Android operating system. Such a move was formed due to Judge Amit P. Mehta&apos;s findings during the initial ruling. It was discovered that Google requires smartphone and other device makers to "sign an agreement" before receiving access to Gmail and the Play Store.</p><p>The other side of the divestment includes Google Chrome, which sources claim is included in the agreement OEMs must sign.</p><p>Instead of divesting, the DOJ may offer a more lenient option, such as pushing Google to share its search data with the competition. Such competitors include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-bing-edge-openai-chatgpt">Microsoft (Bing)</a>, DuckDuckGo, and more. The publication states that Google&apos;s stronghold over search provides it with "16 times" more data than the competition — while also gatekeeping that data to pad its lead over them.</p><p>Nothing is set in stone regarding the DOJ&apos;s potential shift to break up Google&apos;s hold in several areas.</p><p>However, it seems that Judge Mehta will have to accept any desired plans from the U.S. government before forcing Google to comply. As Bloomberg notes, the decision to break apart Google would cement itself as the largest move involving antitrust since AT&T and the infamous "Baby Bells" in 1984.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google for any information about the current DOJ report. The company declined to comment on the ongoing process following the ruling.</p>

<p>Earlier in August, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">a landmark ruling</a> was brought down upon Google by Judge Amit P. Mehta who found that the company acted "illegally" to maintain a monopoly in search. Mehta stated Google enacted "shrewd business decisions" to obtain and retain the top spot on search over the competition. The 298-page ruling detailed Google&apos;s exchange with companies such as Apple to ensure it debuts as the default search engine on their devices.</p><p>It was found that Google made up 95% of the search market share in 2020, leaving Microsoft&apos;s Bing to make up the remaining 5%.</p><p>Google has had a long history with the U.S. Department of Justice. In 2020, the DOJ launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/us-government-set-file-antitrust-suit-against-google-today">an antitrust investigation</a> into the company due to its go-to status for search. Elsewhere, the idea of Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-will-reportedly-pay-15-billion-dominate-search-apple-devices">seemingly paying Apple</a> a substantial amount of money to become its default search engine was a topic discussed in 2021.</p><p>It was rumored that Google might&apos;ve offered $15 million to Apple to become the default service its users see.</p>

<ul><li>Google started rolling out its final patch for the Android 15 beta to enrolled Pixel testers.</li><li>The update is minor, only packing smaller fixes for issues that have appeared throughout this final stretch.</li><li>Google then announced that Android 15 QPR1 testing will begin "soon," potentially signaling a September launch of the next OS.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Development of Google&apos;s next major software version progresses as the company pushes another minor update for enrolled testers.</p><p>Google posted about its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1eri0u4/android_15_beta_42_now_available/">final Android 15 Beta 4.2 patch</a> on Reddit, which seems to hone in on several issues plaguing the software (and Pixels). The update should become available for enrolled testers soon. Devices ranging from the Pixel 6 to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8</a> series, including the Pixel Fold and Tablet, are eligible for this patch.</p><p>Beta 4.2 isn&apos;t a substantial patch; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes#beta-4.2">its changelog states</a> that Google added a fix for a low frame rate issue caused by the camera. There was also a reported color saturation problem with the Pixel camera, which is also being rectified in the latest beta.</p><p>The remainder of the 4.2 patch is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed an issue where some devices were delayed in waking up.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a gray transparent bar was appearing when using the camera.</li><li>Fixed a camera issue that was causing a crash when changing zoom values.</li><li>Fixed an issue that was causing the UI to flicker.</li><li>Fixed an issue that was causing the YouTube app to crash.</li></ul>

<p>Enrolled users should continue to check to see if their device has picked up the update throughout the day. This can be done by hopping into <strong>Settings > System > System Updates</strong>.</p><p>Google also announced it will soon begin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1erml83/android_15_qpr1_beta_around_the_corner/">testing Android 15 QPR1</a> for interested Pixel owners. The company stated that this cycle will cover the December feature drop for Android 15 and that QPR1 builds upon the "bug fixes and improvements" from the beta. Pixel owners who are involved in Android 15&apos;s original beta testing <em>do not </em>need to leave the program to receive QPR1 testing access.</p><p>Those wishing to receive the stable version of Android 15 will need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta#devices">opt out of the program</a>. The company offered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1erml83/android_15_qpr1_beta_around_the_corner/">additional instructions</a> on how to leave the program <em>without </em>wiping all of your data.</p><p>With the final Android 15 beta update here and the impending QPR1 testing afoot, users speculate September will hold the final product.</p><p>Throughout its testing, it&apos;s become evident that Google is plugging several features alongside better optimization into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. We&apos;re not staring at any major UI/design changes, but the smaller refinements should make for an overall better OS. Hopefully, with the update seemingly poised for September, perhaps <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-it-mean-if-both-google-and-samsungs-android-15-updates-are-delayed">the delays will be worth the wait</a>.</p>

<p>The Pixel Watch 3 comes in two sizes, and the smaller 41mm option is pretty darn similar to the Pixel Watch 2. You get a much better display and a few minor hardware upgrades for connectivity, but most of its coolest new tricks will also come to the Pixel Watch 2 with Wear OS 5. We're most excited to have a 1.4-inch display option, finally.</p></p>

<p>If you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> vs. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> solely by their specs, you&apos;d assume that Google didn&apos;t make that many changes to its latest Android watch. It&apos;s fair to say that many of its coolest new features will also hit the Watch 2 soon, once it receives the latest Wear OS 5 update.</p><p>Even though Google gave the Pixel Watch 3 and 2 the same processor, sensors, battery, and other key hardware, it did make a few key changes to modernize the watch compared to the competition, primarily the revamped display with its second size option.</p><p>Below, we&apos;ll break down how the Pixel Watch 3 vs. 2 specs compare and whether Google did enough for you to upgrade.</p>

<p>When you look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-vs-pixel-watch" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 2 vs. 1, Google made plenty of changes</a>, but if you compare the Watch 3 vs. 2, you&apos;ll find more similarities than differences. Keep reading for a long laundry list of everything Google left unchanged between the Google Pixel Watch 3 and Watch 2.</p><p><strong>Processor: </strong>The Pixel Watch 3 retains the same Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 chip as the Pixel Watch 2, along with other Android watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, and Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro. Even though the chip is two years old, it&apos;s still on the cutting edge for performance.</p><p>Specifically, both watches use four Arm Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz, plus a Cortex M33 MCU for background processes and 2GB of RAM. For context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> has a new Exynos chip with one Arm Cortex-A78 core (1.6GHz), four Cortex-A55 cores (1.5GHz), and the same memory. </p><p>In other words, it&apos;s fair to say that the Pixel Watch 3 still matches the competition for performance, even if its chip is a repeat.</p><p><strong>Storage:</strong> Both watches give you 32GB of storage, offering plenty of space to download playlists and podcasts for phone-less streaming. Only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch Series 9</a> gives you more at 64GB, which doesn&apos;t help Android users.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wuxvFoRxyHiW2Aa9a86Jz6" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-sensors-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wuxvFoRxyHiW2Aa9a86Jz6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Sensors:</strong> The Pixel Watch 3 and 2 both borrowed their sensors from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a>, tracking your heart rate, resting HR, HR variability, blood oxygen, skin conductance for body response (cEDA), AFib detection (ECG), skin temperature, sleep duration and zones, and daily readiness.</p><p>Despite Google&apos;s new focus on running, the Pixel Watch 3 only offers standard GPS tracking (like the Watch 2), unlike the dual-band GPS you get on the Galaxy Watch 7.</p><p><strong>Protection:</strong> Either watch gives you an IP68 rating with 5ATM water protection. This means they&apos;re fully dust and water-resistant but shouldn&apos;t be submerged in shallow water for longer than 30 minutes or at a 50-meter depth for longer than 10 minutes.</p><p>Google gave the Pixel Watch 3 the same Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protective layer as its predecessor. Most smartwatches in this price range now use Sapphire Crystal, which is more scratch resistant, so you might reasonably find this disappointing.</p>

<p><strong>41mm design:</strong> Ignoring the new 45mm Pixel Watch 3 for a moment, the standard 41mm Watch 3 has the same diameter, thickness, and weight as the Pixel Watch 2. It has the same recycled aluminum materials and the same battery capacity. If it weren&apos;t for the display changes, you&apos;d have trouble telling them apart. </p><p>They use the same band connector, too, so your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-2-bands">Pixel Watch 2 bands</a> carry over to the Watch 3 — though <em>not</em> the Watch 3 45mm. They even share the same case colors (Matte Black, Polished Silver, or Champagne Gold) and the same band colors, except that the Watch 3 has a Rose Quartz band instead of Bay Active.</p><p><strong>Battery life: </strong>Once again, Google rates the Pixel Watch 3 as having a 24-hour battery life with AOD active, regardless of which size you choose. Even though the Watch 3 45mm has an extra 114mAh capacity, much of it goes directly into powering the extra display. </p><p>I&apos;ve heard some conflicting reports from Google staffers saying the 45mm Watch 3 might last longer than the 41mm Watch 3 and Watch 2, but I can&apos;t confirm that, so you shouldn&apos;t assume anything until we can test this for ourselves.</p><p><strong>Software: </strong>Although the Pixel Watch 2 uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a> at the moment, it should update to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> soon after the Pixel Watch 3 launches on September 10. So even though the Watch 3 is introducing some really cool features like live Nest Doorbell view and Fitbit Cardio Load, Watch 2 owners will receive them as well. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="to9FczSGrrjWUQjNfCZHAm" name="google-pixel-watch-3-metal-link-band-close-up-1.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 with Metal Link Band Close-up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/to9FczSGrrjWUQjNfCZHAm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Why upgrade to the Pixel Watch 3 if so many things remain unchanged from the last generation? It&apos;s a fair question, but the Pixel Watch 3 vs. Watch 2 differences below could tempt you to switch.</p><p><strong>A new 1.4-inch option:</strong> Google finally took after Samsung, Apple, Garmin, and several other watchmakers by offering two size options for its mainline watch. </p><p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3 hands-on</a> tester Andrew Myrick, who also reviewed the Pixel Watch 2, praised the new variant, saying "any size concerns" he had with the "dainty" 41mm watch were "put to rest" by the 45mm option.</p><p>Wear OS 5 uses a flexible UI that adds more details and menu options for larger watch displays. In Andrew&apos;s test, he noted that the Watch 3 45mm had room for an extra four complications on the default watch face; similarly, when looking at the Fitbit app&apos;s Quick Start menu, he could see six sport icons on the 45mm Watch 3 compared to three on the 41mm Watch 3.</p><p>Best of all, this 45mm Watch 3 only weighs six grams more than the Watch 2 and measures the same 12.3mm in thickness, making it comfortably light combined with the default Active band. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AM58k4uyAjAsNjDAzKe5tG" name="google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-45mm-with-pixel-buds-pro-2-4.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AM58k4uyAjAsNjDAzKe5tG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Revamped display: </strong>Google shrunk the Pixel Watch 2 display border by 16% for the Pixel Watch 3. Even though the screen space is the same as before, the glass rounds off the edge more quickly, so it doesn&apos;t feel as wasteful as before.</p><p>You also boost the display brightness from 1,000 to 2,000 nits, matching the Galaxy Watch 7 and Apple Watch Series 9. That earns it the name "Actua display," Google&apos;s term for displays bright enough to handle direct sunlight; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> also has an Actua display, though it hits an impressive 2,700 nits.</p><p>Another key Watch 3 display boost is to its refresh rate. The Pixel Watch 2 maxed out at 30Hz, making screen transitions more noticeable, while the Pixel Watch 3 has an LTPO display that hits a smoother 60Hz but can dip as low as 1Hz when you&apos;re using the always-on display.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SUYun2bhF7fsxK5qmDnV5i" name="google-pixel-watch-3-google-tv-controls.jpg" alt="Google TV controls on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SUYun2bhF7fsxK5qmDnV5i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Connectivity: </strong>Both watches have Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC contactless payments, GPS satellite tracking, and an optional LTE upgrade. Yet Google upgraded the Bluetooth standard from 5.0 to 5.3 this generation; while the data speeds and connection range don&apos;t change between these two, 5.3 consumes less power, both when sending data and when idling, and the connection itself is less susceptible to signal interference.</p><p>Google also gave the Pixel Watch 3 support for 5GHz Wi-Fi, which can typically deliver twice-as-fast download speeds as 2.4GHz. You&apos;ll be able to add new apps or sync your data much quicker than before.</p><p>One brand-new connectivity tool is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-uwb-galaxy-s21-series-and-which-models-support-it">Ultra Wideband (UWB)</a>. Phones and watches typically use UWB for finding lost devices nearby, or as a unique signature for unlocking things, such as car doors. In this case, Google promises that the Pixel Watch 3 will use UWB to auto-unlock your Pixel phone if it&apos;s nearby; we could also see further uses for it down the line.</p><p>Lastly, we&apos;ll point out that Google is charging $100 to add 4G LTE instead of $50 for the Pixel Watch 2. That might sound like a rip-off, but it appears Google is bundling two free years of LTE data with the watch; adding a watch to your carrier plan can often cost more than that in a year, let alone two, so it could make the Pixel Watch 3 LTE one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatch-lte">best LTE watches</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tM6xHPacLDCn8XUGC8wfz4" name="pixel-watch-2-final-review-2.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 charging animation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tM6xHPacLDCn8XUGC8wfz4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Faster charging speeds:</strong> Here are the charging speeds for the Pixel Watch 2, Pixel Watch 3 41mm, and Pixel Watch 3 45mm:</p>

<p>As you can see, charging is relatively fast for all three watches up to 50% before slowing down to preserve battery life. The smaller Pixel Watch 3 is relatively speedy compared to the Pixel Watch 2, while the Pixel Watch 3 45mm takes a little longer than before because of its larger capacity. That, combined with the 24-hour battery life, means finding a convenient time to charge it could be tricky.</p><p><strong>Better HR accuracy for workouts:</strong> Google claims that the Pixel Watch 3 has the "most accurate heart rate for running" compared to the Pixel Watch 2 and 1. Why? Apparently these watches had issues with "light artifacts" that made it hard to catch rapid changes in heart rate during hard workouts, but Google "made significant improvements with generation tuning exactly for these challenging conditions."</p><p>Essentially, it&apos;s the same claim Samsung made with the Galaxy Watch 7 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, promising better heart rate data for hard runs. Samsung did <em>pretty</em> well in our fitness tests, but we&apos;re excited to test if Google does any better in our upcoming review.</p><p><strong>An extra year (?) of support:</strong> Google promised the Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 would receive three years of security updates. We don&apos;t know yet whether that applies to the Pixel Watch 3, but it&apos;s not likely to get <em>fewer</em> updates than the Watch 2, so it should receive support through 2027 at least, while the Watch 2 will lose its support in 2026. We&apos;ll update this post when we have confirmation of this.</p>

<p>If you love the Pixel Watch 2 but wish it had a larger display, the Pixel Watch 3 will be a perfect option for you. It provides that extra space, naturally adjusting the interface so you see more information at once, and makes it much easier to read outdoors thanks to the extra nits.</p><p>Otherwise, the upgrades to the Bluetooth, wi-fi, and heart rate accuracy are fairly niche; the faster charging speed and enhanced display specs are great, but you might not be willing to pay another $349, unless you get some good trade-in credit for your Pixel Watch 2. </p><p>If you order from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_watch_3">Google Store</a>, they&apos;re offering a $220 mail-in rebate for your Pixel Watch 2, so it&apos;d cost you $180 to jump to the Pixel Watch 3 45mm. That&apos;s not a bad price, in theory!</p><p>The Pixel Watch 2 is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> today, and while the Pixel Watch 3 should take its place on our list after we review it, the Watch 2 will receive many of its best perks like the revamped Fitbit training tools and better Pixel phone integration. You may decide to be patient and wait for the Pixel Watch 4, in the hopes it has more significant upgrades to performance and battery life.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>

<hr>
<p>Google just unveiled its new Pixel phones, including its latest foldable model, but carrier compatibility is already causing ripples.</p><p>According to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/at-t-says-it-wont-carry-googles-pixel-9-pro-fold/" target="_blank">CNET report</a>, AT&T has decided not to carry the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. This move means Google misses out on AT&T&apos;s massive subscriber base, unless customers go for the unlocked version.</p><p>It’s a shame AT&T won’t carry the latest foldable from the tech giant. With a bigger screen, a sleeker design, and better proportions, it’s a serious contender for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">top foldable smartphone</a>.</p><p>Simply put, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is impressive, but it’s a letdown for potential buyers that AT&T won’t be offering it.</p><p>It’s also puzzling that AT&T would skip the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, especially since the carrier still offers the first-gen Pixel Fold and plans to carry the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>Google’s latest foldable fits right in with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a>, packing the same top-tier features, including the Tensor G4 chip and advanced Gemini AI. Plus, its ultra-thin design makes it all the more premium-looking.</p><p>On the flip side, AT&T is still offering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold&apos;s main competitor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>While AT&T’s decision to skip the Pixel 9 Pro Fold remains a mystery, it could be due to underwhelming sales of the first-generation Pixel Fold. But for now, it&apos;s anybody&apos;s guess.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear if AT&T will officially support unlocked Pixel 9 Pro Fold devices on its network. We’ve contacted AT&T for more details and will update this article when we receive a response.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold will launch on September 4 for $1,799. While Verizon and T-Mobile are on board, AT&T&apos;s choice to skip Google&apos;s new foldable is a notable outlier among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">major carriers</a>.</p>

The decision comes down to two things: clean software and consistent cameras. While most Android skins have decent interfaces these days, there&apos;s still a lot of overt styling, and I prefer what Google does in this area with Material You.</p><p>And while Google doesn&apos;t have the outright lead in cameras these days — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, Vivo X100 Ultra, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> take better photos and videos — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> takes the most consistent photos, and it does a great job with portrait shots and moving objects.</p>

<p>That said, Google&apos;s phones aren&apos;t without issues. I&apos;ve had a litany of problems with Pixels over the years; the panel on the Pixel 2 XL had washed-out colors, it didn&apos;t take much to break the Pixel 3 XL (I did it twice in two months), the oleophobic coat on my Pixel 4 XL wore out in under three months of use, and the volume rocker on the Pixel 7 Pro detached randomly one day. Last year, the Pixel 8 Pro decided to charge sporadically, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-already-doubting-the-long-term-durability-of-my-pixel-8-pro">USB-C port was to blame</a> — this was an issue on the Pixel 6 Pro as well.</p><p>Look, most phones have some issue or another, but the percentage of hardware-related problems I&apos;ve had with Pixels is significantly higher than any other brand. With Google now guaranteeing seven years of updates, it needs to do better in this area, and if the messaging around better durability is any indication, it looks like the brand is taking this seriously.</p><p>While that&apos;s undoubtedly good, Google for some reason just can&apos;t seem to nail the basics. Some of this is down to the choice of hardware; Google used Samsung&apos;s Exynos 2400 as the foundation for the Tensor G4, and other than newer cores, it is nearly indistinguishable to the Tensor G3.</p><p>Google made it clear that it doesn&apos;t want to chase performance numbers, and the brand instead chooses to focus on the TPU that powers all the AI features on its devices. That&apos;s fine by me; I don&apos;t use the Pixel 8 Pro because it is the fastest, but because it has a good overall experience. But what&apos;s annoying is that Google doesn&apos;t do any meaningful thermal management — even on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> generation — and that makes these devices prone to throttling and overheating.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tQMNQXwaV7Pomdj28HW7nV" name="google-pixel-9-with-buds-pro-2-peony-pink-01.jpg" alt="The Peony pink Google Pixel 9 next to the pink Google Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQMNQXwaV7Pomdj28HW7nV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s the arbitrary feature gating; most global models of the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL include a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a> modem, but the phones sold in India use an older Wi-Fi 6 modem. All other flagships sold in the country have Wi-Fi 7 as standard, but Google decided to not bother.</p><p>Even on the global version, Google randomly decided to not include features like 8K video and Night Sight video on the standard model, limiting these to the Pro variants. In a similar vein, the base models still come with 128GB of storage, and that&apos;s ridiculous in 2024; even mid-range phones now start at 256GB, and at this point, Google is just nickel-and-diming customers in this regard.</p><p>Hilariously, the base models of the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have an unnecessary 16GB of RAM and woefully inadequate 128GB of storage, and there isn&apos;t another brand that offers this configuration. It&apos;s clear that Google is trying to emulate Apple, and is using a similar pricing strategy to upsell storage variants.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="scfUdVxyWnHitQpX3n7tQh" name="google-pixel-9-pro-vs-pixel-8-pro-porcelain-06-display.jpg" alt="Comparing the Google Pixel 8 Pro to the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/scfUdVxyWnHitQpX3n7tQh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s also the question of pricing; the Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 and the 9 Pro XL at $1,099, and that&apos;s for phones with 128GB of storage; you&apos;ll need to pay another $100 to get 256GB models of these devices, and Google doesn&apos;t have anywhere as generous trade-in offers as Samsung.</p><p>Granted, these are minor irritants, but they matter on a flagship. There really isn&apos;t much to distinguish most flagships these days — at least on the hardware front — so every misstep is amplified. Google says its devices are the best at AI — and they are — and so it&apos;s asking a premium. Again, that&apos;s justified; ultimately, it&apos;s down to the brand to dictate what its phones cost.</p><p>But Google needs to understand that if it wants to price its phones in line with Apple and Samsung, it needs to deliver equivalent features; I&apos;m just not sure it is doing that.</p>

<ul><li>Google has launched the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL in India.</li><li>Thankfully, all three models are available in a single variant with 256GB of storage.</li><li>The Pixel 9 and 9 Pro don't cost that much more than their predecessors.</li><li>Google also introduced the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in the country, and that will set you back ₹1,72,999 ($2,061).</li></ul>
<p>Google unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 generation</a> earlier than usual this year, and the brand also showcased the awkwardly-named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. There are a lot of differences this time around, and I&apos;m not just talking about the accelerated launch — the Pixels have a new design language with flat sides that makes them look like an iPhone, and there are three models: the standard Pixel 9, a Pixel 9 Pro that has the same dimensions as the regular model but with a telephoto lens at the back, and a Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>If you&apos;ve used a Pro model in the Pixel series in the past, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is what you&apos;ll need to get. With the foldable, that makes four new devices. Outside of the differences with the design, Google is changing how it&apos;s selling phones in India; it just started assembling the Pixel 8 series locally, and it may do the same with the Pixel 9.</p><p>As a result, there isn&apos;t a noticeable increase in pricing from last year. The Pixel 9 is sold in a 12GB/256GB model and is available for ₹79,999 ($953), and that&apos;s actually less than the equivalent Pixel 8, which debuted at ₹82,999 ($989). The Pixel 9 Pro costs ₹1,09,999 ($1,310) for the 12GB/256GB model, and while it is marginally more than the ₹1,06,999 ($1,275) asking price of the Pixel 8 Pro last year, that phone was only sold in a 128GB model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="X7E8zftiVdtFxgfTEpfVQf" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-rose-pink-01.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in Rose Quartz" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X7E8zftiVdtFxgfTEpfVQf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL, meanwhile, debuts at ₹1,24,999 ($1,489) for the 16GB/256GB model, and that&apos;s on par with what the Galaxy S24 Ultra costs in the country. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold, meanwhile, is available at ₹1,72,999 ($2,061), making it the costliest foldable in the country — the Galaxy Z Fold 6 retails for ₹1,64,999 ($1,966).</p><p>What I like about Google&apos;s positioning is that all models come with 256GB of storage as standard. However, there are no other variants available, and if you want more storage, there isn&apos;t an alternative. I don&apos;t understand why Google does this year after year — surely, it isn&apos;t too hard to have all colors and storage variants of a phone available.</p><p>Anyway, if you&apos;re interested in a new Pixel, you should just get the Pixel 8 series; the standard Pixel 8 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/google-pixel-8-hazel-128-gb/p/itm67e2a2531aaac?pid=MOBGT5F2WD8HPTPZ">currently discounted to ₹58,999 ($703)</a>, and that is a good value considering what&apos;s on offer. While I think the Pixel 9 is decent in its own right, it isn&apos;t worth an additional ₹21,000.</p><p>Pixels never sold well in India in the past, and I don&apos;t see that changing with the Pixel 9 generation. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is unlikely to find any takers; foldables are still a niche, and while Chinese manufacturers are making inroads in this category, I can&apos;t see anyone shelling out more than the Galaxy Z Fold 6 to pick up what Google is offering.</p>

<p>Google hammers away at more AI software for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a>; however, there&apos;s more in store for its convenient search feature.</p><p>We&apos;ve been expecting Circle to Search to pick up audio lookup for a while, and a demo by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-audio-search-first-look-3470398/">Android Authority</a> takes it for a spin. An APK dive into the latest beta version (15.32.36) of the Google app shows how this feature, "Audio Search," might work in a stable release.</p><p>From <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/uerc9sZJjTA">the demo</a>, producing Circle to Search will display a new music note beside the search text box. Tapping it will overlay a graphic on top of your current display. If you&apos;ve hit play on Spotify or another listening service, Circle to Search will use that for your query.</p><p>The software will listen in for a few seconds before switching your display to the Google app&apos;s search results. The song&apos;s title will pop into the text field at the top, as well.</p><p>What&apos;s more, the latest beta builds upon previous suspicions by showing the company&apos;s plans to let users "sing or hum" a song on this screen. This is similar to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-search-for-a-song-on-youtube-by-singing-or-humming">Search a Song</a>" in the Google app or YouTube Music, accessible by hitting the microphone icon or Search in the latter app. Users can play, hum, or sing a song for music-based queries.</p><p>The publication states that Google may display a quick bubble when opening Circle to Search <em>after </em>this feature arrives for informative reasons.</p>

<p>It was first speculated that Google was developing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/circle-to-search-audio-lookup-spotted">an audio lookup feature</a> for Circle to Search in June. Back then, the feature was awfully barebones, only offering a quick glimpse at the music note icon that would signify its availability. Moreover, it still doesn&apos;t seem as though Google will let users attach a text-based add-on to their query <em>before </em>the software runs its search.</p><p>The demo suggests users can alter the lookup afterward, which might have to do. Despite the feature advancing between beta versions, there&apos;s no telling when users could see this rollout.</p><p>In other news, there&apos;s a chance Google will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-phones-may-soon-let-you-use-circle-to-search-in-split-screen-mode">bring split-screen support</a> to its search function. Shortly after Android 15 Beta 1.2, it was discovered that Pixel phones could be in line for this QoL (quality of life) addition. Samsung devices don&apos;t suffer from this lack of support, which could indicate a simple lapse during software development on Google&apos;s side.</p>
