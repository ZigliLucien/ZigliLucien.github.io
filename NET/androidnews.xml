<p>Google pandered to runners like me with the Pixel Watch 3, and barring a couple of mistakes and missing features, it did an excellent job. But my excitement was immediately tempered by the news of another nail in the Fitbit brand&apos;s coffin, one that limits who&apos;ll actually get to take advantage of these new running tools.</p><p>Up until now, running with a Pixel Watch was a bare-bones experience. You turned on the GPS, saw a few stats on your wrist during a run, and received a simple summary afterward. </p><p>The Fitbit OS is slightly better, though I found certain features, like creating intervals, needlessly complicated. Also, its daily recommendations and Premium workouts always felt more geared towards indoor workouts. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> changes things, adding tools like user-made workouts, AI-generated runs based on your Daily Readiness, a cardio load score that takes weeks of workout data and your target load into account, running form insights, and a Morning Brief summarizing everything you need to know before a run. </p><p>Google even says it improved heart rate accuracy when running by reducing "light artifacts" caused by rapid arm pumping. Based on our review testing, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 2</a> was no slouch in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZpQy2hJJLDEQQqsYxDTxfT" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-on-wrist.jpeg" alt="Close-up of the Google Pixel Watch 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZpQy2hJJLDEQQqsYxDTxfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Me wearing the Pixel Watch 3 at Made by Google 2024. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s not <em>everything</em> I&apos;d want out of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watch</a>, to be clear. The Pixel Watch 3 won&apos;t let you race past times. You can&apos;t download offline GPX maps, and Google has yet to take full advantage of Google Maps for things like courses or Back to Start. There&apos;s no Garmin Coach equivalent for long-term training plans, either. But this is nitpicking, and Wear OS 5 has things on the right track.</p><p>I&apos;m more disappointed that Google didn&apos;t follow Samsung&apos;s example with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and put dual-band GPS in the Pixel Watch 3. I&apos;ve had bad luck with GPS-only tracking on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a>, though the Watch 3 antenna should be much better. I can&apos;t really criticize it until I test the accuracy for myself, but it does feel like a slightly missed opportunity.</p>

<p>So what&apos;s the <em>real</em> problem? It&apos;s that the future of Fitbit smartwatches apparently rests on the Pixel Watch, and it remains uncertain if Google intends to bring these Fitbit insights to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">Fitbit-branded watches</a> (and I wouldn&apos;t bet on it).</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/waiting-for-a-new-fitbit-smartwatch-google-says-thats-the-pixel-watch-3-202314838.html">Engadget&apos;s Cherlynn Low</a> interviewed Sandeep Waraich, senior director of product management for Pixel Wearables, at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google 2024 event</a> earlier this week when Waraich gave her some unfortunate news.</p><p>Low asked Waraich about other Fitbit-branded smartwatches; he responded that "Pixel Watch is our smartwatch part of the portfolio" and that any Fitbits moving forward would offer a minimalist experience. He says Fitbit users want "a simple experience" and pointed to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-inspire-3-review">Fitbit Inspire 3</a> as an example.</p><p>He clarified that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review" target="_blank">Fitbit Sense 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review" target="_blank">Versa 4</a> will remain available, but we may not see Sense 3 or Versa 5 for a long time, if ever.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Fitbit, asking if these new running features could be added to past Sense and Versa watches and to confirm the news above. A spokesperson responded, saying that Google is "very committed to Fitbit" and to "the customers that use and depend on those products and technology." However, they did not comment on whether we would see these new running features on your Fitbit anytime soon, which doesn&apos;t leave me very hopeful.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve written in the past about Fitbit&apos;s struggles as a brand, so I&apos;ll keep it brief. Fitbit used to be a top-selling wearable brand, but it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-sales-are-going-up-and-the-apple-watch-extends-its-dominance">fell from 7th to 10th in total sales</a> in 2022, as per Counterpoint, and now rarely appears outside of the "Other" category on industry reports.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-confining-fitbit-makes-financial-sense-but-missed-opportunity">cut the territories</a> where it sold Fitbit devices in half in late 2023. A few months later, Fitbit&apos;s executives — including founders James Park and Eric Friedman — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-lays-off-hundreds-in-ar-assistant-while-losing-fitbit-executives">left Google</a> under unclear circumstances. Since then, Fitbit has presumably fallen under the Google wearables umbrella, with no one left to advocate for Fitbit as a separate entity.</p><p>The last Fitbit-branded device — released before the executive exodus — was the respectable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a>. It was essentially a reboxed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-charge-5-review">Charge 5</a> with new Google apps and a Google-made algorithm for better heart rate. We&apos;d hoped new Sense and Versa watches were next; instead, we&apos;ll probably see a petite Fitbit Inspire 4 band next year.</p><p>Here&apos;s the problem: Fitbit&apos;s pivot to focus on cheap fitness bands makes very little economic sense. Look at this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/worldwide-wearable-band-market-q1-2024">2024 Canalys report</a> showing how smartwatches dominate basic bands in total sales. In 2020, trackers and smartwatches made up 46% and 37% of the market, respectively; today, basic bands only account for 17%, versus 37% for smartwatches. By 2028, analysts predict, it&apos;ll be 12% and 48%, respectively.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="dCB7BFwvWviGc9UboSwuvA" name="Canalys-wearables-report-2024.jpeg" alt="A 2024 Canalys chart titled "Wristwatches will continue to steal wristband share."

<p>Abandoning your Fitbit smartwatches for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 3</a> and tiny Fitbit bands feels...short-sighted. It cuts out Fitbit&apos;s many iOS power users, as well as Android-using athletes who want a lightweight fitness watch that lasts a week and not a 24-hour Pixel Watch or a tiny-screened Inspire with no built-in GPS.</p><p>Even though the Fitbit Charge 6 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">best fitness tracker</a> available today, many people skip it because of the relatively high price and subscription. Jitesh Ubrani, IDC&apos;s research manager for wearables, says Fitbit has struggled to compete against "low-cost, value-oriented brands such as Xiaomi, Amazfit, or Huawei." Why spend $160 + $10/month when you can pay $40 for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/xiaomis-next-gen-fitness-tracker-could-hit-stores-worldwide-soon">Xiaomi Smart Band 9</a>?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5111px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7CYB4VkaSFhmKx45pLQhJ3" name="google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-45mm-fitbit-quick-start.jpg" alt="Fitbit Quick Start buttons on Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7CYB4VkaSFhmKx45pLQhJ3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5111" height="2875" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In light of that, I&apos;d always hoped that Fitbit would double down on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a>, optimizing its fitness software and health sensors on the Sense and Versa lineups, then porting those features to the Pixel Watch for Android power users who don&apos;t care as much about battery life.</p><p>Instead, at this rate, Fitbit will become more niche than ever as it pivots to the fitness band form factor that most people are starting to abandon in favor of smartwatches or smart rings.</p><p>Brands like Garmin, Coros, and Polar still cater to runners, but these focus much more on training guidance than health data. The Pixel Watch 3 takes the reverse approach, and I&apos;m genuinely excited to put it through its paces. However, Fitbit&apos;s hardware could have struck a balance between fitness and health, as well as smarts and efficiency. That&apos;s not gonna happen now.</p>

I didn&apos;t expect there to be (tech publications often receive details about products early so they can be prepared for their launch), but I still had a small sliver of hope. I was disappointed like I am every year.</p><p>I&apos;ve finally decided I&apos;m no longer going to have any expectations about seeing a wearable designed for wheelchair users from companies like Google, Samsung, or Apple because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">the wearable market</a> is like the market for every product; it&apos;s based on profits and not some lofty humanitarian effort.</p>

<p>I&apos;ll start by saying there <em>is</em> a wearable designed for people like me so it&apos;s not like we&apos;ve been forgotten. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">Garmin Venu 3</a> does an amazing job keeping track of how often I fail to meet my fitness goals, tracks workout routines specifically designed for folks in wheelchairs, and has been tailored for the physical changes and challenges people in a chair face. And it does an excellent job doing it.</p><p>I&apos;ll also say it&apos;s not the best smartwatch out there because of its software. It runs a proprietary Garmin-built operating system that isn&apos;t as intuitive or feature-packed as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Google&apos;s Wear OS</a> or Apple&apos;s watchOS. Besides, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> looks really good, and I like things that look nice. I just want one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fs5f8mn65hUPZJwc2DbzHS" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-at-made-by-google.jpeg" alt="Two Google Pixel Watch 3s on display at the Made by Google 2024 event." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fs5f8mn65hUPZJwc2DbzHS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Google can&apos;t have the same priorities as I do because it wants to sell watches. Google could prioritize a wheelchair mode complete with algorithm changes based on physiology for the next Pixel Watch, but that&apos;s not going to open many wallets.</p><p>Almost every product is like this. In the U.S., <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theregreview.org/2023/03/28/welch-ross-opening-the-skies-to-passengers-who-use-wheelchairs/">8.5% of the population has some sort of mobility issue</a>. Of those people, 15% use a wheelchair. That&apos;s 15% of 8.5%, or about 3.5 million people. That&apos;s a lot of people, but when compared to the 343 million people who <em>aren&apos;t</em> in a wheelchair, it puts the number into perspective. You see this in your daily life — you will find people using a chair, but not very many.</p>
<p>Most companies can not cater to marginalized groups. Yes, I said that and I can, because I&apos;m part of that group. Don&apos;t get mad. Garmin does it because it found a way to do it without compromising the work on features built for everyone else. Other smartwatch companies will let you set your wearable in chair mode without core changes to how fitness tracking works, and that&apos;s enough to include everyone without making things difficult for development.</p><p>This goes for every group of people with any sort of special need.

<p>These companies can&apos;t change their products to better serve the needs of the relatively few people affected. I guess they <em>could</em>, but that would be a silly business decision because it&apos;s spending money in a way that doesn&apos;t make your product better for the vast majority of people. It would only slow the development of features everyone wants.</p><p>I don&apos;t have to like this, but I&apos;ve decided I&apos;m going to stop hating it so much. With every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch</a> launch, I&apos;ve told myself this could be the year they make a watch for me. It&apos;s never that year.</p><p>Meanwhile, Android Central has contacted Google regarding any potential plans to bring wheelchair-focused features to the Pixel Watch but has not received a response in time for publication. I will update this article when I hear back.</p>
<p>Still, you should not let any of this influence your buying decision unless you&apos;re affected. Look at what gives you the best feature-to-value ratio, then buy whatever you like the most. Nobody in a wheelchair <del>is going to</del> should ever try to police your tastes. </p><p>Rock your new Pixel Watch and enjoy it. I&apos;ll wear my Garmin Venu 3 until it dies, but I&apos;ll be a <em>little</em> jealous.</p>

Well, before you do, those of you who want the Pixel 9 Pro Fold are out of luck if you were looking to purchase the device through AT&T. While the carrier has highlighted the impending availability of the Pixel 9 series, the company curiously left out the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>So what gives? We&apos;re not sure, but Android Central did reach out for a comment. Perhaps the original Pixel Fold didn&apos;t sell well enough for AT&T to justify carrying the sequel? After all, these aren&apos;t cheap phones. Still, AT&T does carry the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, so your guess is as good as ours until we receive an official statement from AT&T on the matter.

The company was just dealt a major blow after a judge ruled that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">maintaining an illegal monopoly</a> on search. However, as a result of the ruling, it looks like the U.S. is considering potentially breaking up the company.</p><p>The units up for consideration for Google to divest are Android and Chrome, two major products for Google. According to Statista, Android is used on about 70% of devices worldwide, while Chrome holds over 50% of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545520/market-share-of-internet-browsers-usa/">browser market in the United States</a>.</p><p>However, it may not come to this. The Justice Department is also considering much less drastic moves, such as making Google share its search data with others, which could definitely level the playing field. The government may also ban exclusive contracts like those Google made with companies like Apple to secure itself as a default search engine, which could have interesting consequences for the company.</p><p>These proposals would have to be approved by Judge Amit Mehta, and it seems no decisions have been made, so we&apos;ll keep an eye on the situation as it unfolds.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-app-mirroring-improved"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>One of the cool things about the Link to Windows app is that it allows users to stream their apps or mirror their screens on their PCs. However, one limitation can muddy the experience: You need to give permission to start the streaming process every time you want to open an app.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-devices-confirmed">One UI 6.1.1</a>, that appears to no longer be the case. As pointed out by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-6-1-1-streaming-apps-windows-3469490/">Android Authority</a>, Microsoft made some changes to how the Link to Windows app works and asks for permissions, letting users opt to "Always allow" mirroring. </p><p>The move definitely streamlines the process of streaming apps to your computer. Of course, you can always use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> to achieve more or less the same thing on a desktop-like UI.</p><p>The catch is that One UI 6.1.1 is only available on the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, with no word on when it will arrive on other Samsung devices. Hopefully, it&apos;s soon, as users are hoping to get Android 15 sooner rather than later after it rolls out on Pixel phones.</p>

There have been a few leaks of the Galaxy S24 FE, but the latest suggests that we may be getting the phone fairly soon.</p><p>The phone appears in what looks like press images, revealing the specs and likely colors the phone will launch in. It seems the phone will have a 6.7-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1900 nits of brightness. On the back, we see a triple camera system with a 50MP primary, 12MP ultrawide, and 8MP 3x telephoto. The display will be protected by Gorilla Glass Victus Plus, and the phone will feature an aluminum frame.</p><p>The report from Android Headlines also mentions an Exynos 2400e that will power the phone, likely a slightly downgraded version of the current flagship chipset for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>.

<p>Google's second-gen foldable comes with a ton of tweaks; it is significantly lighter and thinner than its predecessor, and both the inner and outer panels are noticeably brighter. There's decent hardware, one of the best camera packages in this category, and a design that's in line with the regular Pixel 9 Pro. Combine all of that with a clean software and plenty of cool AI features, and you get a foldable that excels in key areas.</p></p>

<p>Even though it isn't a new device, the Open continues to be a great choice if you need a new foldable. It is lighter than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, has brighter AMOLED panels, and its cameras hold their own against what Google is offering. You get a smoother hinge articulation, crease that isn't as visible, battery that lasts longer, and 67W charging. Basically, it has a lot of features that you'll actually end up using, but the software is limited; there are useful software features, but the phone will only get three Android updates.</p></p>

<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-oneplus-open-design-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. OnePlus Open: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dS9GZeJta4Bn4kmYb8crCC" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-oneplus-open-face-down.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold and OnePlus Open face-down with screens open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dS9GZeJta4Bn4kmYb8crCC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> was a showcase of Google&apos;s ambitions, but it was too heavy, and wasn&apos;t available widely. Google is rectifying both issues with the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>; the foldable is 26g lighter than its predecessor, and is significantly thinner. While it isn&apos;t the thinnest or lightest foldable — Honor and Vivo claimed those niches — it is thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, and Google is using that to its advantage in North America.</p><p>Coming to the design itself, Google did a good job maintaining the same design aesthetic as the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> series, and the dual-stacked camera housing at the back looks great. That said, the defining design feature is the side profile where the cover screen meets the metal chassis, and this is similar to the Open — but a little more prominent.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xHEmLL3ihZfhAp6ZcUyQjB" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-obsidian-porcelain-side-by-side-angle-closer.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Porcelain and Obsidian face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHEmLL3ihZfhAp6ZcUyQjB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the overall design, but coming in at 257g, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is 18g heavier than the Open while having a smaller battery. Google went with an aluminum frame and upgraded hinge, and while it gets to claim that the foldable is thinner than its rivals, the added weight isn&apos;t ideal. That said, the one area where the foldable has an advantage is water resistance; with an IPX8 rating, it is able to withstand water ingress — the Open only has an IPX4 rating that covers splashes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eGyLKviAK3wq4uCoqV8HdX" name="oneplus-open-2024-18.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eGyLKviAK3wq4uCoqV8HdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the Open isn&apos;t without its wins. The foldable has a faux leather back that&apos;s great to hold, and it has a hinge with one of the best articulations in the segment. The crease is barely noticeable in the middle of the inner panel, and OnePlus nailed the design basics.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-oneplus-open-displays-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. OnePlus Open: Displays</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FGpDTKpipC2U464JTXWyCb" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-split-screen-prompt-alt.jpg" alt="Split-screen prompt on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FGpDTKpipC2U464JTXWyCb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google clearly liked what OnePlus was doing on its foldable, because it went with a similarly-sized outer panel on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The foldable has a 6.3-inch OLED panel with a 20:9 ratio, and the width makes it just as usable as the regular Pixel 9 Pro. In fact, Google went with the same dimensions, and if the foldable looks like it has the panel of the Pixel 9 Pro up front, that&apos;s by design.</p><p>While the Pixel 9 Pro has a QHD panel, the foldable uses an FHD+ resolution (2424 x 1080) on the outside, but it still gets 120Hz dynamic refresh and decent brightness levels. The inner OLED panel is interesting as well, as the 8.0-inch size is one of the biggest on a foldable. Like other devices in this category, the inner panel has a plastic layer protecting the screen, and it also goes up to 120Hz and hits the same brightness levels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dXEAa8WVpZvUdAtztpADwX" name="oneplus-open-2024-20.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dXEAa8WVpZvUdAtztpADwX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Talking about brightness, the device is able to go up to 2,700 nits in HDR content, and that&apos;s double that of its predecessor. I&apos;ll update this post once I start using the foldable to gauge how bright it gets in regular use, but there shouldn&apos;t be any issues in this area.</p><p>The Open is a known quantity, and it has a 6.31-inch cover panel and 7.82-inch inner screen. Both panels get 120Hz refresh with dynamic refresh, have a higher resolution than what Google is offering, and excellent color vibrancy and brightness levels. I used the Open extensively over the course of the last year, and didn&apos;t see any issues with either panel.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-oneplus-open-hardware-and-cameras-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. OnePlus Open: Hardware and cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4aNfnwyja9Ag9HUzaN8KRY" name="oneplus-open-2024-16.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4aNfnwyja9Ag9HUzaN8KRY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has a unique take on the hardware, and while the Tensor G4 platform is technically new, it doesn&apos;t differ too much to the G3. It isn&apos;t as fast as what Qualcomm is offering, but that&apos;s not the point; Google chooses to focus on the AI side of things, as it sees that being a bigger differentiator.</p><p>Although the Open is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, it is still able to deliver outstanding performance in demanding titles. It is optimized to take advantage of the hardware, and doesn&apos;t have any lag in daily use. While both devices come with 16GB of RAM, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold only has 256GB of storage on the base model, and you&apos;ll need to pay an additional $120 to get the 512GB edition. The Open doesn&apos;t have such shortcomings, and the foldable has 512GB of storage as standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5VEqQ3Ah5DyuAJhYnx4yVV" name="oneplus-open-2024-7.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5VEqQ3Ah5DyuAJhYnx4yVV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Open also has a larger battery, but where it has a sizeable advantage is the charging tech; the foldable goes up to 67W, and you can easily charge the battery in under 50 minutes — Google still relies on 21W charging on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The Open comes with a 67W charger as well, and that&apos;s an added bonus.</p><p>I&apos;m not going into much detail on the cameras, as I&apos;ll still need to get the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and see how it measures up. That said, Google knows how to deliver standout cameras on its devices, and while the foldable isn&apos;t using the latest sensors, it should take great photos and videos.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-oneplus-open-software-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. OnePlus Open: Software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HBYM6PMPzpGEUSZaCA2uRT" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-close-up-on-new-apps.jpg" alt="New apps on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HBYM6PMPzpGEUSZaCA2uRT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has a sizeable lead on the software front, with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold slated to receive seven Android updates. The foldable launched with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and it will pick up the Android 21 update whenever that becomes available at the end of the decade. By contrast, the Open will get just three software updates, and as it debuted with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a>, it won&apos;t go beyond Android 16.</p><p>Okay, so the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will technically be usable until the end of the decade, but what about the software itself? Google is the only Android brand that has a clean software without any bloatware, and that makes a difference. The Material You design has a decent amount of customization, and the bright accent colors are great to use. It may not be to everyone&apos;s tastes, but I prefer it to other Android skins.</p>

<p>I&apos;ll admit that OnePlus did a good job on the software side of things. Although OxygenOS has a cluttered interface, you get a lot of unique software features designed to maximize the real estate of the inner panel, and multitasking is a breeze. You get a few AI features as well, and they aren&apos;t gimmicky.</p><p>But when it comes to AI, no manufacturer comes close to Google. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a slate of new features in this regard, with the likes of Pixel Studio allowing you to create stunning imagery in a matter of seconds. There are lots of other Google-focused utilities that rely on AI, and most of it is handled on-device.</p><p>On the whole, if you want a clean UI with AI features you&apos;ll use daily, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the device to get.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1963px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="nYakyXauxUpCJjCEZvMSBZ" name="oneplus-open-2024-12.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nYakyXauxUpCJjCEZvMSBZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1963" height="1106" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is an easy one to sum up: if you need a new foldable, you should get the OnePlus Open. It may be a year old, but it&apos;s still one of the best foldables around. It has a gorgeous design, the leather back is great in daily use, and you get a smooth hinge with no visible crease. The cameras are terrific, there are no issues with battery longevity, and it charges at 67W.</p><p>The only point of contention with the Open is that it will get just three Android OS updates, and having launched with Android 13, that means it won&apos;t be updated beyond Android 16. That just isn&apos;t enough in this category, and to put things in context, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will get the Android 21 update when that rolls out at the end of the decade. Obviously, you&apos;re not going to use the device that long, but long-term updates absolutely make a difference in the resale market.</p><p>To its credit, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold gets a lot right; I really like the design, the OLED panels are brighter than its predecessor, and it has decent hardware. The biggest selling point is the software and cameras; Google&apos;s clean interface combined with the latest suite of AI features make the Pixel 9 Pro Fold a true powerhouse, and while it may not have the latest sensors, the foldable should take standout photos and videos.</p><p>There&apos;s the cost to consider as well. You can get the 16GB/512GB version of the OnePlus Open for $1,399 in the U.S. and ₹1,39,999 ($1,667) in India, and the same model of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold costs a ridiculous $1,919. Google doesn&apos;t even sell the 512GB model in India; the 256GB version is available for ₹1,72,999 ($2,061), and you can get the 1TB OnePlus Open and have enough left over to buy a swathe of accessories.</p>

<p>Google has a lot to offer with its latest foldable, and if the inflated pricing doesn't daunt you, then you should just pick it up. The outer and inner OLED panels are much better than last year, the software has the best suite of AI-based features available today, and you get versatile cameras at the back.</p></p>

<p>If you don't want to spend too much money but still want a great foldable, the Open is the way to go. I used the foldable a lot over the course of 2024, and it has been outstanding. The software has a ton of cool features, the battery easily lasts all day, and it takes phenomenal photos. The only limitation is the number of software updates, but if you're willing to look past that, it is still an easy recommendation.</p></p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google’s Satellite SOS feature is launching first on the Pixel 9 series and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, but only in the continental U.S. (not Hawaii or Alaska).</li><li>Garmin Response will handle rescue operations, connecting Pixel 9 users with local and international emergency services.</li><li>Skylo’s global satellite network makes it possible for the Pixel 9 to connect in remote areas, with potential for global expansion.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has teamed up with Garmin and Skylo to let you send an SOS message via satellite if you&apos;re stuck somewhere with no cell service.</p><p>During the Made by Google event earlier this week, Brian Rakowski, vice president for product management, announced that the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> series would be the inaugural <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a> to incorporate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-consumer-charge-potential">Satellite SOS</a>. This means users can connect with emergency services and send their location even when there’s no cell signal (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/garmin-skylo-pixel-9-series-satellite-sos/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p><p>Apple was the first to bring satellite connectivity to smartphones with the Emergency SOS feature on the iPhone 14. It gave users in remote spots a crucial way to get help when cell coverage was spotty.</p><p>Much like Apple&apos;s Emergency SOS, Google&apos;s Satellite SOS provides a similar safety net. If you find yourself without cell service, you can use Satellite SOS to reach emergency services. After filling out a quick form about your situation, you&apos;ll be able to text the first responders. Plus, you can let your emergency contacts know what&apos;s happening.</p><p>Just like Apple’s satellite service, Google’s Satellite SOS doesn’t rely on your cellular carrier.</p><p>Google’s Pixel 9’s satellite SOS feature is a joint project with Garmin and Skylo. Garmin Response, known for its global emergency management expertise, will handle rescue operations for Pixel 9 users in the U.S.</p><p>If a Pixel 9 user hits an emergency and is out of cell service, they can use Satellite SOS to reach Garmin Response&apos;s 24/7 emergency crew. Garmin Response will then loop in local authorities like police, fire departments, search and rescue teams, and even international agencies if needed, to get help on the way.</p><p>This partnership could be a real game-changer. Not only does it bring satellite SOS to Pixel users, but it also hints at Garmin’s emergency response services potentially reaching a larger Android crowd, as per Garmin&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/corporate/garmin-announces-support-of-new-satellite-sos-on-google-pixel-smartphones/" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>Skylo’s a big player in this collaboration too. Its global satellite network lets Pixel 9 users get help even in the most remote places. Thanks to this network, there’s potential for satellite SOS to go global, not just stay in the U.S.</p><p>Skylo teamed up with various satellite operators and worked with Google to build a system where phones can connect straight to satellites. This major tech upgrade makes it possible to communicate in emergencies, even in the most isolated spots, according to Skylo&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.skylo.tech/newsroom/skylo-connectivity-enables-new-satellite-sos-feature-on-google-pixel-9-series" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>While Satellite SOS is a groundbreaking feature, it&apos;s still in its early stages. For now, it’s only on the Pixel 9 series and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. Plus, it’s rolling out first in the U.S. but won’t be available in Hawaii and Alaska, according to Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15254448?visit_id=638591764705047306-3664744699&p=satellitesos&rd=1" target="_blank">support page</a>.</p>

<ul><li>An interview with Google's Director of Design for Pixel phones, Claude Zellweger, explained why the Pixel 9's camera visor is so huge.</li><li>Zellweger explained that consumer interest in mobile photography is the catalyst as Google needs to bring large lenses and sensors but keep the device thin.</li><li>The company highlighted "Add Me" for the Pixel 9's camera alongside announcing the arrival of its long-awaited "Zoom Enhance."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s Pixel 9 series picked up one design change that could give consumers a mixed reaction.</p><p>Google&apos;s Director of Design for Pixel phones, Claude Zellweger, sat down with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/24220359/google-pixel-9-camera-bar-small-phones-claude-zellweger-interview">The Verge</a> and discussed why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-pixel-9-series-boasts-a-faster-chip-brighter-screens-and-new-ai-features">Pixel 9&apos;s camera bump</a> is so big. The conversation led off with Zellweger stating the bump is large by design and was also "the most efficient way" to deliver the phone&apos;s cameras.</p><p>He also linked the idea of producing a Pixel phone with such a large camera to consumer interest and what they want from mobile photography. Google says it understands that users want to take good, high-quality photos. However, doing so requires the device to pack beefy sensors and lenses to meet demand.</p>

<p>Additionally, a large camera bump helped Google keep the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL reasonably thin.</p><p>When questioned whether smaller phones could be a possibility, Zellweger saw trials ahead. He stated, "building small phones is just fundamentally a bigger challenge" due to battery life demands, cameras, and more. Zellweger remained hopeful, adding that there could be a future where "some people have different priorities" about their devices.</p><p>This future could indicate a vastly smaller camera bump — which Google might still consider. Zellweger states the design choices are ultimately left to the camera needs of consumers. What&apos;s more, the design choice of the Pixel 9&apos;s camera bump might not stick around "forever."</p>

<p>Google debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">the Pixel 9 series</a> earlier this week and the devices pack small performance increases alongside notable AI boosts. Joining the Pixel 9 and the 9 Pro is the larger 6.8-inch display Pixel 9 Pro XL. Google implemented a completely flat design language with its smartphone&apos;s display this year and flat, shiny sides.</p><p>The camera bump entered the spotlight with a telephoto lens on the Pro models, a 42MP selfie camera, a 50MP primary lens, and a 48MP ultrawide lens.</p><p>The Pixel 9&apos;s photography is taken to new heights with Google&apos;s new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a>" feature.

<ul><li>A worrying vulnerability was discovered on Pixel devices caused by Verizon's demo app, per iVerfy researchers.</li><li>The issue could open a user's Pixel to malware and spyware attacks if it becomes active and receives the necessary permissions.</li><li>Google states it is working on a software update to remove the Verizon demo app from all affected Pixel phones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Every Google Pixel phone sold by Verizon comes preloaded with the carrier&apos;s apps, but one of them could cause a nasty malware attack if activated in person.</p><p>The discovery made by mobile endpoint and response researchers at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://iverify.io/press-releases/iverify-discovers-severe-android-vulnerability-impacting-millions-of-devices-around-the-world">iVerify</a> was detailed in a recent report (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/showcase-app-3472086/">Android Authority</a>). iVerify&apos;s researchers state the file&apos;s malicious properties expose Pixel device&apos;s Android software to MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks.</p><p>Essentially, online threats could virtually inject malware and spyware onto your device to gain "system privileges." According to a Google spokesperson, the vulnerability&apos;s catalyst was found within a file named Showcase.apk, which is the Verizon demo app.</p><p>Normally, uninstalling a problematic app would solve the issue but this is a special app preloaded by Verizon and cannot be uninstalled. iVerify informed Google about the vulnerability and the company says it&apos;s working with Verizon to get a system update out to customers that removes the problematic app.</p><p>The "good" news is that Verizon&apos;s demo app is dormant. So long as the app isn&apos;t enabled or active on your Pixel devices the problem isn&apos;t critical. The cause for concern is that the software still exists within your Pixel device. The publication adds that an attacker would need "physical access" to your phone to enable the app and grant the Showcase.apk file the necessary permissions.</p><p>Google informed Android Authority that it will remove the file in question "from all supported in-market Pixel devices with an upcoming Pixel software update." iVerify&apos;s report states this vulnerability could affect a "large percentage" of Pixel phones sold from September 2017 onward.</p>

<p>Android vulnerabilities and those that plague one subset of devices are scary, but Google&apos;s had to wrangle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-fixed-a-critical-security-flaw-for-pixels-but-other-android-phones-were-left-hanging">with others in recent months</a>. Earlier this year, the company patched a zero-day vulnerability that could&apos;ve erased a user&apos;s data stored on their Pixel.</p><p>Interestingly, only Pixel devices received the fix for this issue. Google stated that other non-Pixel phones will have to wait for Android 15. Another issue that plagued Pixel occurred last year, dubbed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-acropalypse-exploit">aCropalypse</a>," allowed attackers to "un-crop" an image and discover hidden data in it.</p><p>As is the case with most issues, the problem was rectified through a Google software update. Pixel phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> series receive seven years of software updates — including important security updates like these examples — showing just how important it is to receive years of software support.</p>

That's cheaper than the price of a caramel latte (which just so happens to be the name of this model's color variety). <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8eb25536-51d3-470b-939b-f90f6f4f18e2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$294.99" data-dimension48="$294.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s next Galaxy S series isn&apos;t expected until next year, but a new round of leaks suggests unique changes might arrive with it.</p><p>The initial rumor stems from known X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1824300253081899277">Ice Universe</a> who purports that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will undergo a screen-to-body ratio rework (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s25_ultras_width_and_screen_size_tipped-news-64159.php">GSMArena</a>). The post claims the device will feature a "smaller" display width than the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Additionally, the body frame changes may result in a narrower aspect ratio, but with an immersive display due to slimmer bezels.</p><p>It seems the device will move away from feeling difficult to hold due to its size and the amount of "frame" users have wrangled with. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1824302121078100117">subsequent comment</a>, the tipster added that the device&apos;s thickness could be compared to Apple&apos;s iPhone 16 Pro Max.</p><p>Elsewhere, the tipster showed off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1823924355849707849">a supposed render</a> of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which suggests Samsung could fix one key aspect: its sharp corners. The rendering doubles down on what we&apos;ve heard previously as the next model could offer rounded corners, instead of ones that dig into your palm.</p><p>The change (if true) would aid in comfortability when holding the device — alongside those rumored body frame alterations.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What is the biggest problem with the S24 Ultra design?The number one flaw is that the horizontal screen-to-body ratio is too low. The body width is 79mm, of which only 72.3mm is the screen, and the remaining 6.7mm is all the frame and the middle frame, which makes the hand feel… pic.twitter.com/YjCVWgWeKi<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1824300253081899277">August 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Curiously, another rumor from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1824358380657578108">Yogesh Brar</a> on X states Samsung could rename its S series Ultra model (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-ultra-note-pro-3472224/">Android Authority</a>). The Korean OEM is allegedly considering swapping the name of the Ultra model for the Note. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1824460462043418967">Brar adds</a> that this may not happen with the Galaxy S25 Ultra since the "branding has been fixed." However, there&apos;s supposedly a chance a Galaxy S26 Note could happen.</p><p>Moreover, the company could rebrand the Plus model to "Pro," instead. If this pans out, perhaps there&apos;s more in-store upgrade-wise for the Galaxy S series&apos; middle device. Google is launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> with two different-sized Pro models this year, so it&apos;s possible Samsung might offer something similar.</p><p>At the end of June, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-might-bring-back-a-classic-look">rumors claimed</a> Samsung could give its next Ultra a classic Galaxy Note look by bringing back the rounded corners. An issue Android Central had with the S24 Ultra was how uncomfortable it was to hold over long periods. Now, with a narrower aspect ratio rumored, perhaps these two changes could help make it effortless to scroll endlessly.</p><p>It was also rumored that the device could feature next-gen display technology, outfitting fingerprint scanning across the screen. Another leak stated the S25 Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s25-ultra-wont-probably-blow-your-mind-with-its-battery-life">might not excite you battery-wise</a> as it could continue to offer a 5,000mAh capacity with 45W charging. Meanwhile, companies like OnePlus have been rumored to outfit their next phones with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-charging-display-upgrade-leak">larger battery</a>.</p>

<p>The best Android phones under $100 do exist, you just have to know where to look. If you&apos;re on a tight budget, these devices will give you a fairly decent user experience. </p><p>They are obviously not going to be the most feature-packed or anywhere close to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> on the market, but we&apos;ve used nearly every device on this list and can recommend ones that will function reliably without breaking the bank. You might even be surprised by some of the specs. The NUU A23 Plus, for example, gets the top spot for the best bang for buck below $100. For users outside the U.S., the Xiaomi Redmi 12C is a great option, even if you might have to wait a little for it to get a bit discounted. Some of these smartphones, like UMIDIGI&apos;s Power 5, even manage to pack in features that are found in flagship smartphones.</p>

<p>Although the Xiaomi Redmi 12C usually costs a little over $100, you can easily get it for less than that during sales and promotions. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-xiaomi-phones" target="_blank">Xiaomi phone&apos;s</a> design itself is pretty standard for this price range — a full-plastic body and a small camera cut-out in a waterdrop notch on the front — but you do get a very convenient rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, and the camera experience is better than you might expect.</p><p>The MediaTek Helio G85 SoC inside offers plenty of performance for everyday use, pushing the boundaries of what a cheap smartphone is capable of. You get multiple memory combos, but the cheapest variant of the Xiaomi Redmi 12C comes with 3GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage.</p><p>You even get a delightfully large battery rated at 5,000mAh. A single charge could get you two to three days of use, which is good as the 10W microUSB charger included in the box will take several hours to juice things up. Best charge it overnight and just enjoy using it while you&apos;re awake.</p><p>The 50MP primary camera is the star of the show, delivering the best results of any phone at this price range. Sadly, the Xiaomi Redmi 12C isn&apos;t officially available in the U.S. and even if you get your hands on it, carrier support can be a bit problematic. If that doesn&apos;t matter to you, it&apos;s definitely among the best phones for anyone having a $100 budget.</p>

<p>Exquisite design isn&apos;t something you see on Android phones in this price range, and while &apos;exquisite&apos; isn&apos;t exactly the word we&apos;d use to describe the BLU G33, it certainly stands out from the rest of the phones on this list. The eye-catching textured design on the back is bold and attractive.</p><p>Joining that design is a well-rounded set of specifications, including a 6.26-inch LCD display, a dual-lens rear camera setup with a 5MP unit and a 0.3MP module, a side-mounted fingerprint reader integrated into the power button, upgradable storage, and even face unlock for further security.</p><p>The chipset features an octa-core ARM Cortex A55 setup, but the 2GB/16GB option is very poor for RAM and internal storage. It&apos;s got some of the worst battery life on this list though, as the 3,000mAh battery probably won&apos;t last more than a day. You do get some consolation in the form of the USB-C charging port.</p><p>In addition to the phone itself, BLU gives you all of the accessories you could possibly need, right in the box. These include a screen protector, a silicone case, a charger and cable, and even a BLU sticker for you to place wherever you want. All in all, the water-resistant BLU G33 is a great budget phone for well below $100.</p>

<p>In case you are not familiar with the term, dumb phones are essentially just super simple devices that lack all of the bells and whistles found in modern smartphones. There are typically no apps, no touchscreen, and no high-tech camera software; just try to picture the phone you used in 2006. Durable, cheap, and long-lasting, these devices have been seeing a resurgence in popularity among people who are trying to disconnect from being constantly online. Others may be interested in a dumb phone for privacy reasons or to improve their work/life balance. No matter the reason, the Cat S22 Flip is still among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-dumb-phone" target="_blank">best dumb phones</a> with Android that costs less than $100, even if the company behind it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/bullitt-reportedly-shuts-down" target="_blank">probably won&apos;t be making any more devices</a>.</p><p>Now, if you want to get technical, it’s worth noting that the Cat S22 Flip cannot really be called a true dumb phone since it runs Android 11 (Go Edition). If you’re willing to ignore the semantics, it&apos;s a great phone powered by the quad-core Snapdragon 215 chipset. You can download simple apps like Facebook and YouTube, the phone has a 2.8-inch touchscreen and a 1.44-inch outer secondary display, and the whole thing is military-grade tough, offering resistance to water, dust and insane temperatures.</p><p>The Cat S22 Flip comes with up to 12 hours of battery life, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, USB-C charging, a programmable button, a 5MP primary camera, a 2MP selfie lens, and a microSD card slot for expandable storage.</p>

<p>While the TCL 30 Z isn&apos;t as fancy of a phone as the company&apos;s newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl-40-series-nxtpaper-12-pro-launch" target="_blank">TCL 40 XL</a>, it&apos;s a solid option in the sub-$100 bracket. There&apos;s something to be said about simplicity, and even though the TCL 30 Z is simple, it still has all the basics of a cheerfully cheap smartphone to keep you satisfied.</p><p>Running Android 12 out of the box, the TCL 30 Z has a MediaTek Helio A22 SoC, and pleasantly, 3GB of RAM. You get 32GB of storage onboard and it can be increased up to a whopping 512GB via a microSD card. The smartphone&apos;s 6.1-inch HD+ LCD panel is dwarfed by a thick forehead and chin, but it still looks nice and crisp.</p><p>There are dual cameras — an 8MP rear sensor and a 5MP front-facing lens. They get the job done, but obviously won&apos;t come anywhere close to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera" target="_blank">best Android camera phones</a> out there. Thankfully, you can expect excellent battery life, even with the small 3,000mAh battery of the phone. Although the microUSB port is a letdown, but at least you get Verizon support, which is hard to come by in this price range.</p>

<p>It may not be the flashiest thing out there, but UMIDIGI&apos;s Power 5 offers just about everything you could possibly want in a sub-$100 Android smartphone, while also packing a few extras.</p><p>While the 6.53-inch HD+ display of the Power 5 obviously can&apos;t hold a candle to the Super AMOLED screens you&apos;d find in some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> in the market, it&apos;s perfectly fine for everyday usage. The smartphone is powered by MediaTek&apos;s Helio G25 SoC and comes with 3GB or 4GB of RAM. You can also choose between 64GB or 128GB of internal storage and expand it further up to 256GB via a microSD card. That said, the biggest highlight of this affordable smartphone is its built-in contactless thermometer, which uses Infrared technology to measure your body temperature. The only other smartphone (that we know of!) having this feature is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review" target="_blank">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a>, and that thing costs more than ten times as much.</p><p>UMIDIGI Power 5 comes with a triple-lens rear camera setup, comprising a 16MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 5MP macro module. The software — Android 11 — is quite dated and there&apos;s no 5G connectivity, but you can&apos;t have everything at this price. Among other goodies are a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and a 6,150mAh battery with support for 10W charging support.</p>

<p>There are many junk Android phones that you can buy in this $100 price range, but there are also many great ones, as seen above. Overall, the NUU A23 Plus stands out as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" target="_blank">best cheap Android phone</a> that we&apos;ve managed to find under the $100 price point. When it comes to buying cheap phones, you want to get as many features as possible. Even then, the NUU A23 Plus gives you bang for your buck, complete with a clean Android 13 experience.</p><p>For Verizon support in the U.S. however, the TCL 30 Z remains our top pick. It costs way less than $100 and comes with a number of decent features including a great screen, plenty of storage, decent performance, expandable storage, and face unlock. The one caveat here is the dated micro-USB port, but it&apos;s probably not a big deal at this price point. We also suggest the UMIDIGI Power 5, which offers decent specs, a big battery, and even a contactless Infrared thermometer, all for less than $100.</p><p>If none of these phones tickle your fancy and you&apos;re willing to stretch your budget a little, we&apos;ve also gathered the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200" target="_blank">best Android phones under $200</a> for you to choose from.</p>
