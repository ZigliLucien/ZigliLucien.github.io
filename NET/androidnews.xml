Both phones deliver a singular vision of what Google sees in the future of Pixel phones, offering an identical experience at two distinct sizes.</p><p>Since there&apos;s no real difference between these two phones other than their size, we&apos;re combining the reviews to give you a better look at the best Pixel 9 experience available. We&apos;ve been using both models interchangeably over the past month and have come away disappointed about problems that have plagued Pixels for years. Thankfully, many of Google&apos;s latest feature additions help offset those disappointing feelings.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking to pick up a Google Pixel 9 Pro or Google Pixel 9 Pro XL this year, read on to find out why that&apos;s a great choice for some folks, while others might want to look elsewhere for their next smartphone upgrade.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL are now officially available as of August 22, 2024. Both models offer a choice of 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage, as well as 16GB of RAM. You can choose from either size in a range of colors, including Obsidian (black), Porcelain (white), Hazel (grey), and Rose Quartz (pink).</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 with 128GB of storage, while the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL starts at $1099 with 128GB of storage. You can buy the Pixel 9 series in any of the following countries:</p>
<ul><li><strong>NAMER: </strong>US, Canada</li><li><strong>EMEA:</strong> Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, France, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, UK</li><li><strong>APAC: </strong>Australia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan</li></ul>
<p>All Pixel 9 models include Pixel VPN at no additional cost, which helps protect you while on the go and connecting to potentially unscrupulous public Wi-Fi hotspots. Google is also including one year of Gemini Advanced with every Google Pixel 9 Pro or 9 Pro XL, which would normally cost $20 per month with the AI-tier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One subscription</a>.</p><p>Each Google Pixel 9 Pro box contains no plastic and is impressively environmentally friendly.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5qjmyvhuj5Y9BbVDENCrpE" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-7.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL in tree" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5qjmyvhuj5Y9BbVDENCrpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the exception of a few tweaks here and there, Google has largely kept the same design that was initially introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a>. However, we&apos;ve slowly seen more and more phone makers adopt an iPhone-like design with flat edges and flat screens. Google jumped aboard this trend with the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL. Gone is the combination of curved glass and aluminum, and in its place, we have flat edges as far as the eye can see.</p><p>As soon as I saw the Pixel 9 series in person, I immediately thought that this was just an iPhone. Sure, the buttons, colors, and camera housing are different, but I haven&apos;t been able to shake the idea that Google made a Pixel iPhone. This isn&apos;t a bad thing by any means, but it&apos;s just something I think is rather interesting.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rperGrMLvNzKanmJfUdkZ6" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-iphone-15-pro-max-1.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with iPhone 15 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rperGrMLvNzKanmJfUdkZ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the Pixel 9 and the 9 Pro Fold, Google opted to use a polished aluminum finish with the 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL. I understand the need to try and differentiate the Pro from the non-Pro models, but I still prefer the feeling of brushed aluminum over polished.</p><p>While a polished frame might be more eye-catching to some, it won&apos;t take long for fingerprints and smudges to ruin everything. I also found both the 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL to be a bit slippier to use, resulting in me slapping a case on the phones as soon as they arrived.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2wMzuCweMPitEorspQR4km" name="thinborne-case-on-google-pixel-9-pro-xl.jpg" alt="Thinborne case with PopSocket on Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2wMzuCweMPitEorspQR4km.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In previous years, I would usually head over to the dbrand website and find a skin that would match whatever phone I was switching to. Then, I would grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe ring adapter</a>, sticking it to the dbrand skin, so I could enjoy the plethora of MagSafe accessories at my disposal.</p><p>I was hoping that Google would kill two birds with one stone for me, but alas, there&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-google-pixel-9-support-qi2-wireless-charging">no Qi2 support</a> on any of the Pixel 9 models. Thankfully, my our favorite case maker, Thinborne, is here to save the day with its excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinborne-Compatible-Aramid-Magnetic-Minimalist/dp/B0D86M1X4D/">Aramid Fiber Thin Case</a> that&apos;s also MagSafe-compatible.</p>

<p>I was rather surprised that Google released its Pro phone in two different sizes. It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t think this is the right move, but I just didn&apos;t see Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/there-are-too-many-pixel-phones">adding another phone to its ever-growing lineup</a>. Nevertheless, I&apos;m of the mindset that having a small "pro" phone is a great way to potentially attract more people to make the switch to the world of Pixel.</p><p>Besides the physical screen size, these displays are practically identical. They can reach 3000 nits and offer Google&apos;s "Smooth Display" variable refresh rate. With the exception of following the trend of displays that can get brighter, it&apos;s all pretty much what you&apos;d expect from a flagship phone.</p><p>The colors pop, the screens look great, and yeah, that&apos;s pretty much all I can say.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2XTFe28XWSvVLQ4gKWJ4dm" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-display-fingerprint-sensor-01.jpg" alt="An up-close look at the new in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2XTFe28XWSvVLQ4gKWJ4dm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing that ended up causing quite a bit of frustration was the in-screen fingerprint sensor. When using these phones without a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-screen-protectors">screen protector</a>, everything works as advertised. That all changed as soon as we installed a screen protector on the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>Currently, I&apos;ve only used the screen protector that comes with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">Thinborne case</a>, so I&apos;m not sure if this is to blame, but unlocking the phone has become a hassle. It seems to be less of a problem during the day, but as soon as I&apos;m in an area with little light, it just doesn&apos;t work.</p><p>After a couple of days, I remembered there&apos;s actually a toggle in the Settings app to help combat this issue. However, after enabling the "Screen Protector Mode," there literally hasn&apos;t been a difference.</p><p>Since I spend the majority of my time at home, this isn&apos;t really all that much of an issue. A recent trip to New York for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-2024samsung-lenovo-chromebooks-hands-on">Google&apos;s Chromebook Showcase</a> quickly reaffirmed my stance on embedded fingerprint sensors. I really, and I mean REALLY, wish Google would just integrate the sensor into the Power button. It already does this with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and Pixel Tablet, but I think it&apos;s time for it to come to the phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4Pcpty7fGkKAHMEjU7xpE" name="google-pixel-9-pro-with-pixel-9-pro-fold-1.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro next to Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Pcpty7fGkKAHMEjU7xpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can&apos;t tell you how frustrating and annoying it is to be trying to catch a subway, only to get tied up at the gate because your fingerprint didn&apos;t authenticate tap-to-pay. It only worked for me once or twice, and more often than not, I ended up just using face recognition instead.</p><p>Seeing as I don&apos;t experience the same PWM tribulations as my compadre and Android Central senior content producer, Nick Sutrich, I can&apos;t speak to that. However, he&apos;s included his thoughts and feelings about the PWM and refresh rate of Google&apos;s Super Actua Display below:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TnqSSfkMnpJQSSUAHUg3N3" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-pixel-8-pro-pixel-7-pro-displays1.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL next to Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel 7 Pro showing displays" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnqSSfkMnpJQSSUAHUg3N3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The ultra-low 240Hz PWM rate used to "dim" the phone&apos;s display gives me terrible headaches, especially when I try to use the phone in the evening. This problem started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone#:~:text=If%20you%27re%20suffering%20from,customer%20service%20team%20know%2C%20too.">about 2 years ago for me</a> and has only gotten worse as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">displays have gotten ultra-bright</a>.</p><p>The 3000-nit display on these phones is insanely bright, and flickering on and off at a low rate of 240Hz is nothing short of abysmal. Google is the only smartphone company that hasn&apos;t upgraded its rate — Samsung and Apple now use 480Hz on most devices — and companies like Honor and OnePlus push that rate to 2160Hz, 4320Hz, and beyond.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1008px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:172.42%;"><img id="Euf9ppPybGmybnjtG9p9hD" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pwm-measurement-100.jpg" alt="The PWM rate of the Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL at 100% brightness" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Euf9ppPybGmybnjtG9p9hD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1008" height="1738" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">It doesn't get any worse for your eyes than this display. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this brightness, Google is not even close to complying with the recommended <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1789/4479/">IEEE PAR 1789 standard</a> for displays and lighting.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-pro-hardware-performance"><span>Google Pixel 9 Pro: Hardware & performance</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TzbPJGZazXSa6yPQ2gCknn" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-pixel-8-pro-pixel-7-pro-back-2.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with Pixel 8 Pro and 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TzbPJGZazXSa6yPQ2gCknn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thanks to the onslaught of Pixel 9 leaks that we saw leading up to the official unveiling, my expectations about performance were quickly tempered. I was hoping that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> would end up putting Google&apos;s flagship phones alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and iPhone, but it just wasn&apos;t meant to be.</p><p>That&apos;s not to say the G4 isn&apos;t performant, but it&apos;s still not quite on the same level as some of its competition. I&apos;m keeping my fingers crossed that this will change with the Tensor G5, but I digress.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8" name="google-tensor-g4-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G4 on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In day-to-day usage, I came away quite impressed with how well the Pixel kept up with whatever I needed to do. There were times that I wanted to reach for either the Pixel 9 Pro Fold or Galaxy Z Fold 6, but that kind of defeats the purpose.</p>

<p>With practically every new device that I get, whether it&apos;s for review or for myself, I want to try and see how well it performs with emulation. This is one area where Google&apos;s Tensor chips just can&apos;t hold a candle to Qualcomm.</p><p>Using something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> for emulation is a dream, but that&apos;s largely because of the support for Snapdragon chips with Adreno GPUs. If you come across graphical glitches and errors, there&apos;s a good chance that you can find and use a different GPU driver, provided that your emulator is compatible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sJ2RxA4EU4ZBR5qQ9Npqk8" name="switch-emulation-pixel-9-pro-xl-2.jpg" alt="Switch Emulation on Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sJ2RxA4EU4ZBR5qQ9Npqk8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s not so much the case with MediaTek and Google&apos;s Tensor chips, which make use of Mali GPUs. However, I have noticed that community support for custom Mali drivers is beginning to increase. Nevertheless, it still hasn&apos;t resulted in stability and performance gains that can rival phones using a Snapdragon SoC.</p><p>The point that I&apos;m trying to make is that while I was able to load up a few Switch games, it&apos;s not an enjoyable experience. Framerates are unstable, constantly dropping as soon as you get to a graphically intensive area. And there are some games that just won&apos;t load at all, even if you manage to find a custom GPU driver.</p><p>In order to put this into better perspective, I defaulted to Geekbench 6, just to provide something a bit more substantive.</p>

<p>As you can see, the Pixel 9 Pro XL simply can&apos;t come close to competing with either the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 or Apple&apos;s A17 Pro. Mind you that isn&apos;t even Apple&apos;s latest chip, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-apple-or-google">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and Pro Max are powered by the A18 Pro. However, at the time of this review, I have yet to get my hands on the new iPhone, which is why it&apos;s not included in the table above.</p><p>While those numbers might seem a bit disappointing, it&apos;s not actually anything that you&apos;re going to notice on a daily basis. Potential issues and limitations won&apos;t crop up until you try and push the phone to the extremes. Which isn&apos;t something I suspect many people are doing on a regular basis. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-pro-battery-life"><span>Google Pixel 9 Pro: Battery life</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JnfckBzVEHyPHreXakGZ2m" name="battery-settings-on-pixel-9-pro-xl.jpg" alt="Battery screen on Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JnfckBzVEHyPHreXakGZ2m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is what blew me away more than literally anything else about Google&apos;s latest phones. As it turns out, Google&apos;s inability to make the performance leap in the Tensor paid dividends in other ways, the largest of which seems to be battery life.</p><p>As I&apos;ve mentioned a few times, I took the Pixel 9 Pro XL with me on a trip to New York and figured it would be the best time to see how well it could hold up. Oh boy, it did so much better than I ever could have thought.</p><p>The first day kicked off at 6:30 a.m. and consisted of getting from my house to the airport, flying to the city, getting to the hotel, and then to an event, before coming back to the room shortly before midnight. Even with all of that, I still had yet to dip below 20% and I just couldn&apos;t believe it.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I'm constantly blown way with how long the Pixel 9 Pro XL lasts without needing to be recharged.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Across the entire three-day trip, I never once felt nervous or worried about running out of juice. That includes spending one day walking around New York City for the purpose of taking camera samples for this review. A day that ended with me taking a spur-of-the-moment trip to Yankee Stadium for the first time to see my beloved Orioles take on the Yankees.</p><p>Much like the Geekbench test results in the previous section, I&apos;m trying to provide something a bit more solid than just "battery is gud." With that being said, I opted for a good old video playback battery test. Here is how I had everything set up:</p>

<p>Then, I just fired up a 4K HDR video on YouTube and let it keep playing for the duration of the test. Below, you can see the battery percentages, which were recorded every hour at the same time:</p>

<p>After the first couple of hours, the trend became obvious, draining at a clip of 10% for four hours, and 9% in the last hour. This is after the 12% and 13% drop in the first two hours. It&apos;s almost like the phone kind of settled into a groove, so to speak, and was just coasting for as long as possible.</p><p>At that rate, the phone would have lasted for another three to four hours, running out of steam between 8:15 and 8:45. Of course, I could have gotten the 9 Pro XL to last much longer once Extreme Battery Saver mode kicked in.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It was weird seeing the rate of battery drain settle into a pattern. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Our parent company, Future PLC, runs lab tests via the Future Labs department and found that it took an average of 13 hours to run down the battery on the Pixel 9 Pro and the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Comparatively, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> died after just 9 hours of running the same test. Clearly, Google wasn&apos;t kidding when they said Tensor G4&apos;s efficiency was better.</p><p>I&apos;ve been using these phones for a few weeks now, and it&apos;s the first time in a long time that I haven&apos;t felt the need to enable the ability to see the battery percentage in the status bar.</p>
<p>In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 hands-on</a>, we talked about the new charging speeds for the phones and even was able to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-45w-usb-c-power-charger-snow/6587825.p?skuId=6587825">Google&apos;s new 45W charger</a>. While that charger is great for topping up the battery quickly from 0% to about 50% in under 30 minutes, a full charge isn&apos;t any faster than the Pixel 8 series — and charging the phone when it&apos;s above 50% battery level results in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-charging-speed">much slower charge</a> than you might expect.</p>

<p>There are a few things that I look for when it comes to testing out different phone cameras — speed, a telephoto lens, and how a photo looks without edits. Speed is definitely subjective, but if I try and take a picture of my dog before she gets distracted by something, that plays a role. So does being able to switch between the different modes without needing to do too much tinkering.</p><p>I feel like I&apos;m in the minority as someone who would much prefer having a telescope camera as opposed to an ultrawide one. But thankfully, the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have both, so it&apos;s not a concern.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fh74GxgsiaGa2xxK5wsmb7" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-iphone-15-pro-max-3.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with iPhone 15 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fh74GxgsiaGa2xxK5wsmb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly is speed. There are times when I&apos;ll snap a bunch of RAW photos to manually edit them later. More often than not, I don&apos;t want to think twice about it, and just want my phone to take a good picture.</p><p>Thankfully, the Pixel 9 Pro and XL check all of these boxes. In fact, Google <em>probably</em> produces my favorite pictures out of any device that I own or have owned. This includes the iPhone and Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p>

<p>While my iPhone is still faster at taking regular JPG pictures, there&apos;s just something off about the color balance of my eyes. I&apos;m sure I could remedy this, but again, it&apos;s something that I don&apos;t want to have to think about. Pull the phone out and take a picture. With an almost-eight-month-old little boy trying to run around, speed and quality are the name of the game.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve come to appreciate the "flow" of taking a picture to pull it up in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> or having it automatically added to an album. There&apos;s no fiddling to be had unless I choose to do so. Even then, unless I&apos;m using Reimagine, editing a picture takes just a few taps.</p>

<p>When it comes to the Android software experience, I prefer Samsung&apos;s "kitchen sink" approach to features. However, nothing beats Google&apos;s aesthetics, and it continues to shine with the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>For the most part, it&apos;s the same experience you would have if you were coming from the Pixel 8 Pro. The biggest difference now comes in the form of the various AI features Google has introduced.</p><p>But here&apos;s the thing — I barely use them and have found little reason to.

<p>But there were times when Gemini would try to use Imagen to generate a picture itself, defeating the purpose of using Reimagine. I did find that either opening a new Gemini chat or reusing the initial prompt would give me what I was looking for.</p><p>It&apos;s great having this variety of options to enjoy the fruits of Gemini&apos;s labors. I suspect it will continue to improve, especially considering that Google is releasing updates on what appears to be a monthly cadence.</p><p>What I&apos;ve talked about doesn&apos;t even take into account the multimodality functionality of Gemini Nano. With the Pixel 9 series, Gemini Nano can now recognize text, voice, and image input. This is part of the reason why Google increased the RAM from 12GB to 16GB on the Pro models, as about 3GB of that is reserved for Gemini.</p>

<p>One thing that did come as a bit of a surprise was seeing that Google&apos;s latest devices didn&apos;t actually ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">the latest version of Android</a>. In years past, a new version of Android would be released, and then new phones would be introduced. This time, Google opted for something completely different, and I&apos;m not exactly sure how it will play out in the long run.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing to worry about when the last update will arrive, but it&apos;s still left me scratching my head. Perhaps this is just a "blip" on the radar, as rumors suggest Google could release <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-codename-sooner-launch-speculation">Android 16</a> in Q2 2025, as opposed to Q3 or Q4. Doing so would ensure that the new version of Android is ready in time for the next crop of Pixel phones.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UCWDgrL9gjjvGiK6EakeMh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-vs-OnePlus-12-back-02.jpg" alt="Comparing the OnePlus 12 to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UCWDgrL9gjjvGiK6EakeMh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s biggest competition in the U.S. is both Samsung and Apple, and both companies offer phones with faster processors and displays with better PWM rates. The Galaxy S24 series is promised to deliver the same seven years of software updates as the Pixel 9 series, and given the gulf in performance between Google and Samsung&apos;s phones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">any Galaxy S24 model</a> will likely last longer without feeling sluggish like the Pixel 9 eventually will.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for an even better display and crazy fast charging speeds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> does it all while costing even less than a Pixel 9 Pro. OnePlus only offers four years of software and OS updates, but you may not plan to hold on to your phone for more than that, so it&apos;s probably an OK trade-off. There&apos;s also the fact that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> are probably just a few months away.</p><p>Of course, none of these phones come with those nifty Pixel-exclusive features like call screening, VPN, Pixel Studio, and others. Plus, as I&apos;ve covered many times, Pixels take the best photos of kids and pets and now even have great features like Add Me that offer even more interesting photography options. And, unlike Samsung or OnePlus, The Pixel 9 Pro family gives you a choice of phone size without losing features or camera prowess.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>Google Pixel 9 Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ppx2XnXUjksHgLDqz4RePJ" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-10.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL angled view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ppx2XnXUjksHgLDqz4RePJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You have pets or kids that you take lots of pictures of.</li><li>You love Google's clever AI features and Pixel exclusives like call screening.</li><li>You like to keep your phones for years before updating.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You should not buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You play lots of mobile games.</li><li>You want faster charging or more storage at a lower price.</li><li>You're sensitive to light flicker or displays that use low-Hz PWM dimming.</li></ul>
<p>Over the years, Google has figured out clever ways to differentiate its Pixel line from other phones in meaningful ways. Pixel-exclusive features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-call-screen-feature-pixel">Call Screening</a>, advanced spam detection, and Pixel VPN have been mainstays of the line for years, while new Pixel-exclusive features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio</a>, and camera modes like Add Me are sure to make your friends and family jealous.</p><p>However, there&apos;s an underlying upfront value problem that continues to grow. Pixel is once again $100 more than the previous year. Tensor is still slower than other competing processors and heats up more quickly than those, too. Google hasn&apos;t improved its display dimming rate as other companies have, and the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is problematic for some people, too.</p><p>Thankfully, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-deals-pixel-9-pro-discounts">Pixel 9 deals</a> will often get you the phone for next to nothing as Google tries to expand its reach globally and get more Pixels into more people&apos;s hands. It doesn&apos;t make up for some of the other problems the phone has, but it&apos;s easy to give Pixel a shot and see if all those amazing exclusive features and apps are more important to you than raw performance or charging speed. Plus, being able to choose a size without losing important features is finally a reality.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S10 Ultra is a modest upgrade over its predecessor, and other than an anti-reflective coating, it has the same 14.6-inch AMOLED panel as last year. The switch to MediaTek hardware is interesting, and it holds up against the best that Qualcomm has to offer. You also get Galaxy AI and long-term software updates, and plenty of custom software features designed to maximize the real estate. That said, the tablet is being sold at a hefty premium, and if you want to get a decent value, you should consider picking up another Android tablet instead.</p></p>

<p>The OnePlus Pad 2 is my favorite Android tablet; it doesn't have an AMOLED panel, but the IPS LCD screen is terrific in its own right, and it holds up incredibly well for consuming content.

Coming in at less than half the price of the Tab S10 Ultra, this is the obvious choice if you need a new tablet.</p></p>

<p>Just like the internal hardware itself, Samsung didn&apos;t make many changes to the external design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>, and the tablet looks nearly identical to its predecessor. That means you get flat sides and rounded edges, and I don&apos;t really like the design. The flat sides make it uncomfortable to hold and use the tablet, and you&apos;ll need to use it with a case, adding to the heft and weight.</p><p>The tablet has an aluminum mid-frame along with an aluminum back, and it uses the same alloy as the Galaxy S24 Ultra, giving it a decent amount of rigidity. Samsung continues to deliver IP68 dust and water resistance on the tablet, and that is a major differentiator.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tjMMRAY28X3My6QE4LDUWa" name="oneplus-pad-2-5.jpg" alt="OnePlus Pad 2 back view highlighting metal chassis" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tjMMRAY28X3My6QE4LDUWa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-is-my-favorite-android-tablet">OnePlus Pad 2</a>, meanwhile, has a much better design with flowing sides and edges, and it is significantly easier to handle. It doesn&apos;t have ingress protection and is sold in a single color option, but it has a sturdy aluminum chassis, and I don&apos;t have any issues with the build quality.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VufeKJJPRoheUGJwAPGQWW" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hdr-video-playback.jpg" alt="HDR video playback on Galaxy AI key on Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VufeKJJPRoheUGJwAPGQWW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming in at 718g, the Tab S10 Ultra is one of the heaviest Android tablets around, and a major contributing factor is the 14.6-inch panel. Samsung is using the same AMOLED panel as last year, but the tablet now gets an anti-reflective coating, and that&apos;s good to see. The panel itself is among the best you&apos;ll find on any tablet today — only the iPad Pro 13 has a better OLED screen.</p><p>The gargantuan AMOLED panel has outstanding color vibrancy, and is a delight to use. The Pad 2 misses out on OLED tech, and instead uses a 12.1-inch IPS LCD panel that goes up to 144Hz. While it doesn&apos;t have the same great contrast or color accuracy, it gets bright in daily use, and holds up incredibly well for streaming content. HDR content in particular shines on the tablet, and Dolby Vision integration is an added bonus.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Samsung sided with MediaTek with this generation, and the Tab S10 Ultra is powered by the Dimensity 9300+. While I don&apos;t have the tablet on hand yet, I tested the Dimensity 9300+ in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review">Xiaomi 14T Pro review</a>, and the key takeaway is that it is better than Qualcomm&apos;s offering at multi-core workloads.</p><p>That&apos;s because MediaTek is using Cortex X4 cores instead of the usual A720 cores to do a bulk of the heavy lifting, and it gives the Dimensity 9300+ a slender edge. Qualcomm still has the lead when it comes to the GPU, but what&apos;s clear is that MediaTek is intent on bridging that division.</p>

<p>Coming back to the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, there shouldn&apos;t be any issues with the hardware itself in daily use, but again, I&apos;ll confirm that once I actually test the tablet. Thankfully, I used the OnePlus Pad 2 for the better part of a month, and I didn&apos;t run into any issues whatsoever. The Pad 2 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it is a powerhouse; it handles demanding games with ease, and there are zero slowdowns in regular use.</p><p>Overheating isn&apos;t an issue on the Pad 2 either, and it is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> you can get at the moment. The only major omission is cellular connectivity — OnePlus still doesn&apos;t have a cellular model, and you can&apos;t add a SIM card to the Pad 2.</p>

<p>Both tablets have 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage as standard, and the Tab S10 Ultra is configurable with up to 1TB of storage. The Pad 2 is available in a single variant, and it doesn&apos;t have a MicroSD slot, a standard feature on Samsung&apos;s tablet.</p><p>The Tab S10 Ultra also has a larger 11200mAh battery, but it still relies on 45W charging. The Pad 2 has a 9510mAh battery, and the 67W charging tech does a better job in this regard. The Pad 2 has standout battery life, and this hasn&apos;t been an issue at all in the month I used it.</p>

<p>Samsung has a clear edge on the software front thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and all the custom features it added to its tablets over the years. DeX is another major differentiator, and you don&apos;t quite get the same feature on any other manufacturer&apos;s tablets. With Galaxy AI, you get a similar feature-set as Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>, including AI Note Assist, Sketch to Image, real-time translation, and much more.</p><p>Another advantage to the Tab S10 Ultra is long-term updates; it will pick up the same seven Android OS updates as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">S24 Ultra</a>, and that&apos;s great to see. Samsung doesn&apos;t quite delver software updates to its tablets at the same time as phones, but the fact that you get updates all the way through 2031 is a huge deal.</p><p>OnePlus is also doing better on the software side of things, but the Pad 2 doesn&apos;t have much in the way of AI-assisted features. What I like is the unique multitasking mode, and the software finally has useful extras that take advantage of the 12.1-inch panel. The Pad 2 won&apos;t get as many software updates as the Tab S10 Ultra, but it will pick up four Android OS updates.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is retailing for a hefty $1,199, with the OnePlus Pad 2 available at a much more reasonable $549. Yes, the Tab S10 Ultra has a larger screen and uses AMOLED tech, and that gives it much better color vibrancy. You also get IP68 ingress protection, all the AI features that Samsung offers on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and the same software update guarantee.</p><p>But is that worth twice the asking price of the Pad 2? No — it just isn&apos;t. If you need an Android tablet with powerful hardware that&apos;s designed for consuming content and playing games, the Pad 2 is a terrific choice. While it doesn&apos;t have an AMOLED panel, the LCD screen is plenty great in its own right, and it even has Dolby Vision integration.</p><p>If you don&apos;t care about the asking price and want an Android tablet with a vibrant AMOLED panel, then the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is the way to go. But if you&apos;re looking to maximize value and need something that&apos;s almost as good — but costs less than half as much — I recommend picking up the OnePlus Pad 2.</p>

<p>OPPO has been drip-feeding hints about its upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>, and now a company executive reveals that the devices can get rid of annoying reflections in your photos.</p><p>OPPO&apos;s Find series product manager, Zhou Yibao, shared on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/OzPyD5dOI" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that the Find X8 series will feature reflection removal for your photos, and unsurprisingly, it&apos;s all powered by AI (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_find_x8_series_will_remove_reflections_from_your_pictures-news-64783.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>In a demo, Zhou highlighted a cultural artifact from the Chengdu Museum in China. While the original photo looked great, it had a noticeable reflection on the artifact&apos;s surface that distracted from its beauty.</p><p>But once the AI imaging feature was applied, the reflection vanished, leaving behind a clean, crystal-clear image.</p><p>To further show off how well this new feature works, Zhou asked his social media followers to post pictures with reflections. He then demonstrated how the device effortlessly gets rid of those pesky elements, as you can see in the visuals he shared.</p>

<p>Zhou explained that this feature is made for those moments when reflections and glare mess up your photos. Think of times like capturing an aerial view through a plane window or pretty views while riding a train.</p><p>Although reflection removal tech isn’t brand new, it started getting noticed when Huawei showcased it back in 2020. It wasn’t until Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-object-eraser-can-now-automatically-erase-shadows-and-reflections">added this feature to its S22 series</a>, though, that it really took off and caught everyone’s attention.</p><p>Still, it’s a fantastic addition to the Find X8 series, letting you nail that perfect shot through airplane windows or office glass.</p><p>Now that OPPO is embracing a reflection removal feature, you can bet other Chinese smartphone brands will hop on the train and add it to their lineups, too.</p><p>On top of that, the Find X8 series is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-and-x8-pro-specs-leak">gearing up for some impressive hardware upgrades</a>, featuring a 10x periscope camera that outdoes the 6x zoom from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>. Plus, the rear camera module is expected to have a unique square design with rounded edges.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube detailed what's coming up for Shorts, beginning with an option to record three-minute-long videos.</li><li>Shorts will soon display a "template" icon, so creators can quickly hop on the latest trends with their unique touch.</li><li>Other Shorts updates include customization for the Home feed, community engagement, and Veo's AI assistance for "later this year."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>October is looking like the month for Shorts as YouTube details what&apos;s coming up for its short-form content.</p><p>YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/tall-updates-coming-to-shorts/">highlighted several updates</a> arriving for Shorts later this month, beginning with longer videos. Starting on October 15, content creators can craft Shorts up to 3 minutes long. This longer duration for Shorts pertains to videos that feature a square "or taller" aspect ratio.</p><p>It&apos;s worth remembering that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-takes-aim-at-tiktok-with-these-new-reels-features">Instagram&apos;s Reels</a> can reach a maximum of 90 seconds (a minute and a half), so YouTube will have that beat by 30 seconds. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/camera-tools#:~:text=Videos%20you%20record%20in%20TikTok%20can%20be%20up%20to%2010%20minutes%20long.">TikTok lets its users</a> record 10-minute-long videos in the app<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>YouTube&apos;s Shorts update also includes new templates. The post states users can find templates after tapping "Remix" on a Short they enjoy. "Use this template" will let you take a trend or a sound clip and use that in your creation.</p><p>Speaking of following trends, YouTube teases that there&apos;s more in store for "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-remix-music-video-rollout">Remix</a>" regarding videos and music videos from the platform. "In the coming months," the post states creators can pull "multiple clips" from a variety of sources across YouTube and plug them into a single Short.</p><p>Customization is preparing to hit YouTube&apos;s primary home feed on mobile. Shorts are everywhere, and often in these two-by-two boxes. The platform states it will introduce a "Show fewer Shorts" option inside the three-dot menu of a Shorts suggestion box.</p><p>Be advised: YouTube states it will show fewer Shorts "temporarily" on your Home feed if you hit that option.</p><p>The company is also looking to drive more engagement between communities and the activities that trend via Shorts. According to the post, pausing a Short will display a new option in the top row called "Trends." This opens a dedicated Shorts Trending page, where users can find what&apos;s new and catching viewers&apos; attention.</p><p>Additionally, Google is adding a comment section preview in the Shorts feed, showing how others feel about a Short without having to open the section.</p>

<p>Today&apos;s post reiterated an announcement during September&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/made-by-youtube-2024-ai-hype-updates">Made by YouTube event</a> involving Google&apos;s AI model Veo. The AI software is a video-generation model featuring an "advanced understanding of natural language and visual semantics." YouTube stated Veo&apos;s inclusion on the platform would come to the benefit of Shorts.</p><p>Now, the company states Veo will arrive "later this year" with its AI generation tools. Such options will let users create backgrounds and produce unique concepts that might&apos;ve been far too difficult without Veo&apos;s assistance. However, it&apos;s worth noting that any usage of Veo will result in a "generated with AI" content label on your Short.</p>

<p>Smart rings are all the rage these days as more and more companies step into the ring (so to speak) with their own takes on the wearable tech. For some time, Oura was the only big player with its well-received Oura Ring Gen 3, but other smaller companies have since created their own models that have caught our attention. We even got a major player to join the fray, with the Galaxy Ring making a splash in 2024.</p><p>A smart ring can be used as a standalone health monitoring wearable, meant to track your heart rate, blood oxygen, sleep, body temperature, and even some exercises. They can be used on their own or in tandem with a smartwatch; although your mileage may vary as you may end up with duplicate data, smart rings are meant to be a low-maintenance and distraction-free way to keep track of your health. There&apos;s no screen, and everything is tracked passively in the background, with minimal interaction with the actual ring.</p><p>So, which smart ring is right for you? We&apos;ve reviewed a number of smart rings already, which you can check out for yourself in this guide, but we&apos;ll also include some honorable mentions that we haven&apos;t tested yet.</p><p>And with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">October Prime Day sales event</a> right around the corner, we&apos;ll be on the lookout for best smart ring deals so you can save a few bucks.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring (Gen 3)</a> has been available for a few years now, but it is undeniably still the king of the smart ring. After a fairly rough start, with the ring still missing many promised features, Oura has been on a roll, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-resilience-metric-tracks-stress-recovery">adding new features every year</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-natural-cycles-partnership">partnering with other companies</a> to bring more capabilities to the ring.</p><p>Sleep tracking is one of its strong points, which is great since some people prefer not to wear smartwatches to sleep. Thanks to its snug fit on your finger, the Oura Ring is great at tracking sleep, determining what stages you&apos;re in throughout the night, and logging any detected movements. Sleep tracking is quite detailed, and while there&apos;s no sleep apnea detection, it provides enough information to help users self-diagnose.</p><p>Beyond sleep tracking, the Oura Ring can automatically detect certain activities, such as running, gardening, and even dancing. Yes, dancing. In the years that I&apos;ve used the ring, I&apos;m always surprised to see it ping my phone after a party, asking if I had been dancing at a certain time. Thanks to its accelerometer, it can be surprisingly intuitive, although it&apos;s not perfect.</p><p>The Oura Ring monitors your temperature, which can help detect illnesses or even track menstrual cycles. All this information adds to your Readiness score, which will help you determine how ready you are for the day and what you can do to improve your daily readiness. The best part is that Oura syncs with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> and apps like Strava. Plus, it lasts a full week on a single charge, meaning you rarely have to remember to charge it.</p><p>Unfortunately, to get the most out of the Oura Ring experience, you&apos;ll have to subscribe to a membership. It only costs about $6 a month, but it&apos;s still an extra financial burden you&apos;ll have to take into account.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring (Gen 3) review</a></p>

<p>RingConn is a relatively unknown company, but its products are surprisingly solid. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Gen 2</a> launched in 2024, and while it&apos;s mostly similar to its predecessor, it comes with some welcome additions that make it a great option if you&apos;re looking for a smart ring that doesn&apos;t come with a subscription.</p><p>Where most smart rings go for a circular design, the RingConn Gen 2 has a squircle shape, which looks rather fresh. And even with how glossy the silver model I tested is, the finish doesn&apos;t scratch or scuff nearly as easily as the Oura Ring, which is a plus for people who like to work out or perform other activities with their ring on.</p><p>Another thing the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring has going for itself is battery life. Lasting as long as 12 days, you can go nearly two weeks without worrying about charging it, and when you do, you can use the charging case that you can also carry around (although it&apos;s too big for most pockets).</p><p>The app experience is pretty intuitive, providing easy-to-read visual representations of your daily progress compared to the day before, as well as your various health metrics. You&apos;ll also enjoy the timeline feature that logs various events that you can easily track. The ring can track certain workouts, but it doesn&apos;t do it automatically, and the options are limited.</p><p>Sleep tracking is one of the ring&apos;s strong points, as it is capable of sleep apnea monitoring, which should help users who worry that they might suffer from the condition or help those that do keep track of any improvements. Unfortunately, this drains the battery quite a bit.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring review</a></p>

<p>Amazfit makes some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> on the market, so it only made sense for the company to launch its own smart ring. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Amazfit Helio Ring</a> is a decent first effort, and while it falls short on some features, the company makes up for it with a good design and some compelling health and fitness features. Plus, it looks like the Amazfit is welcoming feedback and making changes accordingly, which is a very good sign.</p><p>The Helio Ring features a very sturdy design, which, in my use, felt like the most durable option out of the smart rings I&apos;ve tested. While there&apos;s only one finish, the brushed metal actually fares well when wearing the ring during workouts, which is more than I can say for the Oura Ring.</p><p>While Amazfit says there&apos;s no automatic workout detection, the ring does passively log certain activity types in the calorie section of the app, which I find interesting. It tells me if I was on a "light walk" or doing a "light activity," or if I was walking faster than usual, it would say as much. However, these aren&apos;t logged as workouts like the app would do with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch">Amazfit smartwatch</a>.</p><p>Speaking of, the Helio Ring is best used with an Amazfit smartwatch. This is because the ring can&apos;t log many workout types on its own, so the Amazfit app uses AI to merge data from both the ring and watch to give you a comprehensive view of your day. You can also choose to <em>only</em> collect heart rate data from the ring if you prefer.</p><p>The downside is that you would need to purchase a separate device to take advantage of these features. Additionally, the Amazfit Helio Ring has the shortest battery life of smart rings we&apos;ve tested at just four days. Still, since reviewing the Helio Ring, Amazfit has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-gets-permanent-price-drop-and-free-subscriptions">dropped the price of the ring</a>, added a new size (bringing it to three), and got rid of its subscriptions, meaning you can take advantage of all its features for free.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Amazfit Helio Ring</a></p>

<p>Smartwatches aren&apos;t the most comfortable when it comes to sleep tracking, which is where smart rings like the Ultrahuman Ring Air come in. This smart ring has a comfortable design that makes it easy to wear all day and night, ensuring you can get the full range of your health metrics when you&apos;re awake or asleep.</p><p>When it comes to sleep tracking, the Ultrahuman Ring Air not only provides insights into your sleep stages throughout the night, but it also tells you how well you slept based on factors like your body temperature, restfulness, efficiency, and more. The ring will even track your "Tosses and Turns," which can also provide insights into your sleep quality and the impact that stress or other factors may have.</p><p>The ring also takes how much you&apos;ve slept into account with a Sleep Debt feature. This establishes a baseline for you based on your patterns and calculates the difference between this and the amount of sleep you&apos;ve actually received. This is a good way to know if you&apos;ve fallen behind and need to take time to catch up on your sleep by getting in a nap.</p><p>In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air review</a>, Android Central senior editor Michael Hicks says the ring provided him with actionable data for a concerning metric that he would have otherwise ignored since he does not like wearing smartwatches to bed. To him, this makes the ring worth the initial high price.</p><p>Aside from sleep tracking, the Ultrahuman Ring Air also comes with up to six days of battery life, which is pretty respectable, and some workout tracking. It will also be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-adds-afib-new-app-store-of-powerplugs">first smart ring with AFib detection</a>, which is a big deal. However, Hicks says that you may become annoyed with the flurry of notifications, and the step tracking is fairly unreliable.

<p>Samsung is probably the biggest name to enter the smart ring game, and while the Galaxy Ring is far from perfect, it has the benefit of being part of the Galaxy ecosystem. As such, the ring connects to Samsung Health and utilizes Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> to provide insights into your health via a sleep score and readiness score.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring has automatic workout detection, something you don&apos;t find on too many smart rings, although it&apos;s pretty limited. You also have get a sleep score based on your sleep quality, and when combined with your other activities and metrics, the Samsung Health app will provide you a Wellness Score. The app uses Galaxy AI to analyze your metrics and suggest ways you can improve them. However, the ring goes beyond just health tracking.</p><p>Samsung is the only major smartphone manufacturer to have a smart ring, so it makes sense for the company to figure out a clever way to make the most out of this. That&apos;s where gestures come in, which allow you to control certain functions on your phone by performing certain movements with your finger. So, by just pinching your designated ring finger with your thumb twice, you can utilize remote capture functions with the camera. You can also snooze alarms without touching your phone.</p><p>In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring review</a>, Android Central senior editor Nick Sutrich notes that these are cool features, but they only work for very specific circumstances and are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-samsung-galaxy-ring-features-are-exclusive-to-samsung-phones">limited to Samsung phones</a>.

You also get "medals" based on certain activities or milestones that you hit, which is pretty motivational.</p><p>While most smart rings start at $299, the RingConn Smart Ring is available for $279, which is kind of a steal when you consider there&apos;s no subscription involved, meaning you&apos;ll have access to all the available features.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ring lacks certain features I&apos;d love to see, such as automatic workout detection and support for Health Connect (although Google Fit is supported). The available workout modes are also fairly limited, but the ring supports major ones like running, cycling, and the treadmill.</p><p>If you won&apos;t want to spring for the more expensive Gen 2 Smart Ring, the first-gen is worth the spend.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-smart-ring-review">RingConn Smart Ring review</a></p>

<p>The above options are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to smart rings. There are many other offerings out there, including some we have not yet tested but hope to.

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h2>
<p>So with the growing number of smart rings out there, how do you know which one is right for you?</p><p>First, you should know what kinds of features you&apos;re looking for. Most smart rings come with the basics, such as heart rate tracking, blood oxygen, sleep monitoring, and temperature sensing. However, you have to look at the extra health tracking features these rings offer and how the data is being used. For example, the Oura Ring and Evie Ring use metrics such as temperature sensing to help track menstrual cycles, which could be beneficial to those who experience periods.</p><p>If you want to use the ring to track workout data and aid with recovery, you&apos;ll want a ring that is not only well-built with good water resistance but also features automatic tracking, meaning you&apos;re spending less time looking at your phone. The Oura Ring, Galaxy Ring, and Amazfit Helio Ring all feature this to some extent (and at differing levels).</p><p>Price is a big factor when choosing a smart ring. They cost roughly as much as a smartwatch but can be priced even higher. Sometimes, the upfront cost can seem unwieldy, but in most cases, that&apos;s the only price you&apos;ll pay. In other cases, like with Oura, you&apos;ll also have to consider the monthly subscription cost, which is admittedly fairly low at $6 per month, but it&apos;s still something to consider.</p><p>Lastly, you may want to consider if you want to buy a smart ring to replace or supplement your smartwatch. Smart rings come with a lot of health tracking features, but their functionality is somewhat limited compared to a smartwatch. On the other hand, they&apos;re much less distracting and good at capturing the main metrics, including heart rate and sleep. Some rings, like the Galaxy Ring and Helio Ring, will merge data from smartwatches of the same brand, which helps give you a better overview of your health. Some rings, like the Oura Ring, can also sync with Health Connect or Apple Health, which is also helpful in this regard.</p>

<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Why you can trust Android Central</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">☑️ One of the <strong>oldest and most trusted</strong> Android sites on the web<br>☑️ Over <strong>15 years</strong> of product testing<br>☑️ <strong>Thousands </strong>of products reviewed and tested since 2007<br>☑️ <strong>Dozens</strong> of wearables<strong> </strong>tested every year by our team</p></div></div>
<p>Smart rings are relatively new to the scene, but we have started reviewing them in 2021. Like all other products we test, from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> to smartwatches, we typically spend a couple of weeks with the devices before we give our final thoughts on it. Sometimes, we&apos;ll publish an initial review with early impressions up to a week after we receive a product, then test it for an additional few weeks before publishing the full review. This way, you can be sure you&apos;re getting our full experience with a product.</p><p>We will wear the ring and go about our normal routines, for the most part. That includes exercising or running errands so that the ring can capture as much data throughout the day and night. We may also test multiple rings at the same time if we want to compare how they capture metrics such as step counts (using a manual step counter), heart rate (starting and stopping workouts at the same time), and more.</p><p>Testing a smart ring for a couple of weeks at a time also ensures that we can evaluate the battery life and charging speed, as these devices often last for up to a week or more on a single charge.</p><p>No product is perfect, and we remain honest in all of our reviews. A product may get a high rating but may not be perfect for everyone, or it may get a low score but still have some redeeming qualities that some potential buyers may like. We try to keep this in mind when reviewing smart rings, and this is reflected in our reviews.</p>

<p>Anker's latest upgrade does it all: folding prongs for great portability, a 30W charging maximum, and a smart chip inside this GaN charger to ensure your phone, smartwatch, or tablet is getting the <strong>right</strong> wattage at all times. It's also <em>tiny,</em> at 70% reduced size compared to the original Anker 30W charger.</p></p>

<h2 id="of-charging-speeds-ports-and-cables-how-to-pick-the-best-phone-charger-2">Of charging speeds, ports, and cables: How to pick the best phone charger</h2>
<p>There are a lot of features and priorities to try and juggle when picking the fastest phone charger, but here&apos;s the easiest way to narrow down your search quickly: How many devices do you <strong>need</strong> to charge at one time? If you only need something to plug your phone into the wall, grab the Anker 511 Nano 3 or Samsung 45W USB-C Fast Charger and get on with your day. Both are super-small and durable, and they should last you through at least two phones, so long as you don&apos;t yeet &apos;em out a window or step on one accidentally. Anker has color choices and foldable prongs, while Samsung throws in a cable, so both are winners.</p><p>But what about if you consistently need to charge your phone and laptop? What if you need to charge your phone and your smartwatch? Are there any music addicts like me who need to recharge their earbuds every night? That&apos;s where a great charger with two or more ports changes the game. The four-port 120W charger from Spigen and any of UGREEN&apos;s multi-ported Nexode chargers are good options with plenty of ports and power to charge a laptop, phone, tablet, and Bluetooth speaker simultaneously.</p><p>Don&apos;t buy an overpowered charger unless you have devices that support that charging speed. For example, a 65W USB-C charger is wasted on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, because it only supports a top speed of 45W. Of course, the same doesn&apos;t apply if you plan on using the same charger to top up your laptop and phone. All laptops and Chromebooks that charge via USB-C require at least 65W chargers or higher.</p><p>Next, make sure you check your phone&apos;s charging profile and match it with the charger you buy. Luckily, brands like Anker, UGREEN, and Baseus always add support for Apple, Samsung, and Google&apos;s fast-charging profiles. If you don&apos;t ensure this, your phone might not get the max possible charging speed even if the wattage on the charger, the cable, and your phone match.</p><p>And speaking of cables, not all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cables</a> are created equal. Be sure to grab a 5A or higher USB-C cable for chargers over 60W. Likewise, you need 100W USB-C cables for 100W chargers. Without the right cable, you might not be able to tap into your phone or laptop&apos;s maximum possible wired charging speed.</p>
<h2 id="invest-in-a-powerful-usb-c-power-bank-2">Invest in a powerful USB-C power bank</h2>
<p>While expanding your charging collection, consider that a wall charger can&apos;t do you any good if there&apos;s nowhere to plug in while you&apos;re walking around a theme park or stuck in economy on a cross-country flight. Instead, a good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-portable-power-packs" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-portable-power-packs">power bank</a> is the perfect companion to your new wall charger, and reliable USB-C power banks have never been more affordable. They&apos;re a great way to top up any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>!</p><p>In my travel backpack, I always bring along a wall charger with multiple ports (both USB-C and USB-A) and several charging banks. Don&apos;t forget: you&apos;ll need a port on that handy wall charger to power up the charging bank, too! The bottom line is to invest sufficiently in the fastest phone charger money to buy to get the most use out of it.</p>

<ul><li>Spotify detailed the launch of "Offline Backup," a feature that piggybacks off the stored cache data of your music to operate.</li><li>Offline Backup is a playlist on your "Home" tab that collects your music data from your recently played to give you tunes if your signal drops.</li><li>This update is rolling out on Android and iOS and joins Spotify's recent AI Playlist.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Spotify&apos;s rolling out a feature for mobile users that should make that loss of service a little more bearable.</p><p>Hitting the town often comes with the risk of losing cell service, which is what Spotify aims to solve in today&apos;s update. As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-10-03/offline-backup-keeps-the-music-going-when-your-connection-goes-missing/">Newsroom post</a>, mobile users are beginning to receive "Offline Backup," a feature that compiles your music into a playlist ready to go without cell service. Spotify states this feature will appear on the "Home" tab whenever you&apos;ve gone offline.</p><p>Tapping it expands into a playlist; however, there&apos;s a caveat. For Offline Backup&apos;s functionality, users must have recently played "more than five songs" <em>and </em>have the feature enabled. The playlist can be added to "Your Library."</p><p>The Offline Backup playlist can be organized and filtered. The post states users can sort tunes based on artist, mood, and genre.</p><p>Spotify states that it keeps your recently played songs within a cache on your device if you&apos;re listening regularly. Offline Backup is pulling music from that stored data to remove the necessity of relying on a stable connection to grab the music.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1073px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.92%;"><img id="fNd7LmQkKaKnqFtoPjygek" name="spotify-offline-backup-rollout.jpg" alt="Spotify rolls out "Offline Backup" for continuous tunes when your signal is gone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fNd7LmQkKaKnqFtoPjygek.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1073" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>More importantly, Offline Backup shouldn&apos;t appear "dated" or out of touch with your habits. Spotify adds that (if enabled) it will continue to dip into what you&apos;ve heard recently and refresh the offline playlist.</p><p>Spotify&apos;s Offline Backup playlist is rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-06-21/more-choice-for-us-subscribers/">to Premium users</a> today (Oct 3). Users on Android and iOS should see it "this week" alongside Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.</p><p>This is the second update to hit Spotify in the past couple of weeks. At the end of September, the company introduced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotifys-ai-playlist-is-now-spinning-tunes-in-more-regions">AI Playlist</a> to more regions. U.S., Canadian, and New Zealand users can find a curated collection of songs that may pique their interest. Tapping the "+" icon on mobile will produce a drop-down menu with AI Playlist listed.</p><p>Users can give the streaming service&apos;s AI a prompt and it&apos;ll try and compile an ideal playlist to fit your needs. Spotify encourages users to be as descriptive as possible to aid the AI. Users can toss in details like a specific genre, decade, mood, favorite artist, and more to create a unique, personal playlist.</p>

Just a few days before Amazon&apos;s October Prime Day (aka Big Deal Days) is set to kick off, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-razr-2023-256gb-unlocked-infinite-black/6544832.p"><strong>Best Buy is slashing a whopping 40% off the Motorola Razr Plus (2023)</strong></a>, a foldable phone that we considered nearly perfect when it was first unveiled last year. </p><p>That price reduction is applied automatically when you buy the phone unlocked, but <strong>your discount will increase to 50%</strong> if you activate the phone on Best Buy&apos;s website. It&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-motorola-deals-have-come-early-score-40-off-foldable-phones-epic-flagship-discounts-and-more">best Prime Day Motorola deals</a> I&apos;ve seen so far, and the sale event hasn&apos;t even started yet (nor is this an Amazon discount, for that matter).  </p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="447e72d4-b4e0-4b27-8c34-534d49652041" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Motorola Razr Plus (2023) 256GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Motorola Razr Plus (2023) 256GB: $999.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-razr-2023-256gb-unlocked-infinite-black/6544832.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:787px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:98.86%;"><img id="xWhqeHRCxJ83yPZA94iswk" name="motorola-razr-plus-2023-render-with-space.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xWhqeHRCxJ83yPZA94iswk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="787" height="778" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Motorola Razr Plus (2023) 256GB: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-razr-2023-256gb-unlocked-infinite-black/6544832.p" data-dimension112="447e72d4-b4e0-4b27-8c34-534d49652041" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Motorola Razr Plus (2023) 256GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Motorola Razr Plus (2023) 256GB: $999.99"><del>$999.99</del> <strong>$599.99 unlocked, $499.99 with activation at Best Buy</strong></a></p>
<p>Despite being a last-gen foldable, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Motorola Razr Plus (2023) still impresses</a>, thanks to its powerful Snapdragon chipset, durable teardrop hinge, and vibrant cover display that lets you use important apps and features while the phone is closed. It may not have the best battery life and the cameras are nothing to write home about, but with a discount of up to 50% up for grabs, it's a pretty unbeatable opportunity. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-razr-2023-256gb-unlocked-infinite-black/6544832.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="447e72d4-b4e0-4b27-8c34-534d49652041" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Motorola Razr Plus (2023) 256GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Motorola Razr Plus (2023) 256GB: $999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a great foldable phone experience but you don&apos;t want to drop a bunch of cash; you take a lot of selfies or you simply enjoy a stylish phone. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need incredible cameras or loads of battery life; you can afford the newer Razr Plus (2024).</p><p>Obviously, if you can afford it, you&apos;ll have an better overall experience by going with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus (2024)</a>. The upgrades are considerable with the new model, but you&apos;ll probably end up paying around $300 more, so it&apos;s up to you whether or not the 2024 model is worth it.</p><p>For me, I&apos;m happy to lose some fancy AI features and battery life if it means I can save some cash ahead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">Big Deal Days</a> — and it&apos;s not like the Razr Plus (2023) is a serious downgrade. I&apos;m still getting the efficiency of the Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chipset with consistent bi-monthly security updates, and the vegan leather finish gives the phone a premium look and feel. For my wireless needs, that&apos;s more than enough. </p>

<ul><li>Samsung confirmed that the One UI 7 beta, based on Android 15, will drop before the year ends, with the official launch set for 2025 alongside the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>One UI 7 promises to be a fresh redesign for the interface on phones and tablets.</li><li>The upcoming update focuses on three main ideas: simplicity, a unique One UI vibe, and new UI elements that bring positive feelings.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>At Samsung’s Developer Conference, the company revealed that the One UI 7 beta update based on Android 15 is set to drop before the year ends and will officially launch in 2025 with its next flagship lineup.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s timeline for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> update has seen a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-has-allegedly-put-the-brakes-on-the-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">ups and downs over the past few months</a>. Everyone thought the One UI 7 beta would arrive early, but those hopes were dashed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dreary-one-ui-7-beta-forum-update">when the company hit some delays</a>.</p><p>Samsung today officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-celebrates-10-years-of-sdc-and-spotlights-ai-based-innovation-at-sdc24" target="_blank">announced</a> a major delay for the One UI 7 update. The South Korean tech giant hasn&apos;t shared the exact reasons behind it, but it has given developers a new timeline to work with.</p><p>While the updated timeline isn’t exactly shocking, it would really throw off Samsung&apos;s usual pace, considering it kicked off the One UI 6 beta program in August last year, well ahead of the annual Developer Conference.</p><p>One UI 7 is expected to be a huge and fresh redesign for the One UI interface on phones and tablets. Samsung has shared a sneak peek at the exciting features of its next major OS iteration.</p><p>The next One UI version is focused on three main ideas: keeping the user interface simple, creating a unique One UI vibe, and introducing new UI elements that aim to give users a positive emotional kick.</p><p>Sally Hyesoon Jeong, Samsung Electronics&apos; executive VP and head of the framework research and development team, gave a quick rundown of the upcoming update at the company’s conference on Thursday.</p><p>Although Jeong skipped the nitty-gritty details or any visuals, she shared Samsung’s big vision for One UI 7. The update is all about figuring out what users need and simplifying things. Samsung also fine-tuned motion dynamics and introduced a new blur system, which you can see in the revamped home screen grid.</p><p>Samsung’s One UI upgrades aren’t just for the shiny new toys; they actually improve the experience for all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a>. Usually, the firm debuts new features on its flagship models first before sharing the love with older devices—like it did with the recent One UI 6.1.1 update.</p>

<ul><li>Google details a few updates for users, beginning with a more "organized" Search experience on mobile and increased ads in AI Overviews.</li><li>Google Lens is starting a test that lets user record videos in the app and speak their questions aloud for in-depth query results.</li><li>The company is also bringing Circle to Search's music lookup button to even more Android devices following its September debut.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s finishing the week with a few "significant" updates to its Search experience — including Lens.</p><p>The U.S. is set to witness Google Search&apos;s new form, courtesy of the company&apos;s continuation of AI assistance. Google highlighted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-lens-october-2024-updates/">a blog post</a> that mobile users will notice new "organized" Search results "with AI." The company attributes this rollout to a recent wave of feedback from users finding them useful. This update will add a "full-page" experience to Search packed with information from websites (articles), forums, and more.</p><p>It appears that Google&apos;s organization might display results in order based on relevancy or importance. When searching for a recipe, these organized results with AI will display "top recipes" before diving into potential sides, ingredient information, and other relevant results.</p><p>This update is set to roll out "this week," meaning you may notice it by the weekend if not by next week.</p><p>Google adds that "following positive feedback," your Search results will see an uptick in ads. The increase in advertisements concerns Search&apos;s AI Overviews in the U.S. "for relevant queries." The company states it hopes these ads can help users find products and brands that the AI model deemed "helpful" to their search.</p><p>We were warned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-ads-announced">about increased ads</a> coming to AI Overivews in May.</p>

<p>Google Lens is the next stop for the latest string of updates — and there are a few, beginning with recording capabilities. Previewed during I/O 2024, Google teased that Lens would soon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">let users record a video</a> as the backbone of a query. The post states users can open Lens and <strong>hold the shutter button </strong>to begin taking a video. Additionally, users can speak their questions aloud while recording.</p><p>After processing, Google <em>should </em>return an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overview-save-feature-expansion">AI Overview</a> with relevant information concerning the video and your vocalized question. Those enrolled in the SGE (Search Labs) "AI Overviews and more" test on Android and iOS will begin seeing recording in Lens "globally" today (Oct 3). For now, the test supports English queries.</p><p>Lens is also extending its voice capabilities to photos. After snapping a photo, users can hold the shutter button to voice their questions. The result will be similar to what was explained for capturing a video through Lens.</p><p>Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-new-search-feature-lets-you-find-objects-using-a-mix-of-text-and-images">a shopping revamp for Lens</a> in 2022, but that&apos;s getting pushed further with an improved results page. The company states taking a photo of a product (like a bag or top) will see it run through Google&apos;s Shopping Graph and AI models. This will expose users to a detailed results page, featuring product reviews, prices from multiple retailers, and where to buy.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you were missing Circle to Search&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-new-search-feature-lets-you-find-objects-using-a-mix-of-text-and-images">new music lookup</a> from September&apos;s Android update, worry no more. Google states it&apos;s expanding the availability for users to look up music on their devices through Circle to Search. The feature should be widely available following today&apos;s (Oct 3) update, but give it some time if you&apos;re not seeing it yet.</p><p>Users can use Circle to Search to discover music when watching a video on their device or from external audio sources. On your device, open the tool, and tap the music note icon beside the search bar. Circle to Search will listen in briefly before displaying its results. The AI will also provide a YouTube link to the song for easy listening and sharing.</p>
