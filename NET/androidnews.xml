                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-launch">launched the new Galaxy Watch FE</a> this week, which is really just a 2024 "refresh" of the Galaxy Watch 4. The smartwatch features more or less the same specs, chipset, and design as the 2021 model, with the exception of a new sapphire glass over the display for better scratch protection. However, while a Galaxy Watch 4 reboot may seem like a strange move for Samsung, I think it&apos;s kind of genius. In fact, it&apos;s exactly what Wear OS needs: more affordable smartwatches.</p><p>I&apos;ve been reviewing Wear OS smartwatches for several years, and I&apos;ve often winced at the prices some of these companies charge for these devices. Fossil, which pulled an LG and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-wear-os-exit-shows-platform-improvements-less-competitive">left the smartwatch business</a> earlier this year, used to charge $299 for the Fossil Gen 6, which didn&apos;t even run Wear OS 3 at launch and had very questionable performance. Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Watches now cost more than ever, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Watch 5 Pro</a> model priced in the same ballpark as a cheap Android phone and even the price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> giving me pause (don&apos;t even get me started on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/montblanc-summit-3-with-wear-os-3-announced">Montblanc Summit 3</a>).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fuVP42LF5An82C5MHpndTg" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-5-Pro-3.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fuVP42LF5An82C5MHpndTg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The only exception I&apos;ve seen is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mobvoi-ticwatch-e3-review">TicWatch E3</a>, which launched a few years back. That watch featured a relatively cheap build and skipped out on the best features found on more expensive TicWatch models, like the dual-display tech, but the price kind of made it worth it. At $199, you got a smartwatch that was much cheaper than the competition and performed surprisingly well with the Snapdragon Wear 4100, despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-3-rollout">Wear OS 3 coming much later</a>.</p><p>In fact, I&apos;m a little bummed we haven&apos;t gotten a TicWatch E4 or some equivalent, especially now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a> is here and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> is on the way, both of which likely require newer chips like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen 1</a>. But seeing Samsung launch the Galaxy Watch FE gives me some hope that cheaper Wear OS watches could be a thing again if companies play their cards right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pijN8QWdPijHNrru7JhWLg" name="ticwatch-e3-lifestyle-landscape-crop.jpg" alt="TicWatch E3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pijN8QWdPijHNrru7JhWLg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, agrees, saying that launching the cheaper smartwatch was a smart move on Samsung&apos;s part. "I think the Galaxy Watch FE allows Samsung and its partners to offer a cheaper option that can be easily discounted or given away for free as a bundle item and broadens the price range of products it&apos;s offering for wearables."</p><p>I&apos;m not saying every cheap Wear OS smartwatch has to be a rebranded version of an older model, but I do think companies should have affordability in mind when developing upcoming models. At $349.99, the Pixel Watch 2 is asking for a lot, and that&apos;s not even with LTE. If I didn&apos;t already have one, I would have a hard time justifying spending that money on it, and honestly, I&apos;m still trying to figure out if it&apos;s worth it (don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s a really great smartwatch). But I would love to see a future Pixel Watch 3a that features a toned-down Snapdragon chip and some other compromises, especially if it means spending only $199 to be part of the Pixel ecosystem.</p><p>Keep in mind that Google just launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-launch">Fitbit Ace LTE</a> for $229, and Qualcomm already gives smartphone OEMs cheaper alternatives of its chips, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, so both companies could very well make it happen. Apple already sells the more affordable Apple Watch SE, which was apparently good enough to warrant an upgraded model two years later, so I would love to see more Android OEMs follow suit. Sag notes the importance of launching cheaper models, as it allows people to make decisions based on price<strong> </strong>"and doesn&apos;t price certain people out of the market because their appetite for spending on a smartwatch is less than $299." </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy Watch FE is a blueprint for how other companies can approach making cheaper Wear OS watches.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This is why the lack of cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> is a glaring omission for me, especially as companies stuff more features in their devices to drive the price up. Wear OS doesn&apos;t have the same reputation as WatchOS, and while that&apos;s starting to change, I&apos;m not convinced too many people are clamoring to shell out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin</a> or Apple Watch amounts of money for a Wear OS smartwatch. It&apos;s good that we have premium smartwatches that perform well, but Wear OS also needs to be more financially accessible.</p><p>This also goes for companies such as OnePlus, which is rumored to have a potentially budget-friendly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> variant launching soon. Then there&apos;s Motorola, which has stayed away from Wear OS on its budget-friendly smartwatches. However, a new Wear OS model from the company would be perfect, as it already makes some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best affordable phones</a> on the market.</p><p>That said, Sag warns that while there should be more affordable Wear OS models, there should also be a happy medium and that companies need to be careful. "I do think it’s a problem, but I also believe that if you go too cheap, the experience gets really bad and not worth making. Kind of like most really cheap smartphones."</p>

<p>One of the reasons Android is so great is because it caters to everyone, from those willing to spend an arm and a leg on a new phone to those who just want something with the basics that doesn’t break the bank. Now that Wear OS is finally coming into its own with big players like Samsung and Google at the helm, the same philosophy should be applied to the wearable platform to help it reach more people.</p>

<ul><li>Google's latest Pixel Feature Drop for June 2024 adds a feature called Lookup to the Phone app. </li><li>The new button simplifies the process of reverse-searching phone numbers, and it's helpful for figuring out whether a call you missed is worth a call back.</li><li>It's live in the latest Phone by Google app beta, and should be expanding to all users soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently announced everything included in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-june-2024-feature-drop-detailed">June Pixel Feature Drop</a>, and one of the smaller features is called Lookup. It&apos;s a new tool in the Phone by Google app that&apos;ll make it easier for users to find out who&apos;s behind an unknown number. While it might not be as exciting as other features included in the Pixel Feature Drop, like display output support, it&apos;s still a notable addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best smartphones</a>. Having a way to reverse-search a phone number can save you time and stress by letting you know whether it&apos;s worth calling someone back. </p><p>Lookup was announced with the recent Feature Drop, but it&apos;s not available for everyone yet. For now, it&apos;s included in the Phone by Google app for beta testers. We saw it in version 133 of the beta, but it was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/12/google-phone-lookup-pixel/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> in version 132. After installing the Google Phone app beta, you&apos;ll see a new fourth option underneath your recent missed calls when you select them. </p><p>Previously, tapping a missed call in the <strong>Recents</strong> tab of the Phone by Google app presented three options: <strong>Add contact</strong>, <strong>Message</strong>, and <strong>History</strong>. To search for a phone number, users needed to manually copy the number and search it in Google or the browser of their choice. Some people certainly used this method, but you needed to be "in the know" for it to work. There wasn&apos;t anything on the phone by Google app that told you how to reverse-search a phone number. </p><p>Now, that fourth option — <strong>Lookup</strong> — does just that. It&apos;s a new button in the Phone by Google that takes the effort out of the process of looking up a phone number. While the feature isn&apos;t groundbreaking by itself, the important part of this is that Lookup is now front-and-center in the Phone by Google app. More people will see it, more people will use it, and hopefully more people will avoid wasting time on scammers because of it. </p>

<p>The Phone by Google app already has some protections against scam calls within, like adding a <strong>Scam Risk</strong> tag in the Caller ID when a number is known to be associated with scams. Your cellular carrier might offer some protection, too. However, there isn&apos;t anything to help you figure out whether an unknown number or missed call is worth a call back from the Google Phone app. That&apos;s where Lookup comes in. After trying it on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>, this might save users quite a bit of time. </p><p>The way it works is simple. When you see a missed call in the <strong>Recents</strong> tab of the Phone by Google app, you probably don&apos;t know what it&apos;s about — especially if the call is from an unknown number and the person didn&apos;t leave a voicemail message. Even if they did leave a message, it may be misleading. Law enforcement agencies across the U.S. have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.alexandriava.gov/sheriff/sheriffs-office-warns-of-fraudsters-impersonating-law-enforcement-in-phone-scam" target="_blank">issued warnings</a> over the last few months about phone scams involving police impersonation, where scammers use real names, addresses, and offices to trick unknowing citizens. One way to verify if a call is legitimate is to use the Lookup feature.</p><p>Tapping the Lookup button immediately opens a page in Google Search that&apos;ll help you find out more about where a call came from. Using the full phone number, including country code, Google may pull up results explaining the origin of your missed call. In one of our tests, Google wasn&apos;t able to tell us anything about an unknown number. </p><p>However, in another test, Lookup in Phone by Google worked exactly as intended. It told me that the missed call was from a county government office in Germany. Since I&apos;ve had no connection to Germany, I now know that the call was either an honest mistake or a scam, and there&apos;s no reason to call back. Spoofing a phone number is easier than ever, and it&apos;s entirely possible that a scammer could use a seemingly legitimate number to try and trick people. By uncovering the origin of calls with Lookup, you won&apos;t waste your time on calling back people who don&apos;t have any real reason for contacting you. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.55%;"><img id="78SrehunX4Va6ddM9CzyS8" name="google-phone-app-hero-1.jpg" alt="Google Phone app logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78SrehunX4Va6ddM9CzyS8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1363" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lookup is going to have the most impact for people who aren&apos;t as savvy at detecting potential scams. For seasoned tech users, the Lookup tool will simplify the process of reverse searching a number, but it doesn&apos;t add any new functionality. However, it&apos;s going to be a game-changer for people who may not have even thought to Google Search the unknown number that called them. By putting the new Lookup button right in front of users, more people are going to use it in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-app-found-showing-whatsapp-call-log">Google Phone app</a>. </p><p>Aside from simply averting scams, Lookup is going to save users time. As we mentioned earlier, phone scams are becoming more advanced. A scammer posing as a police or court officer could have a thorough script and correct information, making it difficult to identify whether it&apos;s a scam or a serious problem. When it becomes clear that the call is a scam — the bad actors usually ask people to make payment through sketchy means — you may have already wasted a half hour believing it was real. </p><p>Using the Lookup tool might have revealed that the call wasn&apos;t coming from a real office before someone even called back. It&apos;s not only going to save people time, but also their money and identity from theft. Any time tech companies can make it easier for us to avoid online scams, it&apos;s appreciated, and that&apos;s exactly what this new feature does. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Motorola will unveil its new Razr foldable phones in China on June 25, 2024, while a global launch event is tipped for July.</li><li>This year's Razr models are rumored to feature larger cover screens for both standard and premium versions.</li><li>The Razr Plus 2024 is rumored to include Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, while MediaTek's Dimensity 7300X SoC could power the standard model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Motorola has confirmed that it will reveal its next Razr foldable phones at a launch event in China on June 25, 2024.</p><p>The Lenovo-owned smartphone maker revealed on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1645915085/OiPaixsJc" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that it is gearing up to launch its next-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable smartphones</a> in China, presumably the Motorola Razr 50 (Razr 2024) and Razr 50 Ultra (Razr Plus 2024), following in the footsteps of the well-loved Razr 40 and Razr 40 Ultra (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/06/13/razr-50-series-to-launch-on-june-25-first-foldable-with-snapdragon-8s-gen-3/" target="_blank">Gizmochina</a>).</p><p>While the Motorola Razr 50 and Razr 50 Ultra make their joint debut in China first, it looks like the rest of the world won&apos;t have to wait too long. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-moto-razr-50-lineup-debuts-in-july/" target="_blank">Smartprix</a>, there&apos;s a follow-up event planned for July to reveal the Razr 2024 and Razr Plus 2024 for the global market.</p><p>Interestingly, Motorola&apos;s Weibo announcement about the event doesn&apos;t explicitly make mention of the Razr 50 and Razr 50 Ultra models. However, it&apos;s likely these are the smartphones the company is hinting at.</p><p>This year&apos;s models are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-series-renders-reveal-cover-screen-changes">rumored to feature even larger, eye-catching front screens</a> for both the standard and premium versions.</p><p>As per earlier rumors, the top-tier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> is rumored to sport a big 4-inch cover display and a dual 50MP camera system. Meanwhile, the standard variant might come with a slightly smaller 3.6-inch cover screen to keep the price more competitive. You can also expect the standard model to feature a 120Hz main display and a lower megapixel front camera compared to its bigger sibling.</p><p>Based on previous reports, the Razr Plus 2024 is shaping up to be quite impressive. Rumor has it that it&apos;ll feature a massive 6.9-inch pOLED internal display with a 2640 x 1080 resolution and a silky-smooth 165Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Under the hood, the Razr 2024 series is gearing up for a performance showdown. The bigger variant is expected to be a powerhouse with Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> chip, while the Razr 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">might go for the efficient MediaTek Dimensity 7300X</a>.</p><p>The battle heats up on the charging front. The Razr Plus 2024 is rumored to feature blazing-fast 68W wireless charging, possibly making it the quickest folding phone to juice up in a short period of time. On the other hand, the Razr 2024 offers a solid 33W fast charging and a 4,200mAh battery.</p>

<hr>
<p>Moving into the weekend, YouTube is highlighting a few new features it currently has in testing for a limited percentage of viewers and creators.</p><p>As detailed in its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167/youtube-test-features-and-experiments">Features and Experiments</a>" post, YouTube states it has kickstarted a test for AI-generated live chat summaries. The platform explains that its AI software will create its summaries based on "published chats" in a live stream&apos;s rolling feed.</p><p>Viewers can see a snapshot of the most "exciting" conversations to understand them quicker without scrolling a bunch. YouTube adds that a live stream&apos;s chat must have a "sufficient" amount of chat data before the AI can kick in and begin summarizing.</p><p>This feature is rolling out to a small cluster of viewers who join eligible streams broadcast in English with "super active" chats.</p><p>We&apos;ve spotted YouTube&apos;s AI-generated chat summaries during a live stream. The summary appears when first entering the channel at the top of the feed. The text box offers an overview of what&apos;s transpired but quickly disappears after a few seconds. Minimizing the chat and re-opening it (or refreshing) produces it again, but with a new summary as the chat continues to evolve.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:411px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.80%;"><img id="Ukpu6Ht7Ww4uAQCMiaqHre" name="youtube-ai-generated-chat-summaries.jpg" alt="An example of YouTube's AI live chat summaries." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ukpu6Ht7Ww4uAQCMiaqHre.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="411" height="254" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nickolas Diaz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The platform&apos;s next test involves a new way for users to discover channels through QR codes. YouTube states this is only available through its mobile app, informing creators in the test to navigate to the "You" tab. A new "Share your channel" chip will be displayed beneath your handle, which produces an interactable QR code.</p><p>The post states that users can share these codes anywhere and that online and offline users can scan them. Only a small group of creators will receive this test. However, YouTube states that it will detail an expansion if all goes well.</p><p>Lastly, YouTube is experimenting with integrating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-google-lens-search-images-text-simultaneously">Google Lens</a> into its search bar. The function works similarly to Lens in other apps, as users can capture what they see with their phone&apos;s camera and run a search through YouTube&apos;s database. The post adds that users can learn more about what they see by tapping "Search on Google."</p><p>Those in the test will notice a Lens icon in the YouTube search bar. Note: only a small percentage of Android-based users are eligible.</p><p>Team YouTube highlighted a new test that involves creators and viewers the other day. The former will see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-details-test-compare-thumbnail-experiment">alternating thumbnails</a>. The company sees the test as a way for creators to gauge what type of photos entice viewers to click on their content. As such, they can upload up to three thumbnails, which will be shown to audiences "evenly" with feedback about which performed the best.</p><p>The service also started an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-highlights-premium-features-coversational-ai">AI test for Premium users</a> late last year, involving AI-powered summaries for comments and "Ask" for video-specific questions.</p>

<p>A discovery shows that Motorola&apos;s plans to re-enter the Bluetooth tracker game with a next-generation device are progressing.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/accessories/accessories-news/moto-tag-tdra-certification/">MySmartPrice</a> discovered a new UAE TDRA database listing, which details Motorola&apos;s device tracker in development (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/14/motorola-find-my-device-moto-tag/">9to5Google</a>). The tracker reportedly appeared for certification as its listing shows its official market name: the "Moto Tag."</p><p>More information shows that the product falls within the "short-range device/low-power device" category. The publication notes that the Moto Tag bears the model number "XT2445-1."</p><p>Unfortunately, there was nothing more to unearth about the Moto Tag as the company hadn&apos;t provided any specifications. Photos of the devices or at least early renderings were also unavailable in the website&apos;s certification listings.</p>

<p>Motorola debuted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Smart-Tag-Finder-Anything/dp/B071FR7Y3P">"smart tracker"</a> in 2017, which was a circular device with a small space at the top to clip onto keys and other items. The device featured a slim, horizontal green light at the bottom, to showcase its activation. With the certification listing void of a design teaser, it remains to be seen if Motorola will continue with that old look or revamp it.</p><p>However, the existence of a Motorola brand tracker isn&apos;t coming out of leftfield as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">Google confirmed it would do so</a> in April. Joining the OEM is reportedly Eufy and Jio who will enter the network with brand new trackers.</p><p>A highlight of Google&apos;s new network is the addition of stronger user security and privacy measures to protect their devices.</p><p>Even more, users have been using Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">Find My Device network</a> since May. Folks can find their lost phones or accessories (e.g., earbuds) and even share the location of their devices with friends and family. There was also a discovery earlier in June that detailed Google&apos;s early development of AR-based directions for phones and UWB support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ar-directions-uwb-find-my-device">even more trackable devices</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing has announced a new staggered firmware rollout to its flagship Phone 2 this week, which includes new features in addition to improvements and bug fixes.</p><p>The update, dubbed <strong>Nothing OS 2.5.6</strong>,  comes right after the OS 2.5.5 released in April, bringing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-chatgpt-integration-camera-update">ChatGPT integration</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a>. It also added conversation functionality to the recent Ear and "Ear a" buds. The latest firmware, however, brings in nifty new features, like a new option in Settings that lets users hide or show the navigation bar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nYTZ7UktaRKju3mbPx4Q37" name="Nothing-phone-2-back-glyphs-on-hero.jpg" alt="The Glyph lights illuminated on the back of a Nothing Phone (2)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nYTZ7UktaRKju3mbPx4Q37.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/11514-phone-2-nothing-os-256-changelog">community post</a>, Nothing explains features, like adding a custom option that lets users enable or disable the swipe action required to access the Quick Settings pane from the top of the lock screen. Additionally, Status bar icons can now be customized with new options that can be accessed via display settings on the Phone 2. Google&apos;s latest June security patch is the other notable thing added with the new update.</p><p>While the complete changelog can be viewed from the aforementioned community post, here are the primary improvements included with the OS 2.5.6:</p>
<ul><li>New Quick Settings Widget animations for enhanced engagement.</li><li>Optimized compatibility with some carrier networks.</li><li>Enhanced UI of carrier names.</li></ul>
<p>The latest firmware release refines the ChatGPT integration from the previous update to Phone 2, which will likely improve the AI service&apos;s overall experience. The new update also fixes an issue preventing cloned apps from functioning while on a VPN network. </p><p>The other fixed issues include lock screen widgets not showing up occasionally and back gestures that sometimes lacked haptic feedback. Lastly, the overall stability improvements will be seen with the OS 2.5.6 release on the Phone 2.</p><p>While the Phone 2 getting regular updates is a welcome move from Nothing, its CEO Carl Pei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">has stated</a> that its successor, Phone 3, isn&apos;t coming this year, breaking the company&apos;s annual flagship release schedule. The CEO further mentioned that Nothing&apos;s been "designing and prototyping AI interactions," which are likely to be improved and witnessed on the Phone 3, which now has a launch pushed to next year.</p><p>"It&apos;s important we get the product right, integrating hardware and AI in a way that is both useful and brings a smile to people&apos;s faces," Pei added in his recent X post. </p>

Google TV 4K Pro:</strong> $49.88 at Walmart</a></li></ul>
<p>Things have slowed down quite a bit when it comes to streaming devices. The market is largely dominated by Amazon’s Fire TV Stick, thanks in large part to just how cheap you can get one for. Meanwhile, we’re still waiting for Google to release an updated version of the Chromecast 4K for those who prefer the Google TV interface. </p><p>However, there’s been a surprise entrant into the space that has turned a lot of heads. Walmart’s Onn. brand focuses on offering affordable alternatives for everything from tablets to cables and now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">streaming boxes</a>. The most recent release could be its most impressive, as the Onn. Google TV 4K Pro aims to offer the best experience without breaking the bank. </p>

<p>Walmart <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tvs-magic-button-debuts-launching-any-app-of-your-choice">released</a> the Onn. Google TV 4K Pro in early May 2024, and it retails for $49.88. Currently, this streaming box is only available from Walmart, and it’s unlikely that we’ll see it arrive at other retailers. Additionally, it’s only available in one color, while including a remote control, HDMI cable, AC adapter, and the Quick Start Guide. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-onn-google-tv-4k-pro-what-you-ll-like"><span>Onn. Google TV 4K Pro: What you'll like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="USKvnNXChkJnYWLzAuoBcK" name="onn-google-tv-4k-pro-google-stadia-controller-2.jpg" alt="Google Stadia Controller next to the Onn Google TV 4K Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/USKvnNXChkJnYWLzAuoBcK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something that immediately grabbed my attention, besides the price, was the port selection. Sandwiched between the AC power adapter and the reset button, the 4K Pro includes an Ethernet jack, a full-size HDMI port, and even a USB 3.0 Type-A port. </p><p>This immediately gives it a leg up on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast-google-tv-review">Chromecast</a>, as you don’t need to fiddle with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-hubs-chromebooks">USB-C hubs</a> just to get more storage or enjoy a faster and more reliable internet connection. But for me, the first thing this made me want to do was turn the 4K Pro into a retro emulation box.</p><p>Speaking of emulation, let’s talk about what’s under the hood. Powering the Onn. Google TV 4K Pro is the Amlogic S905X4, paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. As you might suspect, you won’t actually have 32GB of storage to work with, but there’s still three times more storage here and an extra gigabyte of RAM (3GB vs. 2GB) than what the Chromecast with Google TV 4K has to offer. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ArFLY9dZppmBMnp6HG7J44" name="onn-google-tv-4k-pro-review-home-screen.jpg" alt="Onn Google TV 4K Pro home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ArFLY9dZppmBMnp6HG7J44.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this in mind, performance has been what you would expect. Navigating the interface is smooth and snappy and feels even better than the Fire TV Cube. The only streaming box that I feel offers a more fluid experience is the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/music-movies-tv/apple-tv/apple-tv-4k-2022-review">Apple TV 4K</a>, but it’s only marginal, and you might not even notice it unless you compare them side-by-side.</p><p>If you were to see the Onn. Google TV 4K Pro at a friend&apos;s house, you might mistake this for a smaller version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv-cube-2022-review">Fire TV Cube</a>. The top shell is made from a material similar to the fabric found on many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-speaker">best smart speakers</a> from either Amazon or Google. That’s not a bad thing, as it just kind of blends in and doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="4uWKKp3Gwxm87sjterd4QH" name="onn-google-tv-4k-pro-ports.jpg" alt="Onn Google TV 4K Pro ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4uWKKp3Gwxm87sjterd4QH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Elsewhere on the box itself, we have a hardware mute switch for those who don’t want or need Assistant to always be listening. And on the front, there’s a button that I mistook for being an oversized IR sensor at first glance. This button is pretty darn awesome, though, as it activates the Remote Finder feature. When pressed, your remote will start making a chirping noise so you can figure out which couch cushion it got wedged beneath.</p><p>Walmart chose this design, as opposed to the plastic shell of the Onn. 4K Streaming Box, because of the built-in microphones and speakers. Not only is the 4K Pro a streaming box, but it’s also a Google Assistant smart speaker, complete with hands-free control. This means that you don’t need to talk into the remote every time you want to turn off the lights or pause a movie if you accidentally burnt the popcorn.</p>

<p>You won’t want to immediately toss your remote in a drawer, as it, too, offers a few extra tricks. At the bottom, we have four shortcut buttons that quickly take you to YouTube, Netflix, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a>, or Paramount Plus. While these can’t be natively remapped for other streaming services, the YouTube button can be mapped to open YouTube, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>, which can come in quite handy. </p><p>In the top right corner is a button you won’t find anywhere else. The “Magic” button can be customized to perform different actions or set as a shortcut for a specific app. It’s been really nice having a dedicated button that lets me launch right into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">RetroArch</a> when I’m in the mood to play some classic games. It’s also worth pointing out that the buttons are backlit, something I hope to see if the Chromecast with Google TV is ever updated. </p>

<p>For as much as I’ve thoroughly enjoyed using the Onn. Google TV 4K Pro, my biggest problem has nothing to do with the box itself. Instead, it’s the abhorrent, blue “Free TV” button slapped right in the middle of the remote. </p><p>It sticks out like a sore thumb, and while the idea of having such a button is solid, I just wish Walmart had done something different. A better idea would have been to swap out one of the other shortcut buttons at the bottom for the Free TV one or maybe add a button at the top between the Power and Magic buttons. </p><p>The only other “problem” I found was that you need to keep the 4K Pro out in the open. It&apos;s nice to be able to yell at Google Assistant to stop the music, but the microphones can’t pick up your voice if it’s tucked away in a TV stand. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="CyHVx3dXTPNBh6LpJeKYxL" name="onn-google-tv-4k-pro-review-assistant-lights.jpg" alt="Onn Google TV 4K Pro with the Google Assistant lights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CyHVx3dXTPNBh6LpJeKYxL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This might be a deal-breaker for those who prefer to hide things out of the way, which is completely understandable. On the bright side, at least the box doesn’t come in gaudy colors that would stick out like a sore thumb.</p><p>Besides that, I wish that Walmart had opted for a different design overall. There’s nothing really wrong with how the 4K Pro looks, but it’s very reminiscent of the early days of smart speakers with the mesh fabric. It’s a bit rough to the touch and just doesn’t really <em>look</em> as sleek or svelte as I would have preferred. </p>

<p>Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast-google-tv-review">Chromecast with Google TV 4K</a> is the next most obvious competitor, as it is also priced at $50. However, the biggest benefit that the 4K Max has over the Onn. 4K Pro is that it can be regularly had for much less. Even without accounting for Prime Day or Black Friday, there’s almost always a way to get Amazon’s best streaming stick for less than its retail price. While it can be hidden behind your TV, it suffers from the same problem as the Chromecast as it doesn’t offer any additional ports besides power.</p><p>From there, Amazon’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-2023-review">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a> is the next most obvious competitor, as it is also priced at $50.

It can do everything that the others can, but just relies on Roku’s own interface as opposed to the Fire TV or Google TV interface. However, the biggest difference here is that the included power cable features a “long-range wireless receiver.” This aims to provide a stronger and more stable connection to make up for the inability to use it with Ethernet.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a budget-friendly streaming device with ports.</li><li>You want a better version of the Chromecast with Google TV 4K.</li><li>You don't want ot deal with constant ads from Amazon or Roku.</li><li>You're okay with having this in the open for hands-free Google Assistant.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a streaming device that hides behind the TV.</li><li>You don't need 4K streaming.</li></ul>
<p>I won’t bury the lede here. If you’re in the market for a new streaming device and are on a sub-$100 budget, then the Walmart Onn. Google TV 4K Pro is the one you should buy. It’s snappy, reliable, and has plenty of extra features that you won’t find for $50.</p><p>It’s so good that I’m even considering swapping out the Apple TV 4K in my living room and replacing it with this. Since most of my smart home is powered by Google Assistant, the 4K Pro slots in quite nicely, fitting in with the other Google and Nest devices that I have. </p><p>My only hang-up, besides the ugly Free TV button, is whether my wife would want to switch to something else right after she’s gotten used to the Apple TV.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Ultra" was previously rumored to be a South Korean exclusive, but a new discovery suggests the opposite. </p><p>A new database listing, discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/06/exclusive-galaxy-z-fold-6-ultra-coming-to-different-markets.html">Android Headlines</a>, teases Samsung&apos;s interest in pushing the Ultra foldable to other markets. The phone is seemingly on its way to the Chinese market as the listing shows a device codenamed "Q6A" with the model number "SM-W9025."</p><p>This codename has been used in South Korea to reference the Fold 6 Ultra internally, but what&apos;s more important now is the "W" in its model number. The publication states that it follows a similar trend Samsung made during the Flip 5 and Fold 5 launch, where the market saw them as the "W24 Flip" and the "Galaxy W24."</p><p>Still, it&apos;s not certain if the rest of the world will see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra</a>. This database listing seems to confirm its existence in China, but we&apos;re left wondering about other areas. Samsung is expected to debut the basic Fold 6 later this summer, but rumors state the Ultra model could be left for another time.</p><p>Currently, the potential Fold 6 Ultra launch timeframe is speculated to be 2025.</p>

<p>An "Ultra" model Fold 6 has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-ultra-second-model-rumor">been rumored</a> for a while, but it&apos;s been bittersweet as other regions, like the U.S., might not see it. In April, model SM-F958N was spotted for the Fold 6 Ultra, signaling its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-could-be-developing-a-galaxy-z-fold-6-ultra">South Korean exclusivity</a>. Samsung typically marks its exclusive home soil devices with an "N," similar to how the Chinese market sees a "W."</p><p>Specification differences aren&apos;t expected as these slight changes in model numbers are to fit the region&apos;s market.</p><p>In other news, a massive leak <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-just-got-spoiled-hard-in-this-massive-leak">spilled the specifications</a> of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 ahead of Samsung today (June 14). The phone&apos;s 6.3-inch cover display will supposedly remain but with a 22:9 aspect ratio and 2376x968 resolution to make things wider. The other notable upgrade is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, which the device will sport everywhere it&apos;s available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-qualcomm-exclusivity-choice-report">instead of swapping to Exynos</a>.</p><p>It was rumored that Samsung would incorporate Qualcomm&apos;s 2023 flagship chip into its next foldables for "efficiency" reasons.</p><p>Also, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-gets-launch-date">Samsung Unpacked countdown</a> leaked, doubling down on its rumored July 10 debut date.</p>

From now through Sunday, June 16th, you can head to Best Buy and score some massive savings on everything from smartphones to smart TVs, just in time to buy that last-minute Father&apos;s Day gift. </p><p>Keep reading for a selection of my favorite deals included in the sale. I&apos;m talking about discounts like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-8-pro-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6559251.p"><strong>$250 off</strong></a> the Google Pixel 8 Pro before activation or this deal that drops the price of Jabra&apos;s Elite 10 earbuds to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/jabra-elite-10-dolby-atmos-true-wireless-in-ear-heaphones-titanium-black/6553257.p"><strong>only $199.99</strong></a>. The big question now is whether you should take advantage of this weekend&apos;s sale or wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2024-dates-early-deals-and-what-to-expect-from-the-sale">Prime Day deals</a> to drop.

<p>On June 11, 2024, GN-owned brand Jabra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabras-new-elite-earbuds-come-with-a-case-thats-more-than-meets-the-eye">announced</a> the second generation of their Elite 8 Active and Elite 10 true wireless earbuds. Then, on that same day, GN <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/06/11/2896501/0/en/GN-to-gradually-wind-down-its-Elite-and-Talk-product-lines-Strong-performance-in-the-Hearing-division-to-partly-off-set-the-extraordinary-impact-from-the-gradual-wind-down.html">announced</a> that its name really stands for “Good Night” as it reveals that it&apos;s killing off Jabra’s Elite and Talk product lines.</p><p>In a press release, Peter Karlstromer, CEO of GN Store Nord, said that the company “cannot generate a fair return on investment compared to the many other opportunities we have within our Hearing, Enterprise, and Gaming businesses.”</p><p>Translation: GN is dropping the Elite and Talk lineups because they will be too expensive for them to keep up with the competition. This is despite Jabra acknowledging that refocusing the Elite product line towards the premium segment in 2023 did, in fact, result in stronger profits than before.</p>

<p>Jabra has a reputation for bringing true wireless earbuds to the market that strike a delightful balance of great sound, reassuring IP ratings, and solid ANC and transparency modes. Seeing GN sunset this brand is quite a surprise to many, especially on the same day as announcing updates to its current lines, which add a Bluetooth feature update as exciting as their LE Audio cases: support for the LC3 codec. If that’s Greek to you, we’ve written an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">in-depth Bluetooth primer</a> that makes sense of it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4D2YHbSFj2YGHF4yPkaDGW" name="JABRA ELITE 75T_YTTHUMB2.jpg" alt="YouTube sreenshots of Tshaka reviewing Jabra's Elite 75t true wireless earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4D2YHbSFj2YGHF4yPkaDGW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ve been a fan of Jabra since I first tried their 65t earbuds. I have notoriously small ear canals, and Jabra’s earbuds are one of the only manufacturers whose products fit in my ears without falling out during exercise. In my early days of reviews on YouTube, Jabra earpiece reviews were among my most popular.</p>
<p>That said, while it&apos;s shocking to see the Elite lineup go, this isn’t a complete surprise regarding the Talk product lineup. With the ubiquity of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">great true wireless earbuds</a>, mono Bluetooth headsets just don’t have the utility to keep up with many users. Plus, they look like the earpieces your uncles walk around with in their ears all day at the barbeque, which is to say, they look dated.</p>
<h2 id="fierce-competition-from-both-ends-2">Fierce competition from both ends</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Hc5WG5oUUta9UifWHdyP4a" name="Jabra-Elite-8-Actve-gen-2.jpg" alt="Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hc5WG5oUUta9UifWHdyP4a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5000" height="2813" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jabra)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rubber meets the road here where the options for high-quality, go-anywhere, do-anything Bluetooth earbuds are concerned. Jabra has a lot of competition in the fitness-focused earbud space at similar price points. Brands like Beats, Bose, and Sennheiser all offer some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">best fitness earbuds</a>, but Jabra has them all beat in the water and dust resistance category. In some instances, even Jabra’s case is more water resistant than competitor’s earbuds.</p><p>The tradeoff is that some of those competitors offer access to Hi-Res Wireless Audio codecs, something Jabra has surprisingly avoided with its premium earbuds despite offering top-notch microphone quality. However, it can be argued that the importance of those codecs for consumers and their purchasing decisions is questionable based on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/do-listeners-really-care-about-hi-res-audio">blind audio test</a> we conducted. Still, the lack of Hi-Res audio can be a determining factor for audiophiles. </p><p>On the other hand, if you look on Amazon, you’ll find a dozen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds">budget earbuds</a> promising to provide sweat-ready tunes for a fraction of the cost. One of the only ones that have made that promise and come close to offering the quality of Jabra’s Elite series is Anker’s Soundcore brand, though their noise canceling and sound signature aren’t quite as robust.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:636px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.13%;"><img id="HQEEdzEiUm3RYV3HU7EbVY" name="tshaka-earbuds-2.JPG" alt="Wireless earbuds on surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HQEEdzEiUm3RYV3HU7EbVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="636" height="357" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Jabra is a major player in the space, and it’s almost always a bad thing to see competition go away. Less competition often allows other manufacturers to rest on their laurels and slow down innovation. Even Jabra suffered from this to a degree, only offering AAC and SBC codec support with no Dolby Atmos support on the new Elite 8 Active Gen 2. Companies like Sennheiser have eschewed certain innovations like Atmos, and Apple’s top earbuds support only AAC, ignoring innovations like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">aptX</a> Lossless.</p><p>That isn’t to excuse Jabra for not offering such innovations and conveniences but rather to question market demand. To put it another way, Jabra does durable, gym-ready, all-around use earbuds with solid call quality well, and over the years, it has focused on improving the things that matter most: noise cancellation, transparency mode, call quality, and IP ratings.</p><p>Continuously seeking to perfect their strengths is great. However, with the race to lossless audio going full throttle and LC3 promising broadcast capabilities that will make Bluetooth connectivity publicly accessible in a profound way, GN’s In-N-Out burger-style formula of sticking only to what they do best and thriving in that space looks like it wasn’t going to work as well for them as it does for the highly lauded burger franchise.</p>

<p>So, what’s next? Should you still consider buying Jabra’s latest wireless earbuds if the lineup is being put to rest? Well, the short answer is yes.</p><p>According to the press release, GN will reduce the inventory of affected products, which they expect to have completed by the end of 2024. The company has stated that they will continue to service and support their products for “several years.” You’ll still be able to pick up the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 and Elite 10 Gen 2 later in June, but after that, as Porky Pig was known to say, “That’s all folks!”</p>
