<p>Unlike a lot of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-preorder-deals">Pixel 9 preorder offers</a> I&apos;ve seen so far, this deal doesn&apos;t require you to upgrade your wireless service to receive the savings, making it a great opportunity for folks (like yours truly) who prefer to buy their devices unlocked. Best Buy is apparently being pretty generous about the phones it&apos;s accepting for trade-in, too; I plugged in my old Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and got the max $1,099 off the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, effectively making the new device free. And again, there&apos;s the $200 gift card to sweeten the deal. </p><p>Use Best Buy&apos;s trade-in tool to see how much trade-in credit you&apos;re eligible to receive before you commit to the offer, but if you&apos;re lucky, you just might get a free unlocked Pixel 9 out of the deal. </p>

It blew everyone&apos;s minds and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/superhot-vr-outsells-superhot-pc/" target="_blank">sold more copies</a> than the non-VR version after only two years on the market.</p>

<p>The latest data we have is a few years old but shows that SUPERHOT VR has made the company well over $50 million in revenue, making it one of the best-selling VR games ever. Yet, here we are nearly a decade later and somehow still have no official sequel. It&apos;s still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games/7">best Meta Quest games</a> despite its age because, for lack of a more modern term, it very much feels like the "Mario 64 of VR."</p><p>Thankfully, nDreams and Meatspace have answered the call and created Vendetta Forever, a game announced at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vr-games-showcase-2024-announcement">2024 VR Games Showcase</a>, which includes a demo you can play on your Quest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/7392594197533540/"><strong>right now</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="lo-kill-motion-2">LO-KILL-MOTION</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DhJFGhvZzevdseLAvkEbzc" name="Vendetta-Forever-Announce-SC-04.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of Vendetta Forever on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DhJFGhvZzevdseLAvkEbzc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: nDreams)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The game&apos;s entire premise revolves around a cute pun on the word "locomotion," a word that&apos;s normally used to describe how you move in a VR game. SUPERHOT VR was purposefully limited in this area as it was intended to be playable by anyone, regardless of whether the virtual motion in VR makes you sick or not. Players in that game only physically move their bodies. It&apos;s not possible to virtually move your character with a joystick.</p><p>However, VR gaming (and its gamers) has evolved significantly since the original SUPERHOT VR release. Essentially, all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/section/258035155854818/">top-selling Meta Quest games</a> in any given week task players with moving around virtually, whether it&apos;s using a joystick, like in a traditional game, or moving yourself like a monkey with your arms in Gorilla Tag.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Vendetta Forever upgrades SUPERHOT VR's gameplay by introducing a unique locomotion mechanic: grabbing fallen enemies weapons to warp to them.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Vendetta Forever upgrades SUPERHOT VR&apos;s gameplay by introducing a unique teleporting mechanic that should keep even ultra-sensitive players from feeling sick, yet, still gives them a more modern feeling of freedom of movement. From what I can tell, it&apos;s the next-generation version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sidequestvr.com/app/9575/bang-bang-slice-alpha">Bang Bang Slice (Alpha)</a>, a game from the same developer that was released in 2022.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uoyFCFBHNbjJAVnzWZ7yAe" name="Vendetta-Forever-Announce-SC-08.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of Vendetta Forever on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uoyFCFBHNbjJAVnzWZ7yAe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: nDreams)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Vendetta Forever's locomotion feels like the perfect hybrid of Pistol Whip and the lesser-known Rogue Ascent.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The developers briefly describe it as "shoot to kill, kill to move," which means that when you kill an enemy, they drop their weapon, allowing you to teleport to the weapon by remotely grabbing it. It&apos;s the simplest mechanic you can think of, yet it evokes a powerful feeling of badassery that&apos;s eminently important for a game like this.</p><p>In fact, Vendetta Forever&apos;s locomotion feels like the perfect hybrid of Pistol Whip and the lesser-known Rogue Ascent, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-free-hand-tracking-apps-and-games-oculus-quest">best hand-tracking games</a>. There&apos;s a slight slow motion triggered as you teleport, but it&apos;s not like the time-moves-when-you-move mechanic of SUPERHOT. This feels faster in an almost superhuman way.</p><p>Here&apos;s an illustration so you can better understand it:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iwX8nUTfsuUY2Vsrw8RXh6" name="vendetta-forever-lo-kill-motion.gif" alt="Using the unique grab-and-teleport locomotion system in Vendetta Forever on Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iwX8nUTfsuUY2Vsrw8RXh6.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: nDreams)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>There are over 60 levels and more than 50 challenges throughout the game.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It&apos;s one of those amazing classic arcade-style mechanics that gives you room to improve over time, meaning you can replay levels to your heart&apos;s content and get a better score as your skills improve. What&apos;s particularly impressive is that there are over 60 levels and more than 50 challenges throughout the game, meaning there&apos;s <em>a lot</em> of replayability value here.</p><p>Scoring is similar to Pistol Whip in that you&apos;ll compete with friends on online leaderboards, and a modifier system similar to Pistol Whip is included in Vendetta Forever, as well. It&apos;s also impressive just how difficult some of these levels are, especially if you&apos;re planning to get anywhere near the top of the leaderboard.</p><p>The playable demo consists of 5 levels, each of which carries a very different theme, set of weapons, and even color scheme to differentiate itself.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KMgjsGxR2MLP3oDxr94gad" name="Vendetta-Forever-Announce-SC-01.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of Vendetta Forever on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KMgjsGxR2MLP3oDxr94gad.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: nDreams)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the levels in the demo sees you at a Russian Roulette table, complete with a pistol. This particular level tasks you with taking out the entire table of bad guys as quickly as you can. My best time is 1.6 seconds so far, and I felt pretty good about that time until I looked at the scored leaderboard.</p><p>Even in the early access demo — which was likely only played by a few dozen folks — I was in 9th place at that time. I could hardly believe it until I dialed down into the score and realized it wasn&apos;t just clear time or kills that got you points but also if you got hit, got headshots, etc. It&apos;s a lot to happen in 1.6 seconds, but boy, is it exhilarating!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="o9kuHw99KMUYuWoKk6W7DT" name="vendetta-forever-katana.gif" alt="Using the katana to dash in Vendetta Forever on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o9kuHw99KMUYuWoKk6W7DT.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: nDreams)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And the weapon variety is second to none, too. One of SUPERHOT VR&apos;s coolest mechanics is being able to pick up anything and sling it at your opponent, or even punch them when there&apos;s nothing else to use, then steal your opponent&apos;s weapon to finish the level. Vendetta Forever turns that up several notches with over 50 weapons — 33 of which are types of guns — even including throwing knives and katanas.</p><p>Enemies slice apart like the fruit in Fruit Ninja, and throwing knives and ninja stars can be thrown in one or three group increments, meaning you can take out up to three enemies at once with a single throw. It&apos;s the perfect way to make you feel like you&apos;re a top-rated assassin or spy in a way most games fall flat on.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what is taking Superhot Team so long to make a sequel, but I&apos;m glad at least some other developers are taking up the mantle.</p><p>After you&apos;ve quenched your thirst on the demo, it won&apos;t be too long of a wait til the final game, either. Meatspace and nDreams are targeting an October 2024 release for Meta Quest 2, 3, Pro, and PlayStation VR2.</p>

<ul><li>Google Meet is starting to roll out a new update today (August 14), packed with a UI overhaul and a couple of new features.</li><li>The new calling layout is said to make it easier to reach the features you need while also introducing an "on-the-go" mode on Android and iOS.</li><li>Google recently started rolling out an update for Meet that brings Gemini to meetings for automatic AI-generated notes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Following the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google event</a>, the company is detailing a major overhaul for its video calling app on Android.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/meet/new-google-meet-features/">blog post</a>, the complete Google Meet overhaul kicked off by detailing how the update brings better accessibility to its features. The company states mobile users will find a new layout with call control buttons that "mirror" the meeting. This new layout features a text chat, giving folks who can&apos;t speak a chance to share links and more.</p><p>On top of that, it seems Google Meet is leaning on its AI prowess to toss in live captions during a call. The post adds that these captions are available in over 70 languages as its rollout begins.</p>

<p>The other side of this Meet rework is an "on-the-go" mode. Rolling out for Android and iOS, Google states this mode is audio-only supported with "larger, easier-to-press" controls. The company has implemented its call-switching function to Meet on mobile.</p><p>If you&apos;re on your computer, the post states that users can easily transfer the meeting to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> or tablet without missing a beat.</p><p>Screen sharing is also making its debut on mobile devices with this update. It seems to function similarly to the web-based variant. Users can quickly showcase photos and other content directly from their devices. Joining that is a small update to Google Meet&apos;s emojis, filters, and video backgrounds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:824px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.75%;"><img id="Q3LJyQZirvzZ6GSkVHwVaL" name="google-meet-stacked-effects-flairs.jpg" alt="Google is rolling out additional flair options for mobile-based Meet users, like "stacked effects."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q3LJyQZirvzZ6GSkVHwVaL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="824" height="583" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google states that its update to the "flair" side of Meet introduces "stack effects." Users on mobile can add a background to their video feed alongside a filter and "accessories." Moreover, this Android drop brings emoji reactions during meetings, a feature those on the web have access to already.</p><p>Despite the rollout beginning today, Google says it will continue over the "next few months." Meanwhile, users are advised to keep their Google Meet app updated as the feature&apos;s availability won&apos;t be the same for everyone.</p><p>Earlier this week, Google detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-gemini-note-taking-feature">another update hitting Meet</a>, which is set to let the service "take notes for me." The feature echoed Workspace&apos;s Duet AI in the sense that Gemini will handle the automatic AI-generated note-taking function. Users who join late can tap the pencil icon to see a brief meeting summary. Additionally, notes taken by the AI are saved into a document within the meeting owner&apos;s Drive.</p><p>They can then share those notes with everyone after the fact to ensure no one&apos;s left out of the loop.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL has a new design since it drops the previous camera visor that covers the entire back of previous models, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. Google keeps the new floating camera bar more toward the middle. The latest Pixel has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a>, which can withstand drops as high as one meter onto concrete surfaces.

<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL launches with a 6.8-inch Super Actua display (matching the S24 Ultra) that aims to provide you with very high brightness levels without forgoing clarity or vividness. The display has a 20:9 aspect ratio, an inferior 1344 x 2992 resolution, and 486 ppi compared to its competitor. It also boosts a 120Hz refresh rate, HDR support, and a higher peak brightness of 3,000 nits.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra also has a 6.8-inch Dynamic LTPO AMOLED display with a 19.5:9 ratio, a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and an Always-on display.

<p>Both phones have a lot to show off regarding hardware. The latest Pixel 9 Pro XL has an impressive 16GB of RAM and different storage options, including 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or a massive 1TB option (matching the S24 Ultra). Google also added its latest Tensor G4 processor to give you even more power when multitasking. There is also a Titan M2 security coprocessor and a substantial 5,060mAh battery with up to 100-hour battery life with Extreme Battery Saver.</p><p>Thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-charging-speed">fast charging</a>, the Pixel can get up to 70% of your charge in about 30 minutes. You can use the 45W USB charger, which you must buy the charger separately since it doesn&apos;t come in the box. The Pixel 9 Pro XL matches its Galaxy competitor with a primary 50MP Octa PD wide, which is accompanied by a 48MP ultrawide sensor with Macro Focus and a 48MP Quad PD telephoto unit with 5x optical zoom. Google has added a gorgeous 42MP Dual PD selfie camera with autofocus that selfie enthusiasts will love, myself included! Google also threw in a USB Type-C 3.2 matching the S24 Ultra.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S 24 Ultra has impressive features, such as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor and Adreno 750 GPU. Still, it falls behind in terms of the maximum amount of RAM it can offer, offering a maximum of 12GB. You can choose from storage options such as 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB.</p><p>There is not much difference in the battery size since the S24 Ultra has a 5,000mAh battery that can power all your tasks. There is a tie when it comes to charging since they both share 45W speeds. You also get 15W wireless charging and 4.5W reverse charging. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra camera</a> specs are fantastic, with a 200MP primary camera, a 12MP ultrawide sensor, a 10MP 3x telephoto camera f/2.4, and a 50MP 5x periscope telephoto camera. These cameras offer a great dynamic range. Samsung also added a USB type-C 3.2 port for faster transfer times when transferring your files elsewhere.</p>

<p>The phone you choose comes down to what&apos;s more important to you. Some users want a great camera, while others may care more about a big screen. But if you want a fantastic camera with a powerful processor, the S24 Ultra is the way to go. But that doesn&apos;t mean the Pixel 9 Pro XL is a poor choice. The downside to the new Pixel is that it will be more expensive than its predecessor since it&apos;s newer, so your budget will also play an essential part in which phone you get, but the S24 Ultra is also not easy on the wallet.</p><p>Google often releases features on Pixels faster than Galaxy phones, which is something to consider if you can&apos;t wait to try out the latest features. So, which phone sounds more tempting to you?</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> all promise more than a day&apos;s worth of battery life and even longer if you use the Extreme Battery Saver option. For fast charging, Google recommends using its in-house 45W fast charger. Even though all three phones support this same charger, the actual charging rates vary based on the model. The Pixel 9 and 9 Pro feature the same 4,700mAh battery capacity and can be charged up to 55% in 30 minutes. </p><p>The actual charging rate for both phones is 27W, with Google&apos;s 45W charger. The Pixel 9 Pro XL has a larger 5,060mAh battery, but Google claims its battery can charge up to 70% in 30 minutes. This is because the XL charges at 37W using the same adapter. </p><p>It&apos;s a similar story for fast wireless charging, too. Using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-stand-2nd-gen-charger-review">Google Pixel Stand (2nd Gen)</a>, the Pixel 9 can wirelessly charge up to 15W, while the Pixel 9 Pro can charge up to 21W, and the 9 Pro XL up to 23W. If you use your own Qi wireless charger, then all phones have a limited speed of up to 12W.

<p>The Google Pixel 9 is available in an Obsidian, Porcelain, Wintergreen, or Peony finish. Equipped with a 6.3-inch Actua OLED display with a 2,424 x 1,080 resolution, you get a refresh rate that can go from 60Hz up to 120Hz, depending on what’s needed for the application you’re using. It features rounded corners with a squared design and a new camera visor that houses dual cameras. </p><p>With a polished back and a soft metal finish frame, it has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> screen, making it a pretty durable phone. It’s also IP68 water and dust-resistant, adding to its rugged design, and has a fingerprint-resistant coating. </p><p>The screen can hit 1,800 nits brightness in HDR and 2,700 nits peak brightness, so you can confidently use it outdoors in bright sunlight and shouldn’t have any issues seeing the screen. </p><p>Available with either 128GB or 256GB storage, you’ll have to rely on cloud storage after that since there isn’t a microSD card slot. The 4,700mAh battery affords a day or more of battery life, which you can extend to up to four days using the Extreme Battery Saver mode. It also supports both fast charging using the optional Google 45W USB-C charger and wireless charging. With Battery Share, you can recharge your phone or other compatible devices, like a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-launch">Google Pixel Buds</a>. </p><p>Additional features include fingerprint and face unlock along with pattern PIN and password. There are stereo speakers and three mics with noise suppression along with Spatial Audio support. </p><p>As with all the latest Google Pixel phones, you don’t have to worry about this one becoming outdated quickly. Google promises seven years of OS and security updates, along with frequent Pixel feature drops through this same timeframe.</p>

<p>Comparatively, the Samsung Galaxy S24 comes in Cobalt Violet, Amber Yellow, Onyx Black, and Marble Grey. Samsung offers its own exclusive colors when purchasing directly, including Sapphire Blue, Sandstone Orange, and Jade Green. </p><p>Employing a unified design similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S23,</a> for those familiar with that phone, this phone has a flat front and back with rounded edges and a soft finish similar to the Google Pixel 9. It is made of Armor Aluminum, which is lighter than steel and comes with a Corning Gorilla Armor screen, making it slightly more durable. The three cameras are positioned in a vertical row on the back. </p><p>The screen is 6.2 inches in size, so it’s a smidge smaller, which also makes the phone itself a hair smaller as well. It’s also quite a bit lighter in weight. The screen is a dynamic AMOLED 2x FHD+ with a 2,340 x 1,080 resolution, slightly lower in resolution. With Vision Booster, you can get up to 2,600 nits peak brightness, which stands up to the Google Pixel 9 in this respect. It has the same 120Hz refresh rate as well. </p><p>It has the same IP68 water and dust-resistant rating, but the Samsung Galaxy S24 4,000mAh battery likely won’t last as long on a single charge. It supports both fast and wireless charging, as well as Wireless PowerShare for using the phone’s battery to recharge other compatible devices, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds</a>. Expect to get about a day’s worth of life per charge, which is less for heavier users. </p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 comes with the same non-expandable 128GB or 256GB storage variants. It has stereo speakers as well as face and fingerprint unlock. Like the Google Pixel 9, you get seven years of software and security updates with this phone.</p>

<p>Let’s look at what these two phones can actually do. </p><p>Equipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, the Google Pixel 9 is powered by the Google Tensor G4 processor. It has an impressive 12GB RAM, so you can be confident that it will keep up with all your multi-tasking needs, even activities like video streaming and gaming. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9 has all the usual AI features that you’ll find in other recent Pixel devices, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a>. These include seamless access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-google-messages">Google Gemini</a> and AI assistance with everything from photos to composing messages, surfing the web, generating images, and more. </p><p>You’ll get Google VPN standard with the phone along with Google’s end-to-end security. Along with multi-layer hardware security are the tensor security core, Titan M2 security co-processor, anti-malware and anti-phishing protection, and spam protection. </p><p>The phone also comes with plenty of safety features, including satellite SOS, emergency SOS, crisis alerts, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-enable-car-crash-detection-pixel">car crash detection</a>, and Safety Check. Set up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, it has the Bluetooth 5.3 spec with dual antennas for enhanced quality and connection. There’s also NFC, Google Cast, and built-in GPS.</p>

<p>Support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> allows for versatile setups, such as a second screen if you’re using the phone for productivity. It also works seamlessly with Samsung SmartThings for adding it to a smart connected home.</p><p>Also running Android 14, the Samsung Galaxy S24 also includes Samsung One UI 6.1 for further customization and personalization over and above the stock Android experience. Powered by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor, you get only 8GB RAM, which is significantly less than with the Google Pixel 9. Both should yield favorable results, but if you tend to do a lot of intensive tasks, from gaming to video recording and multi-tasking, you might appreciate the extra RAM in the Google Pixel 9. </p><p>You’ll get all the same AI features through Google Gemini AI, including ones like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Android Central’s Nicholas Sutrich</a> calls his favorite feature (it’s also available in the Google Pixel 9). There are also features like Live Translate, Note Assist, Transcript Assist, generative photo editing, and more, all of which you’ll find in the Google Pixel 9, too.</p>

<p>Everyone uses their smartphones as cameras nowadays, so how these two phones perform for taking photos and videos as well as in post-editing is crucial. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9’s main camera has a 50MP wide sensor and affords up to 8x Super Res Zoom. It also has a 48MP Quad PD ultra-wide camera with Macro Focus. The front camera is where it falls short: it’s a measly 10.5MP. We’ll have to wait until we can try it out to determine if how well the photos looks when snapping selfies and other content with the front camera. </p><p>When it comes to photo editing, you get all the Google camera features you have come to know and love over the last few generations of devices, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>, Magic Eraser, Best Take, Photo Unblur, and Portrait Light. </p><p>Using the rear camera, you can take 4K videos with digital video zoom up to 7x and can shoot 4K videos using the front camera as well.

<p>How do the Samsung Galaxy S24 cameras compare? This phone also has a 50MP wide main camera, but its ultra-wide camera drops significantly in specs at just 12MP. It adds a 10MP telephoto camera as well, and the wide front camera isn’t much better at just 12MP. You get up to 30x space zoom, though, and 3x optical zoom. </p><p>Samsung adds the ProVisual Engine to this phone, an AI tool that helps power its intelligent features, many of which work just like they do in the Google Pixel 9. This includes everything from generative edit, which works like Magic Editor. Samsung adds some unique features as well, like Edit Suggestion, which recommends how to tweak a photo to improve it, and flaw detection that will help eliminate the possibility of taking a bad photo. </p><p>You can leverage AI features while taking videos as well, like instant slo-mo whereby AI will generate the additional frames to help fill in the blanks.</p>

<p>It’s a tough comparison when looking at the Google Pixel 9 vs. Samsung Galaxy S24. The Google Pixel 9 is the newer of the two phones, but the Samsung Galaxy S24 is not even a year old yet. Both give you seven years of OS and software updates, so you’re in a good position when it comes to longevity. They also both feature the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini AI</a> features along with photo editing features that match one another. </p><p>The decision may come down to nothing more than brand preference. The Google Pixel 9 does have more RAM and a slightly higher-resolution screen. Samsung adds a telephoto camera, but its ultra-wide camera doesn’t have as high of a resolution, though its front camera might be a tad better when looking at specs alone. </p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 has a more refined design and an Armor Aluminum finish, which ranks among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">the best Android phones</a>. However, both phones are rugged and meet water and dust resistance ratings. They’re equally great for productivity and entertainment. </p><p>The bottom line is that you won’t go wrong with either of these phones, which come in around the same price. If you’re familiar with Samsung Galaxy devices and like them, and if you own or plan to buy other Galaxy devices like Galaxy Buds or even smart home gear like a Samsung TV or appliances, you’ll want to stick with the Galaxy phone.</p><p>Conversely, if you are upgrading from an older model Pixel or even an Android phone of another brand, you’ll find the Google Pixel phones blazingly simple to use and intuitive. Plus, they work well with other Google devices, from Google Pixel Buds to your smart home speakers and more.</p>

For the fastest charging speeds, you need a Google Pixel Stand (Gen 2).</p></article></section>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-about-qi-wireless-charging-2">What you need to know about Qi wireless charging</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the latest Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL models don&apos;t have Qi2 wireless charging. When Google was asked why it didn&apos;t include Qi2 in its latest Pixel lineup, the company said that it doesn&apos;t see a large demand for the feature. This is similar to what Samsung said about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-dropped-the-ball-qi2-galaxy-s24">not bringing Qi2</a> to the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>Instead, Pixel 9 users must continue to use their new Android phone without the Qi2 technology <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">iPhone users have already been enjoying</a>. In fact, there is only one Android phone that supports Qi2 at the time of writing, and it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">one you wouldn&apos;t expect</a>. However, you can still enjoy Qi wireless charging, although not at the speed they would like, since Qi wireless charging technology only offers anywhere from 5W to 15W. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.00%;"><img id="8wezwUmtxJrt3pQ3Fqh2XM" name="Google-Pixel-9-charger-3.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8wezwUmtxJrt3pQ3Fqh2XM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1680" height="1008" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit:  Arsène Lupin / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s important to remember that you can get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-will-stifle-innovation">Qi2</a> charger, but if your phone doesn&apos;t have Qi2 technology, your phone won&apos;t get the total 15W of wireless charging. Qi2 wireless charging offers faster charging speed and creates less heat since the charging coils are always correctly aligned thanks to the magnetic alignment, which enhances charging speeds.</p><p>With Qi wireless charging (not Qi2), the magnets can misalign when you get notifications if your phone vibrates, preventing your phone from being perfectly aligned. Or maybe you bump into the tablet you&apos;re charging your phone on and move it. However, by having Qi2, it&apos;s less likely your phone will stop charging or not get the full 15W that Qi2 provides when these types of things happen. Not charging your phone properly with the Qi-certified charger can cause a loss of power, resulting in heat that will damage your phone&apos;s battery over time.</p><p>Since the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL don&apos;t have Qi2 wireless charging, using accessories such as the best magnetic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-tripod">tripods</a>, portable batteries, and wallets is not possible unless you use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe accessories for your Android phone</a>.</p><p>The main question here is, do you <em>need</em> Qi2? It all comes down to how fast you need your phone to charge your phone. Just because the latest Pixels don&apos;t have Qi2, it doesn&apos;t mean you can get a great wireless charging speed. When you use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-stand-2nd-gen-charger-review">Pixel Stand Gen 2</a>, it charges the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL wirelessly at 15W, 21W, and 23W, respectively, but only up to 12W with Qi-certified EPP <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads" target="_blank">wireless chargers</a>. So it all comes down to which chargers you use.</p>

With an IP rating, the first number represents the dust resistance, while the second represents water resistance. The "6" indicates complete protection against dust intrusion while the "8" means the phone can be continually immersed under 1 meter of water without any getting in.</p><p>While the Pixel 9 is highly water resistant, it&apos;s not technically waterproof as there is a possibility water will eventually get in. For the most part, you&apos;re safe from an accidental drop into the bathtub or swimming pool. You also don&apos;t need to worry about putting it away if you get stuck out in the rain. Still, you shouldn&apos;t use the phone underwater or deliberately submerge it without a special case.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review" target="_blank">Pixel 8</a> series was also IP68 rated, and if it gets wet, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7533279" target="_blank">Google Support recommends</a> immediately removing the phone from the water, turning it off, drying it with a cloth, and then allowing it to dry at room temperature to avoid damage. For example, the pins in the USB-C charging port will still be exposed to water, and the phone could be damaged if corrosion forms on the pins, so make sure it&apos;s dry before plugging it in.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the phone only maintains its water resistance as long as it&apos;s sealed to outside elements. If you crack the 6.3-inch or 6.8-inch OLED display on your Pixel 9 device, despite being made of tough <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a>, water could potentially make it into that crack, damaging the electronics. Similarly, the SIM card slot must be completely closed for the gasket to work properly. </p><p>With the powerful Tensor G4 SoC inside with 12GB of RAM on the Pixel 9 and 16GB on the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL, this phone is worth protecting. If you can keep the hardware in good condition, these phones should last you years, with Google even promising seven years of OS and security updates. The Google Pixel 9, like its predecessor, will more than likely be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> for quite a while, and it&apos;s a nice perk that Google has committed to longevity with long-term software support as well as durable hardware.</p><p>Thus, you&apos;ll want to make sure you protect these phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">Pixel 9</a>/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">Pixel 9 Pro XL cases</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-screen-protectors">Pixel 9</a>/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-screen-protectors">Pixel 9 Pro XL screen protectors</a>.</p>

An update coming to the Magic 6 Pro will enable the feature starting August 27.</p><p>While you won&apos;t be able to control your car with the phone — that was done via a unique app designed to control the custom servos and motors installed in the demo car — there are plenty of mundane use-cases Honor is touting, including pulling up notifications and opening apps just by looking at your phone.</p><p>Honor is going all-in on AI to differentiate its devices, and MagicOS 8.0 brings a slate of features in this area. Magic Portal continues to be a unique addition that makes it easier to pull up useful information or add actionable items from messaging threads seamlessly.</p><p>The Magic 6 Pro is still one of the best phones around, offering a gorgeous design and stellar cameras. The eye-tracking feature is exclusive to the device, but given the investment Honor made in the tech, it isn&apos;t hard to predict most of the brand&apos;s upcoming phones also getting the same.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-about-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-water-resistance-2">What you need to know about the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold water resistance</h2>
<p>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) gives users this rating to indicate how careful they should be with their devices. The phone will be fine if you get caught in a rainstorm and have fresh water thrown at you for some reason. Other foldable phones are available with the same rating, for example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a>. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an IPX8 rating, meaning the IEC tested the phone for water resistance and received a high rating. The"8" in the rating (the second number) reveals how much water it can resist and indicates that you can drop it in freshwater as deep as 1.5 meters for as long as 30 minutes without it suffering permanent damage.</p><p>Since the IEC conducted the tests with fresh water, they gave the Pixel a rating that tells you to be careful with liquids such as sugary drinks, cleaning supplies, and similar liquids. You should also avoid exposing your phone to highly chlorinated pools and salt water, which could seriously damage it by weakening the parts and causing corrosion. The lowest number you&apos;ll see on a phone to indicate whether it is waterproof is a zero, with nine being the highest. A phone with the highest rating possible is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/blackview-bl8800-pro-review">Blackview BL88OO Pro</a>, with IP69K. The rating indicates that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> can withstand high-pressure water jets and dust, something you would find in food processing and pharmaceutical industry equipment.</p><p>The X in the IPX8 rating means that the company did not put the Google Pixel 9 Fold through testing for dust resistance. This doesn&apos;t necessarily mean it&apos;s not dust-resistant, but the company did not provide any testing details. You can protect your phone from dusty areas by placing it in a dustproof bag or by purchasing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-cases">Pixel 9 Pro Fold case</a>. Immediately dry it with a soft microfiber cloth if it gets wet, especially as the phone gets older. You can follow various cleaning tips to keep your new Pixel phone in tip-top condition by knowing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-clean-and-disinfect-your-android-smartphone#section-how-to-clean-your-phone-by-hand">how to clean and disinfect your Android phone</a>.</p><p>So, the next time you want to see if a phone is dust and waterproof, you can read it by knowing that the first number refers to its dust resistance, zero being the lowest and six being the highest. The second number refers to how waterproof the device is, with zero being the lowest and nine being the highest.</p><p>Keep in mind that daily wear and tear can degrade the IPX8 rating over time and reduce water resistance. Rough handling and falls can also damage the gaskets and seals. Avoid exposing your phone to extreme temperatures as much as possible to keep the IPX8 strong for as long as possible. If you want a Pixel with a high water and dustproof rating, you can also go with either the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, or Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p>
