<ul><li>A report claims that Spotify is interested in raising the prices of its "basic" by a dollar and its duo plan by $2 in certain markets worldwide.</li><li>Alleged sources state Spotify will also introduce a new basic tier, which will include music and podcasts minus access to audiobooks.</li><li>Spotify's "supremium" tier is still on the way as a brief mention shows it's still under development.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new report suggests Spotify is preparing to increase prices for its streaming services and develop new Premium plans.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/spotify-is-changing-how-it-charges-customers-with-new-plans-and-prices?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> states that Spotify is interested in raising the price of its "basic" plan by $1 and its duo service by $2 in certain markets worldwide. Sources claim that the UK, Australia, and Pakistan consumers will see these increases take effect by the end of April.</p><p>The U.S. is also participating in the price hike wave, though it will allegedly take place "later this year."</p><p>The report adds that Spotify is also looking into adding more subscription plans for consumers to drive revenue. Those familiar with the matter said the company is preparing a new "basic" tier with music and podcasts but forgo audiobooks. This plan may cost $11, which is the cost of a Premium plan for a single user.</p><p>There are more "new pricing options" that Spotify is working on, but nothing further was detailed.</p><p>Spotify&apos;s "supremium" plan was briefly mentioned, and it looks like the tier is still under development. Users who grab that subscription would be granted HiFi audio for a steeper price.</p><p>Bloomberg states Spotify&apos;s reasoning behind its alleged impending price hike is to "cover the cost of audiobooks." The audio service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify-premium-challenges-audible-monthly-audiobooks">launched audiobooks</a> for Premium users in November 2023. The feature came with over 200,000 titles that users could listen to for "free" for 15 hours per month. You would then have to spend an additional $12.99 to give yourself an extra 10 hours of listening if you exceeded the initial cap.</p><p>Sources state Spotify has only generated revenue from users who have exceeded the initial allotted time for listening per month. The service then added an "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-audiobook-access-tier-rollout">Access</a>" tier that was cheaper for bookworms.</p><p>We&apos;ve been waiting on Spotify&apos;s "supremium" plan for a while, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-supremium-logo-features-rumor">the latest leaks</a> came in October 2023. It was suggested that not only would users receive HiFi (high fidelity) audio, but "Your Sound Capsule," "Highlights," and 24-bit lossless audio would join in.</p>

<ul><li>Owners of a Galaxy S23 device have started reporting problems with the line after installing the One UI 6.1 update.</li><li>Problems include issues with the biometrics (fingerprint) scanner, which isn't picking up a user's finger and forcing them to re-attempt a scan to unlock their phones.</li><li>Other users on Samsung's forums report having problems with the device's charging, stating it isn't charging at its maximum strength.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We&apos;re virtually a week into the reception of One UI 6.1 for Samsung&apos;s past-gen devices, and a couple of glaring problems are appearing.</p><p>Users have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1bql7sw/fingerprint_issue_after_one_ui_61_update/">taken to Reddit</a> to report problems with the biometrics (fingerprint) reader of their Galaxy S23 Ultra following One UI 6.1 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/03/galaxy-s23-fingerprint-sensor-one-ui-6-1-update/">9to5Google</a>). The user states that their "fingerprint sensor randomly doesn&apos;t register my input" when attempting to unlock their device.</p><p>They add that no apparent error is appearing. They are forced to lift and press their finger against the screen again to restart the process. Other S23 Ultra owners <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1bql7sw/comment/kx4edo7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">chimed into the thread</a>, stating they encountered the same issue shortly after downloading and installing the One UI 6.1 update.</p><p>Most users state that they are required to touch their finger against the scanner twice for it to work, considering it fails on the first attempt. This doesn&apos;t appear to happen <em>all </em>the time but is instead sporadic.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1brbbel/oneui_61_s23_bug_with_fingerprint_scanner/">Another thread</a> discussed the same problem but involved a base Galaxy S23 model. The user stated the scanner isn&apos;t "working immediately" and causes them to wait "three to four seconds" before their device realizes they&apos;re attempting entry. One user commented, saying they&apos;ve encountered this problem on their S23 FE.</p><p>Elsewhere, users took to Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S/Battery-charger-restricted-to-15w-in-oneui-6-1-update/m-p/15831358/highlight/true#M87244">community forums</a> to discuss charging and heating problems with the Galaxy S23 series (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/02/samsung-one-ui-6-1-charging-heat-issues-report/">9to5Google</a>). The user&apos;s screenshot showed that their device only charged at 15W instead of its max 25W capability. Other users reported that their device was running a little warmer than usual.</p>

<p>There could be some good news here as we&apos;re just getting into April, which means Samsung will start pushing this month&apos;s security patch to its slew of devices. The Galaxy S24 started receiving it quite early, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/some-samsung-devices-are-already-getting-the-april-update-with-camera-improvements">at the end of March</a>. Perhaps Samsung will delay its April patch for the Galaxy S23 series to work in a fix. If not, users may have to wait until May before seeing relief.</p><p>Samsung started rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-ai-announcement">One UI 6.1 update</a> packed with Galaxy AI features to its past-gen devices on March 28 in the U.S. The entire Galaxy S23 series was eligible for the update, which notably involves the devices users have reported problems with since the update became available. Galaxy AI&apos;s features also graced the Galaxy Z Flip 5, Fold 5, and Tab S9 series.</p><p>Users of these devices can now access Google&apos;s "Circle to Search," Live Translate, Chat Assist, and more.</p>

<ul><li>Hidden features in Android 15's latest developer preview suggest a potential revamp for icons like battery and Wi-Fi signals.</li><li>Google may introduce a horizontal battery icon to accommodate the battery level indicator within it.</li><li>There might also be improvements in haptic feedback for various interactions in Android 15.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is not expected to have major visual overhauls, Google appears to be brewing some nice tweaks for the next mobile update, such as snazzier status bar icons and more.</p><p>Android expert Mishaal Rahman, writing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-new-status-bar-3430578/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, did some digging and unlocked some hidden features in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">Android 15&apos;s second developer preview</a>. Apparently, Google might be revamping the icons at the top of your screen, like the battery and Wi-Fi signals.</p><p>Instead of the usual smooth icons, these new ones would be broken into segments, making it easier to see how strong your connection is at a glance.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google might flip the battery icon on its side, going from vertical to horizontal. This change means the battery level indicator can fit right inside the battery icon instead of next to it. But if you&apos;re not feeling it, you can always turn that off.</p>

<p>These tweaks might seem minor, but for users who prefer getting quick and clear information at a glance, they could come in really handy.</p><p>In the current version of Android, the icons for Wi-Fi, cellular signal, and battery life are just simple bars that fill up depending on how strong they are. They also turn white or dark, depending on your phone&apos;s theme. A separate spot shows the battery percentage, but you might have to turn that on in your settings.</p><p>Rahman also mentions that Google is stepping up the haptic feedback game in Android 15. So, when you tap or hold down on a quick settings toggle in the notification shade, you&apos;ll feel a slight vibration. And it doesn&apos;t stop there—when you slide the volume up or down using touch, thanks to the brightness adjuster, you&apos;ll feel that feedback, too.</p><p>These new features are currently hidden in a special testing version of Android 15 meant for developers (it is not super stable, so avoid putting it on your main phone). We&apos;ll have to wait for the official Android 15 release to see if Google decides to include these tweaks.</p>

<ul><li>Oura announces the launch of "Oura Labs," an optional in-app experience its members can join within the main app to playtest features in development.</li><li>Users will be treated to "Symptom Radar," a feature that informs them of sudden changes in their biometrics and prompts them to seek rest instead of daily goals.</li><li>Oura Labs is available for all of its smart ring devices.

<hr>
<p>Oura is bringing its users behind the curtain with a new app that lets their feedback directly impact the future of its development for new features.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240403398484/en/%C5%8CURA-Introduces-Oura-Labs-A-New-In-App-Innovation-Hub-for-Members">press release</a>, the company is introducing "Oura Labs," an in-app experience interested parties can access to test experimental features. The post states this new testing environment has been added to the Oura Membership experience.</p><p>With its introduction, Oura members can playtest "Symptom Radar." The feature is designed to help users understand how their bodies react to fatigue, high activity levels, and illness. Symptom Radar is said to alert users to these changes in their bodies as they appear in their biometrics before we physically notice them.</p><p>The feature bases its judgment on a user&apos;s baseline when their biometrics are in the green. If the numbers begin to deviate, Oura states it will notify users to activate "Rest Mode" or adjust their previously set daily goals to avoid excess strain. After, Symptom Radar is said to deactivate to give users time to rest properly.</p>

<p>The Finnish brand states that all features wrapped in its Labs experience are subject to be removed, reworked, or added permanently to the main app. Oura Labs is available on all of its smart rings for iOS members. The post doesn&apos;t state when (or if) Android users can expect to see its test environment.</p><p>If you have an iOS device, you can experiment with Labs by tapping the hamburger menu at the top left of the Oura app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/26055991315859-Oura-Labs">to get started</a>. The company&apos;s support page states that if a feature users are testing is removed, they will receive a notification and a prompt to deliver feedback.</p><p>Alongside new features, Oura states its "Labs" environment will let users gain deeper insight into published research studies made possible by its devices. Additionally, Oura adds that its members can participate in its research studies and those conducted by its partners or academic institutions.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>In today&apos;s digital world, our personal information is everywhere. We use it to shop online, access bank accounts, and connect with loved ones. Unfortunately, this convenience comes with a risk: data breaches.</p><p>It seems like we see at least one major data breach every year. In 2024 (so far) we&apos;ve seen AT&T tell us about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/73-million-atandt-accounts-leaked">a massive breach</a> of over 70 million customer&apos;s info, and we&apos;ve also seen the same from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-2023-data-breach">T-Mobile</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">Verizon</a>. Other companies aren&apos;t immune, of course, but there&apos;s a good chance you&apos;re a customer of one of these carriers because they provide service for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a>. You should be concerned.</p>
<p>Amazingly, this doesn&apos;t happen more often. Huge companies hold data about hundreds of millions of customer accounts, and that&apos;s a juicy peach for bad actors looking for a quick way to get data. At the risk of sounding like a corporate apologist, most companies are doing a lot to prevent data breaches. They can&apos;t get it right every time, though.</p><p>You don&apos;t have any control over your data once it&apos;s in the hands of another. You&apos;re at the mercy of the practices and security of companies like AT&T, who try to keep it safe. That doesn&apos;t mean you <em>shouldn&apos;t</em> do anything, though.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-data-breach-2">What is a data breach?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1151px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="PAR9KhoatfG9aLtnhpNYyi" name="hacker.jpg" alt="A computer hacker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PAR9KhoatfG9aLtnhpNYyi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1151" height="647" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Kaspersky)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A data breach is the unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive information. This could include anything from your name and address to your Social Security number or credit card details. </p><p>This can happen in many ways; someone may gain unauthorized access to a company&apos;s internal network through an exploit, an employee could decide to go rogue, enterprise-grade malware can be injected into a server, or employee devices can be stolen and used to gain access.</p><p>None of the how matters to you and me because we can&apos;t do anything about it. We have to trust that the companies we do business with are doing everything they can to prevent it. But you should still care and do your part.</p>
<p>A data breach can have a dramatic impact and the consequences are far-reaching. As a customer of a business which has experienced a data breach, you could face:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Financial Loss:</strong> Hackers can use stolen financial information to make unauthorized purchases or open new accounts in your name.</li><li><strong>Identity Theft:</strong> Data breaches can be a stepping stone for identity theft, where criminals use your information to impersonate you and potentially rack up debt or even commit crimes.</li><li><strong>Damaged Credit Score:</strong> Fraudulent activity can wreak havoc on your credit score, making it difficult to secure loans or rent an apartment.</li><li><strong>Emotional Distress:</strong> Dealing with the aftermath of a data breach can be stressful and time-consuming. Don't discount this aspect even though it's not very "technical".</li></ul>
<p>None of that sounds good. And to be honest, none of it may happen even when your data is leaked out. A company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-sued-over-recent-data-breach">required by law</a> to report a breach of customer data, no matter how small, and most of the time customers see no immediate impact when it happens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="4spABXLZQoBv4T9qd8mPVj" name="credit-karma.jpg" alt="Credit karma" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4spABXLZQoBv4T9qd8mPVj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The issue is that your data is out there and available. There are websites and forums where this sort of data is bought and sold every day. You hear crazy stories about the "Dark Web," and some are real. If I had the desire and the money, I could buy a bundle of names and credit card numbers this afternoon. So could you. So could someone who wants to try and use them to steal money from people like us.</p>
<p>This is why you need to pay attention and do your part when it happens. The affected company will have some guidelines you should follow, so be sure to follow what they suggest. In the most recent example as of writing, AT&T has forced all customers to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/support/article/my-account/000101995?">create a new passcode</a> and suggests that you monitor your credit report. If a breach is severe, a company may also offer free identity and credit monitoring services. Please take advantage of them.</p><p>Other steps worth considering are changing all your account passwords, contacting your bank and credit card companies so they can flag your accounts for monitoring, or even placing a freeze notice on your credit report so no new accounts can be opened in your name.</p>
<p>That said, the best things you can do happen <em>before</em> a data breach. They&apos;re things you should be doing anyway, and they can dramatically limit the damage from a data breach. They&apos;re also pretty easy:</p>
<ul><li>Be cautious online, and never click any link from someone you don't trust.</li><li>Use 2FA (<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">two-factor authentication</a>) for every account or service offering it.</li><li>Use a VPN if you need to use public wi-fi regularly.</li><li>Keep the software on all your connected devices up to date.</li></ul>
<p>Data breaches are a concern in today&apos;s digital age and will only become more commonplace. Understanding the risks and taking preventative measures can minimize the damage and protect your personal information, even when billion-dollar companies don&apos;t get it right.</p><p>For further insight into data security and breach response, visit the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Identity Theft Resource Center</a> (ITRC) webpage for information and up-to-date notices of data breaches.</p>

<p>WhatsApp Messenger is down for thousands of users on Wednesday, April 3, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/metas-whatsapp-down-thousands-downdetector-shows-2024-04-03/">Reuters</a>. </p><p>The outage, which began around 2 p.m. ET today, has impacted WhatsApp users worldwide. Users reported issues connecting to WhatsApp in several countries, with the app stuck on "connecting." For some, WhatsApp is allowing users to send messages. However, those messages aren&apos;t being delivered. </p><p>The official X account for the messaging app posted a message stating that its team is working on getting things back on track as soon as possible.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/whatsapp/">Downdetector</a>, a website that tracks outages and user reports, over 23,000 users reported an outage in the U.S. In comparison, data showed that more than 20,000 users in India, about 46,000 in the United Kingdom, and over 42,000 in Brazil have reported problems with the platform.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We know some people are experiencing issues right now, we're working on getting things back to 100% for everyone as quickly as possible<a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1775598113769623703">April 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Meta&apos;s outage page stated that the app is experiencing &apos;major disruptions&apos; in service on &apos;On-Premise API.&apos; This issue started at around 2:10 p.m. ET. </p><p>"Our engineering teams are investigating the issue. We will provide another update within 4 hours or sooner if additional information is available."</p><p>Some users have reported experiencing issues with Instagram and Facebook Messenger that began around the same time. Meta&apos;s outage page attributes these disruptions to the same ongoing issue. </p><p>For some lucky folks, the messaging app is back up and running, which means it is slowly being restored.</p>

<p>Motorola unveiled its next mid-range smartphone today (Apr. 3), the Edge 50 Pro, for the Indian market.

<p>The Edge 50 Pro&apos;s decent 4500mAh battery capacity is paired with 125W TurboPower charging support that keeps the device going. The mid-range phone also supports 50W wireless charging and 10W reverse charging. The company provides 68W in the box for the base storage and charges an additional amount for the 12W charging adapter, which also gives an additional storage variant.</p><p>The Edge 50 Pro has a triple rear camera system with a 50MP primary camera aided by a 13MP ultra wide-angle and another 10MP telephoto sensor. On the front, another 50MP selfie shooter comes with AI-powered enhancement modes similar to the rear camera system.

<p>We no longer need expensive accessories or dedicated cameras to capture stunning shots of the world as we see it. Even the simplest, most mundane of things can be made to look stunning when photographed properly.</p><p>Back in the day, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">mobile photographers</a> were laughed at, and understandably so. Technology wasn&apos;t at the point where lenses built into phones could dare to compete with the prowess of professional cameras.</p><p>However, rapid advancements in smartphone photography have made it possible for your average Joe to shoot some delightful pictures. Some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android flagships</a> can easily deliver professional-looking images. Powerful editing tools put the finishing touch. Even budget phones can get you unbelievably good photos — you just need to know the right angle.</p><p>Believe it or not, I use my phone for almost every single one of my review images. If you&apos;re looking to level up your mobile photography game, let me share a few simple tips and tricks that I have picked up over the years. This guide avoids jargon and long, complicated words such as bifocal length or aperture for the sake of simplicity and ease. You don&apos;t even need to use the pro mode, just follow some of these tips and see where it takes you.</p>
<h2 id="lighting-is-everything-2">Lighting is everything</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LmBSLmMxrfGrwJyWv9Li75" name="google-pixel-8-pro-display-outside.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 8 Pro's vibrant display outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LmBSLmMxrfGrwJyWv9Li75.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This one is fairly obvious, but it&apos;s the first rule of mobile photography. The light conditions can make or break your photo. Ideally, you want to capture images during the daytime with lots of natural light in the form of golden sunlight. This makes a world of difference and just makes it so easy to get a good shot.</p><p>Make sure that the light source is above your subject or in front of it. You don&apos;t want the light to be behind the subject because that casts ugly shadows which mess up the final image. This is why night photography is so tricky as opposed to the morning or afternoon, because the sun sheds light evenly across the land whereas the night has no natural light source save for the moon and man-made lamps.</p><p>At night or in poor low-light conditions, flash isn&apos;t always the way to go. Try to choose the constantly lit-up flash for a steady source of light. This can usually be done by tapping the flash option twice in the camera app. Even better, invest in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-ring-light">powerful ring light</a> to spread light evenly in the direction that you want. I prefer to use lights with customizable warmth, so I can see which temperature of white light looks best for my low-light shot.</p>
<h2 id="anything-looks-good-from-the-right-angle-2">Anything looks good from the right angle</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3724px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="pJ4zjoy544m6cYA3ELFpvQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-s23-s22-cameras.jpg" alt="Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S22 cameras side by side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pJ4zjoy544m6cYA3ELFpvQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3724" height="2094" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Pointing and shooting are not enough; you need to shoot from the right angle for a truly stunning shot. Don&apos;t just take a single picture or a couple of them. Try out different positions and angles. Move the subject around if you&apos;re not content. I also find that moving my phone around to find just the right angle helps a lot.</p><p>Choose a good focal point depending on what you like or what you&apos;re trying to highlight, and then tilt the phone and move it high or low to find the right placement.

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="detZwD5aTj3g2xJ4Vjwv9J" name="OnePlus-Nord-N30-5G-cameras-01.jpg" alt="Taking a photo with the OnePlus Nord N30 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/detZwD5aTj3g2xJ4Vjwv9J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you whip out your phone and get ready to take a picture, think about the aspect ratio and orientation that will best suit the situation. Landscape images are more artistic and better suited for natural elements, whereas humans tend to look better in portrait images.</p><p>Selecting the aspect ratio can be a bit more challenging. Usually, the lens in use automatically changes based on the chosen aspect ratio. So, if you select a widescreen 16:9 ratio, the wide-angle lens will automatically be in use. Depending on the resolution of your phone&apos;s cameras, you might get a better or worse result.</p><p>In situations where your device has a terribly low-resolution lens, it is often smarter to capture the picture with the best lens and then crop it to your desired aspect ratio. For example, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap mid-range phone</a>&apos;s 2MP macro lens will most definitely give you garbage results. Instead, use the primary camera to get as close to the subject as possible and then crop it out. I can guarantee you will be much more pleased with the outcome.</p>
<h2 id="the-golden-ratio-and-rule-of-thirds-2">The golden ratio and rule of thirds</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="h6AQpeWJTGDxx9SacuHZMa" name="Google-Pixel-8-new-camera-ui.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Google Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h6AQpeWJTGDxx9SacuHZMa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Symmetrical photos might sound nice, but it is, in fact, the asymmetry of a scene that gives it such striking beauty. Placing your subject dead center isn&apos;t going to look as nice as a strategic, asymmetrical position. This is the basic thought behind what is known as the golden ratio in photography.</p><p>If you&apos;re an amateur photographer, you may or may not be familiar with the golden ratio. I&apos;m not going to give you an in-depth explanation of the Fibonacci sequence and where the ratio originates. That&apos;s why Google exists. All you need to know is that the spiral framework pictured below depicts the golden ratio. According to the golden ratio, your subject should be at the heart of the spiral for the optimal shot.</p><p>How can you ensure that your subject falls within the ideal spot when taking pictures with your phone? It&apos;s simple, just enable the grid option in your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-third-party-camera-app-android">camera app</a>. In some phones such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, you can can change the shape of the grid to the golden ratio within the camera app&apos;s settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2376px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.45%;"><img id="S3R7R7RrYxmyqeJhjz6xRA" name="camera-golden-ration-screenshot.jpg" alt="The golden ratio in the OnePlus 12R camera app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S3R7R7RrYxmyqeJhjz6xRA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2376" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just because the golden ratio exists, it doesn&apos;t strictly mean that you should only stick with that one spot of the frame. And that&apos;s where the rule of thirds steps in. If you split your image up into nine equal-sized sections, the ideal placement of your subject should be somewhere along the two-thirds bit. You can change the exact position according to the shot at hand.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2376px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.45%;"><img id="6RzZUVKomWTtdugn7ZSKLD" name="camera-grid-android-screenshot.jpeg" alt="The rule of thirds in the OnePlus 12R camera app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6RzZUVKomWTtdugn7ZSKLD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2376" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once again, using the grid makes it a lot easier to achieve this. Simply enable the option from your camera app and choose the standard option that splits your viewfinder into nine equal parts. Align your subject accordingly and voila! You have your photo.</p>
<h2 id="don-apos-t-underestimate-stability-and-level-2">Don&apos;t underestimate stability and level</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1425px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="TyxsY2YtvxsU2QJyNfoDVc" name="camera-level-gradienter-google-pixel-6-pro.jpg" alt="Camera level gradienter on the Google Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TyxsY2YtvxsU2QJyNfoDVc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1425" height="802" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A stable and steady hand will photograph a million times better than a shaky, tilted one. You want your shots to be perfectly horizontal or vertical in relation to the ground. There are several tricks for this. Any cheap selfie stick or stand can ensure steadiness. You can minimize shaking by using phone grips as well.</p><p>Another great idea is to enable the level gradienter in your camera app. You will see a line in the center of the camera viewfinder, as well as an angle usually. Sometimes, it might be depicted as a plus sign. The goal is to have a line that is completely flat and a zero-degree tilt angle, which means your camera is perfectly level.</p>
<h2 id="bright-contrasting-colors-and-color-theory-2">Bright contrasting colors and color theory</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sV8b4emBC3oKgvcGxsMhoK" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-17.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sV8b4emBC3oKgvcGxsMhoK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This mobile photography trick is usually applicable to inanimate objects like food and non-living things. However, it teaches an important lesson about colors and contrast which you could definitely apply across the board when taking pictures.</p><p>Let&apos;s say the subject is a dull, dreary object lacking any oomph or brightness. You can spice things up by using brightly contrasting colors. An example of this would be a black phone as your subject. Try using brightly colored backgrounds with color theory as your guide. Opposites attract, so pick colors that sit opposite to your subject&apos;s colors on the color wheel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="UfzoBGQLUfEJD2WkXTVkSC" name="canva-color-wheel-color-theory.jpg" alt="Color wheel on Canva" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UfzoBGQLUfEJD2WkXTVkSC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1896" height="1067" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Canva)</span></figcaption></figure>

I loathe recommendations in general and just want a minimal interface that offers easy access to the streaming services I use. It&apos;s no surprise, then, that I went all-in on Android TV. In the beginning, I just used the default Android TV implementation that came as standard on most TVs and projectors, and although the UI was lightweight, it was prone to lag.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>I realized a streaming device would solve the issue, and coincidentally, Xiaomi came out with an Android TV streaming box at the time, so I picked that up. While it was definitely a better experience than what most TVs offered, there was still an occasional lag, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-mi-box">Mi Box</a> would crash when playing high bitrate content.</p>
<p>So when NVIDIA introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review">Shield TV Pro</a> back in 2019, I bought a unit a few weeks after it went on sale. NVIDIA already had a great track record in this segment thanks to the 2015 and 2017 models of the Shield TV, and NVIDIA&apos;s insistence on rolling out timely updates was the deciding factor.</p>
<p>It took just a few days of use to realize that the Shield TV Pro was in a league of its own; the powerful hardware combined with the minimal Android TV interface made for a great pairing. NVIDIA also had a suite of exclusive features on the Shield TV Pro, including GameStream — which allowed local game streaming on the device — and AI upscaling, long before AI was a buzzword.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3aiKBJ35Kmd5QLGhiYzw5U" name="nvidia-shield-tv-pro-2.jpg" alt="NVIDIA Shield TV Pro against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3aiKBJ35Kmd5QLGhiYzw5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The AI-backed feature did a standout job upscaling SDR content, and it was a definite bonus. But where the Shield TV Pro truly came into its own was at Plex; it did a better job playing Plex content than any other device I&apos;d used up to that point. I liked the Shield TV Pro so much that I bought two additional units, and I use it throughout the house to this day. </p>
<p>Five years later, the Android TV ecosystem has fundamentally changed, but the Shield TV Pro continues to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">best streaming device</a>. As is its wont, Google decided to mess with Android TV, switching out the clean UI and introducing an ad-laden abomination in its stead that is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a>. Thankfully, none of my Shield TV Pro units have been updated to Google TV, and they&apos;re still running the older Android TV interface.</p>
<p>But where the Shield TV Pro truly stands out is its performance; after nearly five years of use, it is still just as fluid as the day I set it up. A big part of this is NVIDIA&apos;s continual update cadence that brings bug fixes and stability tweaks, and this is a rarity in the industry — I can&apos;t think of any other Android device that has gotten as many updates.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2aBaSEzPF8Lyx6K9LjRvNU" name="nvidia-shield-tv-pro-4.jpg" alt="NVIDIA Shield TV Pro against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2aBaSEzPF8Lyx6K9LjRvNU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, there have been a few issues over the years. One of the units is prone to freezing once a week, and Bluetooth pairing is wonky on another unit. NVIDIA moved away from GameStream, and while that&apos;s annoying, Moonlight is an alternative that works just as reliably, so it wasn&apos;t a big issue.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the underlying Tegra X1 hardware is still decent enough even though it is nine years old at this point, and honestly, there isn&apos;t another streaming device that is as good as the Shield TV Pro. Yes, there are things I would want to see in a 2024 variant of the device — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/av1-codec-video-format">AV1</a> decode, DLSS tech that&apos;s similar to what&apos;s on the latest NVIDIA video cards, and HDMI 2.1 connectivity.</p>
<p>A newer Shield TV Pro would be a killer device, but it doesn&apos;t look like that&apos;s a priority for NVIDIA at the moment. The chip vendor is making so much money via its AI business that it doesn&apos;t need to focus on any other product line, including the GeForce portfolio. The Shield TV is in the same boat, but if NVIDIA were to provide the hardware for Nintendo&apos;s Switch 2 (as leaks suggest), it isn&apos;t outlandish to assume the brand will introduce a next-gen Shield TV that uses the same platform.</p><p>We&apos;ll have to wait and see if that pans out, but if you&apos;re dissatisfied with your current streaming device and want something better, the Shield TV Pro is still the one I&apos;d recommend.</p>

<ul><li>All Meta Quest 2 and Quest 3 users must re-verify their age while playing VR.</li><li>A one-time prompt will automatically appear on your headset when your account is ready for verification.</li><li>Meta says this step provides access to age-appropriate tools, content, and protections.</li><li>Users who don't follow these steps within 30 days of receiving the prompt cannot use their headsets until they do so.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta is rolling out a new age verification process for all Meta Quest 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> users, ensuring that every user is equipped with an age-appropriate account setting. Over the next few days, Quest users will receive a prompt on their headset to input their birthday, followed by a quick setup to ensure privacy settings are appropriate.</p><p>Meta says users will have 30 days to enter their birthdate once this prompt is available. Users not following these steps after 30 days will block their accounts until the required information is entered. The company notes that birthdates are not public unless you specifically choose to make that information non-private in your account settings.</p><p>"On our app store, we want to make it easier for developers to better understand the ages of people who use their apps so they can provide age-appropriate experiences for preteens, teens, and adults. Parents, in turn, can trust that apps are providing the most age-appropriate experience and protections the app offers for their child’s age."</p>

<p>Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/new-meta-quest-age-requirements">lowered the age requirement</a> for using a Quest headset from 13 years old to 10 years old last Summer, adding in a new type of account that requires a parent to administrate. These preteen accounts, made for ages 10-12, have the most restrictive privacy and content settings, and parents can manage whether children are allowed to download and install apps, as well as block certain apps and games entirely.</p><p>Teen accounts are also set to private by default and can be managed by a parent but are initially less restrictive than a preteen account. Adult accounts can be set to private or public upon creation, but active status is set to public by default. Any of these settings can be changed after account setup, but Meta chooses specific defaults to ensure regulatory compliance and privacy.</p><p>Meta has a set of User Age Group APIs that developers can use to automatically change in-app settings based on the age of the user playing the game. This includes options for both content and data sharing, which is why Meta requires that all users have the right settings on their accounts.</p>
