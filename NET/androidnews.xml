<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="L5VRabFbfGinbLoqNxmwif" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-01.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in Obsidian" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L5VRabFbfGinbLoqNxmwif.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series phones</a>, introduced at Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google event</a> in mid-August 2024, boast tons of upgrades compared to the previous generation Pixel 8 series. From the new look with a camera bar to updated finishes with silky matte glass back and metal sides, they are also more durable.</p><p>Seven years of updates means that every time Google announces a new version of Android beyond the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> version these devices come loaded with, you will be able to download it. The devices will support the OS and function as they should. While there’s no telling what features may arrive by 2031, even if the phones can’t run some of the more advanced features that could be coming down the pike more than five years from now, Google assures that the phones will continue to work. </p><p>Arguably, most importantly, Google promises to continue to support the phones with security updates. Thus, even if they can’t support every exciting feature that comes by the end of this decade, they will be updated with all the safety and security necessities to ensure they run smoothly and, most importantly, safely. Chances are you’ll be ready to upgrade the phones before they reach end-of-life, which means they’ll have great resale, trade-in, or hand-me-down value as well.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EoXNaGtnUZxHDdh2msjRXm" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-pink.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL in Pink" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EoXNaGtnUZxHDdh2msjRXm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL differ only in size, with the former measuring 6.3 inches and the latter 6.8 inches for those who want more screen real estate. The Pixel 9 Pro XL also boasts slightly more power and faster charging speeds, but beyond that, all specs are the same as the Pixel 9 Pro. </p><p>The entry Pixel 9 is still packed with tons of premium features, not far off from the specs found in the step-up devices. The most notable thing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 9 Pro</a> is missing is a telephoto camera on the non-Pro model, and it has a much lower resolution front camera, down from 42MP in the Pixel 9 Pro to just 10.5MP in the Pixel 9. You won’t get an Ultra-Wideband chip, and there’s no temperature sensor. There are some camera features missing, too, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">Video Boost</a>, Zoom Enhance, Night Sight Video, and Super Res Zoom Video. So, if you shoot a lot of videos, it would make sense to upgrade to the Google Pixel 9 Pro or Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>Nonetheless, all three phones come powered by the new Google Tensor G4, have tons of AI features included that the processor allows them to run, and include new Google Gemini features, like Gemini Live for conversational chats for Gemini Advanced subscribers. With features like Pixel Studio for unique image generation, Pixel Screenshots for analyzing the context of your screenshots so you can easily find them in a searchable database, and Add Me to add yourself to group photos while you take them, these phones take the cake in the line-up. </p><p>Considering that the Google Pixel 9 series phones can last for seven years — that’s an entire middle and high school run and longer than you might even keep your computer — you’ll want to keep them well protected. Once you choose the model you want, opt for one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">best Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro cases</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-screen-protectors">Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro screen protectors</a> to further protect your investment. As long as you take care of the phone you choose, the Pixel 9 series devices will likely outlast your desire for them.</p>

<p>While the Google Pixel 9 might be missing some of the bells and whistles its higher-end sisters have, it’s still a premium device offered at a reasonable price. With seven years of OS and security updates as well as Feature Drops, you can rest assured that you’re getting great value with this phone, which is far from being an “entry level” device.</p></p>

<p>Almost identical in looks and specs to the Google Pixel 9, the Google Pixel 9 Pro adds a few more features relating to the cameras and video recording. But by and large, they are similar to one another. Nonetheless, if you feel you’ll make use of these features, notably for content creators, the upgrade is worth it. And this phone has seven years of OS and security updates, too.</p></p>

<p>If you want a much larger screen, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL is the way to go. Also supported by seven years of OS and security updates along with Feature Drops, this phone has the biggest screen in the line (with the exception of the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold). It’s more powerful and charges faster, too, so this is the option for power users.</p></p>

<ul><li>Google states that a camera feature it debuted during I/O 2023 is finally rolling out on the Pixel 8 Pro alongside availability for Pro model Pixel 9 devices.</li><li>"Zoom Enhance" leverages the device's AI software to "intelligently" process a zoom to keep a photo's high quality.</li><li>Made by Google 2024 was packed with new AI features like Gemini Live, the revamped Pixel Screenshot, and the Pixel 9's new "Add Me" camera function.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is sneaking in a photo feature for the Pixel 9 that you might&apos;ve forgotten about. Zoom Enhance, originally announced at Google I/O 2023 for the Pixel 8 Pro, will arrive on both Pixel 9 and 8 phones soon. </p><p>Zoom Enhance aims to fix the typical quality drop you get when you zoom in too far for a far-off photo. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-9-ai-camera-features/#:~:text=even%20more%20with-,Zoom%20Enhance,-%E2%80%94%20even%20after%20you%E2%80%99ve">Google blog post</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219750/google-zoom-enhance-pixel-8-9-pro-feature">The Verge</a>) includes the feature among a number of other recently announced features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a> and Reimagine with Magic Editor.</p><p>Google states that users zooming into a photo will leverage the on-device AI software as it "intelligently fills in the gaps between pixels and predicts fine details." Ultimately, the feature is designed to help keep a photo&apos;s quality high as you zoom in to isolate certain aspects.</p><p>Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh first introduced the feature at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2023-everything-announced">Made by Google 2023</a>, saying it would let users "get closer than ever, even when you forget to zoom" through the camera. Despite being tapped to arrive on the Pixel 8 series relatively quickly, it had a longer development cycle than expected.</p><p>As highlighted by The Verge, the Zoom Enhance example looks a bit lackluster, not showing a significant improvement in quality (we can&apos;t upload the GIF here, so check the blog to see it). We&apos;ll need to test Zoom Enhance for ourselves to see if it was worth the wait, or if Google had to compromise on its original goal with the AI feature.</p>

<p>The company states that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">9 Pro Fold</a> will have this feature. What&apos;s more, the company is bringing it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> today (August 15).</p><p>There&apos;s a lot to digest regarding the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google</a> event, but one of the highlights revolves around the Pixel 9&apos;s wealth of AI features and camera enhancements. With the Pixel 9 Pro, for instance, you can get 20X Super Res Zoom or auto-enhance videos to 8K quality.</p><p>One Made by Google revelation was a new version of its AI model, dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">Gemini Live</a>. This is its most "conversational" variant. Users can communicate with the AI about an extensive range of topics and (ideally) receive some relevant information in return.</p><p>The revamped version of Pixel Screenshots enters alongside Pixel Studio for AI assistance when storing or using a prompt to generate a photo.</p><p>The other side of Google&apos;s new features is one for the Pixel 9&apos;s camera called "Add Me." The company performed a live demonstration during the event with NBA star Jimmy Butler. Users can snap a photo through Add Me and freeze that memory in time. They can then swap places with one of the subjects so they can be photographed.</p><p>The result is a photo that looks like you or anything else was always in the frame to begin with.</p>

<ul><li>JerryRigEverything put the Pixel 9 Pro XL through its typical (and brutal) durability test following its launch.</li><li>The device received deep display grooves at level 7 on the Moh Scale of Hardness while also surviving the bend test with flying colors.</li><li>The Pixel 9 Pro XL has Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover and back glass and an IP68 protection rating.</li><li>It features a 6.8-inch display, Tensor G4 SoC, up to 1TB of storage, and has an official launch date of August 22.</li></ul>

<p>Zack Nelson, host of the JerryRigEverything channel, chose the new Google Pixel 9 Pro XL to put through his brutal durability test gauntlet. It showed its durability in some areas but received criticism in others.</p><p>He measured the Pixel 9 Pro XL and found the camera visor adds another 3.5mm of thickness on top of its official 8mm, jokingly calling it "one Oreo cookie biscuit thick." That aside, he praised Google&apos;s shift to flat glass, calling curved glass "a nightmare for durability and repairability."</p><p>During his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DLWBWrK31U&ab_channel=JerryRigEverything">durability test</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> showed signs of damage at level 6 of the Moh Scale of Hardness. Its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> screen showed more pronounced grooves of damage at level 7. </p><p>For comparison, when Nelson <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-jre-durability-test">tested the Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, he found that it only scratched at level 7 and had deeper grooves at level 8, thanks to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-armor-galaxy-s24-ultra">Gorilla Armor</a>. The Pixel 9 Pro XL display is still tough, but you may want to invest in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-screen-protectors">screen protector</a>.</p><p>Nelson proceeded to the burn portion of the test, where the display lasted 30 seconds against a lighter.</p><p>The channel&apos;s host then put the device through the ever-crucial bend test — and the 9 Pro XL surprisingly held strong. Nelson stated that it&apos;s expected for a phone that large to have some sort of give or even a heart-stopping <em>creak</em>. However, Google&apos;s Pixel 9 Pro XL barely gave in either direction when bent and didn&apos;t even make a sound.</p><p>You can catch Zack Nelson&apos;s full durability test breakdown of the Pixel 9 Pro XL. The video shows off the scratchy durability of the camera visor and the reliability of the in-display fingerprint scanner under severe damage.</p>

<p>Despite how strong Google&apos;s Pixel 9 Pro XL may be, we&apos;d still recommend picking up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-cases">a good case</a> — just in case.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google</a> behind us, we were able to get a solid look at the latest edition to the Pixel lineup: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">9 Pro XL</a>. With smaller bezels and a large display, the XL model features a 6.8-inch Super Actua display with a 120Hz maximum refresh rate. Consumers can grab the device with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of internal storage.</p><p>Additionally, thanks to Gemini, the 9 Pro XL alongside the rest of the Pixel 9 cast benefit from a new wave of AI features. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">Gemini Live</a> is the company&apos;s new conversational feature that users can lean on for a variety of topics. Users will also find a revamped version of Pixel Screenshots.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL officially launches on August 22, when you can put it through its paces yourself — hopefully without scratching it up.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is adding the AI-powered Circle to Search to certain Galaxy A-series phones, with the Galaxy Tab S9 FE tablets following suit.</li><li>By late August, Circle to Search will be available on Galaxy A models like the A55, A54, A35, and A34, but not yet on entry-level models like the A15 or A25.</li><li>Circle to Search allows users to quickly get information by circling, highlighting, or tapping parts of photos, text, images, or videos.</li></ul>

<p>Samsung is rolling out its AI-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> feature to select Galaxy A-series phones, with the Galaxy Tab S9 FE tablets next in line.</p><p>Google&apos;s Circle to Search is a fresh way to steer users to its search engine. First launched with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> series in January, this feature has since made its way to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">premium Samsung phones</a> like the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6, along with some Google-branded products.</p><p>The Circle to Search feature is now making its way to certain Galaxy A models like the A55, A54, A35, and A34, with availability expected in late August, as per the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-circle-to-search-to-galaxy-a-series-and-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-series" target="_blank">announcement</a>. But it is not clear when it will be available on Samsung&apos;s entry-level devices, like the Galaxy A15 or A25.</p><p>Later, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe">Galaxy Tab S9 FE and S9 FE Plus</a> will also get the Circle to Search feature in an upcoming update.</p><p>Circle to Search lets users dive into content with simple gestures. Just circle, highlight, or tap on parts of a photo, text, image, or video to instantly pull up related information without jumping between apps.</p><p>Google uses visual search technology to find and show relevant information based on what you select in an image or document.</p><p>It&apos;s no shock that Circle to Search stands out among the AI features in the Galaxy S24 series. Its seamless link to Google Search, a key part of the Android experience, gives it a real edge.</p><p>Samsung plans to start rolling out the update for these devices this month, but it’ll be a gradual process. This means updates might come at different times, depending on your region and device model.</p><p>That said, it&apos;s great that Samsung is bringing AI features like Circle to Search to its mid-range Galaxy A series. This fits with the trend of making advanced tools accessible to more people.</p><p>With Google continuously improving the feature, users can expect an even better Circle to Search experience on more devices.</p>

Over that span of time, we&apos;ve seen Samsung release both the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Fold 6, while the OnePlus Open entered the fray. No matter what phone you currently own, you might be wondering if you should upgrade to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>Although we were excited to see Google join the mix with its first attempt, the Pixel Fold fell a bit short of expectations in a few different ways. However, given Google&apos;s previous track record, it&apos;s definitely understandable if you&apos;re on the fence about moving over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p>

<h2 id="design-overhaul-fixes-a-lot-of-complaints-2">Design overhaul fixes a lot of complaints</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eEe5APmjLXtUW4vzNFmvyP" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-rear.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold rear view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eEe5APmjLXtUW4vzNFmvyP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If there&apos;s one thing that Google absolutely nailed with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it&apos;s the brand-new design. It&apos;s difficult to even believe that this new phone and the Pixel Fold came from the same company, as the changes are incredibly drastic. For one, Google understands that people don&apos;t want a compromised experience, regardless of whether you&apos;re using the cover screen or the massive inner display.</p><p>App compatibility with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> continues to be a headache despite the form factor being around for more than six years. In an effort to reduce potential issues, the displays will better adapt to the apps that you use. This is especially true when using apps on the inner screen on a split screen, as the aspect ratio makes it feel like you&apos;re using two apps at the same time without awkward layouts.</p>

<p>The inner screen has also been upgraded in a number of ways, starting with the improved hinge. You&apos;ll no longer have to worry about the phone not being able to unfold to 180 degrees, something that some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> owners experienced. It&apos;s about as good as you might have hoped, offering a smooth and satisfying "pop" when either folding or unfolding the phone.</p>

<p>One of the biggest complaints about the Pixel Fold was that it only enjoyed a few months of being the best phone that Google offered. As soon as the Pixel 8 lineup was introduced with the Tensor G3, the Fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-hope-google-doesnt-limit-assistant-with-bard">immediately felt obsolete</a>. This feeling was driven home even further after it was revealed that the $1,800 Fold would lack features found in phones that cost at least $1,000 less.</p><p>Thankfully, Google learned from its mistakes this time around, as the 9 Pro Fold shares the same Tensor G4 SoC as its contemporaries. At least in terms of what&apos;s possible, all four <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> models enjoy largely the same set of software features. Of course, this includes all of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> features, such as Gemini Live, Pixel Screenshots, Super Res Zoom, and more.</p>
<h2 id="foldable-phones-are-so-versatile-2">Foldable phones are so versatile</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="D2FuJiAWSGeWTc7HJeq5jh" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-split-screen-youtube-photos.jpg" alt="YouTube and Google Photos in split-screen on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D2FuJiAWSGeWTc7HJeq5jh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By now, you might be asking yourself why spring for the 9 Pro Fold if the less expensive phones can do the same things. Well, that&apos;s where the foldable phone aspect comes into play. Pull the phone out of your pocket, and you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-pixel-9-or-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, albeit one that&apos;s a bit thicker than you might be used to.</p><p>While the 6.3-inch screen is fine for pretty much everything, there are times when you&apos;re doing something and have a bit more space to stretch out. Just open the Fold, and now you have a screen that&apos;s even bigger than our beloved Nexus 7. And when you&apos;re done, close it shut and throw it back into your pocket without wishing you still had JNCO jeans or cargo shorts.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-shouldn-apos-t-upgrade-to-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-2">Why you shouldn&apos;t upgrade to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EmSigZ7prjRbed97djK7QZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-22.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Sketch to Image"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EmSigZ7prjRbed97djK7QZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Besides adapting to a different form factor, the biggest barrier to upgrading to a foldable phone is the cost. Even with some pretty great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-preorder-deals" target="_blank">pre-order deals</a>, the $1,800 price tag can still hit you with a bit of sticker shock. This is part of the reason why Samsung is seeing more success with the Galaxy Z Flip line, while Motorola is content in sticking with the flip form factor instead of venturing into the book-style foldable.</p><p>Not helping matters is something that we consider to be a reason in favor of upgrading to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and that&apos;s the feature parity with the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL. Even when matching up the storage configuration (the Fold starts with 256GB), the Pixel 9 Pro XL is $700 less than the 9 Pro Fold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="M2GtqXC29EQEJyxDFafvDJ" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-obsidian-01.jpg" alt="An Obsidian Google Pixel 9 next to a Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M2GtqXC29EQEJyxDFafvDJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the same price as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold with 256GB of storage, you can get the 9 Pro XL, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a>, and Pixel Buds Pro 2 and will still have a few bucks left over to snag a case or extra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-bands">watch band</a>. That&apos;s one tough pill to swallow, especially if you&apos;re potentially looking to dive head-first into the Pixel ecosystem.</p><p>Another detractor to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is that it still lacks stylus support, something Samsung has featured in the Galaxy Z Fold series since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review">Fold 3</a> in 2021. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Open</a> technically supports the use of a stylus, although that&apos;s not in an official capacity and is only possible if you import the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/using-oppo-pen-with-oneplus-open">OPPO Pen</a>. This might not be a deal-breaker for some, but it could definitely play a factor if you&apos;re upgrading from an older Galaxy Z Fold.</p><p>Lastly, there is a sentiment with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> that these expensive phones still feel as though they&apos;re being treated as second-class citizens in the camera department. We have only minimal upgrades with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold&apos;s camera, while the 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL will arguably provide better photos and videos.</p>

<p>If there&apos;s even an inkling that you <em>might</em> want to upgrade to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, just give it a shot. We aren&apos;t talking about buying one and returning it if you don&apos;t like it, but head over to your local big box store and mess around with the display models. Obviously, this doesn&apos;t give you the full picture of what to expect, but it should be enough to whet your whistle before making a final decision.</p><p>In the meantime, you can look forward to our review of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which is currently in progress.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has stopped selling a few of its past-gen Pixel devices, but that doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re gone for good.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/13/google-pixel-fold-7-pro-stops-sales/">9to5Google</a>, Google seemingly removed the Pixel Fold, the Pixel 7, and the Pixel 7 Pro from the featured device list for "Phones" on its online store before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google event</a>. However, scrolling over in the carousel and clicking "Compare phones" shows that the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro are still available to purchase.</p><p>Consumers can pick up the former for $599 while the Pro model runs for $899. Interestingly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a> is still featured on that highlight carousel before shifting to the Pixel 8 series.</p><p>Unfortunately, you won&apos;t find the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> anywhere on the Google Store. When surfaced through the "Compare" section, the device appears with a "no longer available" label. The publication stated that any attempt to purchase the original Pixel Fold would send users over to the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p><p>Surfacing the device through the comparison method doesn&apos;t offer a chance to click. Instead, users are shown the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> and Pixel 9 Pro Fold initially, likely as a bit of a teaser to grab what&apos;s new.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google about the availability of certain Pixel devices. In return, the company stated that the original Pixel Fold will return to the online store <em>after </em>the Pixel 9 Pro Fold goes public. We also asked if the Fold and the Pixel 8 series will return at a discount, but did not receive confirmation.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold launches alongside the Pixel 9 Pro on September 4, while the base Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL launch on August 22.</p>

<p>We asked Google about a potential Pixel Fold discount based on its past behavior. Typically, Google will bring past series back at a slightly reduced price. Either Google has yet to decide on a discount, or it doesn&apos;t want people to skip the new 9 Pro Fold because of the promise of a cheaper Pixel Fold. Nevertheless, we won&apos;t have long to wait to see what happens.</p><p>The company announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">the full Pixel 9 series</a> alongside the Pixel 9 Pro Fold earlier this week. The slab phone featured three editions: the base Pixel 9, a Pixel 9 Pro, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL. The series can reach screen heights of 6.8 inches, the Tensor G4, 16GB RAM (Pro models), and boasts even more Gemini-powered AI.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold takes what the first one started and runs with it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Our hands-on</a> highlighted its external 6.3-inch display and the much more expansive 8-inch inner display. Additionally, Google upgraded the internal performance of the device by providing an up-to-date chip: the Tensor G4.</p><p>Despite its official September 4 release date, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_9_pro_fold" target="_blank">Google Store</a> shows that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold won&apos;t arrive until mid-September, and some editions have already begun to sold out. Perhaps a cheaper Pixel Fold will tempt those that missed out on buying the newer foldable next month.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is rolling out a few updates for its AI-generated overviews, beginning with a "save" feature for rediscovery.</li><li>Users will also find even more links as Google tests them inline to bring more awareness to additional context and for easier fact-checking.</li><li>AI Overviews are also expanding to six additional countries over the next few weeks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Expanding the helpfulness of Search is a key priority for Google as the company provides details of a few key updates.</p><p>The company&apos;s latest string of AI Overview updates kicked off by highlighting its new capabilities. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/new-ways-to-connect-to-the-web-with-ai-overviews/">In a blog post</a>, Google states users can test the new "save" function for AI Overview&apos;s results. Saving it will reproduce the same results, links, and more whenever you search the same topic.</p><p>Moreover, Google lets users see saved overviews within their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/interests/saved">Interests page</a> tucked inside their account from Search. English-based queries in the U.S. will find the option to save overviews today (August 15). Google states users should ensure they&apos;ve enrolled in the appropriate "AI Overviews and more" test in Labs.</p><p>The next experimental update brings the option to "simplify the language" used in an AI Overview. Google states that "some" overviews provided during a search will offer a button to refine a result&apos;s language to avoid any complex or confusing jargon. Testers enrolled in "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/1?source=srp">AI Overviews and more</a>" should see it appear today (August 15) in the U.S.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, a new set of links will be displayed on the right-hand side of results. Google states these links will be rolled into AI Overviews whenever information is collected and displayed for a complex question. Users on mobile will find these additional "relevant" links by tapping the "site icons" in the top-right corner of an overview.</p><p>Google&apos;s extra relevant links in AI Overviews are rolling out today (globally) in every country that has them alongside Search Labs testers.</p><p>Additionally, the post states there&apos;s an ongoing test for inline links whenever AI Overviews appear for bite-sized information.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:285px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:210.53%;"><img id="zR7BXqoxKENt48QnHjk5mH" name="google-ai-overviews-expands-more-countries.jpg" alt="Google expands AI Overviews to six more countries.

<p>The final update includes an expansion of Google&apos;s AI Overviews to more places. Following extensive testing and feedback from U.S. users, Google states its overviews are arriving in the U.K., India, Japan, Indonesia, Mexico, and Brazil.</p><p>The expansion isn&apos;t hitting every area at once, as Google adds that the rollout will continue over the next "several weeks." More importantly, users in those areas will find full support for their preferred language in AI Overviews once it arrives.</p><p>Google previewed the ability for users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">"adjust" their overview results</a> earlier this year after I/O 2024. We&apos;re now seeing that roll out as this simplification of language to help ease the digestion of difficult-to-understand topics. However, the company upgraded the overviews in May so that users could provide more complex, multi-step questions.</p><p>Users getting their hands on AI Overviews won&apos;t have to break up a lengthy question. Instead, Google&apos;s software should take it in stride and deliver accurate and relevant results when called upon.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Google Pixel 9 is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-preorder-deals">available for pre-order</a> and the company has spent the time and money telling us why we might want to buy one. The internet will debate its worth for a while because that&apos;s what the internet does, but the phones look like a fine upgrade for anyone who wants or needs something new.</p><p>As expected, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-battle-for-your-next-dollar-will-be-fought-with-software">the hardware is not the selling point</a>. Yes, the new processor has an NPU with a higher compute rate than anything else, and you should not care about that in the least. Yes, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> promises better battery life, but you probably won&apos;t really notice. Generally, it&apos;s slightly better than the hardware from the Pixel 8. </p>
<p>What "stole the show" was, of course, AI features. One in particular stood out to me: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/articles/pixel-add-me/">Add Me</a>. It&apos;s a great example of something people can see and understand that Google can do very well. Most people won&apos;t buy a Pixel phone, but for a lot of people who do, the camera and its features are the reason.</p><p>I have no idea how many people wanted something like Add Me. To be honest, it&apos;s something that I probably would never use after I tried it to see how it works. I do know that it&apos;s the kind of thing that AI should be really good at doing, that it should work very well, and that it will make people talk about Google&apos;s new phones.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-is-how-it-works-2">What it is, how it works</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1088px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.61%;"><img id="9M9dgRtUy6hHYG2DdD6A36" name="paint-dot-net-layers.png" alt="Paint.Net image editing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9M9dgRtUy6hHYG2DdD6A36.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1088" height="790" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Add Me isn&apos;t a new idea; it&apos;s a <em>much</em> easier way to do something people have been doing for years and years. Simply put, it&apos;s a way to paste a photo into another photo and seamlessly stitch everything together so it looks like an unaltered photo. You follow a few easy steps, and the Pixel 9 does the rest, so you don&apos;t have to learn how to do it yourself.</p><p>You can always do this, and you don&apos;t even need expensive software like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-adobe-photoshop-on-your-phone-or-chromebook">Photoshop</a> to do it. Open a photo in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.getpaint.net/download.html">free editor like Paint.Net</a>, add a layer, paste a second picture into it, and clean up what you don&apos;t want to see in the photos. If you&apos;re good at it, once you save the result, it looks like a genuine photo of your dog on the moon, you standing beside someone else, or some strange weather, even where it&apos;s raining grumpy old man BitMojis. The <em>idea</em> is easy, but the execution isn&apos;t, and that&apos;s why where the Pixel 9 comes in.</p>
<p>AI is good at things like edge detection. Feed the camera the data it needs about the space around your photo, snap a pic of subject one, then subject two, and then let AI determine what should or shouldn&apos;t be there. No weird seven-finger hands or AI trickery is involved because it&apos;s two real photos blended into one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1474px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tZPUSQyrD64nGD6fLQyoh4" name="Dave-Burke-announces-gemini-nano-multimodality.jpg" alt="Dave Burke at Google I/O 2024 announcing Gemini Nano with multimodality" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZPUSQyrD64nGD6fLQyoh4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1474" height="829" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m sure a lot of work went into the feature, but this is pretty simple compared to some of the complex (and less relatable) things companies are doing with AI. The genius was thinking about how to make this a camera feature and refining it so it works great most of the time.</p>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google knows AI</a>. Every product the company offers uses it in some form, and most of them leaned on AI long before it became the tech buzzword it is today. Google has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overview-problems" target="_blank">failed at using AI</a> on many occasions, just like its competition. The company knows what it can and can&apos;t do well, and lately, it has shown it knows how to present something it thinks is easy and fun to people like us who are buying products.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how popular this feature will be; even Google isn&apos;t sure. But I do know it was presented in a way that has people curious enough to talk about it on social media. As expected, almost nobody has tried it, yet one half says it&apos;s great, the other says it&apos;s not, and it will be groundbreaking when <em>that other company</em> does it so people can argue about who did it first. </p><p>All I can suggest is that you give it a try. </p>
<h2 id="what-about-misinformation-2">What about misinformation?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1812px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="obRBZu4KqS5Uj4cdKALBe4" name="mark-zuckerberg-meta.jpg" alt="Mark Zuckerberg alongside Meta's logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/obRBZu4KqS5Uj4cdKALBe4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1812" height="1020" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Any time you have built-in tools that make photo manipulation easy, you have to discuss ways <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/facebook-announces-forwarding-limit-stop-spread-misinformation-messenger">they can be abused</a>. Add Me is no different.</p><p>As designed, you have to take photos yourself of real people in real places for it to work. You scan the area with the Pixel 9&apos;s camera, snap a photo of your friend (or your dog or a houseboat or whatever) positioned off to one side of the scene, then switch places, and they take a pic of you on the other side.</p>
<p>Someone will work around these restrictions and find a way to stitch someone or something into a photo that already exists. People always find ways to do stupid and dishonest things. </p><p>People who want to do something like this can already do it as described above. Being able to do it on a phone while they rage on social media will just make it easier.</p><p>Hopefully, places like Facebook and Instagram will label Add Me photos as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.instagram.com/761121959519495">created with AI</a> to try and prevent potential abuse but people will still find ways to spread them around. Use your brain and trust your instincts and you&apos;ll be fine.</p>
<hr>
<p>Is Add Me enough to make you buy a Pixel 9? I don&apos;t think so. It is another of those neat features Google is so good at building, and with the right messaging, it adds to a list of reasons why you might want one. We&apos;ll have to wait and see if people are using Add Me a year from now.</p>

<p>Unlike a lot of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-preorder-deals">Pixel 9 preorder offers</a> I&apos;ve seen so far, this deal doesn&apos;t require you to upgrade your wireless service to receive the savings, making it a great opportunity for folks (like yours truly) who prefer to buy their devices unlocked. Best Buy is apparently being pretty generous about the phones it&apos;s accepting for trade-in, too; I plugged in my old Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and got the max $1,099 off the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, effectively making the new device free. And again, there&apos;s the $200 gift card to sweeten the deal. </p><p>Use Best Buy&apos;s trade-in tool to see how much trade-in credit you&apos;re eligible to receive before you commit to the offer, but if you&apos;re lucky, you just might get a free unlocked Pixel 9 out of the deal. </p>

It blew everyone&apos;s minds and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/superhot-vr-outsells-superhot-pc/" target="_blank">sold more copies</a> than the non-VR version after only two years on the market.</p>

<p>The latest data we have is a few years old but shows that SUPERHOT VR has made the company well over $50 million in revenue, making it one of the best-selling VR games ever. Yet, here we are nearly a decade later and somehow still have no official sequel. It&apos;s still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games/7">best Meta Quest games</a> despite its age because, for lack of a more modern term, it very much feels like the "Mario 64 of VR."</p><p>Thankfully, nDreams and Meatspace have answered the call and created Vendetta Forever, a game announced at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vr-games-showcase-2024-announcement">2024 VR Games Showcase</a>, which includes a demo you can play on your Quest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/7392594197533540/"><strong>right now</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="lo-kill-motion-2">LO-KILL-MOTION</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DhJFGhvZzevdseLAvkEbzc" name="Vendetta-Forever-Announce-SC-04.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of Vendetta Forever on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DhJFGhvZzevdseLAvkEbzc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: nDreams)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The game&apos;s entire premise revolves around a cute pun on the word "locomotion," a word that&apos;s normally used to describe how you move in a VR game. SUPERHOT VR was purposefully limited in this area as it was intended to be playable by anyone, regardless of whether the virtual motion in VR makes you sick or not. Players in that game only physically move their bodies. It&apos;s not possible to virtually move your character with a joystick.</p><p>However, VR gaming (and its gamers) has evolved significantly since the original SUPERHOT VR release. Essentially, all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/section/258035155854818/">top-selling Meta Quest games</a> in any given week task players with moving around virtually, whether it&apos;s using a joystick, like in a traditional game, or moving yourself like a monkey with your arms in Gorilla Tag.</p>

<p>Vendetta Forever upgrades SUPERHOT VR&apos;s gameplay by introducing a unique teleporting mechanic that should keep even ultra-sensitive players from feeling sick, yet, still gives them a more modern feeling of freedom of movement. From what I can tell, it&apos;s the next-generation version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sidequestvr.com/app/9575/bang-bang-slice-alpha">Bang Bang Slice (Alpha)</a>, a game from the same developer that was released in 2022.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Vendetta Forever's locomotion feels like the perfect hybrid of Pistol Whip and the lesser-known Rogue Ascent.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The developers briefly describe it as "shoot to kill, kill to move," which means that when you kill an enemy, they drop their weapon, allowing you to teleport to the weapon by remotely grabbing it. It&apos;s the simplest mechanic you can think of, yet it evokes a powerful feeling of badassery that&apos;s eminently important for a game like this.</p><p>In fact, Vendetta Forever&apos;s locomotion feels like the perfect hybrid of Pistol Whip and the lesser-known Rogue Ascent, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-free-hand-tracking-apps-and-games-oculus-quest">best hand-tracking games</a>. There&apos;s a slight slow motion triggered as you teleport, but it&apos;s not like the time-moves-when-you-move mechanic of SUPERHOT. This feels faster in an almost superhuman way.</p><p>Here&apos;s an illustration so you can better understand it:</p>

<p>It&apos;s one of those amazing classic arcade-style mechanics that gives you room to improve over time, meaning you can replay levels to your heart&apos;s content and get a better score as your skills improve. What&apos;s particularly impressive is that there are over 60 levels and more than 50 challenges throughout the game, meaning there&apos;s <em>a lot</em> of replayability value here.</p><p>Scoring is similar to Pistol Whip in that you&apos;ll compete with friends on online leaderboards, and a modifier system similar to Pistol Whip is included in Vendetta Forever, as well. It&apos;s also impressive just how difficult some of these levels are, especially if you&apos;re planning to get anywhere near the top of the leaderboard.</p><p>The playable demo consists of 5 levels, each of which carries a very different theme, set of weapons, and even color scheme to differentiate itself.</p>

<p>One of the levels in the demo sees you at a Russian Roulette table, complete with a pistol. This particular level tasks you with taking out the entire table of bad guys as quickly as you can. My best time is 1.6 seconds so far, and I felt pretty good about that time until I looked at the scored leaderboard.</p><p>Even in the early access demo — which was likely only played by a few dozen folks — I was in 9th place at that time. I could hardly believe it until I dialed down into the score and realized it wasn&apos;t just clear time or kills that got you points but also if you got hit, got headshots, etc. It&apos;s a lot to happen in 1.6 seconds, but boy, is it exhilarating!</p>

<p>And the weapon variety is second to none, too. One of SUPERHOT VR&apos;s coolest mechanics is being able to pick up anything and sling it at your opponent, or even punch them when there&apos;s nothing else to use, then steal your opponent&apos;s weapon to finish the level. Vendetta Forever turns that up several notches with over 50 weapons — 33 of which are types of guns — even including throwing knives and katanas.</p><p>Enemies slice apart like the fruit in Fruit Ninja, and throwing knives and ninja stars can be thrown in one or three group increments, meaning you can take out up to three enemies at once with a single throw. It&apos;s the perfect way to make you feel like you&apos;re a top-rated assassin or spy in a way most games fall flat on.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what is taking Superhot Team so long to make a sequel, but I&apos;m glad at least some other developers are taking up the mantle.</p><p>After you&apos;ve quenched your thirst on the demo, it won&apos;t be too long of a wait til the final game, either. Meatspace and nDreams are targeting an October 2024 release for Meta Quest 2, 3, Pro, and PlayStation VR2.</p>
