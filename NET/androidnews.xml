<hr>
<p>A dive into the latest version of Google Messages showcases the inner workings of its integration with the AI model Gemini.</p><p>AssembleDeBug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/First--Look-Google-Messages-Working-Gemini.html">TheSpAndroid</a>) discovered several activities and interactions users would soon find with Google&apos;s Gemini in Messages (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-google-messages-first-look-3427717/">Android Authority</a>). Found in version <strong>messages.android_20240318_00_RC00</strong>, the Gemini integration functions close to its web version as it includes Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bard-connects-to-google-apps-and-services">app extensions</a>. Internal code shows Messages will support Gmail, Flights, Maps, and other Workspace apps.</p><p>In a test, the AI bot was asked to display emails, and it reportedly displayed them accordingly. Moreover, when asked to "find something nearby," Gemini offered a list of local spots, citing Google Maps as its source.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> in Messages appears to have some image generation functionalities, but it&apos;s not as fleshed out as its web version. The post states Gemini will refuse images given to it if users have a question, but it <em>can </em>generate images based on a prompt. AssembleDeBug suspects Gemini&apos;s ability to respond based on text and photo prompts will be rectified later on.</p><p>Elsewhere, Gemini was spotted giving suggestions for coders. When asked to "write a bash script," Gemini responded appropriately but lacked the ability to copy it to the clipboard. Users must, instead, long-press the message to copy its contents.</p><p>AssembleDeBug was also able to add Gemini to a group chat. It was noted that doing so broke its E2EE (end-to-end encryption) and it didn&apos;t seem possible for the AI to respond in that setting.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s plans to implement Gemini into Messages was spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-bard-in-messages-integration-discovered">early on in 2024</a>. Early discoveries showed the AI would let users ask it to draft text messages if they were calling in sick, ideas to motivate the team for presentations, and more. Even then, the AI detailed that chats with it were not encrypted, meaning users should refrain from inputting sensitive information.</p><p>The company likely made such a move in an attempt to save some data for training purposes for the AI.</p><p>Since then, Google has rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-you-to-text-gemini-in-google-messages">Gemini in Messages in beta</a> so users can chat with the AI. Users need to be signed into their account on Messages to utilize Gemini&apos;s abilities. The beta is only available for folks with a Pixel 6 or later, Pixel Fold, Samsung Galaxy S22 or later, and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip or Z Fold.</p><p>Once in, users can start a new chat with Gemini to begin texting with it much like you&apos;d do on a computer or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">in its app</a>. Google also previously stated image generation was disabled in its beta, however, the current preview suggests it might not remain that way on full release.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The latest PSVR 2 headset firmware update enables a direct PC connection via the built-in USB-C cable for supported PCs.</li><li>Sony hasn't released a software driver yet, which means official support isn't quite ready.</li><li>The headset requires a unique 12V connection, meaning most PC users will need some kind of adapter.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Sony regularly updates the PS5 and all its accessories, including headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-ps-vr2-review">PSVR 2</a>. The latest firmware update includes a nifty hidden feature that will soon unlock direct PCVR usage when plugging a PSVR 2 into a supported PC, but there&apos;s a catch: you&apos;ll need a 12V USB-C port for it to work.</p><p>Sony&apos;s PSVR 2 hardware is designed similarly to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualLink">Nvidia VirtualLink</a>, a special VR-ready port used on the company&apos;s GeForce RTX 2000 series of graphics cards. Nvidia no longer outfits cards with this special port in the 3000 and 4000 generation, meaning only users with a GeForce RTX 2000 series card and a VirtualLink port might be able to directly connect a PSVR 2 and use it as a PC headset.</p><p>While this portion of the equation has been known for some time — you could use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/992490/iVRy_Driver_for_SteamVR/">iVRy software</a> on Steam for PSVR PC usage — the new firmware update makes it so PCs will no longer require some kind of workaround software solution to make the headset work.</p><p>Now, all we&apos;re waiting on is an official Windows driver, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/iVRy_VR/status/1770724715444809964?s=20">iVRy on X</a> (formerly Twitter). Once Sony has that driver ready for consumers, a PSVR 2 headset should be usable as a PCVR headset without any hacky workarounds.</p><p>The final part of the equation, of course, is how to get around that VirtualLink port requirement. It&apos;s surmised that Sony is developing an adapter similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-get-psvr-adapter-ps5">PSVR to PS5 adapter</a> that&apos;ll allow users to plug a PSVR 2 into it and then into a PC for easy wired PCVR use. Sony has become increasingly friendly about providing its games on Steam in recent years, so it&apos;s entirely likely that we&apos;ll see a final official solution soon.</p>

<p>As part of its major Spring Sale event, Amazon is quietly dropping 36% off the Zyber Elite Strap, a versatile and highly-adjustable strap that can totally eliminate neck and head discomfort during those longer VR gaming sessions. </p>
<p>It doesn't come with a battery pack, but if you don't need to extend the 2-ish hours of battery life on your Meta Quest 3, this Zyber strap is a wise choice. Pick one up now and you can even grab an additional 20% off coupon (just don't miss the little checkbox on the product page). <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHPDYLW1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="48fc7702-fa6b-4655-8f5c-901772bd3047" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Zyber Elite Strap replacement: $38.99" data-dimension48="Zyber Elite Strap replacement: $38.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The Zyber Elite Strap is one of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">Meta Quest 3 accessories</a>, not because it&apos;s particularly high-tech, but because it does what it&apos;s trying to do particularly well. This replacement head strap doesn&apos;t come with a battery pack like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/this-is-the-one-quest-3-accessory-you-actually-need">BoboVR M3 Pro</a>, but it adds a considerable amount of comfort for long gameplay sessions. The cloth strap that ships with the Meta Quest 3 is good enough for some people, but the Zyber Strap has multiple adjustment points for a fine-tuned fit, with a double-hinge system and downward tilt that takes some of the pressure off your head. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> is one of the best VR headsets ever made, so why shouldn&apos;t it have a better head strap? The Prime Day-esque Amazon Big Spring Sale ends on Monday, March 25th, so don&apos;t wait too long if this discount piques your interest.</p>

<ul><li>A new Meta AI feature, SceneScript, can automatically map rooms and identify features such as walls, doors, windows, tables, and more.</li><li>The AI was trained on hundreds of thousands of procedurally generated rooms and could end manual room mapping on XR headsets.</li><li>Room data can also be used by LLMs to ask complex questions about living spaces for consumers and businesses.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta researchers have debuted a new room scanning feature called SceneScript, which uses the power of AI to automatically identify a room&apos;s objects and architecture. While that sounds pretty scary, Meta is using it to improve AR and VR devices and make them more consumer-friendly.</p><p>A detailed post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@edwardrichardmiller/post/C4yJmsagJO2">Threads</a> juxtaposes current room mapping techniques with the new model, showcasing how much easier VR and AR usage is with the new model. Meta debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-to-set-up-your-room-for-meta-quest-pro-mixed-reality">manual room mapping</a> on the Quest Pro, while the depth sensor on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> can automatically map floors, walls, and ceilings. The problem is that you still have to manually map couches, tables, windows, and other room features.</p><p>This new technique would use the depth sensor, along with cameras, to make a complete map of the room, including automatically mapped furniture and other architectural features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gC5v3wHqPkBzZyD64P3yrG" name="meta-project-aria-ai-room-mapping.gif" alt="Meta's Project Aria AI mapping a room automatically" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gC5v3wHqPkBzZyD64P3yrG.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The automatic room mapping technique on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3">Apple Vision Pro</a> means users don&apos;t have to manually map anything at all. Still, Apple&apos;s headset doesn&apos;t automatically identify objects with names and features, just as blank surfaces with which virtual objects can interact.</p><p>Meta&apos;s more advanced mapping feature means that this data can be fed into an LLM like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-working-on-open-source-artificial-general-intelligence">Meta LLaMA</a>, which can then be asked questions about the room. One research example, "how many pots of paint would it take to paint this room?" helps illustrate the value of such data for future AR glasses, in particular.</p><p>Meta used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/ase/">Aria Synthetic Environments Dataset</a> — a collection of 100,000 virtual procedurally-generated rooms — to train the AI so it can understand how rooms are laid out and how to properly identify objects. This helps it understand all sorts of different layouts and decor types, as well as variations in furniture and how a room can still be mapped even if things are moved around.</p><p>Meta hasn&apos;t revealed whether or not this will be coming to the Meta Quest 3, but it&apos;s entirely possible that such an upgrade could be included in one of the regular monthly software updates. It&apos;s entirely possible we could see such a feature in the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-ui-overhaul-tease">Meta Quest UI overhaul</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung plans to offer a whopping eight years of OS upgrades for enterprise versions of the Galaxy Tab Active 5. </li><li>An executive for Samsung shared the move on LinkedIn, which will see the Galaxy Tab Active 5 get updates through 2032.</li><li>The Galaxy Tab Active 5 was released earlier this year, and the standard version will only get five years of software support. Enterprise users will have three years of additional support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-active-5-debut">Galaxy Tab Active 5</a> earlier this year as a rugged tablet aimed to assist frontline workers. There are standard and enterprise versions of the tablet, though usually, there aren&apos;t many differences between the business and consumer models. However, this year, the enterprise edition of the Galaxy Tab Active 5 is confirmed to be getting three additional years of software support compared to the standard version. While the regular Galaxy Tab Active 5 will get five years of full OS upgrades, the enterprise version will get eight. </p><p>Andy Rottiers, an executive for Samsung Electronics, announced the company&apos;s plans in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andyrottiers_itmanagers-samsung-securitypatches-activity-7176493307638763520-_fOP/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank">post</a> on LinkedIn. "2024 started with some good news for IT managers needing to service a large fleet of devices for a longer period," Rottiers wrote. "Samsung is introducing extended security patches and OS updates for their newly launched devices."</p><p>Rottiers confirmed that the enterprise Galaxy Tab Active 5 EE will be supported for eight years, meaning that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-rugged-android-tablet">rugged tablet</a> will get OS upgrades through 2032. Additionally, the Samsung Galaxy S24 EE and Galaxy XCover7 EE will each be supported for a seven-year window. These plans follow a trend by OEMs of pushing the boundaries of how long aging hardware can be supported. For example, both the Galaxy S24 series and the Google Pixel 8 lineup are promised to get seven years of full OS upgrades. </p>

<p>The long guarantee of software support makes sense for the enterprise market, where companies hope to deploy their technology for extended periods of time, usually spanning many years or even decades. Due to its rugged build, the Galaxy Tab Active 5 is specifically oriented at frontline workers. The tablet features Gorilla Glass 5, IP68 water and dust resistance, and a protective case that can withstand drops up to 1.8m.</p><p>We&apos;ve reached a point where Apple, Google, Samsung, and others are competing to provide the longest stretches of software support possible. However, we still don&apos;t know what software support for something like the Galaxy Tab Active 5 will look like in eight years. Who knows whether the hardware will hold up in 2032 or if Galaxy Tab Active 5 devices will even be in service at that time? Still, it&apos;s good news for consumers and businesses that devices are nearing a decade of support for full OS upgrades.</p>

<ul><li>This new update follows what had been announced last year by the company. </li><li>Users can take deeper control over their geolocation. </li><li>Apps can now be individually determined to have camera or microphone access. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new update coming to ChromeOS will allow users to have even more control over what apps can see their location. It’s all part of a larger security update coming to the platform, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/chrome-enterprise/shields-up-powerful-new-security-features-in-chromeos">which was announced on Thursday by the tech giant</a>. Though, it’s important to note that many of the updates included within the announcement will affect mainly enterprise users, but the location and privacy settings will impact all. </p><p>Per the announcement, ChromeOS will provide users with enhanced privacy controls, including geolocation control and app-level permissions for camera, microphone and geolocation services. The goal is to enhance “user productivity and transparency with a single hub for all privacy controls,” according to the official blog update. </p><p>These new controls follow what the company had announced last year, which was the ability for users to toggle access to the camera and microphone at a system-based level. Through that update, users who had the toggle turned off would then be asked if they’d like to turn on the microphone or camera when a website attempts to gain access. </p><p>The geolocation control will allow users to individually determine which apps and services can access their geolocation. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/21/chromeos-location-toggle/">Per 9to5Google</a>, which first spotted the new update, the enhanced controls will disable Google Location Services and can be accessed in the Security and Privacy settings. </p>

<p>In its official blog, the company utilized Instagram as a case example of app-level permissions. In this example, a user could individually control the app and its access, including what permissions it has, such as the camera. Turning it on would allow the app to access a user&apos;s camera, and toggling it off would prevent the app from doing so altogether.</p><p>Additionally, if the user has the toggle on,  Instagram would only have access when the app is in use; otherwise, it would be blocked. This level of control would extend across multiple apps and allow users to do the same for the microphone, allowing users to take charge of how these features and apps interact with them.</p><p>In all, with this update, users can rest easy knowing that they have as much control as possible over what other companies can see and detect.</p>

Additionally, it comes with 128GB of storage, a beautiful 6.1-inch AMOLED screen, IP67 water and dust resistance, and pretty impressive performance with its Google Tensor G2 processor.</p><p>As a mid-range phone, it doesn&apos;t have flawless gaming performance, though it&apos;s passable for most games. In our own tests of the phone, we also discovered that features like Face Unlock and Face Detection were killing the battery super fast, but turning these off kept us close to the full-day battery life mark.</p>

<ul><li>Predictive Back allows users to "preview" their destination when using the back gesture.</li><li>On Gmail, Predictive Back will preview the inbox when attempting to exit an email.</li><li>The feature is also reportedly available on Google Calendar </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android 14 users can begin experimenting with Predictive Back on Gmail while they wait for the feature to be deployed system-wide. </p><p>As first spotted by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/19/gmail-in-app-predictive-back/"> 9to5Google</a>, Gmail version 2024.03.03.x allows users to take advantage of the nifty gesture. As it stands, Predictive Back on a system level is behind developer options, and the tech giant has yet to implement it across all of Android 14. Still, it’s a welcomed sight for users who fancy productivity. </p><p>For the uninitiated, Predictive Back is a feature that allows a user to “preview” their destination when using the back gesture on their device. This feature gives a user a chance to decide whether they want to continue and commit to swiping back or returning to their current view. That current view is minimized while the user decides what action they’d like to take. </p><p>As Android’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/design/ui/mobile/guides/patterns/predictive-back"><u>developer website notes</u></a>, “predictive back provides a smoother, more intuitive navigation experience while using gesture navigation. It leverages built-in animations to inform users where their actions will take them to reduce unexpected outcomes.” </p><p>Users on Gmail will notice that when using the back gesture and through Predictive Back, their email will shrink into the corner, with the preview being the user’s inbox. As a result, the animation allows the user to commit to whether they’d like to exit the email and return it to their inbox. The Predictive Back feature is also apparently available in Google Calendar its monthly and daily overviews </p><p>It remains to be seen when Predictive Back as a whole will be implemented across Android 14 without the need for developer options. The tech giant has also encouraged developers to work towards enabling it within their own apps, even providing<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/custom-back/predictive-back-gesture"><u> an entire rundown of how to do so</u></a>.  </p>

The proof is in the pudding with these AMVR Quest 3 controller grips that are mainly designed to add grip and a hand strap, making it fast to change out the battery or use another Quest 3 controller accessory temporarily.</p><p>The secret is in the Quest 3 controller&apos;s ingenious battery door design which clips in and is only released with the press of a button. AMVR Quest 3 controller grips slot in place of the standard controller battery door, adding a lovely grippy texture and easily adjustable hand straps to make throwing objects in VR easier.</p><p>The hand straps are quickly adjustable via a velcro backing, and the ribbed texture on the grip surface helps keep hands cool even during long sweaty play sessions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>.</p>

<p>The original release of this controller grip was defective but AMVR quickly replaced those with a refined version that doesn&apos;t break easily. I&apos;ve been using them for months and have yet to find any structural issues, so I&apos;m confident that the original problems have been fixed.</p><p>My favorite part about these grips is how simple it is to remove them when necessary. You won&apos;t be changing out batteries very often since the Quest 3 controller battery life lasts weeks on end, but I often play Walkabout Mini Golf with friends and love putter accessories like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/helloreal-quest-golf-putter">HelloReal Putter</a> or this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AMVR-Attachment-Compatible-Accessories-Controller/dp/B0CP1MH1J6/">AMVR Quest 3 golf club</a>.</p><p>Both require you to remove the grips to fit snugly inside the club attachment, and it&apos;s nice to just pop the grips off with a single button press and slide the controllers into the golf club.</p>

<p>AMVR also sells <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AMVR-Controller-Compatible-Accessories-Protector/dp/B0CJF9QKZ5/">another controller grip</a> that completely covers the controller, if you prefer that. These are also good and add a similar hand strap to make throwing easier, but require more work to take off in case you want to use other accessories.</p><p>For me, though, simple is best. That&apos;s why I prefer the regular AMVR Quest 3 controller grips and why I call them one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a>. Of all the ones I&apos;ve tested so far, this is my favorite way to play.</p>
