<ul><li>Peak Design launched a new lineup of travel accessories, including a Small Tech Pouch.</li><li>This new carrying case is a smaller version of the standard Tech Pouch, making it a great way to store mobile accessories while on the go. </li><li>After using the Small Tech Pouch for a few weeks now, it’s my favorite accessory organizer yet.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Peak Design has been making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/peak-design-travel-tripod-review">quality camera gear</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/peak-design-android-magsafe-accessories">mobile accessories</a> for years, and there’s a new product that might be a good fit for Android power users. It’s called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.peakdesign.com/products/small-tech-pouch/" target="_blank">Small Tech Pouch</a>, and it’s a smaller version of the regular Tech Pouch, measuring about half the size of the original. It retails for $50 and comes in four colors: black, charcoal, midnight, and sage.</p><p>The release of the Small Tech Pouch, which just became available starting June 20, lined up with a new lineup of travel accessories from Peak Design. That includes the Travel Duffel 50L, Travel Duffel 80L, Packable Tote, and Ultralight Packing Cubes. I’ve been testing all of them for about a month, and surprisingly, it’s the Small Tech Pouch that I can’t stop using. It holds a lot more than its looks would suggest, and I fit all the Android accessories I need on a daily basis inside with no issues whatsoever. </p><p>Before using the Small Tech Pouch, I used the Native Union Stow carrying case and accessory organizer for well over a year. It fit the aesthetic I was looking for and held a fair bit of items, but I actually had to buy two of them to carry everything I needed for trips. There were a few other things I wasn’t a huge fan of, like zipper pockets that restricted what you could put inside them, an over-reliance on elastic straps, and a lack of rigidity when the carrying case was empty. </p>

<p>To be fair, the Small Tech Pouch doesn’t solve all these problems. Some of the case’s small-but-stretchy compartments still limit what you can put inside them. But what Peak Design got right is the rigid design that holds its shape even when the organizer is empty. That allows you to stuff things that don’t quite fit in the small compartments in the empty space in the middle of the Small Tech Pouch. Sometimes  less is more when it comes to pre-sized compartments, and it looks like Peak Design understood that.</p><p>The company added something that I haven’t seen before on an accessory organizer to the Small Tech Pouch. There are two small loops on each end of the pouch that allow you to wear it as a crossbody bag. It’s something I didn’t know I needed until I tried it. Instead of taking everything out of your accessory organizer and moving it all over to a fanny pack or crossbody, simply clicking on a strap to the Small Tech Pouch provides a similar experience.</p><p>That just about sums up why, as a power user that carries a lot of tech and accessories on a daily basis, an accessory organizer is a must-have for me. Most backpacks or tech bags have places you could put all your accessories inside without needing a dedicated pouch. But with an accessory organizer, you can move all your essentials across different bags without any stress. Everything is always stored in one place, so it’s always there when you need it. </p>
<h2 id="what-i-fit-inside-the-peak-design-small-tech-pouch-2">What I fit inside the Peak Design Small Tech Pouch</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AaRhdcyxpKEBAVqtj3QoxC" name="Peak-Design-Small-Tech-Pouch-10.jpg" alt="A spread of everything I fit inside the Peak Design Small Tech Pouch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AaRhdcyxpKEBAVqtj3QoxC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised how much the Small Tech Pouch can fit despite its 1L capacity limit. I couldn’t fill it up, at least not without going overboard just for the sake of doing so. You can see everything I fit inside the Small Tech Pouch in the image above, but here’s a quick rundown:</p>
<ul><li>Two Ugreen power adapters</li><li>Two pairs of Beats Solo Buds </li><li>Ugreen USB-C hub</li><li>SD card reader and storage case </li><li>Microfiber cloth</li><li>USB-C to USB-C cable</li><li>USB-C to MagSafe 3 cable</li><li>USB-C to Apple Watch cable</li><li>Peak Design Cuff camera strap</li></ul>
<p>That’s everything I need for work on a daily basis and then some. On some days, I stuffed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/review-ugreen-145w-25000mah-power-bank-review">Ugreen’s massive 145W, 25,000 mAh power bank</a> in there as well. I’m sure someone will find a way to fill up the Small Tech Pouch with their everyday carry, but mine is fairly robust and I didn’t come close.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="msgv8fj2ppEn2dWk9Ss8UD" name="Peak-Design-Small-Tech-Pouch-9.jpg" alt="The logo on the inside of the Peak Design Small Tech Pouch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/msgv8fj2ppEn2dWk9Ss8UD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the name suggests, this pouch still does remain compact. I tested it in a variety of backpacks and messenger bags, from the lightweight Incase Facet 20L backpack, to the Peak Design Everyday Messenger, to the spacious LTT backpack. You should be able to fit the Small Tech Pouch in most bags, and if you can’t, you can turn the pouch into a bag of its own with the loops. It’s this kind of versatility that makes Peak Design’s new accessory organizer stand out.</p><p>So, should you buy it? With a price tag of $50, you’ll want to make sure you have a need for it before you make the purchase. I think it’s worth the price, but I’m someone who values being able to store a variety of tech accessories in one place. My rule of thumb is that accessories are only useful if you have them with you when you need them. It’s simple, but I’m sure we all remember a time when we wish we had headphones or a charger with us. </p><p>The Peak Design Small Tech Pouch does a better job of storing my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories">favorite Android accessories</a> in a compact form factor, even besting the Native Union Stow organizer I used for over a year. That’s appealing to me, and if it sounds valuable to you, the Small Tech Pouch will likely be a worthy buy.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus has come up with a new battery, which will be seen in the upcoming phones from the company, and it aims to revolutionize smartphones shortly. It is dubbed the OnePlus Glacier battery and has a whopping 6100mAh capacity.</p><p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/u/3871046669?layerid=5047343858583450">Glacier battery</a> is built upon the company&apos;s "silicon carbon anode" battery technology, co-developed by OnePlus and Ningde New Energy. It is believed to be specially designed for high-performance phones and is acclaimed for users&apos; charging habits by providing at least two days of battery life on a single charge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:690px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.81%;"><img id="JR2f9CL2KnCYBwzynPu6EM" name="OnePlus-Glacier-Battery-01.jpg" alt="OnePlus Glacier Battery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JR2f9CL2KnCYBwzynPu6EM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="690" height="323" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the Glacier battery is stated to have its own set of benefits, like a quick charge of five minutes, which can give users a two-hour gameplay or is equivalent to browsing three and half hours of watching TikTok.</p><p>Another exciting element of the new battery capacity is the ability to support OnePlus&apos;s 100W super fast charge tech, which can be topped up by 1% to 100% in just 36 minutes. The further notable element of the new technology is that battery health is promised to retain its maximum health for up to 80% even after four years of usage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:690px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.81%;"><img id="ke7PVsrTVz6L3buQTHcCLM" name="OnePlus-Glacier-Battery-03.jpg" alt="OnePlus Glacier Battery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ke7PVsrTVz6L3buQTHcCLM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="690" height="323" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite a large 6100mAh battery capacity, it is conveyed to be smaller than the conventional 5000mAh batteries found in most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> — all thanks "to "high-capacity bionic silicon carbon material" utilized in the making process of the Glacier battery. It also uses an ultra-high energy density of 763Wh/L, which is "23.1% higher than that of ordinary graphite batteries."</p><p>OnePlus phones are known for their large battery capacities, especially with the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, which already feature 5400mAh and 5500mAh batteries, respectively. They also turned out to be quite outstanding in our Android Central reviews.</p>

<p>The same company bringing a new battery tech accompanied by fast charging is an encouraging aspect to look forward to, particularly with the future <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a>.</p><p>Speaking of OnePlus, the company has started teasing its next Ace 3 Pro handset, which is all set to launch in China by the end of the month. During the Glacier battery launch, the company confirmed that the upcoming Ace 3 Pro will be the first handset from the company to equip the new 6100mAh battery tech, and it will also be powered by a Snapdragon 8 gen series chip. The device&apos;s sibling, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-ace-3-unveiled-in-china">OnePlus Ace 3</a>, has also seen its launch very recently.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s Pixel phones have long reigned as the top camera phones, thanks to impressive computational photography. With some cool software tricks, the company is able to add a level of depth and more natural bokeh, giving images an almost DSLR-like quality. That said, with the new Honor 200 Pro, the Pixel may finally have its work cut out for it when it comes to portrait images.</p><p>Honor&apos;s latest camera-centric phone is not quite a premium flagship, but it&apos;s close enough, bringing specs that rival the latest Pixel 8 Pro. But where things get really interesting is how the phone handles photos, taking almost the opposite approach to most other phones.</p><p>So how do these phones stack up overall? In this Honor 200 Pro vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro guide, we&apos;ll put them side by side to give you an idea so you can decide which phone you prefer.</p>
<h2 id="honor-200-pro-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-design-and-display-2">Honor 200 Pro vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4136px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="kpJtWvoRNgdU5Eu7LtE6s" name="Honor-200-Pro-vs-Google-Pixel-8-Pro-1.jpg" alt="The Honor 200 Pro next to the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kpJtWvoRNgdU5Eu7LtE6s.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4136" height="2327" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design philosophy of both phones is very different. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-200-pro-review">Honor 200 Pro</a> has a very artistic design, which is obvious from both sides of the device. The phone features a very distinct glass back panel, which differs based on the color you get. The Ocean Cyan is one of the more interesting hues, which teeters somewhere between green and blue. It also features a dual-texture design, with part of the panel adopting a smooth matte-like finish while the majority of it has a textured look and feel.</p><p>Honor follows through with the more artistic design of the camera housing, which was inspired by the rather unique shape found at Casa Mila in Barcelona. The combination of these unique design choices results in a phone that is rather eye-catching and is bound to turn heads.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google retained the Pixel&apos;s iconic camera visor on the back with a rather shiny aluminum that wraps around the frame of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. However, the back is a matte glass with a very soft feel, adding a dramatic contrast to the overall design. The back panel also slightly curves into the frame, which itself is also slightly rounded.</p>

<p>On the front, the phone has a flat display with fairly minimal bezels. This is in stark contrast to the quad-curved screen on the Honor 200 Pro, which seamlessly curves into the plastic frame, mirroring the curvature of the back panel. This makes the phone appear even thinner than it actually is. The Pixel 8 Pro is 0.6mm thicker than the Honor, but it looks even thicker when the phones are placed side-by-side. The Pixel is also slightly heavier, but it&apos;s hardly noticeable.</p><p>Both phones have 120Hz OLED panels, and both are quite bright. Honor has the Pixel beat, however, thanks to the much higher 4,000 nits of peak brightness. Honor also took extra care to ensure the display was as comfortable as possible for users. That includes a high 3,840Hz PWM dimming rate—which is ideal for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> users, AI enhancements, TÜV Rheinland certifications, and other features that promote eye comfort.</p><p>Both displays are quite vibrant and sharp, but Honor takes the lead here despite the Pixel&apos;s higher pixel density. That goes for the design, too, which is much more inspired than the Pixel&apos;s, although the IP65 rating is noticeably weaker than the IP68 on the Pixel 8 Pro.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4214px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ff8SNx6g5VZoH36QPkFkBS" name="Honor-200-Pro-review-15.jpg" alt="The Honor 200 Pro face down on a desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ff8SNx6g5VZoH36QPkFkBS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4214" height="2370" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s not just the outside that separates these phones. Internally, the Honor 200 Pro is a bit of a half-step down from phones running the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a> inside still features many of the same AI capabilities and can keep up with many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>. Meanwhile, the Tensor G3 in the Pixel 8 still uses last year&apos;s Cortex-X3 core, but even so, the phone excels at AI, thanks to the Tensor processing unit. That means you may not get the best performance in all scenarios, but the phone will handle AI features extremely well.</p><p>That said, both phones perform well overall, and while gaming performance isn&apos;t particularly a strength of either, the Pixel seems to do a little better (but not by much). Games like Honkai: Star Rail play fairly smoothly on the highest settings, but expect either phone to get quite warm.</p><p>Both phones also have 12GB of RAM, which is great for juggling apps.</p>

<p>One thing that both these phones get right is audio. The dual stereo speakers sound very full and deep, giving your music some needed depth. The Pixel 8 Pro can make voices sound a little echoey, but it&apos;s not too noticeable. The downside is that neither phone has a headphone jack.</p><p>On-display fingerprint sensors are pretty good on both phones, but the sensor on the Honor 200 Pro is a bit faster, unlocking the phone almost as soon as I place my finger on the display. The Pixel 8 Pro takes about half a second. The downside of the Honor sensor is that it&apos;s incredibly low on the display compared to the more comfortable placement on the Pixel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3644px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="bz3pDA7S6YeTSRxBJJwjBX" name="Honor-200-Pro-IR-blaster.jpg" alt="The IR blaster on the Honor 200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bz3pDA7S6YeTSRxBJJwjBX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3644" height="2050" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These phones also have little extras that you may or may not find useful. For the Honor 200 Pro, there&apos;s an IR blaster that you can use for the Smart Remote feature. I use it with my Chromecast with Google TV dongle connected to my Vizio TV, and it works very well. For the Pixel 8 Pro, there&apos;s a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-google-pixel-8-pro-temperature-sensor">temperature sensor</a> on the back, which you can use to measure... things as well as people. It feels a bit superfluous as more smartwatches adopt temperature sensors, and probably would&apos;ve been more useful during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, but better late than never, I suppose.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="i4u2SnVVy7H5kexy6pHq9a" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-temperature-sensor-measurement-01.jpg" alt="Testing the temperature sensor on the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i4u2SnVVy7H5kexy6pHq9a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Neither phone is a battery champ, but this also depends on how you use either one. Power users may have trouble getting a full day&apos;s use, but the Honor 200 Pro has the benefit of 100W fast charging, which tops up the phone in less than an hour when you&apos;re low on juice. The Pixel only has 30W wired charging, which means you&apos;ll be waiting around for a full charge. The same goes for wireless charging, with the Honor hitting 66W and the Pixel only supporting 23W.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> on both phones feels very different. Honor&apos;s approach is much less big and bubbly than the Pixel UI, although I kind of prefer the former to the latter. However, some things may take some getting used to, like the separation of the notification panel and Control Center.</p><p>The Honor 200 Pro has some interesting AI features, like the ability to drag and drop content between apps with the Magic Portal, the ability to extract and interact with text within images, and Air Gestures that let you control the phone without touching it. You also get access to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a> if you want to switch away from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>, and the Magic Capsule brings a Dynamic Island-like experience to the phone when you&apos;re listening to music or using a timer.</p><p>That said, if you want cool AI features, the Pixel 8 Pro has you covered with a plethora of them, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">AI Wallpapers</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a>, and more. Thanks to Gemini Nano integration, many features are available on-device, such as translating and transcribing texts.</p><p>Google also brings frequent updates for Pixel phones, with quarterly feature drops that add even more capabilities.</p>

<p>As far as software updates go, The Pixel also has Honor beat with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-8-8-pro-seven-android-os-updates-game-changer">seven years of OS upgrades</a> and software updates. That said, Honor promises three OS upgrades and four years of security updates, which isn&apos;t bad and should be adequate for most people.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ldt9XngFE9S6gPhUwagFXn" name="Honor-200-Pro-vs-Google-Pixel-8-Pro-2.jpg" alt="The Honor 200 Pro next to the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ldt9XngFE9S6gPhUwagFXn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As stated before, the approach to the cameras is very different between these phones. Both have 50MP primary cameras and strong ultrawide and telephoto lenses (2.5x optical zoom on the Honor 200 Pro versus 5x on the Pixel 8 Pro). The Pixel 8 Pro often excels at adding depth and contrast to images while ensuring they remain sharp and detailed. The Pixel also tends to brighten up darker areas and shadows, giving you as much dynamic range as possible.</p><p>When shooting normally, the Honor 200 Pro seemingly does the opposite of the Pixel in many scenarios, whether it&apos;s leaning more into the shadowy parts of an image or brightening highlights with a surprising amount of dynamic range. This can often cause images to appear darker and with much more contrast than a Pixel, but they can also appear brighter in some areas. Images are also often warmer on the Honor than those taken on the Pixel.</p><p>From the images below, you can see the differences in how these phones process photos.</p>

<p>Where things get interesting, obviously, is in Portrait mode. The Honor lets you choose between three different styles: Harcourt Classic, Harcourt Color, and Harcourt Vibrant. All have a very different effect on the resulting image, but the latter option is probably closest to what a Pixel produces but with colors punched up a bit. With Classic and Color styles, Honor tends to make its Portrait images much more dramatic by simultaneously emphasizing shadows and brightening highlights, while the Pixel tries to make everything as bright as possible, including the background.</p>

<p>If you live in North America, then this might be an easy question to answer since the Honor 200 Pro isn&apos;t sold here. However, elsewhere in the world, the choice comes down to features and your preference when it comes to camera output.</p><p>The Honor 200 Pro is a gorgeous phone with some great specs and a few compromises. The camera system is geared toward anyone who prefers taking photos of people, although Portrait mode works well with just about anything. You&apos;ll just have to be okay with darker shadows and higher-contrast images. Elsewhere, the fast charging and PWM-friendly display give the Honor an edge over the Pixel.</p><p>As for the Pixel 8 Pro, images won&apos;t come out as stylistic as they will on the Honor, but they&apos;ll be consistently good. You&apos;ll also have access to the best AI features out the gate and an impressive software update promise. That said, the Honor 200 Pro costs quite a bit less than the Pixel 8 Pro, which is also worth considering.</p><p>You can&apos;t go wrong with either phone in my opinion, but for most people, the Pixel 8 Pro is probably the way to go.</p>

<p>Do you remember the old "Does it Blend" YouTube videos? Well, I&apos;ve kind of adopted a similar mindset, but instead of destroying things, I try to install emulators on <em>almost</em> anything. This includes the obvious things like phones, tablets, and, of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a>.</p><p>However, I&apos;ve become infatuated with expanding my emulation experiments into various streaming devices. The latest of which came courtesy of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/walmart-onn-google-tv-4k-pro-review">Onn. Google TV 4K Pro</a>, my new favorite Android-based streaming device. That said, I&apos;ve also done similar setups with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-2023-review">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a> and, more recently, the latest Apple TV 4K.</p><p>I think part of the reason why I&apos;ve ventured down this path is because I&apos;m a tinkerer at heart. It&apos;s one thing to be able to install an app, transfer some games, and start playing. But the process isn&apos;t <em>quite</em> as simple when it comes to trying to use emulators on streaming devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pNCuL3sTXcmrBaKtLmP49d" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-totk-alt.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra playing Tears of the Kingdom" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pNCuL3sTXcmrBaKtLmP49d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8064" height="4536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For one, it&apos;s absolutely wild that we&apos;re able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">play Switch games</a> on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, which is another can of worms that I&apos;ll open another day. But it&apos;s also awesome being able to lay back on the couch and fire up some Super Mario 64 or play Link&apos;s Awakening on the big screen. All while doing so from either a box or a stick that&apos;s a fraction of the size of the original console.</p><p>Anyways, as I mentioned before, the process for getting things up and running isn&apos;t as simple on streaming devices. Even with the Play Store at our disposal on Google TV, the most recent Play Store release isn&apos;t always the best way to play.</p><p>For instance, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.retroarch">Play Store version of RetroArch</a> hasn&apos;t been updated since November 2021. At first glance, you might look at that and think "Well, the app is dead, where do I go now?" In reality, RetroArch is very much alive and well, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://buildbot.libretro.com/stable/">most recent stable version</a> being released in early June 2024 and nightly builds easily accessible.</p>

<p>Because of that, you&apos;ll actually want to download and sideload the app directly from the RetroArch website. Provided that you install a file manager and something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yablio.sendfilestotv">Send files to TV</a> app, you can have the latest version installed on your streaming device in relatively no time. Then comes the process of actually making games accessible, which isn&apos;t an easy task for the Fire TV Stick or Chromecast with Google TV.</p><p>This is because neither of those devices includes any additional ports besides the one used for charging. All hope isn&apos;t lost; it&apos;s just that you&apos;ll need to use either a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromecast-google-tv-accessory-usb-c-hub">USB-C hub</a> or a micro USB OTG splitter. In doing so, you&apos;ll now be able to plug a USB drive in, after transferring your ROM files, of course.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3965px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="miif9Z7pE8XPzzxqN6PDw5" name="zelda-fire-tv-stick-4k-max.jpg" alt="Playing Zelda through an emulator on the Fire TV Stick 4K Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/miif9Z7pE8XPzzxqN6PDw5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3965" height="2230" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fun doesn&apos;t stop there; we&apos;re just getting started. There&apos;s a good chance that the majority of the retro games that you want to play will run just fine without any tinkering. However, because RetroArch takes a "one-size-fits-most" approach, there&apos;s more to it than just picking a game and being on your way.</p><p>If you try to play one of your favorite retro games, but you notice that performance is shoddy, you can choose a different RetroArch "Core." For the unaware, Cores are essentially barebones emulators that rely on RetroArch to act as the front end.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="tDvmcF4Loaj7FhMnYF4jSK" name="retroarch-core-updater.jpg" alt="RetroArch Core Updater" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tDvmcF4Loaj7FhMnYF4jSK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="809" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: RetroArch)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>An example of this is with the N64, as there are two different Cores built into the app. If you fire up Super Mario 64 and aren&apos;t happy with the performance, you can go back to the main RetroArch interface and switch to a different one. The same rings true for many other emulators, with only a few exceptions. It&apos;s very much a "trial and error" scenario, which is perfect for the tinkerers out there.</p><p>Of course, RetroArch isn&apos;t the only emulator that can be used on streaming devices; it&apos;s just the one that I&apos;d recommend starting with. RetroArch works with all kinds of retro consoles, ranging from the Atari 2600 all the way up to the PlayStation 2. Still, I&apos;d recommend staying away from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ps2-emulators-android-all-best-options-available">PS2 emulators</a> on streaming devices for now, at least until they get a bit more power.</p><p>So the next time that you have friends or family over and are trying to figure out something to do, grab a couple of controllers and fire up an emulator. You&apos;ll never forget the look of surprise when the original Super Smash Bros. appears on your TV, and you can enjoy those classics all over again. It&apos;s also how I plan to show my son some of the best retro games before he tries getting into Roblox and Fortnite and whatever else the kids play these days.</p>

<p>Ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympics, Samsung has launched a special line of smartphone accessories celebrating the event&apos;s logo and colors.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s new collection includes over 50 smartphone accessories to celebrate the upcoming Summer Olympics in Paris. This array includes protective cases, portable power banks, and handy shoulder straps, all with a Parisian twist (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-accessories-paris-2024-olympics/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p><p>Each item showcases the Paris 2024 emblem, French team colors, and chic Art Deco designs. For true fans, the collection also features "Phryge," the official mascot of the Games.</p><p>The 2024 Summer Olympics will begin on July 26. In its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/fr/samsung-electronics-france-presente-les-produits-officiels-jeux-olympiques-et-paralympiques-de-paris-2024" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Samsung France says that this launch is to celebrate the ongoing global partnership between Samsung and the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Samsung&apos;s upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-event-date-rumored">expected to take place in Paris on July 10, 2024</a>.</p><p>The new lineup extends to a range of Galaxy phones, such as the following:</p>

This gadget jungle leads to a messy tangle of various power adapters. Even though modern devices mostly use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c">USB-C ports</a>, making charging a bit easier, juggling multiple phones, headphones, laptops, tablets, and accessories is still a bit of a hassle.</p><p>On the other hand, the rise of fast-charging technology for smartphones and other smart devices has brought a wave of versatile accessories. These new products focus on compatibility with various devices, offering solutions beyond just charging phones and tablets. Enter the Baseus PowerCombo GaN3 Pro power strip. This product goes beyond a typical power strip, featuring multiple ports that can charge up to six devices at once.</p>

<h2 id="price-and-availability-2">Price and availability</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="AQvbbgyeiZ9d3JsJ6ef7Kk" name="Baseus-PowerCombo-GaN3-Pro-6.jpg" alt="Baseus PowerCombo GaN3 Pro charging station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AQvbbgyeiZ9d3JsJ6ef7Kk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Baseus PowerCombo GaN3 Pro is available from major retailers, with Amazon selling it for around $90. Currently, it only comes in black. While this might not bother everyone, it can stand out against lighter-colored furniture. As I write this review, my eyes keep drifting to the PowerCombo—not because of its sleek design (which it has) but because its matte-black finish contrasts sharply with my warm wood desk.</p>
<h2 id="an-all-around-charger-2">An all-around charger</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SGqymvey62mPsjR9iheoMf" name="Baseus-PowerCombo-GaN3-Pro-4.jpg" alt="Baseus PowerCombo GaN3 Pro charging station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SGqymvey62mPsjR9iheoMf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This 100W charging station leverages GaN technology for powerful performance. Gallium nitride (GaN) makes the design compact and ensures efficient charging. I can charge multiple devices at once. After months of real-world use, I&apos;ve found it pretty reliable despite a few quirks (more on that later). As a result, this charger is now a permanent fixture on my desk.</p><p>The Baseus PowerCombo 100W redefines the traditional power strip, moving beyond the old AC strips hidden behind desks. Unlike bulkier models, the Baseus PowerCombo 100W is compact, measuring only 4.4 x 1.8 x 1.5 inches and weighing a mere 15.7 ounces.</p><p>Gone are the days of bulky chargers hogging precious space in my travel bag. Thanks to GaN technology, the Baseus PowerCombo 100W packs a powerful punch in a remarkably compact design. Its small footprint allows for effortless placement on my desk, or any desk for that matter, but its true potential shines when on the go. This lightweight charger is a serious contender for becoming your travel charging companion, ensuring all your devices stay powered up during trips and adventures.</p><p>The Baseus PowerCombo 100W maintains the brand&apos;s reputation for quality. Its performance, especially with the USB-C ports, is impressive. With two AC outlets, two USB-A ports, and two USB-C ports, the PowerCombo covers a wide range of devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="64XFf9NYQnd3qoetXjTLvc" name="Baseus-PowerCombo-GaN3-Pro-3.jpg" alt="Baseus PowerCombo GaN3 Pro charging station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/64XFf9NYQnd3qoetXjTLvc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>This lightweight charging station is perfect for keeping your devices charged on the go, making it an ideal travel buddy.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While the Baseus PowerCombo GaN3 Pro delivers up to 100W of power, it&apos;s important to understand how this works in real-world use. Its impressive output is most noticeable when charging a single device through one of the USB-C ports. However, when multiple devices are connected, the power is smartly distributed to ensure each gadget charges efficiently.</p><p>When you connect two devices, the power splits between the ports. One device will receive 65W, while the other gets 30W. Check out the image below for a full guide on multi-port charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.87%;"><img id="7TkyomsdzFkWY9Ta8XaCNb" name="Baseus-powercombo-100W-charging-guide.jpg" alt="Baseus Powercombo 100W charging guide" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7TkyomsdzFkWY9Ta8XaCNb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1267" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Baseus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This charger is a breeze to use with its conveniently accessible ports. It effortlessly keeps my devices charged up without any issues. Its minimalist design, featuring a sleek black casing, fits well with most setups. The bright orange ports add a fun touch and make it easier to insert USB cables correctly, solving that all-too-common struggle.</p><p>The Baseus PowerCombo GaN3 Pro smartly manages power across multiple devices, prioritizing faster charging for power-hungry gadgets. It ensures all connected devices get enough power. Although its charging speeds might not quite match those of dedicated wall chargers, the difference is minor, and the convenience of having a single hub for multiple devices is unbeatable.</p><p>It&apos;s worth mentioning that even with GaN technology, the Baseus PowerCombo GaN3 Pro can get slightly warm during extended use, but it never reaches worrying temperatures. Additionally, I&apos;ve noticed brief power interruptions when plugging in multiple USBs at once. According to Baseus, this is due to "overpower protection," a safety feature to prevent overloading.

<ul><li>A new report claims that Samsung will use Qualcomm for all the Galaxy S25's processors. </li><li>Previously, Samsung used a mix of its own Exynos processors and Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips to power Galaxy phones.</li><li>This would mark the second time that Samsung used Snapdragon processors for its S-series lineup in all regions — the first time was with the Galaxy S23 series last year. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We&apos;re still waiting for Samsung to unveil its next-generation lineup of foldables, including the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-slim-rumor-mill">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. However, leaks surrounding the further-out Galaxy S25 series are already heating up. There are conflicting reports about what kind of processor will power Galaxy S25 phones, but a new one from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that Samsung will release another series of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagships</a> featuring Qualcomm processors in all regions. </p><p>Historically, Samsung has used a mix of Qualcomm Snapdragon chips and its own Exynos platforms, with different regions getting different processors. That changed in 2023 when the Galaxy S23 series shipped with Snapdragon chips everywhere. When the current Galaxy S24 lineup was unveiled this year, Samsung returned to using a mix of Snapdragon and Exynos processors. </p><p>Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-snapdragon-8-gen-3-for-galaxy">explained earlier this year</a> that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy platform powers the Galaxy S24 Ultra in all markets, but the S24 and S24 Plus use Samsung&apos;s Exynos chips "in select regions." By comparison, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> for Galaxy chipset powered all of Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Galaxy S23</a> phones globally.</p><p>Now, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that Qualcomm will "likely" produce all the chips for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>. That might not be by choice, though. Kuo adds that Samsung has seen lower-than-expected yield for the upcoming flagship Exynos platform built on the 3nm process. It&apos;s expected to be called the Exynos 2500. Due to the rumored low yield, Kuo predicts Samsung will use the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset — likely in a "for Galaxy" version — for every Galaxy S25 device.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Qualcomm will likely be the sole SoC supplier for the Samsung Galaxy S25 (vs. 40% for the S24), as the Exynos 2500 may not ship due to Samsung's lower-than-expected 3nm yield.In addition to the significant increase in supply share, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 will see a price…<a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1802737528874955169">June 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>This contradicts an earlier, but less credible, rumor surrounding the Galaxy S25 chipset. An X (formerly Twitter) user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OreXda/status/1763379083935936999" target="_blank">@OreXda</a> claimed in March 2024 that the entire Galaxy S25 series would be powered by Exynos processors — ditching Qualcomm entirely. This rumor also stated that the Galaxy Z series would use Qualcomm chips and the Galaxy A series would use a mix of MediaTek and Exynos processors.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So currently 2025 Samsung phones will be :Galaxy Z - Snapdragon OnlyGalaxy S - Exynos OnlyGalaxy A - Mediatek & Exynos<a href="https://twitter.com/OreXda/status/1763379083935936999">March 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>It&apos;s possible that there is some degree of truth to both reports. If Samsung had been able to producer better yield for the upcoming Exynos 2500 systems-on-a-chip, perhaps it had a goal of moving to Exynos entirely. This would&apos;ve been a risky move, since the Exynos versions of Samsung phones still typically perform worse than their Snapdragon counterparts. But if the yield for the new platform was lower than expected, as Kuo reports, that would explain why Samsung is shifting gears entirely. </p>
<h2 id="why-samsung-may-have-wanted-to-move-away-from-qualcomm-chips-2">Why Samsung may have wanted to move away from Qualcomm chips</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7P2ErZCEHSc73umEzHChMN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-back-titanium-04.jpg" alt="The back of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in the Titanium Grey colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7P2ErZCEHSc73umEzHChMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s certainly understandable why Samsung would want to use Exynos processors in all Galaxy S25 phones. In the same report, Kuo says that Qualcomm plans to raise prices for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 mobile platform. This aligns with previous reports, but this time, we got an idea of how much. Kuo adds that Qualcomm will charge phone manufacturers 25-30% more for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip than it charged for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip. That would make these processors priced at nearly $200 alone. </p><p>Kuo says that the price increase has to do with the way the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip is manufactured. It&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4-tsmc-rumor">made using TSMC&apos;s N3E process node</a>, per the report, which is costly. It would be the first Android mobile platform to be created using a 3nm process, which Apple first used in the A17 Pro chip in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max</a>. </p><p>Samsung&apos;s rumored Exynos 2500 processor is also set to use the company&apos;s own 3nm process, but as Kuo reports, it may not ship at all due to low yield. Of course, Samsung would rather make its own chips at a lower cost than Qualcomm is charging for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 mobile platform. However, if Samsung&apos;s 3nm process doesn&apos;t have a great yield rate, Samsung can end up spending more time, money, and manufacturing resources on Exynos chips than it would&apos;ve by simply paying Qualcomm. </p><p>It&apos;s still fairly early in the rumor cycle for the Galaxy S25 series, and things can certainly be changed before the phones are officially announced, which isn&apos;t expected to happen until early 2025. But if it&apos;s true that the Exynos 2500 has bad yield rates, it makes sense that Samsung would pivot to going all-in on Snapdragon. After all, it did the same thing just a year ago. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.97%;"><img id="ur2UZV7sHPk4tJ8uwtZoDe" name="tsmc.jpg" alt="TSMC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ur2UZV7sHPk4tJ8uwtZoDe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1351" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd.)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If anything, this just goes to show how far ahead TSMC really is in the chip manufacturing industry. Samsung has plenty of incentive to make a flagship Exynos chip with Qualcomm raising Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 prices. The higher build-of-materials cost would almost certainly be passed on to customers, which I&apos;m sure buyers won&apos;t be thrilled about. By developing its own chips, Samsung could keep phone prices where they are while increasing profit margins.</p><p>But that only works if Samsung can make Exynos competitive and efficient to produce. It can&apos;t seem to do that if Kuo&apos;s report is accurate. The clear winners here are TSMC and Qualcomm, which appear to be leaving Samsung Foundry, Intel, and everyone else in the dust. </p>

<p>It&apos;s almost election season in the U.S., and Samsung doesn&apos;t want you playing catch up, hunting down news channels to keep up with the happenings of the day. This is why it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-news-product-updates-for-galaxy-owners-news-sports-more/">announced</a> on Wednesday (June 20) that it will be expanding its News App to include in-depth coverage of major upcoming events, including the 2024 United States Presidential Election, with a new update to the app. </p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-news-launch">launched</a> the Samsung News app a year ago—a revamped version of the existing Samsung Free application that helps Galaxy users explore news globally from trusted sources like Bloomberg Media, CNN, and Fox News. The app offers daily news briefings, a customized news feed based on the user&apos;s interests, and podcasts from news/entertainment channels within the app.</p><p>In the past year, "Samsung News has become a daily touchpoint for millions of people looking for easy-to-access updates from their favorite local and national news outlets," said Avner Ronen, VP of product development for Samsung.</p>

<p>With this new update, targeted towards people in the U.S., Samsung News will sport a dedicated tab within the app that will be a "comprehensive hub for the Presidential election coverage." This tab will host an updated calendar of key dates such as debates, party conventions, other upcoming events, candidate profiles, and updated presidential polls. </p><p>Additionally, Samsung is taking it further and collaborating with La Liga before its 94th season kick-off. As their new content partner, Samsung aims to showcase up-to-date information on everything soccer and trending news stories of the user&apos;s favorite teams and players. </p><p>"This partnership will serve as a new tool to not only promote the league and its clubs but also expand our reach in North America through a timely and effective channel,” said Alan Nissim, head of business operations for La Liga North America.</p><p>Samsung has partnered with other news sources, such as Yahoo Sports, ESPN, CNBC, and Good Morning America.</p><p>It looks like Samsung is trying to keep up with users as more people continue to reach for their mobile devices to access the news of the day, more so on the go. The news update is now available to all Galaxy users in the U.S. However, it remains unclear when the said update will roll out to other markets across the board. </p><p>Android Central contacted Samsung for more details, but it did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<ul><li>Google detailed several patches for June regarding its Play Systems for Android users, which brings security and privacy fixes alongside Play Protect improvements.</li><li>Google also rolled out "auto-lock" for lost or stolen devices alongside the ability for users to use a USB cable and WiFi for data restoration and backup.</li><li>Pixel phones received a June security patch earlier this month, which packed loads of fixes for several user-reported issues.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is starting to roll out another wave of Play Service updates for Android users that encompass a range of issues.</p><p>The company detailed its recent set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">patch notes</a> on its Systems page (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/20/june-2024-google-system-updates/#more-623645">9to5Google</a>). Google is starting to roll out version <strong>24.24 </strong>of its Play Services, which brings a new set of goodies for app developers. The notes state that there are several "new features" rolling in for Google and other developers creating apps that could piggyback off Wallet.</p><p>Those users should find new support for Digital Wallets & Payment-related processes within their apps. Google is also patching a few security and privacy issues for users on PC, mobile, and smart TVs.</p><p>Version 41.5 of the Google Play Store aims to provide "improved protection" from Play Protect when users install apps.</p><p>Several more system updates for June are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>With this new security feature, you’ll be able to set a lost or stolen device to auto-lock once it loses connectivity (Phones).</li><li>With this new feature, you can now use your USB and Wi-Fi at the same time to backup and restore your device during setup (Phones).</li><li>New developer features for Google and third party app developers to support Maps related processes in their apps (App Developers).</li><li>New developer features for Google and third party app developers to support Account Management related processes in their apps (App Developers).</li></ul>

<p>For "Device Health," Google rolled out a patch that included optimizations for Android&apos;s "Adaptive Battery" feature. Additional bug fixes for device disconnections have arrived in June, as well.</p><p>Google&apos;s listed addition of "auto-lock" for a lost or stolen device seemingly refers to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">Offline Device Lock</a>." The company detailed the coming feature during I/O 2024, stating it would help users with devices on its Find My Device network. If a device is taken offline for too long, it will automatically lock itself to protect your data.</p><p>Additionally, if a malicious person fails too many sign-in attempts, your phone will lock down.</p><p>What&apos;s unclear is if Google&apos;s listed USB and WiFi usage for data transfers is referring to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-preps-data-restore-tool-transfer-upgrades">what was discovered in May</a>. The company&apos;s Data Restore Tool app featured a few glimpses into this new method to speed up data transfers. Essentially, users should be able to restore the data of an old phone without needing to factory reset.</p><p>Google&apos;s June updates for its services should automatically download and install as we finish the week. In other news, Pixel phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-june-2024-security-patch">grabbed a June patch</a> with loads of fixes for stability, battery, charging, and camera problems.</p>
