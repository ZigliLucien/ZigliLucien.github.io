<ul><li>Xiaomi 14T and 14T Pro are the next upcoming phones from the company, which are likely to launch soon in Europe.</li><li>The standard model is likely to be powered by the Dimensity 8300 Ultra and the Xiaomi 14T Pro may come with the Dimensity 9300 Plus.</li><li>Both are tipped to be coming in three color options. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It is that time of year when we expect a bunch of products from Xiaomi to launch, including phones like the Xiaomi 14T and the Xiaomi 14T Pro. A new leak reveals most of the specs and pricing of the upcoming phones.</p><p>The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-les-prix-et-caracteristiques-des-xiaomi-14t-et-14t-pro-a-paraitre-bientot-59091">Dealabs magazine</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_14t_and_14t_pro_mega_leak_reveals_full_specs_and_prices-news-64353.php">GSMArena</a>) and indicates that the Xiaomi 14T and the Xiaomi 14T Pro are debuting soon in the European region. They will follow in the footsteps of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-13t-series-announced">Xiaomi 13T series</a>, which were announced in Berlin last September. </p>
<p>New information from the outlet indicates that Xiaomi will be offering one configuration for each model. The former is said to feature 12GB of RAM coupled with 256GB of storage and come in Titanium Black, Gray, and Blue color options. Meanwhile, the Xiaomi 14T Pro could come with the same RAM and 512GB of onboard storage and may also be available in the same colorways as the standard model.</p><p>The Xiaomi 14T Pro is tipped to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">Dimensity 9300 Plus</a>, and the standard variant might ship with a Dimensity 8300 Ultra SoC.</p><p>The rest of the specs are also out for the Xiaomi 14T and its Pro variant. Per the publication, both devices have 6.67-inch AMOLED displays with 144Hz refresh rates. Both are also tipped to have a triple camera system, and as seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, they&apos;re likely to also be backed by Leica.</p><p>The Xiaomi 14T may use a 50MP IMX906 sensor coupled with another 50MP telephoto lens and a 12MP ultrawide-angle lens. The Xiaomi 14T Pro might also use a 50MP sensor, but it is a Light Fusion 900 sensor paired with the same 50MP telephoto and 12MP ultrawide-angle lens. For selfies, these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are said to carry a 32MP sensor on the front.</p>

<p>Both variants will supposedly pack the same 5000mAh battery capacity that supports 50W wireless charging for the Pro model; the wireless charging support for the standard variant, however, is yet to be determined. Other similarities include an IP68 rating, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, Bluetooth 5.4, and NFC.</p><p>As for pricing, the leak indicates that the Xiaomi 14T will cost €649, and the Xiaomi 14T Pro costs €899.</p>

<ul><li>An APK dive into a recent Google Play Services beta shows Google will disable your Pixel Watch 3's UWB connectivity if your phone enters Airplane mode.</li><li>Google's code states your device will resort to its Bluetooth connection, which brings back that so-so experience.</li><li>The Pixel Watch 3 launched in a 41mm and 45mm variant with larger screen space, loads of Fitbit perks, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest smartwatch features UWB support and while it&apos;s useful, a teardown shows its activity highly depends on your phone&apos;s airplane mode.</p><p>An APK dive into the latest beta Google app version (24.35.30) by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-watch-3-uwb-airplane-mode-3476777/">Android Authority</a>) shows that airplane mode disables the Pixel Watch 3&apos;s UWB functionality. Airplane mode is a safety feature that cuts back on radio waves that could interfere with the instruments during a flight.</p><p>With that in mind, it makes sense that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3&apos;s</a> UWB chip would stop working. A string in Google&apos;s code states "Watch Unlock with Ultra-Wideband is not available in Airplane mode." Users will switch to a Bluetooth connection to unlock the device. The company adds that your device can still unlock easily; however, users may experience a "delay" or "less accuracy" because of Bluetooth.</p><p>Your UWB chip will continue to work <em>after </em>Airplane mode is turned off or once users enter "a country that supports Ultra-Wideband."</p><p>Additionally, the APK dive showed that Google will let users control whether or not their Pixel Watch 3 leverages the UWB chip. The publication states that opting out of its usage may prolong your watch&apos;s battery life.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="aFo87rpy8zfzMobPVrbe3U" name="google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-45mm-with-pixel-buds-pro-2-3.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 with Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aFo87rpy8zfzMobPVrbe3U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s choice to add a UWB chip into the Pixel Watch 3 was likely due to the so-so experience of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-use-wear-os-watch-unlock">Watch Unlock</a>. Available on both of the previous iterations, Watch Unlock lets users conveniently unlock their phone so long as their Pixel Watch is nearby. It originally leveraged your Bluetooth connection, which was often more fickle than dependent.</p><p>With UWB, the connection between your phone and watch <em>should </em>be stronger and help cut back on odd wait times.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 has yet to land in consumer hands. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-series-goes-official">launched the device</a> in two sizes this year: 41mm and 45mm, which offer more screen space than the previous Watch 2 edition.</p><p>Loads of new Fitbit perks make the Watch 3 a joy to have strapped to your wrist on runs and during workouts. With it slated to arrive early in September, the Pixel Watch 3 starts at $349 for its 41mm variant.</p>

<p>It seems that Google is preparing to bring a little more AI prowess to drivers utilizing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a>.</p><p>AssembleDebug, in collaboration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-live-android-auto-apk-teardown-3477163/">Android Authority</a> discovered signs of Google&apos;s conversational AI, Gemini Live, for Android Auto. The following string is woven into version v12.8.14 of Android Auto: "gearhead_assistant_action_kitt_live_query." The publication suspects that "kitt" refers to Google&apos;s AI as the description reads "Start conversation."</p><p>Moreover, the following "live" tag may suggest that this integration involves the latest launch of Gemini Live on Android.</p><p>The APK teardown further discovered mention of a "GeminiLiveAssistantAction" alongside several other actions for Android Auto. Unfortunately, aside from these brief mentions, the automobile app&apos;s code doesn&apos;t share a much deeper look at how this could all shake down.</p><p>It also seems that Google is preparing to mark Gemini&apos;s existence on Android Auto with a star icon. What remains to be seen is how/where Google plans to pop this star onto Android Auto&apos;s UI once it rolls out.</p>

<p>Google detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">Gemini Live</a> during its event in August. This version of Gemini is said to be more "conversational," as users can speak to it about anything on their mind. Gemini Live seems to take advantage of Google&apos;s recent advancements in AI, as the company stated it can understand complex questions.</p><p>The model began rolling out to Gemini Advanced subscribers on August 13, sparking curiosity about its potential Android Auto integration.</p><p>Regardless, drivers have a host of other AI-backed features to utilize while on the road without needing to lean on Gemini. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-highlights-android-updates-mwc-2024">During MWC 2024</a>, Google highlighted summaries for lengthy text messages, including those from group chats. Android Auto will also display "relevant" replies to messages received, so drivers aren&apos;t wasting time fiddling with their devices on the road.</p><p>What&apos;s more, Android Auto&apos;s AI features provide a quick and easy button to deliver an ETA message to whoever&apos;s asking and the option to start a call.</p><p>Gemini Live&apos;s potential inclusion on the road could give drivers more help during navigation. But we&apos;ll have to wait and see, as the company seems to be in the early stages of development.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Vivo tends to launch a lot of phones over the course of a year, and its mid-range V series in particular sees a new model every six months. The breakneck launch strategy means there isn&apos;t much in the way of differentiation between generations, with Vivo instead offering one new feature to justify launching new devices.</p><p>That changed at the start of 2024, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v30-pro-review">V30 Pro</a> coming with sizeable upgrades, including Zeiss tuning and 50MP auxiliary cameras. With the V40 Pro, Vivo is touting portrait shots as the marquee addition, but it&apos;s also offering much better hardware with the Dimensity 9200+, and even better cameras. Just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a>, the V40 Pro&apos;s 50MP zoom lens doubles as a portrait shooter, and it manages to deliver truly outstanding photos.</p><p>There&apos;s also a larger 5500mAh battery, but the phone itself isn&apos;t any thicker than its predecessor, and that&apos;s an achievement in and of itself. Although the V40 Pro is launching just six months after its predecessor, the sheer number of new features makes it one of the most exciting devices in this segment.</p>

<p>Vivo unveiled the V40 and V40 Pro at a launch event in India on August 7, and the phones are going on sale in the country later in the month. The V40 Pro is available in 8GB/256GB, 12GB/256GB, and 12GB/512GB editions, while the standard V40 is sold in 8GB/128GB, 8GB/256GB, and 12GB/256GB models.</p><p>The key difference between the standard V40 and the V40 Pro is that the latter gets a 50MP telephoto lens at the back. The Pro model is more powerful thanks to the MediaTek Dimensity 9200+, with the standard version offering the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3. Outside of that, both phones share the same 120Hz AMOLED panels, same design, same 5500mAh battery with 80W charging tech, and same software.</p><p>In India, the V40 Pro costs ₹49,999 ($595) for the version with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and the 12GB/512GB model costs ₹55,999 ($667). That&apos;s a heady increase over the V30 Pro, which is available for ₹41,999 ($500) for the 8GB/256GB model and ₹46,999 ($560) for the 12GB/512GB edition.</p><p>The regular V40 starts at ₹34,999 ($417) for the 8GB/128GB model, going up to ₹36,999 ($440) for the 8GB/256GB edition and ₹41,999 ($500) for the 12GB/512GB version.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vdwR4ZdW4DE7gKYQrcNTcE" name="vivo-v40-pro-21.jpg" alt="Vivo V40 Pro next to V40" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vdwR4ZdW4DE7gKYQrcNTcE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo tends to deliver interesting designs with its V series phones, and that&apos;s no different with the V40 Pro. The phone shares similar dimensions as its predecessor, and the symmetric curves at the front and back ensure you can easily hold and use the device. The V40 Pro is one of the thinnest phones around, but there&apos;s adequate thickness around the mid-frame that it isn&apos;t awkward to use the phone in the least.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2Ytj8VpMTogJmZaavX2WsD" name="vivo-v40-pro-22.jpg" alt="Vivo V40 Pro next to V40" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Ytj8VpMTogJmZaavX2WsD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A sizeable change this generation is the camera housing; the module is getting massive with every new release, and the way it is going, by the time the V60 series rolls out by this time next year, the cameras will cover the entire back. Anyway, Vivo says the Gemini Ring camera island accentuates the overall design, and while it looks a little oversized, it isn&apos;t ungainly.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zMvqVnYTUnEQaCrCEmZP7B" name="vivo-v40-pro-3.jpg" alt="Vivo V40 Pro back view highlighting the design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zMvqVnYTUnEQaCrCEmZP7B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As always, Vivo has interesting color choices of the V40 and V40 Pro. The Nebula Purple, Sunglow Peach, and Meteor Blue variants come with a textured back, and the Moonlight White version that I&apos;m using has a glossy coat. The white hue has subtle hints of blue, and Vivo says the design is meant to evoke images of "pristine moonlight reflecting off a tranquil lake," and while the color looks elegant, what I actually like is the anti-fingerprint coating that does a good job minimizing smudges.</p>

<p>Coming in at 7.58mm, the V40 Pro has the distinction of being the thinnest phone with a 5500mAh battery. I still don&apos;t understand why brands chase these meaningless figures, as a thinner device doesn&apos;t really offer any material benefits in daily use. If anything, increased thickness makes holding a device easier. That said, Vivo did a good job balancing the design, and I have to admit that the V40 Pro looks a lot sleeker than its predecessor.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="79yTukVhvC6K66TDte2yEF" name="vivo-v40-pro-5.jpg" alt="Vivo V40 Pro profile view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/79yTukVhvC6K66TDte2yEF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;ll still need to invest in a case to safeguard the device, but in the two weeks I used the V40 Pro, I didn&apos;t notice any issues with build quality; the phone took a few tumbles and came away unscathed. Vivo says it reinforced the chassis to be able to withstand tumbles, and that is indeed the case in daily use.</p>
<p>Another welcome change is the addition of IP68 ingress protection, giving the V40 Pro much better resistance to the elements. While the V40 Pro doesn&apos;t bring many groundbreaking new features, there are lots of smaller tweaks that ultimately make it a much better device.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-v40-pro-display"><span>Vivo V40 Pro: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EHURXMuY2hpngERG973mbF" name="vivo-v40-pro-11.jpg" alt="Vivo V40 Pro home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EHURXMuY2hpngERG973mbF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo hasn&apos;t changed the dimensions of the panel on the V40 Pro, so you get the same 6.78-inch AMOLED screen with a resolution of 2800 x 1260 and 120Hz refresh. What&apos;s different this time is that the panel gets noticeably brighter, going up to 4500 nits in HDR content. Of course, there isn&apos;t that big a change in daily use, and while the V40 Pro gets brighter outdoors, it&apos;s only evident when using it next to the V30 Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3GYC7n4VFi9VjDoV7NHeDE" name="vivo-v40-pro-15.jpg" alt="Vivo V40 Pro selfie camera housing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3GYC7n4VFi9VjDoV7NHeDE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What you&apos;ll actually end up noticing is the presence of stereo speakers; Vivo was obstinate in using a single driver on its mid-range phones up to this point, but thankfully, the V40 Pro gets stereo sound, and that immediately makes a difference. The color fidelity is just as good as the V30 Pro, and you get vibrant colors and excellent contrast — I didn&apos;t see any issues in regular use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NzqFtMb3m2YmgdiqNmT6wG" name="vivo-v40-pro-16.jpg" alt="Vivo V40 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NzqFtMb3m2YmgdiqNmT6wG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a decent amount of customizability as well, and the only quibble I have with the panel is that the in-screen reader sits too low; this is a routine enough occurrence on Vivo phones these days, and it makes using the device more awkward than necessary. Other than that though, Vivo got everything right; the addition of stereo sound and tweaks to the brightness levels makes the V40 Pro one of the best devices in this regard.</p>

<p>Vivo&apos;s V series devices aren&apos;t necessarily known for their hardware, and while the V30 Pro was decent enough in daily use, its shortcomings were evident while gaming. Thankfully, Vivo is rectifying the issue with the V40 Pro; the phone is powered by the Dimensity 9200+ platform, and it is incredible. It switches to Arm&apos;s v9 cores, including a Cortex X3 at 3.35GHz, three Cortex A715 cores at 3.0GHz, and the usual cluster of four A520 cores clocked at 2.0GHz.</p><p>The result is that the V40 Pro delivers significantly better performance than any other V series device to date. The phone does a terrific job in demanding games thanks to the 11-core Immortalis-G715, and even during extended gaming sessions, I didn&apos;t see much in the way of jitter. If anything, the V40 Pro has one of the best hardware packages in this category, and Vivo pulled quite the turnaround in this area.</p>

<p>I&apos;m using the 12GB/512GB version of the phone, and while Vivo uses UFS 3.1 storage modules, I didn&apos;t see any issues in multitasking or shooting 4K video. The vibration motor is great in its own right, and it has granular feedback. There are no problems with connectivity either; the V40 Pro has a Wi-Fi 7 modem, Bluetooth 5.3, and the usual AptX HD suite of codecs.</p><p>Battery is another area where the V40 Pro has a sizeable advantage over its predecessor. The 5500mAh battery manages to last over a day without breaking a sweat, and even with heavy use, I got a day and a half between charges. And when you need to plug it in, the 80W charging tech takes just over 45 minutes to charge the battery.</p><p>Thanks to the latest Dimensity platform and bigger battery, the V40 Pro easily outshines the V30 Pro and most other mid-range phones, and if you&apos;ve wanted a Vivo mid-ranger that takes great photos and is also good at gaming, this is the obvious choice.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-v40-pro-cameras"><span>Vivo V40 Pro: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ogacLUsmVPakFY97A5NRx9" name="vivo-v40-pro-8.jpg" alt="Vivo V40 Pro back highlighting camera island" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ogacLUsmVPakFY97A5NRx9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo regularly rolls out updated cameras on its V series devices, and the V40 Pro is its strongest showing yet. The phone comes with a quartet of 50MP cameras; there&apos;s a 50MP Sony IMX921 main camera with OIS that&apos;s joined by a 50MP Samsung ISOCELL JN1 wide-angle lens and a 50MP Sony IMX816 telephoto that also has OIS. There&apos;s another 50MP ISOCELL JN1 module at the front, and it has a wide angle of view.</p><p>Now, if those sensors look familiar, it&apos;s because they&apos;re unchanged from the Zeiss-tuned V30 Pro. The IMX921 is an update to the IMX920, but other than that, the wide-angle, zoom, and selfie lenses on the V40 Pro are the same as its predecessor, with the key difference being the addition of OIS on the telephoto.</p><p>However, Vivo made tweaks to its camera tuning algorithms, and the V40 Pro is able to deliver better photos in all scenarios. What I like the most is that the zoom lens doubles as a portrait shooter; I used this to great effect on the X100 Pro and the X100 Ultra, and it&apos;s exciting to be able to do the same on a mid-range phone.</p>

<p>Just like the V30 Pro, the V40 Pro manages to take outstanding photos in daylight scenarios, delivering shots with great color rendition and white balance. There are no issues with foliage rendition or contrast levels, and the wide-angle lens also does just as good a job.</p><p>Similarly, the phone takes detailed shots in challenging situations, and there isn&apos;t visible noise — even with the wide-angle or zoom lenses. That&apos;s a big deal on a mid-range phone; while most devices in this segment have a great primary lens, the auxiliary cameras are an afterthought, and that&apos;s thankfully not the case on the V40 Pro.</p><p>Another thing the phone gets right is portrait shots; you can choose the focal length and bokeh, and the V40 Pro takes the best portrait shots of any mid-range device. I took hundreds of portrait shots with the X100 Ultra, and while the V40 Pro didn&apos;t quite manage to deliver the same caliber of photos, it came close — and that&apos;s no small feat.</p><p>Vivo made heady gains in the imaging side of things this year, and while the X100 Ultra is the best all-round camera I&apos;ve used in 2024, the V40 Pro has a clear edge over other mid-range phones.</p>

<p>There isn&apos;t much to talk about on the software front, with the V40 Pro offering the same Funtouch OS 14 interface as its predecessor. The UI is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and while there is overt customization, it looks cohesive, and it is similar to ColorOS. Vivo has a set of custom features that are exclusive to its phones, and these include gestures, Jovi Home, and unique always-on styles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JRZNURJVYyUt6ziPePbbKG" name="vivo-v40-pro-19.jpg" alt="Vivo V40 Pro notification pane" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JRZNURJVYyUt6ziPePbbKG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The interface itself is fluid, and there is a decent amount of customizability on offer. There are no issues with notifications, and while the memory management is aggressive at times, it isn&apos;t anywhere as bothersome as Xiaomi&apos;s software.</p><p>Other than that, the only point of contention with Vivo&apos;s software efforts is that the V40 Pro will get just three platform updates. Most phones in this segment now get four updates as standard, so Vivo is on the backfoot in this regard. Then there&apos;s the question of when these updates will be available to the device — Vivo needs to roll out timely updates to its mid-range phones as well.</p>

<p>If you don&apos;t need the latest phone, the V30 Pro is still a great offering, and now that the V40 series is official, it&apos;s available for less. The V30 Pro also has terrific cameras, the design is just as elegant, and the AMOLED panel is similarly great. The battery doesn&apos;t last as long, and the phone isn&apos;t anywhere as good at gaming, but if you don&apos;t mind those omissions, it is a better value.</p><p>Talking about value, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> continues to be a good choice in this category, and it combines a good design with powerful hardware and a great 50MP camera at the back and 5500mAh battery. While I like the main camera, the auxiliary lenses aren&apos;t anywhere as good, and the resultant shots aren&apos;t quite on the same level as the V40 Pro.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-v40-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>Vivo V40 Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8yeitpfHxPLgfNHVh599WB" name="vivo-v40-pro-4.jpg" alt="Vivo V40 Pro next to colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8yeitpfHxPLgfNHVh599WB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a mid-range phone with terrific cameras</li><li>You want a sleek design that doesn't miss out on the basics</li><li>You need powerful hardware</li><li>You want two-day battery life</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a good value</li><li>You want timely software updates</li></ul>
<p>While I didn&apos;t think much of the V40 Pro when it was announced, I ended up liking the device quite a bit in the two weeks I used it. The ultra-thin design is noticeably different to other phones, and Vivo deserves credit for cramming a massive 5500mAh battery into such a svelte frame.</p><p>While the camera housing is starting to look comically large, I like the overall design of the phone. The hardware is similarly enticing, and the inclusion of stereo sound and IP68 ingress protection allows the V40 Pro to stay relevant in this category. The battery lasts much longer than the V30 Pro, and I was easily able to get a day and a half even with heavy use.</p><p>Interestingly, the switch to MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9200+ makes the V40 Pro one of the most powerful mid-range phones around; it is significantly better than its predecessor at demanding games, and it doesn&apos;t overheat even in extended gaming sessions.</p><p>But the camera is once again the star of the show; by including four great cameras on the device, Vivo is offering the best overall camera package of any mid-range phone today. Yes, it costs a lot more than the V30 Pro, but you&apos;re also getting sizeable upgrades, and if you want a sleek phone with great cameras, the V40 Pro should be at the top of your list.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> is $100 off at Best Buy right now, marking a great price on what is otherwise considered an expensive watch. The Forerunner 965 is similar to the last-generation 955, though it comes with some major improvements to mapping and the display.

<hr>
<p>The Pixel Watch 3’s live Nest Cam streaming will soon be available on other Wear OS watches too.</p><p>Google just introduced a new feature for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> that lets you check out live streams from Nest cameras right on your watch. It’s a convenient way to keep an eye on things, even if your phone is not nearby.</p><p>For now, though, this feature is only available on the Pixel Watch 3, but Google plans to roll it out to older Pixel Watches and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS devices</a> soon (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/30/pixel-watch-live-nest-cam/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The company hasn&apos;t given a specific date yet.</p><p>This integration also lets users get instant notifications on their watch, so they can view live camera feeds. They can also take quick actions like starting a two-way chat or sending preset responses.</p><p>Once configured, users can quickly access live video from their doorbells and cameras. Just tap the Camera tile, select your camera, and the live stream starts. Swipe left or right to move the view, and double-tap to zoom in.</p><p>Additionally, there’s a hamburger menu at the bottom of the screen that lets you access "Quick Replies" or start a two-way talk. When you begin a two-way conversation, the camera will chime, alerting the person on the other side that they&apos;re being watched and a chat is about to begin. To end the conversation, just tap the mic icon on your watch.</p><p>Google’s decision to make live Nest Cam streaming available on other Wear OS devices is a smart move. It means the feature will be accessible to a lot more people, not just Pixel Watch users, which should help more folks adopt and use Nest Cam products.</p><p>Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/15294135" target="_blank">support page</a> says the feature only works with Nest cameras or doorbells from 2021 onward that are connected to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> app. Plus, you’ll need <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS</a> 1.4 or higher on your watch for it to work smoothly.</p><p>This decision encourages a more flexible setup, letting users choose devices that work best for them without being stuck with just one platform.</p>

<p>Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> now scans barcodes and QR codes automatically, making it a lot more useful and quicker for getting the info you need.</p><p>The new AI visual lookup feature has added a new capability that lets you scan QR codes and barcodes right through the viewfinder. It’ll even pop up a handy chip that takes you straight to the website, as noted by Mishaal Rahman on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-barcode-scanner-rollout-3476930/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Circle to Search can now automatically scan barcodes and QR codes!This feature was spotted by @AssembleDebug in late June but has now rolled out to myself and several other people.

<p>Circle to Search basically acts as a smart visual search tool, analyzing what’s on your screen and giving you info based on what you highlight or circle. Meanwhile, if QR codes are visible on your screen, the feature will automatically scan them without you needing to do anything.</p><p>The feature shows handy chips with URLs, making it easy to jump straight to the site you want. Google first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-get-new-circle-to-search-features">unveiled this functionality in July</a>, and it’s now rolling out to more devices, including the Galaxy S23 Ultra we’re using.</p>

<p>Once a URL pops up, just tap the link you want to visit. This makes it way quicker than manually circling QR codes, saving you a lot of time finding multiple links.</p><p>In Rahman&apos;s demo, he goes to a website with a QR code, and Circle to Search instantly turns it into a clickable URL.</p><p>While it might seem like a small tweak, this update really boosts the user experience. By cutting out an extra step, it makes accessing data quicker and more convenient.</p><p>The feature is now rolling out to users with compatible Google Pixel and Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a>. To try it out, just visit a webpage or open an image with a QR code, then long-press the home button or navigation handle to activate Circle to Search.</p><p>This update fits right in with Google’s push to enhance Circle to Search. A recent addition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/28/circle-to-search-share/" target="_blank">is a handy Share button</a>, making it easy to share selected content with your contacts.</p>

<hr>
<p>Honor pulled a bold move against Samsung by engraving a tiny, sarcastic "apology" on its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-and-magic-vs3-foldables-announced">Magic V3</a>. Though it seems harmless, this cheeky gesture packs a punch, showcasing Honor’s competitive edge with a dash of schadenfreude.</p><p>The mobile industry loves a bit of brand rivalry, and this time, Samsung—known for taking jabs at Apple—finds itself in the hot seat. Just before IFA 2024, the South Korean tech giant has become the target of a cheeky jab.</p><p>Quite unapologetically, Honor is taunting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> owners, claiming that their device is a mere shadow of the upcoming Magic V3, the thinnest and most durable foldable on the market.</p><p>The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> from the Chinese brand measures only 4.35mm when unfolded and 9.2mm when folded. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is 5.6mm thin when unfolded and 12.1mm when folded.</p><p>To drive home the point, Honor enlisted micro-artist Graham Short to engrave a tiny "world&apos;s smallest apology" on the hinge of a special-edition Magic V3.</p><p>Honor says the message engraved on the Magic V3 is so tiny, you need a microscope to read it. It&apos;s no wonder the text is hard to decipher. But here&apos;s the full text:</p><p><em>"Dear Samsung Galaxy Z Fold owners, we’re sorry. We know you were excited to buy a phone that folds in half and fits in your pocket, awkwardly. You were promised the future, a technical marvel, a world of boundless multitasking and performance.</em></p><p><em>"And now, you&apos;re probably looking at the new HONOR Magic V3 and feeling a little... betrayed. Size matters, and we feel your pain. Like being tipped for a gold medal and then coming last in the race, the knowledge that a thinner, lighter, and more durable foldable exists is enough to make anyone question their choices.</em></p><p><em>"We get it. You were an early adopter, a pioneer bravely venturing into the uncharted territory of foldable screens with questionable durability. You deserve better.

<p>Honor&apos;s "apology" is a cheeky way to highlight the dilemma faced by Galaxy Z Fold owners who have opted for a bulkier device when the Magic V3 offers a thinner design.</p><p>Don&apos;t get us wrong, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is an incredible phone. It&apos;s a powerful and versatile device that we praised as "master of refinements" in our review.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6&apos;s AI software is also a cut above the rest. While the Magic V3 has its own impressive AI features, we’re skeptical it can match the Z Fold 6’s software prowess.</p><p>While the Honor Magic V3 is launching worldwide on September 5, there&apos;s still no word on whether US customers will get their hands on it.</p>

It&apos;s too late for buyer&apos;s remorse, so the first step is to personalize your Ultra so that it&apos;s as useful and individualized to your needs as possible. </p><p>Having reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and several other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung watches</a>, I&apos;m familiar enough with its One UI Watch spin on Wear OS to point you towards every software feature, new or old, that requires you to dive into settings before you access them. Here are my Galaxy Watch Ultra tips and tricks for getting started! </p><p><em>Note</em>: Whenever I say "Settings" below, I mean the Galaxy Watch Ultra settings found when you swipe down from the main watch face, unless I say otherwise.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-change-your-default-assistant-apps-and-shortcuts"><span>Change your default assistant, apps, and shortcuts</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4DStjDLKKkTcnbvQaxXvVN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-google-assistant.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4DStjDLKKkTcnbvQaxXvVN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re a fan of Samsung&apos;s apps like Bixby and Samsung Wallet, then skip to the next section. But for everyone who prefers Google&apos;s apps, Samsung lets you switch them in as your default options. But you&apos;ll need to download many of them from the Play Store first, and not all of them can be activated in the same place.</p><p>To switch your default apps, go to <strong>Settings > Apps > Choose default apps</strong>. Here&apos;s where you can make Google Assistant and Google Messages your default options. Then, back in Settings, open <strong>Buttons and Gestures</strong> and, under <strong>Home button</strong>, select <strong>Press and hold</strong> and choose Assistant instead of Bixby.</p><p>Unfortunately, Samsung refuses to let you remap the long-press back button shortcut from Samsung Wallet to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> (or anything else). But in this same menu, you can make the <strong>Double Press</strong> shortcut go to any app, including Google Wallet.</p><p>While you&apos;re in this Settings menu, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-quick-button">change what the Quick Button does</a>; it defaults to Samsung Health workouts, but you can choose the Stopwatch, Flashlight, or Water lock tools instead, or default to a <em>specific</em> workout type. </p><p>Lastly, if you want to use Gboard instead of Samsung Keyboard, download Gboard from the Play Store, then go to <strong>Settings > General > Input > Keyboard list and default > Default keyboard</strong> and choose Gboard.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-turn-on-gestures"><span>Turn on gestures</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="GihReeuppfvmJz5YHiZYdK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-gesture.jpeg" alt="Performing a double tap gesture while wearing the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GihReeuppfvmJz5YHiZYdK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has three gesture controls in the same <strong>Buttons and gestures</strong> menu, all disabled by default. Samsung doesn&apos;t point these out during the initial buttons-and-functions tour, so you might never realize they&apos;re there unless you go looking.</p><p><strong>Double pinch</strong> lets you "answer calls, dismiss alerts, launch apps, control your music, and take photos." <strong>Shake to dismiss</strong> has you rotate your wrist twice to "decline incoming calls or dismiss alerts such as alarms, timers, and reminders." <strong>Knock knock</strong> has you bend your wrist down twice to pull up whichever app you want.</p><p>You can turn each on or off individually, so you&apos;ll have to decide if they&apos;re worthwhile to you. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7 reviewer</a> praised these shortcuts, even while saying they only work about 70% of the time. It makes sense to try them for yourself and see if (A) you have issues with false positives and (B) you find it easier than relying on the buttons. Personally, I love "Knock knock" the most, simply because I love having more shortcuts to my favorite apps instead of having to search in the app drawer.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-emergency-sos-and-fall-detection"><span>Set up Emergency SOS and Fall Detection</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="iZuuQFvr93XmEpcerxjbvL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-sos-emergency-shortcut.jpeg" alt=""Press the Home button 5 times to call an emergency number" reads the text on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZuuQFvr93XmEpcerxjbvL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In an emergency, you can <strong>press and hold the Quick Button</strong> to trigger a loud siren, to help anyone nearby find you. But if you&apos;re somewhere isolated and need to call for help, you can <strong>tap the Home button five times</strong> to call 911 from your watch, as well as send your location and an SOS message to your emergency contacts. And your watch can auto-call 911 if it detects you falling.</p><p>Some of these features need to be set up in advance, however! Open your mobile <strong>Galaxy Wearable </strong>app with the Ultra synced and follow these steps:</p><p>1. Tap <strong>Watch settings > Safety and emergency</strong>.</p><p>2. Under <strong>Medical info</strong>, fill out your <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Medical conditions</strong>, <strong>blood type</strong>, <strong>allergies</strong>, <strong>medications</strong>, <strong>organ donor status</strong>, and other info. </p><p>3. Back in Safety and emergency, tap <strong>Emergency contacts > Add emergency contact</strong> and choose whoever you&apos;d want notified in an emergency from your phone Contacts. Then toggle <strong>Share during emergency calls and texts</strong> to ensure emergency response receives your medical info and emergency contact info.</p><p>4. Next, tap <strong>Emergency SOS</strong>. Change your <strong>Emergency number to call</strong> if necessary (mine said 112 instead of 911) and decide whether you want to toggle <strong>require swipe to call</strong> to prevent accidental 911 calls, or to <strong>Share info with emergency contacts</strong> to simultaneously send your info out as you call 911.</p><p>5. Finally, toggle <strong>Hard fall detection</strong> on. With this function, your watch will detect if you&apos;ve suddenly stopped moving and call 911 if you&apos;re not conscious or able to respond to the on-wrist alert.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-limit-your-notifications"><span>Limit your notifications</span></h2>
<p>I only want certain notifications popping up on my wrist; I can check less important ones later, and when certain apps buzz your wrist constantly, it becomes more aggravating than helpful.</p><p>In the <strong>Galaxy Wearable</strong> mobile app, tap <strong>Watch settings > Notifications > App notifications</strong>. Here, you will see a full list of installed apps and can individually toggle off apps you don&apos;t care to see.</p><p>By default, <strong>Sync Do not disturb with phone</strong> is toggled on, which means you don&apos;t need to worry about getting notifications at night. I also like to go into <strong>Advanced notification settings</strong> and toggle on <strong>Turn on screen</strong>. This means that I don&apos;t need to twist my wrist every time I feel a notification buzz; when I&apos;m working at my desk, I like being able to glance at my wrist without having to move it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update-your-watch-face"><span>Update your watch face</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rAFRsDQwYo8mFyp7ybZNEJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-customize-watch-face.jpeg" alt="Customizing the watch face on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rAFRsDQwYo8mFyp7ybZNEJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cool thing about the Galaxy Watch Ultra is how its 3,000-nit display can squeeze in a ton of readable information and has some new, sporty watch faces by default. That said, you should definitely take the time to update them with more useful info and your personal flair.</p><p>You can edit watch faces on the Ultra directly, but it&apos;s much easier to do so in the <strong>Galaxy Wearable app</strong> under <strong>Watch faces</strong>. There you can choose between all of the default One UI 6 Watch options or go downloading from the Play Store. Unfortunately, because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> uses a new XML <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/watch-face-format-for-future-wear-os-releases">Watch Face Format</a>, it&apos;s incompatible with the popular watch face app Facer.</p><p>Still, you&apos;ll find plenty of customization options in the main Wearable app. With the new Ultra Analog watch face, for instance, you can edit the color, style, hands, night mode look, and all <em>eight</em> complications, so you can see all manner of different data based on what you care about. Simply select each criteria, change what you want, then hit <strong>Save</strong> and it&apos;ll immediately auto-update to the Ultra.</p><p>I like to pre-customize and complicate a few different watch faces all at once. Then, if I&apos;m in the mood for a style change, I can just tap and hold the main screen and then swap to one of my backups while keeping the same data I care about.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-adjust-your-display-and-timeout-settings"><span>Adjust your display and timeout settings</span></h2>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra lasts long enough that I like to use the Always-On Display (AOD) setting, make my screen timeout delay longer, and keep apps open and running in the background in case my watch display turns off by mistake.</p><p>Swipe down from the main watch face and tap the <strong>Settings cog icon</strong>, then select <strong>Display</strong>. Here, you can (and should) enable <strong>Adaptive brightness</strong> for obvious reasons, then decide whether to leave <strong>AOD on or off</strong>.</p><p>In this same menu, I prefer to adjust <strong>Screen timeout</strong> to 1 minute and <strong>Show last app</strong> to Within 2 minutes, just to have the most flexibility. This will drain your battery a little faster but feel like an improvement whenever you do use your Ultra.</p><p>You can also change the <strong>default font</strong> in this menu. For the visually impaired, the <strong>Gothic Bold</strong> font makes all text a bit larger and easier to read at a quick glance when you&apos;re not wearing your glasses.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-learn-how-to-extend-your-battery-life"><span>Learn how to extend your battery life</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="muEMqS53avunFtnPzL7JDQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-charging.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra sitting on a charging puck at 17% power." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/muEMqS53avunFtnPzL7JDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For polar-opposite people more concerned about making the Galaxy Watch Ultra last as long as possible, let&apos;s run through your options.</p><p>First, the obvious one: Swipe down to Quick settings and tap the <strong>Battery with leaf icon</strong> to insta-trigger Power Saver mode. This turns off the Wake up gesture, AOD, and Wi-Fi, and it "limits" CPU performance, background network and location updates, and screen brightness while shortening your screen timeout. </p><p>By default, Power Saver also disables auto-detected workouts, high/low HR alerts, continuous HR / HRV / stress, and nightly skin temp, SpO2, respiration, and sleep score. But Samsung seems to know that you might want to cut the smarts but keep the health data in Power Saver mode; go to <strong>Settings > Battery</strong> and toggle <strong>Limit health features </strong>to <strong>Off</strong> to retain them. It makes Power Saver less efficient but more realistic that you&apos;d want to use it.</p><p>One other battery-saving option is to add more <strong>Sleeping apps</strong>. Essentially, this ensures that certain apps will check for notifications "only occasionally," delaying information. It&apos;s sort of a semi-DND for apps that you can&apos;t turn off entirely but know you don&apos;t get many notifications or don&apos;t care about seeing them immediately.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-extend-unlock-your-samsung-phone"><span>Extend Unlock your Samsung phone</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JBGXHpWrwGSGL97ZjuxbVR" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-and-Galaxy-S22-Plus.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra sitting atop the Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JBGXHpWrwGSGL97ZjuxbVR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of my favorite Wear OS features is to keep my phone unlocked if it detects my smartwatch nearby. Toggling this tool is straightforward, so long as you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>.</p><p>Open your <strong>phone settings</strong>, then <strong>Lock screen and AOD > Extend Unlock</strong>. You&apos;ll be prompted to input your phone <strong>PIN</strong>. Then tap <strong>Trusted devices > Add trusted device</strong> and choose your Galaxy Watch Ultra out of the list of connected Bluetooth devices.</p><p>Keep in mind that Extend Unlock works even if you&apos;re not currently wearing your watch; someone could theoretically pick up your unattended watch as a key to unlock your phone. If you&apos;re worried about that, you can go into the <strong>Modes and Routines</strong> settings and make it so that Extend Unlock only works at a particular location or time, when you&apos;re less likely to take your watch off or leave your phone unattended.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-add-music-files-to-your-watch"><span>Add music files to your watch</span></h2>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra can stream your playlists from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">popular music streaming apps</a> over its built-in LTE connection if you add it to your cellular plan, but that&apos;s also a battery killer, even for a long-lasting watch. A better option is to use the doubled storage space and pre-install your music playlists, podcasts, or audiobooks onto the Ultra. That way, you can leave your phone at home and treat the Ultra like a true standalone device.</p><p>This guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-save-music-files-galaxy-watch">how to add music files to Galaxy Watches</a> runs through the steps in more detail, but to briefly summarize, you open the <strong>Galaxy Wearable app</strong> on your phone, tap <strong>Manage content > Tracks on watch</strong>, and add any playlists, albums, or specific songs you want.</p><p>Otherwise, if you subscribe to a specific music streaming app like Spotify, you can typically download offline playlists directly from each respective app. The same applies to Wear OS apps like Audible (which has you pre-download audiobooks onto the watch) or Wear Casts for podcasts. Then you just need some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> or other wireless earbuds to pair with the Ultra.</p><p>On a somewhat related note, if you prefer to stream through your phone, you may want to go to <strong>Settings > Advanced features > Auto launch media controls</strong>. This makes the controls appear by default after you start a playlist or video, so you don&apos;t need to go hunting for them.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-buy-some-backup-bands"><span>Buy some backup bands</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="En3d2D49Ted9cnWDETPXEF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-band-clasp.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/En3d2D49Ted9cnWDETPXEF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you preordered your Galaxy Watch Ultra, you got a second band to go with whichever you picked. Otherwise, you&apos;re stuck with your single Marine, Trail, or Peakform band, each with its particular perks and downsides. Since Samsung charges a whopping $79 for its official bands and the Ultra uses a proprietary band connector, you&apos;ll have to look for some third-party options if you want to switch things up. </p><p>We have a whole guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-bands">Galaxy Watch Ultra bands</a> you should consider; you&apos;ll either have to go with cheap, generic bands from nonsensically-named brands or pay full price on Samsung&apos;s superior options. Either way, the good thing about the Ultra is that swapping your band takes less than a minute because of how easy it is to pop them out and slide new ones back in. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-turn-on-developer-options"><span>Turn on developer options</span></h2>
<p>If you really want to get the most out of your Galaxy Watch Ultra, try playing with the same settings that the Wear OS developers secretly use. They often have drawbacks that make them unfit for everyday users, but you might still want to try them. </p><p>In <strong>Settings</strong>, scroll all the way down to <strong>About watch</strong>, then tap <strong>Software information</strong> and find the <strong>Software version</strong> field. Then <strong>tap it five times</strong>. A Developer Mode pop-up should flash, so back up to Settings and you&apos;ll see <strong>Developer options</strong> under About watch.</p><p>There are dozens of developer options, too many to discuss here, but I was pleasantly surprised to see <strong>Force full GNSS measurements</strong>. Samsung already gave the Galaxy Watch Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">better tracking accuracy</a>, but this dev mode makes your watch check your location more frequently at the expense of battery life. If you don&apos;t mind the trade-off, this should make your results even more accurate.</p><p>You can also toggle things like <strong>Vibrate on connectivity change</strong> to warn you if you leave or enter a network, or ensure your watch <strong>stays awake while charging</strong> if you like to have it sit on your desk during that time. An especially popular setting, based on what I&apos;ve seen on Reddit, is to <strong>shorten the animation</strong> when switching between apps or menus to <strong>0.5x</strong>.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has the same software as past Galaxy Watches, barring a few Wear OS 5 changes. Aside from the new Quick Button shortcuts and gestures, most of the experience will feel quite familiar to you, or to fans of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> in general.</p><p>I didn&apos;t cover some tips like making sure to wear your Ultra to bed to see your Energy Score, or to take an ECG reading and follow the prompts to set up the results in the Samsung Health monitor app — since most Galaxy Watch owners will naturally figure those things out on their own. Hopefully, this Galaxy Watch Ultra beginner&apos;s guide will have shown you things that you might not have noticed on your own!</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra costs more than your typical smartwatch, so make sure you're getting your money's worth by updating all of the above settings straight out of the box. It's a long-lived smartwatch — both for its 60-hour battery life and four years of Wear OS updates — so you'll want to make the most of those perks.</p></p>

<p>Our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a> that money can buy, the Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 straddle the delicate line between premium specs and good old-fashioned bang for the buck. You get incredible sound quality straight out of the box, but there&apos;s also active noise cancellation, spatial audio support with improved head tracking, and loads of customizable settings in the Sound Plus app. </p><p>The included charging case is also interesting because it can double as a playback conduit using LE Audio technology when Bluetooth isn&apos;t available, which means you can listen to your favorite songs literally anywhere. </p><p>Of course, as with any piece of tech, not everything here is perfect. The Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 only feature middling battery life, and you won&apos;t get the hi-res codec support you&apos;d find in, say, the Sony WF-1000XM5. But if you simply want a pair of earbuds that sound great without breaking the bank, this Labor Day deal from Best Buy presents a unique opportunity. </p>
