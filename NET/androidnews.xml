<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/jabra-elite-5-review">Jabra Elite 5</a> earbuds are a great set of earbuds despite being a couple of generations old. While the Elite 5s already punch above their weight at their normal price point, dropping them to under $100 makes them look even more competitive.</p>
<p>The Elite 5s include solid audio quality and features such as ANC, EQ, HearThrough, and more through the Jabra app. Plus, you can expect fairly consistent battery life, and IP55 dust and water resistance.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHJF9WYN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a70baa28-22da-4f7a-a223-169efcdc72c1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.99" data-dimension48="$149.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for earbuds with high-quality audio at a really low price point; you want earbuds that offer ANC, EQ, and other customizable audio features.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re willing to drop more money on earbuds and would rather pick one of Jabra&apos;s premium-tier earbud lines; you need earbuds with better water and dust resistance than the IP55 rating.</p><p>The Jabra Elite 5 earbuds offer great audio quality and features such as ANC, customizable EQ options, and the company&apos;s useful HearThrough ambient mode. The EQ and app features are super easy to use, offering the user six presets and the option to customize their own. In general, these earbuds tend to last up to seven hours without the charging case, and you&apos;ll get around three full charges when using the case.</p><p>Just weeks ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-review">Jabra announced it would be exiting the headphone business</a>, though it simultaneously launched its latest generation of the Jabra Elite line. While the former piece of news could mean that Jabra app support could change in the future, the latter suggests that it&apos;ll at least be around for the lifespan of these headphones.</p>

That&apos;s a ridiculous amount of money towards a foldable, and if you&apos;re having second thoughts, there is a much better alternative available: the OnePlus Open.</p><p>The Open launched last October to much fanfare, and it combined a stellar design with top-of-the-line hardware, versatile cameras, and a large battery with 67W charging — better than any other foldable to date. The foldable debuted at $1,699, but you can get it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Dual-SIM-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad/dp/B0CHN8FNW3">for $1,299 right now</a> as part of Prime Day, a sizeable discount of 24%.

<p>The Open continues to be one of the best foldables money can buy; you get a great design, terrific hardware, standout cameras, useful software features, and amazing battery life with 67W fast charging.

<p>I didn&apos;t like the Open initially; while the design and hardware was terrific, there were annoying software issues out of the box. Thankfully, those have been resolved after a few weeks, and when I switched to the foldable following its Android 14 update, it was almost an entirely different device. OnePlus added a ton of customizability, and you get plenty of useful multitasking features on the software side of things.</p><p>But my favorite thing about the Open is the size; the outer screen is just the right size, and while it is smaller than the Z Fold 6, it is wider — and as a result, much more usable. Both the inner and outer screens go up to 120Hz, and the panels are among the best you get in this segment.</p><p>You don&apos;t miss out on any of the basics either; the foldable gets IPX8 water resistance, Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.3 along with AptX codecs, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage as standard, and a 4805mAh battery with 67W charging. The cameras are among the best of any foldable, and that includes the Z Fold 6. The main 48MP camera takes magnificent photos in just about any lighting, and the 64MP 3x optical zoom comes in handy if you need to get close to a subject.</p>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a foldable with incredible hardware and outstanding cameras. Both the inner and outer screens on the Open are usable, and the hinge has a smoother articulation than what you get on the Z Fold 6. The crease in the middle of the inner screen isn&apos;t as noticeable, and the software has extensive customizability.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want to buy a carrier-backed model instead of buying unlocked, and you need seven years of software updates.</p><p>Ultimately, the Open is my go-to choice if you need a new foldable phone in 2024. It offers all the best qualities of the foldable design and form factor, and you get amazing cameras at the back with plenty of versatility. Outside of a few extras like dust resistance and longer software updates, the Z Fold 6 doesn&apos;t measure up to the Open in any meaningful way, and if you&apos;re using a regular phone and want to upgrade, now is the time to do it.</p>

While sleek, shiny <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> like the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic and Google Pixel Watch may be great for apps and casual wear, you wouldn&apos;t want to take them with you on that 5K mud run or winter hunting trip into the snow-packed Appalachians. Even if they were still usable after the grime, slushy snow, or other fluid exposure, precise GPS tracking would kill the battery in under a day.</p><p>That&apos;s where more outdoor-oriented smart watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-t-rex-ultra-review">Amazfit T-Rex Ultra</a> come in. While they may lack the robust app support of Android&apos;s Wear OS system, they won&apos;t face the battery guzzling drain of those apps (or the Wear OS system itself). The T-Rex Ultra can get 20 days of battery in full smartwatch mode — and up to 40 hours of use with the Endurance GPS mode — while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review#section-samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-battery-life-and-sleep-tracking">Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro&apos;s 590mAh battery</a> only lasts 80 hours in smartwatch mode and less than a day once you get any hour-plus GPS-tracked activity involved.</p><p>I&apos;ve taken the 40mm versions of the Galaxy Watch 5 and 6 golfing. Both of them are basically dead by the time you&apos;re getting back to the clubhouse after a full 18 holes thanks to the GPS drain. You shouldn&apos;t have that issue with the Amazfit T-Rex Ultra.</p><p>Thankfully, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2024-dates-early-deals-and-what-to-expect-from-the-sale">Amazon Prime Day</a> is bringing deals on smartwatches and wearables of all shapes and sizes, including $100 off the Amazfit T-Rex Ultra to bring it down to its lowest price to date. </p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="9088c388-ee34-43b0-a096-4178092a3337" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV2PTSWR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="6qpprNT4JxJdkXvEbCFeUH" name="Amazfit-T-Rex-Ultra-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6qpprNT4JxJdkXvEbCFeUH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7000" height="7000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazfit T-Rex Ultra:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV2PTSWR" data-dimension112="9088c388-ee34-43b0-a096-4178092a3337" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99"><del>$399.99</del> <strong>$299.99 with Prime at Amazon</strong></a></p>
<p>Big, beefy, and almost impossible to break, Amazfit's most durable smartwatch is not for the faint of heart or wrist. If you can take the weight, though, this watch supports 30-meter freediving, -40-degree skiing, and Death Valley hiking up to 150 degrees. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV2PTSWR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9088c388-ee34-43b0-a096-4178092a3337" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you&apos;re after a watch that&apos;ll survive your dirtiest mud runs and week-long hikes through the Rockies. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want a lightweight watch, robust app support, or contactless payments.</p><p>This is not the smartwatch most users need. After all, this lacks many of the "smart" features that water buyers look for: there&apos;s no speaker or microphone, so you won&apos;t be using it for calls Dick Tracy-style. There&apos;s no NFC nor any tap-to-pay apps for this watch, so you won&apos;t be using it to pay for your post-run snacks at the bodega on the way home from your practice 10K. It&apos;s also missing most of the popular fitness tracking apps because it&apos;s a proprietary system rather than Wear OS and some more advanced tracking tools like skin temperature or abnormal heartbeat detection. It&apos;s also three times as heavy as the Galaxy Watch 6. </p><p>That said, what it <em><strong>does</strong></em> have is the most durable body in a smartwatch we&apos;ve seen under $1000, and the certifications to back it up. There are very few smartwatches out there that offer more than the basic IP68 and ATM5 waterproofing certifications and MIL-STD-810H "military-strength" durability — never mind that half the time, the brand doesn&apos;t even mention which actual tests inside 810H they&apos;re even using out of the dozens involved in the ridiculously long specification.</p><p>(If you ever need to put your brain to sleep, I invite you to go read the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=35978">actual specification document</a> for MIL-STD-810H. It&apos;s 1100 pages and covers a truly staggering range of durability tests for everything from sun exposure to nuclear bombs.)</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ZmrwmNhrAgRZHbrvQttR6m" name="Amazfit-T-Rex-Ultra-sports-modes.jpeg" alt="A list of sports modes on the Amazfit T-Rex Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZmrwmNhrAgRZHbrvQttR6m.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1126" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Among the many specifications Amazfit lists, the temperatures are praiseworthy. Normally, we don&apos;t concern ourselves with the temperatures of a smartwatch other than "it&apos;s running so hot it&apos;s scalding my skin." But like outdoor cameras, the operating temperatures of a smartwatch matter once you&apos;re taking it with you on a desert hike or onto a ski course. Many electronics can stop working when it gets too cold outside, and if your watch overheats and shuts off while you&apos;re in the middle of your day hike, you could be in serious danger of not finding your way back before that heat exhaustion graduates to heat stroke and cooks your brain alive.</p><p>Will most of you be hiking in full sun in the July heat in the Sierra Nevadas? No. Will most of you be on the slopes for more than a couple of hours of skiing? No, but if heaven forbid you accidentally find yourself trapped on the mountain, the T-Rex Ultra will last longer to help you track your way back to base camp. </p><p>And with Prime Day bringing it down to the same price as those daintier Samsung watches, now is the time to invest in an ultra-sporty smartwatch that&apos;s as sporty and un-killable as you. </p>

<hr>
<p>Imagine not having to frantically shuffle through your luggage to look for important documents at the airport and simply showing your phone at the counter. Google seems to be working on a handy feature that allows users to scan and store text-based documents in their digital wallets for easy storage and access.</p><p>A recent APK teardown by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1812832421567459666">AssembleDebug</a> showed this feature in action. It looks like it can automatically identify several different types of documents (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-wallet-digital-passes-3443300/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>), such as passports, resident permits, student IDs, and even auto insurance. </p><p>The publication notes that the &apos;Add to Wallet&apos; menu will have a new option called &apos;Everything else.&apos; Through this, users can take a photo of their document in question, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> will automatically scan it and save a digital version onto the app. The app allows you to edit and review your information in case it was wrongly captured. Users can also make changes to their ID number, date of expiration, name, and address. However, before you scan your document, users must agree to a disclaimer.</p><p>The disclaimer reads, "Scan a photo of your pass, and Google will use AI to create a digital version of it in Google Wallet." </p><p>"Google will use the photo of your pass to determine what kind of pass you&apos;re adding and to suggest the content of the pass." </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.43%;"><img id="34wgStkTdHSCHoBBY7oFNN" name="google-wallet-pass.jpg" alt="Google wallet pass" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/34wgStkTdHSCHoBBY7oFNN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3000" height="1633" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once agreed upon, your phone will capture the document and segregate it into two sections: normal and private. Private IDs are locked and need the user&apos;s authentication to be accessed. If the feature doesn&apos;t categorize the document, users can manually choose and fill in relevant information by clicking "add field"—only five additional fields can be added.</p><p>"You&apos;ll have to verify each time you view or use a private pass," the disclaimer states.</p><p>Google also says that the company will not store any information about private passes on its system; it will be stored locally on the device.</p><p>It remains unclear when this feature will be rolled out to all users; however, it seems fully functional on the APK teardown. Android Central has contacted Google about this, but it did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<ul><li>Google's previously spotted Maps UI changes are now rolling out after facing another round of development.</li><li>The update to Maps brings in a "sheet-based" style and also alters how users experience directional information in the search bar.</li><li>Google previously detailed several AI features on the way for Maps while also informing users of a disappearing web feature that'll slide onto Android.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A Google Maps redesign that&apos;s been in the works for the past few months is finally hitting Android devices for the app&apos;s stable version.</p><p>After being popped back into the oven, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/14/google-maps-android-redesign/">9to5Google</a> reports that Google has started rolling out its UI overhaul for Maps on Android. To start, version <strong>11.136.x</strong> changes how users will experience direction searches. It was discovered that the UI now displays your starting location and end destination after asking. Google has also shifted the mode switcher to the bottom of the UI.</p><p>The other side of these changes is a new "sheet-based" UI, which affects the locations we view in the app. Now, when looking up a place, users will see a new, moveable sheet at the bottom of the app. It seems this is designed to give users more agency when seeking written information or when eager to see more of the map itself.</p><p>That new sheet is extendable, which users can do by long-pressing the grayed handle and sliding up their screen. It will hold details like location names, ratings, directions, reviews, photos, and more, similar to the old design.</p><p>The publication notes that users can quickly exit the new expandable sheet in Maps for places by hitting the "X" or swiping the left or right edge on their devices. Additionally, the old "swipe up on the search bar" to hide function has bowed out. The expandable sheet seems to take care of that after reaching a certain height.</p>

<p>The update should start arriving on more Android devices as we push through the week. We&apos;ve noticed the update already internally, so more should see it soon. The post notes that iOS phones have not yet picked it up.</p><p>Google&apos;s work to overhaul the Maps UI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-directions-ui-redesign-rollout">was spotted earlier this year</a> in February. Many of the changes previewed in that test build have made their way onto the stable version of the app.</p><p>The world of maps has been relatively quiet. However, Google teased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-directions-ui-redesign-rollout" target="_blank">that there are Gen AI</a> features that are headed its way. The company detailed some features, such as one that will aid users in finding locations and will also offer pre-made options. The AI will display its results based on category, review summaries, and more.</p><p>Meanwhile, outside of the mobile Maps space, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-gets-rid-of-another-feature-on-web">dropped another feature</a> from its web version. Google Maps Timeline is set to leave web-based users by December 1 and arrive on Android for mobile folks.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung confirmed on its South Korea forum the devices that are set to receive One UI 6.1.1 and several AI-backed upgrades.</li><li>The Galaxy S22, S23, and S24 series devices are eligible, alongside its foldables from the past two years and two generations of tablets.</li><li>One UI 6.1.1 was previously rumored to be the reason behind Samsung's delay of One UI 7, considering its AI updates.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With Samsung&apos;s latest foldables getting to experience One UI 6.1.1, the company is now confirming who else should expect the next iterative update.</p><p>Social media tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1812735763991159025">Tarun Vats</a> posted Samsung&apos;s confirmation of One UI 6.1.1 supported devices on X. The company stated in a post that owners of the Galaxy S22 series, Galaxy 23 series (including the S23 FE), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">the S24 series</a> should expect the update.</p><p>A few of Samsung&apos;s previous foldable devices, like the Galaxy Z Flip 4, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>, Fold 4, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Fold 5</a>, are also eligible. Lastly, the brand&apos;s Tab S8 and Tab S9 series tablets will receive the next One UI 6 update.</p>

Since the Flip 6 and Fold 6 launched with One UI 6.1.1, the post states that new "Generative AI" features like Portrait Studio and Sketch to Image will also come to older devices via a software update.</p><p>Samsung states users will be able to "freely" change the appearance of a photo with different styles such as "comic," 3D character, watercolor, and more. Sketch to Image  lets users draw on a photo while the AI brings it to life.</p><p>We&apos;re still left wondering when Samsung could roll out One UI 6.1.1. However, it was previously rumored that its work <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delay-one-ui-6-1-1-ai" target="_blank">had been delayed on One UI 7</a>. It was stated that the next One UI 6 update packs "many new" AI features, and we&apos;ve seen a few of those listed today (July 15) by Samsung following Unpacked.</p><p>Not only are the aforementioned features expected, but the S24 series is set to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24s-slow-mo-hdr-boost-confirmed">gain an HDR boost</a>, too.</p><p>Moreover, there&apos;s speculation that these confirmed One UI 6.1.1 devices could only involve ones eligible for AI upgrades. It&apos;s unclear if the S21 series and the Flip 3/Fold 3 will pick this up at some point, so we&apos;ll have to wait and see, officially.</p>

<h2 id="choose-your-wireless-charger-carefully-for-the-watch-ultra-xa0-2">Choose your wireless charger carefully for the Watch Ultra </h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> ships with a wireless charging puck in the box, more specifically, the new EP-OL300 fast wireless charger. The charging puck has a magnetic pad that attaches to the bottom of the watch, while the other end is a Type-C port that&apos;ll need to be plugged into a charger or device capable of delivering 10W or more for fast charging to work. </p><p>The Watch Ultra uses the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) wireless charging standard, but unlike the previous generation, it isn&apos;t officially compatible with older chargers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KzmyLJeos9ShaWka8erhqF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-orange-buttons-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KzmyLJeos9ShaWka8erhqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the Galaxy Watch Ultra still uses the same charging tech as previous models, older Samsung watch chargers <em>may</em> work, but the company does not recommend this as the speeds are slower, which could cause excessive heating. We&apos;re sure there will be more first-party and third-party chargers in the future, but for now, it&apos;s best to stick to the one that comes in the box. </p><p>One feature that has been dropped is the ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-and-watch-7-ultra-are-missing-a-killer-feature">charge the Watch Ultra wirelessly</a> on the back of a compatible Samsung phone. The new model no longer supports charging via Wireless PowerShare due to the new layout of the rear sensor and glass design. It&apos;s not a huge loss since this type of charging was limited to about 5W, but it was handy when you absolutely needed a small boost and didn&apos;t have your charger with you. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> still support it, but it won&apos;t work with the Watch Ultra. </p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra has a large 590mAh battery that&apos;s rated to last for 100 hours in Power Saving mode and 48 hours in Exercise Power Saving mode. The Ultra is Samsung&apos;s most expensive watch yet, at $649.99. You can preorder it now, and it will go on sale on July 24. </p>

You could buy a Galaxy Ring and keep using your older Galaxy Watch. Or you could simply upgrade to the Galaxy Watch 7 and save the Rings and Ultras for power users.</p><p>We&apos;ll speak specifically to those with a Galaxy Watch 6 (Classic), Galaxy Watch 5 (Pro), or Galaxy Watch 4 (Classic) and help you decide if you&apos;re wavering on which new Galaxy Watch or Ring to buy!</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-option-1-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-watch-7"><span>Option 1: Upgrade to the Galaxy Watch 7</span></h3>

<p>The value of a new Galaxy Watch depends, as always, on how out-of-date your current watch is. Each new generation adds a few new perks, so the Watch 7&apos;s value is relative.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a> has a two-generation-old Exynos, thicker display bezel, smaller battery capacity, no skin temp sensor, slower charging, and just got its last Wear OS update. If that&apos;s your current watch, I can&apos;t think of a better time to update. Trade in your Watch 4 when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch7/buy/" target="_blank"><strong>preorder the Watch 7 on Samsung.com</strong></a> and it&apos;ll only cost $125, including an extra band.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a> owners have a temperature sensor, proper sapphire glass protection, the current 10W charging speed, and Wear OS 6 promised for next year. Still, it has the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-vs-5">downsides compared to the Watch 6</a> like the smaller displays and older Exynos with less RAM. A Watch 5 trade-in drops the upgrade price to <strong>$100 plus the extra band</strong>.</p><p>Any recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> owners have the toughest call. The Watch 6 and 7 share the same displays, memory, battery capacity, and protection. It has double the storage for those who use their watch for music streaming instead of their phone, a niche concern. Again, the post-trade-in price on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch7/buy/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung.com</strong></a> is <strong>$100</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VBMaZUZdQBNrGEvpfo2xUC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-6-6.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 (left, black) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (right, silver) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VBMaZUZdQBNrGEvpfo2xUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch 6 (left) and Watch 7 (right) aren't all that different. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Your main reasons for upgrading are the Exynos W1000 CPU, the revamped health sensors for more accurate HR data, and the dual-band GPS. Are these enough?</p><p>I did an early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">Galaxy Watch Ulta fitness test</a> against a a heart rate monitor and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> with dual-band GPS, and was very impressed with the revamped accuracy for both. The Galaxy Watch 7 shares the same HR LEDs and GPS antenna, so it should be equally accurate — far better than my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-6-fitness-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 6 fitness test</a> last year.</p><p>Also, I strapped on my heavy Ultra for sleep tracking last night and found that it gave me the same nightly blood oxygen average as my Garmin watch (high-90s percentage) instead of the low-90s or high-80s that my Watch 6 Classic registered.</p><p>As for overall speed, the Galaxy Watch Ultra certainly delivers on speed, zooming through tiles, scrolling smoothly, and opening apps quickly. Samsung claims the Exynos W1000 is "2.7x quicker" at launching apps than the Exynos W930, or up to 3.7x faster for multi-core tasks. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can certainly notice a difference in snappiness and smoothness putting the Watch Ultra and Watch 6 Classic side-by-side, but the older watch isn&apos;t <em>that</em> much slower. The Ultra-Watch 5 gap with less RAM and the Exynos W920 chip is much more significant. If you have the Watch 6, you&apos;ll enjoy the Watch 7&apos;s extra speed, but I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s strictly necessary.</p><p>Overall, you should choose the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7</a> upgrade if you&apos;re (A) using an older watch and need a real upgrade or (B) you&apos;re an impatient techie who truly needs top-tier specs every single year. Why <em>skip</em> the Galaxy Watch 7? If you&apos;re used to your Galaxy Watch 5 Pro&apos;s extra battery life or Watch 6 Classic&apos;s rotating bezel.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-option-2-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-watch-ultra"><span>Option 2: Upgrade to the Galaxy Watch Ultra</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P3s9JuYiQ7FyAuhBm8zyG3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-apps-grid.jpg" alt="Apps on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P3s9JuYiQ7FyAuhBm8zyG3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Ultra</a>, the key differences are its rugged titanium frame, the same 590mAh capacity as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a>, the extra 1,000 nits of brightness, a third button for exercise shortcuts, a built-in siren and LTE antenna, and unique bands.</p><p>Galaxy Watch 5 Pro owners might be the primary target for the Galaxy Watch Ultra. You paid extra for its titanium build and three-day battery life, without needing a physical bezel. Now, you&apos;re jumping ahead two Exynos generations with 33% more RAM, improving from 1,000 to 3,000 nits while removing the thicker display border, and adding properly accurate HR and GPS data.</p><p>Basically, the Galaxy Watch Ultra has become your only way to get a longer-lasting Galaxy Watch in 2024. It&apos;s a pricey proposition, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch-ultra/buy/" target="_blank"><strong>trading in either the Watch 5 Pro or 6 Classic cuts $430 off the preorder price</strong></a> and includes an extra band, making it cost the same as a full-priced Galaxy Watch 7 (<strong>$299</strong>). </p><p>That&apos;s a great deal for Watch 5 Pro owners with two-year-old hardware, who originally <em>paid</em> $450 for it!</p><p>Why avoid a Galaxy Watch Ultra upgrade? Watch 5 Pro owners will have to accept adding an extra 14g/0.5oz of weight; choose the nylon band over the marine band if you&apos;re concerned. Watch 6 Classic owners will find the Ultra weighs about the same but no longer has that physical bezel for seamless controls—and they&apos;re getting fewer relative upgrades. It&apos;ll be an adjustment, but still potentially worth it since you&apos;re getting that same $430 off.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-option-3-buy-a-galaxy-ring-keep-your-current-watch"><span>Option 3: Buy a Galaxy Ring, keep your current watch</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4ctBCNrQJTj22inn3z6ZDL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-wearing-01.jpg" alt="Wearing the gold Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ctBCNrQJTj22inn3z6ZDL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Why buy the Galaxy Ring instead of the Galaxy Watch 7? The Galaxy Ring tracks a few of the same metrics — heart rate, blood oxygen, skin temperature, steps and workout effort via the accelerometer, and sleep stages and quality — but not other health data like AFib, body composition, sleep apnea, and GPS/elevation tracking. Plus, you can&apos;t fit as many LEDs into a petite ring.</p><p>We haven&apos;t determined yet whether the Galaxy Ring matches the Galaxy Watch 7 for accuracy, and can only do so after a thorough review; we were, at least, very impressed by how comfortable and stylish it is during our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring hands-on</a>.</p><p>Choose the Galaxy Ring if you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">hate sleeping with a smartwatch</a> but want nighttime insights into your health. You can wear both the Galaxy Ring and your older Galaxy Watch during the day and have Samsung pick and choose the best data from both devices. Then, at night, you&apos;ll get insights into your body&apos;s health and daily energy that the Watch 7 can&apos;t deliver if it sits on your nightstand.</p><p>This option will require a new way of thinking for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> owners. Owning both a smartwatch and a smart ring is an expensive proposition unless you space out your purchases and make both of them last. So maybe you can buy this smart ring and try to make your current Galaxy Watch last another few years.</p><p>Another option (let&apos;s call it <strong>Option 3.5</strong>) is to buy the Galaxy Watch 7 <em>and</em> Galaxy Ring. The Galaxy Ring has no trade-in option, but assuming you can trade in a Watch 5 or 6 to get your 7, the total price adds up to $499. If you can make both devices last for a few years, you <em>might</em> end up calling it a bargain. </p>

<hr>
<p>Amazon Prime Day is only hours away. While this may be an exciting time to take advantage of the massive deals, several cybercriminals are looking for such opportunities to target your wallet. Like any other cyber scam, these Prime Day scammers aim to steal personal information, card details, or sometimes even money from customers unaware of their intentions.  We dive into the most common ways that people get phished and how you can spot a Prime Day scam without compromising your information.</p>
<h2 id="phishing-attempts-to-watch-out-for-2">Phishing attempts to watch out for</h2>
<p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/amazon-prime-day-2024-cyber-criminals-are-ready-are-you/">data collected</a> by Check Point, there has been a significant increase in cyberattacks related to Amazon Brand. In June alone, 1,200 new domains associated with Amazon cropped up, of which 85% were flagged as malicious or suspected of being malicious.</p><p>"In June 2024, we discovered a widespread phishing campaign mimicking the Amazon brand, particularly targeting the US," Check Point added. </p><p>Scammers can use many methods to reach you, but the most common is disguising themselves as official Amazon websites or accounts. Some of the newly established phishing sites recently spotted by the publication were: </p><p><strong>amazon-onboarding[.]com: </strong>a newly registered fraudulent site, specifically targeting carrier-related credentials.</p><p><strong>amazonmxc[.]shop: </strong>a fake Amazon Mexico website designed as a replica of amazon.com.mx. It looks like the real deal with a login button as well. </p><p><strong>amazonindo[.]com: </strong>Another phishing site that isn&apos;t Amazon that collects users’ login credentials upon clicking the "login" button.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, these phishing attacks end up right in the user&apos;s inbox. They send very convincing emails/text messages with links to massive discounts or deals, luring them to divulge login credentials or, worse, their credit card details. Sometimes, these messages carry a threat, like login details being compromised or the will account shut down if the users don&apos;t act quickly —creating a sense of panic in customers.  </p><p>Clicking on the link might prompt the victim to sign in to a look-alike Amazon site, exposing their credentials to the hacker, or the link may attempt to download malicious software into the device, through which the hacker can get access to all the information on the laptop/phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:452px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.64%;"><img id="hTzL56Szgx2mxLtnv3zeTb" name="Phishing-email-Amazon-Prime-Day.png" alt="Phishing email example" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hTzL56Szgx2mxLtnv3zeTb.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="452" height="482" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Check Point)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, users sometimes get texts from spoofed numbers claiming to be a local post office or Fedex/UPS about an undeliverable package, with a link that tries to get people&apos;s credit card details. These are especially common in the U.S. and Canada around Prime Day Sales.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:627px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:35.09%;"><img id="tJhZkNF3KBUHXoeex6FCv9" name="shipping-scam.png" alt="Shipping-scams" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tJhZkNF3KBUHXoeex6FCv9.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="627" height="220" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sometimes hackers can also call victims claiming to be Amazon customer service representatives offering deals on various products, or again asking shoppers for their personal information, stating that a payment didn&apos;t go through on their recent order or their account has been hacked into. </p><p>Another way that scammers can reach customers is through their social media accounts. They can slide into your DMs promising Prime membership cards or free Amazon gift cards specifically during Prime Days. Some scammers may also share enticing giveaways on their social media accounts  or ads related to Prime Day deals.</p><p>"The scammer&apos;s message may even prompt you to insert your payment information to cover shipping costs for your free item," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.norton.com/blog/online-scams/amazon-scams">Norton&apos;s</a> website stated.</p>

<h2 id="ways-to-spot-prime-day-scams-2">Ways to spot Prime Day scams</h2>
<ul><li>NordVPN's <a href="https://nordvpn.com/blog/amazon-prime-day-scams/">website</a> asks buyers to carefully look through emails and messages for signs for grammatical errors, generic terms like " Dear customer" or a threat/ urgency in the email forcing you to click a link or respond to the message.</li><li>Most phishing emails or links contain gibberish or misspelled URLs that resemble Amazon's customer service IDs. </li><li>Anyone requesting for personal or financial information like passwords, credit card details, or Social Security numbers via email or phone, on the pretext of closing an Amazon account.</li><li>Sales sent via emails or social media accounts, that look too good to be true, with prices slashed to 90%, luring people to purchase from their website. </li></ul>
<h2 id="being-phished-here-apos-s-what-to-do-2">Being phished? Here&apos;s what to do</h2>
<p>In the event that you come across such phishing emails/scams, it&apos;s best to verify the email IDs and look for red flags associated with them, as mentioned above. One way to steer clear of unnecessary hacking is to make sure to purchase from the official Amazon.com website rather than using third-party sites to access deals. </p><p>If someone calls you pretending to be Amazon&apos;s customer service, its best to avoid sharing any information with them over the phone/message and directly contact Amazon customer support through official channels, like the app or the legitimate website. </p><p>Amazon has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4YFYCCNUSENA23B#:~:text=Learn%20to%20identify%2C%20prevent%2C%20and%20report%20scams.&text=If%20you%20received%20suspicious%20communication,at%20reportascam%40amazon.com.">clearly mentioned</a> that it "will never send you an unsolicited message that asks you to provide sensitive personal information like your social insurance number, tax ID, bank account number, credit card information, ID questions like your mother&apos;s maiden name or your password." Customers can also report suspicious emails/calls via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909130" target="_blank">Amazon&apos;s</a> official website. </p><p>Amazon&apos;s biggest sale of the year kicks off on July 16th, and it&apos;s almost time for the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-android-phone-deals-2024">Prime Day deals</a> to hit the site. In 2023, over the course of the two-day shopping event, Prime members purchased more than 375 million items worldwide and saved more than $2.5 billion. </p>
