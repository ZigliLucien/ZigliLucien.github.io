<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> is $100 off at Best Buy right now, marking a great price on what is otherwise considered an expensive watch. The Forerunner 965 is similar to the last-generation 955, though it comes with some major improvements to mapping and the display. It features sleep tracking, heart rate monitoring, and several fitness tools, and its battery can last weeks in the regular smartwatch mode.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a smartwatch with a really good-looking screen; you need something that&apos;s super-precise when using GPS and HRM; you want a smartwatch with a long battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need something that offers AFib detection; you&apos;re looking to spend less on a smartwatch; you want a watch that supports Outdoor Plus.</p><p>The Garmin Forerunner 965 is a top-tier smartwatch, offering battery life times of up to 23 days per charge when used in smartwatch mode. It also comes with 32GB of storage, a bright 1.4-inch AMOLED display, and 5ATM water resistance, boasting sensors for GPS, HRM, and more. You can also use NFC and Garmin Pay with this watch to make purchases.</p><p>A couple of the downsides of Forerunner 965 include the fact that it doesn&apos;t support Garmin&apos;s Outdoor Plus mapping feature, and it also doesn&apos;t include AFib detection.

<hr>
<p>The Pixel Watch 3’s live Nest Cam streaming will soon be available on other Wear OS watches too.</p><p>Google just introduced a new feature for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> that lets you check out live streams from Nest cameras right on your watch. It’s a convenient way to keep an eye on things, even if your phone is not nearby.</p><p>For now, though, this feature is only available on the Pixel Watch 3, but Google plans to roll it out to older Pixel Watches and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS devices</a> soon (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/30/pixel-watch-live-nest-cam/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The company hasn&apos;t given a specific date yet.</p><p>This integration also lets users get instant notifications on their watch, so they can view live camera feeds. They can also take quick actions like starting a two-way chat or sending preset responses.</p><p>Once configured, users can quickly access live video from their doorbells and cameras. Just tap the Camera tile, select your camera, and the live stream starts. Swipe left or right to move the view, and double-tap to zoom in.</p><p>Additionally, there’s a hamburger menu at the bottom of the screen that lets you access "Quick Replies" or start a two-way talk. When you begin a two-way conversation, the camera will chime, alerting the person on the other side that they&apos;re being watched and a chat is about to begin. To end the conversation, just tap the mic icon on your watch.</p><p>Google’s decision to make live Nest Cam streaming available on other Wear OS devices is a smart move. It means the feature will be accessible to a lot more people, not just Pixel Watch users, which should help more folks adopt and use Nest Cam products.</p><p>Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/15294135" target="_blank">support page</a> says the feature only works with Nest cameras or doorbells from 2021 onward that are connected to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> app. Plus, you’ll need <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS</a> 1.4 or higher on your watch for it to work smoothly.</p><p>This decision encourages a more flexible setup, letting users choose devices that work best for them without being stuck with just one platform.</p>

<p>Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> now scans barcodes and QR codes automatically, making it a lot more useful and quicker for getting the info you need.</p><p>The new AI visual lookup feature has added a new capability that lets you scan QR codes and barcodes right through the viewfinder. It’ll even pop up a handy chip that takes you straight to the website, as noted by Mishaal Rahman on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-barcode-scanner-rollout-3476930/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Circle to Search can now automatically scan barcodes and QR codes!This feature was spotted by @AssembleDebug in late June but has now rolled out to myself and several other people. Thanks to Anh on Discord for the tip! pic.twitter.com/bDcpg2qB64<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1829534478622216480">August 30, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Circle to Search basically acts as a smart visual search tool, analyzing what’s on your screen and giving you info based on what you highlight or circle. Meanwhile, if QR codes are visible on your screen, the feature will automatically scan them without you needing to do anything.</p><p>The feature shows handy chips with URLs, making it easy to jump straight to the site you want. Google first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-get-new-circle-to-search-features">unveiled this functionality in July</a>, and it’s now rolling out to more devices, including the Galaxy S23 Ultra we’re using.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:350px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="cwbgNxBv74ZMvra5vbSNvJ" name="Circle-to-search-QR-code-scan.png" alt="Circle to Search QR code scanning" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cwbgNxBv74ZMvra5vbSNvJ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="350" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once a URL pops up, just tap the link you want to visit. This makes it way quicker than manually circling QR codes, saving you a lot of time finding multiple links.</p><p>In Rahman&apos;s demo, he goes to a website with a QR code, and Circle to Search instantly turns it into a clickable URL.</p><p>While it might seem like a small tweak, this update really boosts the user experience. By cutting out an extra step, it makes accessing data quicker and more convenient.</p><p>The feature is now rolling out to users with compatible Google Pixel and Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a>. To try it out, just visit a webpage or open an image with a QR code, then long-press the home button or navigation handle to activate Circle to Search.</p><p>This update fits right in with Google’s push to enhance Circle to Search. A recent addition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/28/circle-to-search-share/" target="_blank">is a handy Share button</a>, making it easy to share selected content with your contacts.</p>

<hr>
<p>Honor pulled a bold move against Samsung by engraving a tiny, sarcastic "apology" on its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-and-magic-vs3-foldables-announced">Magic V3</a>. Though it seems harmless, this cheeky gesture packs a punch, showcasing Honor’s competitive edge with a dash of schadenfreude.</p><p>The mobile industry loves a bit of brand rivalry, and this time, Samsung—known for taking jabs at Apple—finds itself in the hot seat. Just before IFA 2024, the South Korean tech giant has become the target of a cheeky jab.</p><p>Quite unapologetically, Honor is taunting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> owners, claiming that their device is a mere shadow of the upcoming Magic V3, the thinnest and most durable foldable on the market.</p><p>The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> from the Chinese brand measures only 4.35mm when unfolded and 9.2mm when folded. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is 5.6mm thin when unfolded and 12.1mm when folded.</p><p>To drive home the point, Honor enlisted micro-artist Graham Short to engrave a tiny "world&apos;s smallest apology" on the hinge of a special-edition Magic V3.</p><p>Honor says the message engraved on the Magic V3 is so tiny, you need a microscope to read it. It&apos;s no wonder the text is hard to decipher. But here&apos;s the full text:</p><p><em>"Dear Samsung Galaxy Z Fold owners, we’re sorry. We know you were excited to buy a phone that folds in half and fits in your pocket, awkwardly. You were promised the future, a technical marvel, a world of boundless multitasking and performance.</em></p><p><em>"And now, you&apos;re probably looking at the new HONOR Magic V3 and feeling a little... betrayed. Size matters, and we feel your pain. Like being tipped for a gold medal and then coming last in the race, the knowledge that a thinner, lighter, and more durable foldable exists is enough to make anyone question their choices.</em></p><p><em>"We get it. You were an early adopter, a pioneer bravely venturing into the uncharted territory of foldable screens with questionable durability. You deserve better. In fact, you deserve a gold medal.</em></p><p><em>"In all seriousness, we at Honor are committed to pushing the boundaries of technology and bringing you the best possible foldable experience. We&apos;re just saying... it&apos;s okay to feel let down. We&apos;d feel the same way."</em></p>

<p>Honor&apos;s "apology" is a cheeky way to highlight the dilemma faced by Galaxy Z Fold owners who have opted for a bulkier device when the Magic V3 offers a thinner design.</p><p>Don&apos;t get us wrong, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is an incredible phone. It&apos;s a powerful and versatile device that we praised as "master of refinements" in our review.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6&apos;s AI software is also a cut above the rest. While the Magic V3 has its own impressive AI features, we’re skeptical it can match the Z Fold 6’s software prowess.</p><p>While the Honor Magic V3 is launching worldwide on September 5, there&apos;s still no word on whether US customers will get their hands on it.</p>

It&apos;s too late for buyer&apos;s remorse, so the first step is to personalize your Ultra so that it&apos;s as useful and individualized to your needs as possible. </p><p>Having reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and several other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung watches</a>, I&apos;m familiar enough with its One UI Watch spin on Wear OS to point you towards every software feature, new or old, that requires you to dive into settings before you access them. Here are my Galaxy Watch Ultra tips and tricks for getting started! </p><p><em>Note</em>: Whenever I say "Settings" below, I mean the Galaxy Watch Ultra settings found when you swipe down from the main watch face, unless I say otherwise.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4DStjDLKKkTcnbvQaxXvVN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-google-assistant.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4DStjDLKKkTcnbvQaxXvVN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re a fan of Samsung&apos;s apps like Bixby and Samsung Wallet, then skip to the next section. But for everyone who prefers Google&apos;s apps, Samsung lets you switch them in as your default options. But you&apos;ll need to download many of them from the Play Store first, and not all of them can be activated in the same place.</p><p>To switch your default apps, go to <strong>Settings > Apps > Choose default apps</strong>. Here&apos;s where you can make Google Assistant and Google Messages your default options. Then, back in Settings, open <strong>Buttons and Gestures</strong> and, under <strong>Home button</strong>, select <strong>Press and hold</strong> and choose Assistant instead of Bixby.</p><p>Unfortunately, Samsung refuses to let you remap the long-press back button shortcut from Samsung Wallet to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> (or anything else). But in this same menu, you can make the <strong>Double Press</strong> shortcut go to any app, including Google Wallet.</p><p>While you&apos;re in this Settings menu, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-quick-button">change what the Quick Button does</a>; it defaults to Samsung Health workouts, but you can choose the Stopwatch, Flashlight, or Water lock tools instead, or default to a <em>specific</em> workout type. </p><p>Lastly, if you want to use Gboard instead of Samsung Keyboard, download Gboard from the Play Store, then go to <strong>Settings > General > Input > Keyboard list and default > Default keyboard</strong> and choose Gboard.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-turn-on-gestures"><span>Turn on gestures</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="GihReeuppfvmJz5YHiZYdK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-gesture.jpeg" alt="Performing a double tap gesture while wearing the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GihReeuppfvmJz5YHiZYdK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has three gesture controls in the same <strong>Buttons and gestures</strong> menu, all disabled by default. Samsung doesn&apos;t point these out during the initial buttons-and-functions tour, so you might never realize they&apos;re there unless you go looking.</p><p><strong>Double pinch</strong> lets you "answer calls, dismiss alerts, launch apps, control your music, and take photos." <strong>Shake to dismiss</strong> has you rotate your wrist twice to "decline incoming calls or dismiss alerts such as alarms, timers, and reminders." <strong>Knock knock</strong> has you bend your wrist down twice to pull up whichever app you want.</p><p>You can turn each on or off individually, so you&apos;ll have to decide if they&apos;re worthwhile to you. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7 reviewer</a> praised these shortcuts, even while saying they only work about 70% of the time. It makes sense to try them for yourself and see if (A) you have issues with false positives and (B) you find it easier than relying on the buttons. Personally, I love "Knock knock" the most, simply because I love having more shortcuts to my favorite apps instead of having to search in the app drawer.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-emergency-sos-and-fall-detection"><span>Set up Emergency SOS and Fall Detection</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="iZuuQFvr93XmEpcerxjbvL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-sos-emergency-shortcut.jpeg" alt=""Press the Home button 5 times to call an emergency number" reads the text on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZuuQFvr93XmEpcerxjbvL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In an emergency, you can <strong>press and hold the Quick Button</strong> to trigger a loud siren, to help anyone nearby find you. But if you&apos;re somewhere isolated and need to call for help, you can <strong>tap the Home button five times</strong> to call 911 from your watch, as well as send your location and an SOS message to your emergency contacts. And your watch can auto-call 911 if it detects you falling.</p><p>Some of these features need to be set up in advance, however! Open your mobile <strong>Galaxy Wearable </strong>app with the Ultra synced and follow these steps:</p><p>1. Tap <strong>Watch settings > Safety and emergency</strong>.</p><p>2. Under <strong>Medical info</strong>, fill out your <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Medical conditions</strong>, <strong>blood type</strong>, <strong>allergies</strong>, <strong>medications</strong>, <strong>organ donor status</strong>, and other info. </p><p>3. Back in Safety and emergency, tap <strong>Emergency contacts > Add emergency contact</strong> and choose whoever you&apos;d want notified in an emergency from your phone Contacts. Then toggle <strong>Share during emergency calls and texts</strong> to ensure emergency response receives your medical info and emergency contact info.</p><p>4. Next, tap <strong>Emergency SOS</strong>. Change your <strong>Emergency number to call</strong> if necessary (mine said 112 instead of 911) and decide whether you want to toggle <strong>require swipe to call</strong> to prevent accidental 911 calls, or to <strong>Share info with emergency contacts</strong> to simultaneously send your info out as you call 911.</p><p>5. Finally, toggle <strong>Hard fall detection</strong> on. With this function, your watch will detect if you&apos;ve suddenly stopped moving and call 911 if you&apos;re not conscious or able to respond to the on-wrist alert.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-limit-your-notifications"><span>Limit your notifications</span></h2>
<p>I only want certain notifications popping up on my wrist; I can check less important ones later, and when certain apps buzz your wrist constantly, it becomes more aggravating than helpful.</p><p>In the <strong>Galaxy Wearable</strong> mobile app, tap <strong>Watch settings > Notifications > App notifications</strong>. Here, you will see a full list of installed apps and can individually toggle off apps you don&apos;t care to see.</p><p>By default, <strong>Sync Do not disturb with phone</strong> is toggled on, which means you don&apos;t need to worry about getting notifications at night. I also like to go into <strong>Advanced notification settings</strong> and toggle on <strong>Turn on screen</strong>. This means that I don&apos;t need to twist my wrist every time I feel a notification buzz; when I&apos;m working at my desk, I like being able to glance at my wrist without having to move it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update-your-watch-face"><span>Update your watch face</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rAFRsDQwYo8mFyp7ybZNEJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-customize-watch-face.jpeg" alt="Customizing the watch face on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rAFRsDQwYo8mFyp7ybZNEJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cool thing about the Galaxy Watch Ultra is how its 3,000-nit display can squeeze in a ton of readable information and has some new, sporty watch faces by default. That said, you should definitely take the time to update them with more useful info and your personal flair.</p><p>You can edit watch faces on the Ultra directly, but it&apos;s much easier to do so in the <strong>Galaxy Wearable app</strong> under <strong>Watch faces</strong>. There you can choose between all of the default One UI 6 Watch options or go downloading from the Play Store. Unfortunately, because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> uses a new XML <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/watch-face-format-for-future-wear-os-releases">Watch Face Format</a>, it&apos;s incompatible with the popular watch face app Facer.</p><p>Still, you&apos;ll find plenty of customization options in the main Wearable app. With the new Ultra Analog watch face, for instance, you can edit the color, style, hands, night mode look, and all <em>eight</em> complications, so you can see all manner of different data based on what you care about. Simply select each criteria, change what you want, then hit <strong>Save</strong> and it&apos;ll immediately auto-update to the Ultra.</p><p>I like to pre-customize and complicate a few different watch faces all at once. Then, if I&apos;m in the mood for a style change, I can just tap and hold the main screen and then swap to one of my backups while keeping the same data I care about.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-adjust-your-display-and-timeout-settings"><span>Adjust your display and timeout settings</span></h2>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra lasts long enough that I like to use the Always-On Display (AOD) setting, make my screen timeout delay longer, and keep apps open and running in the background in case my watch display turns off by mistake.</p><p>Swipe down from the main watch face and tap the <strong>Settings cog icon</strong>, then select <strong>Display</strong>. Here, you can (and should) enable <strong>Adaptive brightness</strong> for obvious reasons, then decide whether to leave <strong>AOD on or off</strong>.</p><p>In this same menu, I prefer to adjust <strong>Screen timeout</strong> to 1 minute and <strong>Show last app</strong> to Within 2 minutes, just to have the most flexibility. This will drain your battery a little faster but feel like an improvement whenever you do use your Ultra.</p><p>You can also change the <strong>default font</strong> in this menu.

<p>For polar-opposite people more concerned about making the Galaxy Watch Ultra last as long as possible, let&apos;s run through your options.</p><p>First, the obvious one: Swipe down to Quick settings and tap the <strong>Battery with leaf icon</strong> to insta-trigger Power Saver mode. This turns off the Wake up gesture, AOD, and Wi-Fi, and it "limits" CPU performance, background network and location updates, and screen brightness while shortening your screen timeout. </p><p>By default, Power Saver also disables auto-detected workouts, high/low HR alerts, continuous HR / HRV / stress, and nightly skin temp, SpO2, respiration, and sleep score. But Samsung seems to know that you might want to cut the smarts but keep the health data in Power Saver mode; go to <strong>Settings > Battery</strong> and toggle <strong>Limit health features </strong>to <strong>Off</strong> to retain them. It makes Power Saver less efficient but more realistic that you&apos;d want to use it.</p><p>One other battery-saving option is to add more <strong>Sleeping apps</strong>. Essentially, this ensures that certain apps will check for notifications "only occasionally," delaying information. It&apos;s sort of a semi-DND for apps that you can&apos;t turn off entirely but know you don&apos;t get many notifications or don&apos;t care about seeing them immediately.</p>

<p>One of my favorite Wear OS features is to keep my phone unlocked if it detects my smartwatch nearby. Toggling this tool is straightforward, so long as you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>.</p><p>Open your <strong>phone settings</strong>, then <strong>Lock screen and AOD > Extend Unlock</strong>. You&apos;ll be prompted to input your phone <strong>PIN</strong>. Then tap <strong>Trusted devices > Add trusted device</strong> and choose your Galaxy Watch Ultra out of the list of connected Bluetooth devices.</p><p>Keep in mind that Extend Unlock works even if you&apos;re not currently wearing your watch; someone could theoretically pick up your unattended watch as a key to unlock your phone. If you&apos;re worried about that, you can go into the <strong>Modes and Routines</strong> settings and make it so that Extend Unlock only works at a particular location or time, when you&apos;re less likely to take your watch off or leave your phone unattended.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-add-music-files-to-your-watch"><span>Add music files to your watch</span></h2>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra can stream your playlists from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">popular music streaming apps</a> over its built-in LTE connection if you add it to your cellular plan, but that&apos;s also a battery killer, even for a long-lasting watch. A better option is to use the doubled storage space and pre-install your music playlists, podcasts, or audiobooks onto the Ultra. That way, you can leave your phone at home and treat the Ultra like a true standalone device.</p><p>This guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-save-music-files-galaxy-watch">how to add music files to Galaxy Watches</a> runs through the steps in more detail, but to briefly summarize, you open the <strong>Galaxy Wearable app</strong> on your phone, tap <strong>Manage content > Tracks on watch</strong>, and add any playlists, albums, or specific songs you want.</p><p>Otherwise, if you subscribe to a specific music streaming app like Spotify, you can typically download offline playlists directly from each respective app. The same applies to Wear OS apps like Audible (which has you pre-download audiobooks onto the watch) or Wear Casts for podcasts. Then you just need some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> or other wireless earbuds to pair with the Ultra.</p><p>On a somewhat related note, if you prefer to stream through your phone, you may want to go to <strong>Settings > Advanced features > Auto launch media controls</strong>. This makes the controls appear by default after you start a playlist or video, so you don&apos;t need to go hunting for them.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-buy-some-backup-bands"><span>Buy some backup bands</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="En3d2D49Ted9cnWDETPXEF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-band-clasp.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/En3d2D49Ted9cnWDETPXEF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you preordered your Galaxy Watch Ultra, you got a second band to go with whichever you picked. Otherwise, you&apos;re stuck with your single Marine, Trail, or Peakform band, each with its particular perks and downsides. Since Samsung charges a whopping $79 for its official bands and the Ultra uses a proprietary band connector, you&apos;ll have to look for some third-party options if you want to switch things up. </p><p>We have a whole guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-bands">Galaxy Watch Ultra bands</a> you should consider; you&apos;ll either have to go with cheap, generic bands from nonsensically-named brands or pay full price on Samsung&apos;s superior options. Either way, the good thing about the Ultra is that swapping your band takes less than a minute because of how easy it is to pop them out and slide new ones back in. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-turn-on-developer-options"><span>Turn on developer options</span></h2>
<p>If you really want to get the most out of your Galaxy Watch Ultra, try playing with the same settings that the Wear OS developers secretly use. They often have drawbacks that make them unfit for everyday users, but you might still want to try them. </p><p>In <strong>Settings</strong>, scroll all the way down to <strong>About watch</strong>, then tap <strong>Software information</strong> and find the <strong>Software version</strong> field. Then <strong>tap it five times</strong>. A Developer Mode pop-up should flash, so back up to Settings and you&apos;ll see <strong>Developer options</strong> under About watch.</p><p>There are dozens of developer options, too many to discuss here, but I was pleasantly surprised to see <strong>Force full GNSS measurements</strong>. Samsung already gave the Galaxy Watch Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">better tracking accuracy</a>, but this dev mode makes your watch check your location more frequently at the expense of battery life. If you don&apos;t mind the trade-off, this should make your results even more accurate.</p><p>You can also toggle things like <strong>Vibrate on connectivity change</strong> to warn you if you leave or enter a network, or ensure your watch <strong>stays awake while charging</strong> if you like to have it sit on your desk during that time. An especially popular setting, based on what I&apos;ve seen on Reddit, is to <strong>shorten the animation</strong> when switching between apps or menus to <strong>0.5x</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has the same software as past Galaxy Watches, barring a few Wear OS 5 changes. Aside from the new Quick Button shortcuts and gestures, most of the experience will feel quite familiar to you, or to fans of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> in general.</p><p>I didn&apos;t cover some tips like making sure to wear your Ultra to bed to see your Energy Score, or to take an ECG reading and follow the prompts to set up the results in the Samsung Health monitor app — since most Galaxy Watch owners will naturally figure those things out on their own. Hopefully, this Galaxy Watch Ultra beginner&apos;s guide will have shown you things that you might not have noticed on your own!</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra costs more than your typical smartwatch, so make sure you're getting your money's worth by updating all of the above settings straight out of the box. It's a long-lived smartwatch — both for its 60-hour battery life and four years of Wear OS updates — so you'll want to make the most of those perks.</p></p>

The next step would be to go to the governor&apos;s desk to either be signed into law or rejected and sent back for more voting. We should all hope the latter happens because signing this bill into law solves none of AI&apos;s problems and would actually worsen the problems it intends to fix through regulation.</p>

<p>SB 1047 is not completely bad. Things like forcing companies to implement <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-sundar-pichai-argues-ai-regulation">reasonable security protections</a> or a way to shut any remote capability down when a problem arises are great ideas. However, the provisions of corporate liability and vague definitions of harm should stop the bill in its tracks until some changes are made.</p><p>You can do <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-not-the-only-way-to-create-unhinged-ai-photos">terrible things using AI</a>. I&apos;m not denying that, and I think there needs to be some sort of regulatory oversight to monitor its capabilities and the safety guardrails of its use. Companies developing AI should do their best to prevent users from doing anything illegal with it, but with AI at your fingertips <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">on your phone</a>, people will find ways to do it anyway.</p><p>When people inevitably find ways to sidestep those guidelines, those people need to be held responsible not the minds that developed the software. There is no reason laws can&apos;t be created to hold people liable for the things they do and those laws should be enforced with the same gusto that existing laws are.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5443px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UGgG32iy2pmgymUqdtABh8" name="OpenAI-GPT4o-Announcement.jpg" alt="The announcement of GPT-4o." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGgG32iy2pmgymUqdtABh8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5443" height="3061" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I&apos;m trying to politely say is laws like this are dumb. All laws — even the ones you might like — that hold companies creating legal and beneficial goods, physical or digital, responsible for the actions of people who use their services are dumb. That means holding Google or Meta responsible for AI misuse is just as dense as holding Smith & Wesson responsible because of things people do. Laws and regulations should never be about what makes us comfortable. Instead, they should exist to place responsibility where it belongs and make criminals liable for their actions.</p><p>AI can be used to do despicable things like fraud and other financial crimes as well as social crimes like creating fake images of people doing something they never did. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7640807/">It can also do great things</a> like detect cancer, help create life-saving medications, and make our roads safer.</p>
<p>Creating a law that makes AI developers responsible will stifle those innovations, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mozilla.ai/">open-source AI development</a> where there aren&apos;t billions of investment capital flowing like wine. Every new idea or change of existing methods means a team of legal professionals will need to comb through, making sure the companies behind these projects won&apos;t be sued once someone does something bad with it — not <em>if</em> someone does something bad, but <em>when</em>. </p><p>No company is going to move its headquarters out of California or block its products for use in California. They will just have to spend money that could be used to further research and development in other areas, leading to higher consumer costs or less research and product development. Money does not grow on trees even for companies with trillion-dollar market caps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:995px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="pJ9KAxguQALkJzeWfxQmWA" name="mozilla-ai.png" alt="Mozilla AI logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pJ9KAxguQALkJzeWfxQmWA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="995" height="561" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mozilla)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is why almost every company at the leading edge of AI development is against this bill and is urging Governor Newsom to veto it the way it stands now. You would naturally expect to see some profit-driven organizations like Google or Meta speak out against this bill, but the "good guys" in tech, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/08/19/mozilla-eleutherai-and-hugging-face-provide-comments-on-californias-sb-1047/">like Mozilla</a>, are also against it as written.</p>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/un-global-ai-resolution">AI needs regulation</a>. I hate seeing a government step into any industry and create miles of red tape in an attempt to solve problems, but some situations require it. Someone has to try and look out for citizens, even if it has to be a government filled with partisanship and technophobic officials. In his case there simply isn&apos;t a better solution.</p><p>However, there needs to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">a <em>nationwide</em> way</a> to oversee the industry, built with feedback from people who understand the technology and <strong>have no financial interest</strong>. California, Maryland, or Massachusetts making piecemeal regulations only makes the problem worse, not better. AI is not going away, and anything regulated in the U.S. will exist elsewhere and still be widely available for people who want to misuse it. </p><p>Apple is not responsible for criminal activity committed using a MacBook. Stanley is not responsible for assault committed with a hammer. Google, Meta, or OpenAI is not responsible for how people misuse their AI products.</p>

The company is discontinuing the line in favor of the fenix line and the new Garmin fenix 8, which now features both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">MIP</a> and AMOLED models. The updated design features "leakproof metal buttons" and a 40-meter dive rating for those of you who like to explore ocean depths.</p><p>As far as software, users can take advantage of access to the on-device Garmin Messages app and smart commands for AI assistants. Athletes should also enjoy the new "Advanced Strength Training" with dedicated plans for various sports like surfing, skiing, trail runners, and more.</p><p>You can get up to 48 days of battery life with the fenix 8 Solar, but the fenix 8 AMOLED still manages an impressive 29 days.</p>

<p>The Enduro 3 can last up to 90 days on a single charge and has a durable design with a titanium bezel and sapphire lens covering the 1.4-inch MIP display. Like the fenix 8, you get preloaded topographic maps and advance strength training features. It&apos;s also capablt of ECG readings for AFib detection.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1228493/pn/010-02903-00">fenix 8 retails for $999</a> while the Enduro 3 can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/851039">purchased for $899</a>.</p>

What&apos;s interesting is that the phone can be put into various forms for specific use cases, such as watching media, multitasking, live translation, and more.</p><p>When folded, the phone measures only 11mm thick, which is thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.

The video shows that while there are some improvements, Google also made some questionable choices with how the device is assembled.</p><p>When carefully removing the screen, the display became quite damaged, which was surprising. Fortunately, thanks to the dual-entry design, the screen doesn&apos;t need to be removed if you need to replace the battery, which is a plus. However, things start looking grim again when it actually comes to removing the battery, which proved more difficult than it should be.</p><p>You can take a look at the full video above, but Android Central senior editor Jerry Hildenbrand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-ifixit-teardown-gives-me-doubts">can&apos;t imagine this phone lasting seven years</a> given how difficult it is to repair.</p>

It also notes that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> won&apos;t always get it right and that the company will continue to improve the experience.</p><p>This will be available first to Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users.</p><p>In addition to image generation, Google is now rolling out Gems, which are custom versions of Gemini that businesses and enterprise users can take advantage of for specific purposes. Users will be able to describe what they want their Gem to do to create a personalized experience. The company lists examples such as a gym buddy, sous chef, coding partner, or creative writing guide.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When leaks highlighted that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series would get a new app called Pixel Screenshots, I didn&apos;t pay much attention. I thought it was just a location to save all screenshots, but I was wrong; while Pixel Screenshots manages to store all your screenshots, it does so much more: it uses Google&apos;s Gemini Nano on-device AI engine to parse through the information in the screenshot, and make it easily accessible.</p><p>I tend to take screenshots of billing details and other order-related information, but that&apos;s unorganized, and I have to manually search screenshots to usually locate the details I need. That&apos;s where Pixel Screenshots makes a difference; the app automatically creates a title and summary of the content included in the screenshot, so if there&apos;s a reminder or an upcoming event, you can easily add it to your calendar.</p><p>In just over a week of using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, Pixel Screenshots has already made a difference. I get a lot of briefing invites, and the ability to just take a screenshot and add the event to my calendar is nifty. Another cool utility in Pixel Screenshots is the ability to organize content; you can set up custom lists for various things like deals, order-related information, and so on.</p><p>The biggest advantage of the app is that it allows you to search saved screenshots, so if you need details on a package or want the order number of something you bought a few months ago, you can just ask a search query similar to Google Search and it will pull up that information.</p><p>Honestly, Pixel Screenshots has been a revelation, and it makes saving key information — and accessing it later on — a breeze.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-the-pixel-screenshots-app-2">How to get the Pixel Screenshots app</h2>
<p>The Pixel Screenshots app is limited to the Pixel 9 series, so that means you&apos;ll need to pick up one of the four devices in the lineup to be able to access it. As it uses a new multimodal version of Gemini Nano, it isn&apos;t available on Google&apos;s older phones, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and 8 Pro.</p><p>Because of that reason, it&apos;s unlikely to make its way to other devices. You can download the APK and install it on a non-Pixel device, but it will not download the Gemini Nano model as other devices don&apos;t have the requisite hardware.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-pixel-screenshots-2">How to use Pixel Screenshots</h2>
<p>Using Pixel Screenshots is easy; just pull up the Screenshots app from the app drawer, and you&apos;ll see all your saved screenshots. You can just tap on any screenshot to see the auto-generated summary detailing the information contained within; if there&apos;s any actionable content — like an event — you&apos;ll get a button to add the details to your calendar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.12%;"><img id="zboZq5FetrcsP3jN8hDSvE" name="pixel-gemini-nano-1.jpg" alt="Pixel Screenshots on the Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zboZq5FetrcsP3jN8hDSvE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4092" height="2992" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best part of the app is its ability to search screenshots; you can query using the search bar at the bottom, and it will pull up any information that matches the search. It is straightforward to use, and does a good job surfacing order-related details and so on.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-organize-screenshots-in-pixel-screenshots-2">How to organize screenshots in Pixel Screenshots</h2>
<p>Pixel Screenshots lets you organize screenshots into various categories, so if you&apos;re setting up gift ideas, want to store all billing and order details in one location, you can do so easily.</p>
<p>1. In the Collections sub-menu within Pixel Screenshots, select the Plus icon.<br>
2. Enter the name of the category.<br>
3. You can now add all relevant screenshots to this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.39%;"><img id="tutgygzFax8oKGctFApYWZ" name="pixel-gemini-ai-3.jpeg" alt="Pixel Screenshots on the Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tutgygzFax8oKGctFApYWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1270" height="932" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="how-to-set-reminders-in-pixel-screenshots-2">How to set reminders in Pixel Screenshots</h2>
<p>I normally use Any.do to set up reminders, but Pixel Screenshots is highly effective in this regard. If I need to set a reminder for an actionable email, I just take a screenshot, and set a reminder within Screenshots. It&apos;s easy to set up:</p>
<p>1. Pull up the screenshot where you want to create a reminder.<br>
2. Select the Belli icon. <br>
3. You&apos;ll see four choices: Later today sets a reminder an hour from now, Tomorrow sets it 24 hours later, Next week sets a reminder at the same time next week, and you get an option to choose the date and time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:78.90%;"><img id="bhjBRguHUfFRFhyWymdYfZ" name="pixel-gemini-ai-2.jpeg" alt="Pixel Screenshots on the Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bhjBRguHUfFRFhyWymdYfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1270" height="1002" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>4. Once you select the date and time, hit Save to save the reminder.<br>
5. You&apos;ll see the reminder details next to the Bell icon.<br>
6. You can also see all upcoming reminders in the main window.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:78.27%;"><img id="jDUssy6G5tq83XMroGRgMZ" name="pixel-gemini-ai-4.jpeg" alt="Pixel Screenshots on the Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jDUssy6G5tq83XMroGRgMZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1270" height="994" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<hr>
<p>Google is leveraging its Gemini Nano engine to catalog and organize the details included in screenshots, and the best part is that it is all done on-device — no data is sent to the cloud. The fact that all of this is done on-device is pretty cool, and Pixel Screenshots is another utility that differentiates Pixels.</p>

<ul><li>Apple Music and YouTube Music both now support the transfer of music playlists.</li><li>On the corresponding support page, both companies shared the process of transferring playlists.</li><li>Currently, the transfer is supported across these music streaming services only.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Apple Music and Google&apos;s YouTube Music have partnered to offer their users a hassle-free experience, including the ability to transfer saved playlists across music streaming platforms.</p><p>Previously, transferring playlists from one streaming platform to another wasn&apos;t that convenient, as it involved third-party apps like Soundiiz and Tune My Music. Such apps also required a fee to transfer songs/ playlists without any restrictions. It might soon change with the newly announced ability for Apple Music and YouTube Music users (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer/">MacRumors</a>).</p>
<p>Users who wish to transfer their playlists from Apple Music to YouTube Music or vice versa can now do so, as both streaming giants have shared the respective step-by-step process through their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120030">support pages</a>. Apple account holders can head to their Data and Privacy page and request to "Transfer a copy of your data." Users can then select Apple Music playlists to be transferred to YouTube Music. </p><p>Likewise, YouTube Music users will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/14792019">able to transfer</a> their playlists through the Google Takeout feature. They can similarly follow the onscreen instructions to transfer playlists from YouTube Music to Apple Music. While the process appears hassle-free, there are a few things to keep in mind before transferring.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="EdH3ZAKYo5zNEs8LxVMKHg" name="oneplus-buds-pro-2-apple-music.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 2 next to Pixel 7 Pro playing Apple Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EdH3ZAKYo5zNEs8LxVMKHg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To make playlist transfer more swift, users must have an active subscription to the aforementioned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming platforms</a>. While playlists are transferred quickly, they won&apos;t be deleted once the transfer is done. Also, transfers are only possible between Apple Music and YouTube Music, not even Spotify. Users would still have to rely on the above-mentioned third-party services for any music transfer.</p><p>The latest transferring feature doesn&apos;t support other songs in the library except from the playlists. It is also dependent on song availability across both platforms, meaning that when a song from a playlist isn&apos;t available on the other platform that is being shared, users can still be out of luck.</p><p>While it is an exciting start to see transferring music to an extent between Apple Music and YouTube Music, it will be more beneficial if other major players in the music streaming industry also collaborate with each other to bring users a unified experience and easy switching between streaming platforms.</p>
