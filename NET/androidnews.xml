<p>After teaming up with NBCUniversal for the Olympic Games in Paris, Google is bringing its AI smarts to the 2024 Olympics, introducing fresh ways for fans to connect with the action.</p><p>Google recently partnered with Team USA as the "Official Search AI Partner," which is a huge deal. The tech giant is using its AI to highlight Team USA athletes and boost NBCUniversal&apos;s coverage of the Olympic Games, which start on July 26.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/paris-olympic-games-google-features/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Marvin Chow, Google&apos;s VP of Marketing, announced new features on Search, Gemini, YouTube, and other platforms that are built to immerse you in the action regardless of your location.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps">Google Maps</a> and Waze are stepping up to help everyone get around Paris during the event. Both platforms will provide real-time updates on traffic restrictions and road closures. Waze will even alert you about road disruptions, so you can share the information and plan your trip easily.</p><p>Additionally, Maps&apos; new transit features make travel easy. You&apos;ll be able to compare buses, trains, and subways, as well as see real-time disruptions, get fare estimates, and track your journey. Plus, you can find Olympic shuttle information all in one place.</p><p>On Google Search, you can check real-time schedules, results, medal counts, highlights, and daily recaps for your favorite country, sport, athlete, or the whole Games. It also features top news and social media buzz. Search adjusts schedules to your time zone and shows content relevant to your location.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is reportedly ramping up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> production as early market signals show the smart ring is surpassing expectations.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4920" target="_blank">The Elec</a>, Samsung originally planned to produce 400,000 Galaxy Rings. However, due to unexpected demand, it has increased that number by 600,000 units.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s July Unpacked event was a big deal, packed with game-changing innovations. Among other devices launched during the show, the Galaxy Ring stole the limelight, catching everyone&apos;s eye since its debut. Even though it was teased earlier this year, Samsung kept the specs and launch date a secret until the much-awaited July reveal.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring blew past all expectations, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-cant-ship-the-galaxy-ring-fast-enough-shows-how-theyre-an-in-thing">selling out in the preorder phase</a>. It&apos;s clear that demand for Samsung&apos;s new wearable technology is way higher than initially thought.</p><p>Now, industry insiders say Samsung has told suppliers to boost Galaxy Ring production by 150% due to huge consumer interest. If true, the South Korean tech giant could ship over a million units by year-end, as per The Elec.</p><p>Meanwhile, Finnish wearable company Oura <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220405006108/en/On-the-Heels-of-1-Million-Rings-Sold-Oura-Now-Valued-at-2.55-Billion" target="_blank">surpassed 2.5 million units for its smart ring in 2022</a>. While impressive, it took the company seven years to reach its first million.</p><p>Oura pioneered the smart ring category nearly a decade ago, keeping it a niche market. But with Samsung now entering the scene, this technology could go mainstream.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring stands out from other smart rings by offering no subscription fees, a battery life of up to a week, and personalized recommendations and insights powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>.</p><p>Priced at $399, the smart ring is now available in the U.S. But with stock running low and delivery dates pushing into late August, buyers should act fast to secure their size.</p><p>Despite Samsung&apos;s push to speed up production and meet the high demand for the Galaxy Ring, consumers might still face stock shortages in the short term as the company tries to restock.</p>

<p>Samsung released the Galaxy Watch 7 on July 24, 2024 in two sizes: a $300 40mm model that comes in Cream (white gold) and Green (somewhere between Hunter Green and Moss Green) and a $330 44mm model available in Green and Silver. LTE models of the Galaxy Watch 7 are available for $350 (40mm) and $380 (44mm).</p><p>All sizes come with the Sport band that matches the color of the watch&apos;s housing, with a small blue accent on the left side and orange on the right. The 40mm comes with a S/M by default and the 44mm comes with a M/L by default, but if you buy the watch through Samsung, you have the option to customize it to a different band size/color.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 uses the exact same 1.3 and 1.5-inch 2,000-nit touchscreens as the Galaxy Watch 6, and it&apos;s just as bright, crisp, and perfectly easy to read in direct sunlight. After three years of wearing 40mm Galaxy Watches, the 44mm&apos;s screen has been a welcome little upgrade. It won&apos;t display more elements, but they become much easier to glance at, even the thin complications on a watch face, and the $30 upgrade to 44mm seems much more justifiable if it fits your wrist. </p><p>Sadly, my wrist is smaller than the lug-to-lug span of the 44mm Watch 7, so I needed watch bands that could immediately bend back to keep the watch securely in place on my arm. This made me unable to test the sculpted-at-the-lugs Sport band of the watch fully, but it&apos;s grippy without being sticky, and the notches help the band avoid slipping around your sweaty wrist in this miserable summer heat. </p>

<p>The blue-orange accents pop without being tacky, though I wish they were different colors for each colorway — and that the Watch 7&apos;s home button had a different rim color. The orange stands out better against the Watch 7&apos;s colorways compared to the red seen on previous watches, but orange doesn&apos;t go with everything as well as Samsung thinks. </p><p>Outside the new band styles, the only exterior difference to the Galaxy Watch 7 is the new BIA health sensor array. The dome of the array curves higher, making the watch sit higher on lanky wrists like mine, but for thicker wrists, you shouldn&apos;t notice much of a difference. We&apos;ll get into the improvements of the new sensors in a bit, but I do very much like the look of the dome and the new HR sensors. Not that you&apos;ll be looking at the bottom of your watch all that often, but the eight dots white feel cleaner than the grey, partially-clipped ring on previous generations.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/first-one-ui-6-watch-beta-hits-us-galaxy-watches">One UI 6 Watch</a>, the version of Wear OS running here on the Galaxy Watch 7, will be coming to the Galaxy Watch 6, 5, and 4 series, but it gets to show off on the 7 first before rolling out everywhere else in the coming months. Most of the changes Wear OS 5 is bringing are under-the-hood, require updates from app developers, or both, but the most important feature on the Watch 7 isn&apos;t exclusive to the new OS; it&apos;s the expansion and surfacing of the Accessibility-based gesture controls with double-pinch and knock-knock shortcuts.</p><p>Double-pinch gestures are built into many apps and system tools, allowing you to quickly silence timers, turn off alarms, play/pause music, pause/restart workouts, and dismiss notifications. When two watch functions that can use double-pinch are open at the same time, it pops up a window to choose which one you wanted, but that takes away the point of doing it one-handed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6upDrr4Qwzx77v3JaPGHBa" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-pinch-gesture-popup.jpg" alt="A pop-up menu on the Galaxy Watch 7 when double pinch has two available commands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6upDrr4Qwzx77v3JaPGHBa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The knock-on shortcut hasn&apos;t gotten the play that the "zOMG, they copied the Apple Watch" pinch gestures, and it can admittedly do fewer things. It&apos;s just a shortcut, be it to your favorite app, workout style, or the flashlight. Yeah, I forget these watches have a flashlight, too, half the time, but boy, howdy does it come in handy. Granted, you have to twist your wrist up like some Power Ranger or Ben 10 wannabe to have it shine in front of you rather than to the side or straight up, but it&apos;s a hands-free flashlight without any verbal commands. The screen has to already be on, but that&apos;s what tilt-to-wake is for.</p><p>It&apos;s been great when it works, but admittedly it misses my pinches and knocks about 30% of the time. Whether that&apos;s a failure in the detection software, an issue stemming from how bony and thin my wrist is, or user error remains to be seen, but at most, I can suffer 3-5 seconds of pinching at midair like a shadow puppeteer to shut my watch up while I&apos;m carrying something or typing away like a madwoman.</p><p>Samsung proclaimed the Exynos W1000 as almost 3x faster than the Galaxy Watch 6, but I&apos;m not seeing it. Don&apos;t get me wrong, this is the zippiest smartwatch I&apos;ve ever used, but it&apos;s not magnitudes faster, at least during everyday activities. That extra speed likely comes in handy more during offline GPS-tracked workouts and other intensive workout styles, but in the day-to-day, it&apos;s faster, but not noticeably.  </p>

<p>A new generation of Galaxy Watch means new watch faces, and Samsung&apos;s new Ultra Info Board watch face allows us a peek into the future of Wear OS 5&apos;s Flavors. Flavors allow developers to make presets within their watch faces with different styles and even different preset complications. Among the various flavors of the Ultra Info Board, we have swimming, hiking, and running alongside the overall health version. I&apos;m hoping Samsung will allow us to save personally edited Flavors among the presets one day, but it&apos;s a useful little expansion with huge implications for watch face developers. </p><p>The other two new watch faces are… okay? Simple Digital is a little too simple, in my opinion, and while Spatial Number is definitely distinctive, it feels awkward to have a balloon-ish numeral for the hour, analog hands for hours and minutes, and then a background gradient sweeper for seconds. Pick a lane, Samsung.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="TWnsNiFHb4PY4SbwxWeqEa" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-heart-rate-range.jpg" alt="Daily rate rate ranges on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TWnsNiFHb4PY4SbwxWeqEa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The highlight of the Watch 7&apos;s hardware upgrades its new health sensor array, multiplying the LEDs that track heart rate and blood oxygen to help improve tracking accuracy during high-intensity workouts. The readings feel more responsive than previous generations, but I&apos;ve had fewer workouts so far than previous watches because the same day my Watch 7 arrived, COVID symptoms began to flood my sinuses and suck out my energy like a cartoon vampire.</p><p>The beauty of being exhausted from the moment you wake up is you get to really work out the sleep tracking and the new Galaxy AI-powered Energy score. The sleep coaching has been very hands-off this time around, but the tracking itself has been quite good. Blood oxygen readings have way fewer holes in them than on my Watch 6, and both the temperature and heart rate charts are less prone to sudden dropouts or spikes. </p><p>Sleep tracking on the Watch 7 includes your average respiratory rate, even if you don&apos;t have the fancy sleep apnea testing running from Samsung Health Monitor. Yes, the sleep apnea tracking is exclusive to Samsung Galaxy phones, just like the electrocardiogram ECG readings have been since the Galaxy Watch 4 days. Yes, I&apos;m still mad about it; if you pay $300 for a watch that advertises sleep apnea tracking or irregular heartbeat detection, you shouldn&apos;t have to spend another $300-$1300 on a Galaxy phone to actually use it. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FSdbTrCtsN3pbtwBXo2Zhc" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-medications.jpg" alt="Medication reminders on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FSdbTrCtsN3pbtwBXo2Zhc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although it&apos;s not specific to the watch, I&apos;m grateful for Samsung&apos;s Medications minder. You can scan the bottles to put each type in the list rather than having to type out the name — though most of my prescription meds were easy enough to find via autocomplete — set reminders for meds at certain times of day, and even look at possible drug interactions you might not have known about. </p><p>Look forward to more in this space as I finish my COVID recovery and fully put the workout tracking — and the new dual-band GPS — of the Watch 7 through its paces. So far, though, it and Samsung Health work quite well without always throwing themselves in my face like some other watches do. And Samsung remains one of the only smart watches that doesn&apos;t eventually need a fitness subscription.</p>

<p>Battery life varies widely on a smartwatch — especially once you take it outside or undertake any lengthy workouts — so here were my testing factors. This is my first 44mm Galaxy Watch — my 4, 5, and 6 were all 40mm to better fit my small wrist — and I switched off between two watch faces: the new Ultra Info Board watch face with a static background) and Photos with animated gif backgrounds. Google Assistant was turned on but hotword detection was not enabled.</p><p>While the performance upgrade of the Exynos W1000 seemed negligible, its improved efficiency helps the batter shine despite being the same size as its predecessor. With AOD (always-on display) disabled, continuous HR tracking, and overnight sleep tracking, the Galaxy Watch 7 lasted two days on my wrist before needing a charger on days I did not work out. On outdoor-heavy days and when I could manage a light workout, the battery life dropped to 33-36 hours.</p><p>Overall, battery life is a bit better, but the charging experience suffers from the Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s only design change. The new heart rate sensor and curvature of the health sensor array push the charging coils just a few millimeters further away when it sits on a flat charging pad — namely, a Galaxy S smartphone with reverse wireless charging like the Galaxy S24 Ultra — breaking the best backup charger a smartwatch could ask for. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3802px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ZQgQLnZaJLZph7TTjf2yRe" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-health-sensor-curvature.jpg" alt="The new health sensor curvature on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZQgQLnZaJLZph7TTjf2yRe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3802" height="2139" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Small dome, big charging implications </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung calls it Wireless PowerShare; you&apos;d turn it on, set your phone down face-down, and set your Galaxy Watch on top of it face-up. Provided your watch band wasn&apos;t too inflexibly curved, the watch could then recharge itself off your phone&apos;s battery, giving you enough juice to last a few more hours until you get home. This is no longer an option, meaning that if you lose or break your charger, you&apos;ll have to go buy another charging puck. This isn&apos;t the end of the world by any means, but it&apos;s a small bummer worth mentioning for the forgetful folks out there who might&apos;ve relied on this feature.</p><p>Also, if you have a cutesy little stand that your current Galaxy Watch charger is settled into, it might not quite sit properly with the Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s charger and its deeper profile. (Farewell, sweet TPU camera stand; I&apos;ll miss you.) I have confirmed that the Watch 7 will charge on the Watch 6 charger, though, so at least you can keep your old one if you upgrade.</p><p>Although, if you own a Galaxy Watch 6, there&apos;s no real reason to do that.</p>

<p>The biggest obstacle for Samsung&apos;s newest watch isn&apos;t the hardware or the software: it&apos;s the utter lack of reason to upgrade to it. If you&apos;re still rocking a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a>, then yes, your time has come — assuming your battery even held out this long — but even the jump from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a> to 7 seems superfluous unless you&apos;ve had poor results with the ECG or heart rate sensor on it. Even then, the ECG readings are only marginally improved, at least for my fingers and heart or just have to have a 2,000 nit screen instead of a 2,000 mAh one. </p><p>As for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>, the only real change is the heart rate sensor, and that sensor array is a double-edged sword: it improves heart rate tracking, especially during workouts, but it also makes the watch thicker, sitting slightly higher on your wrist. Wear OS 5 should be arriving on the Galaxy Watch 6 in weeks, so just sit tight, save your money, and maybe buy a new watch band instead to make it feel new.</p><p>There&apos;s also the $200 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-vs-galaxy-watch-fe">Galaxy Watch FE</a> if you&apos;re looking for almost the same features for two-thirds of the price. However, you&apos;ll still be stuck with the older processor and chunkier bezels on the screen. </p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 at $300/$330 and this high build quality and software consistency help it easily hold its own against most current Wear OS watches on the market. Granted, the Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> still looks slightly prettier with the recessed bands and the rounded design, but those bands are proprietary, it&apos;s more expensive, and after six months, you&apos;ll need to pay for Fitbit Premium for a number of the fitness metrics. </p><p>I&apos;ll need time to fully test the workout and GPS tracking with the Watch 7 before claiming it a Garmin-killer, but Samsung&apos;s more focused on smarts while Garmin&apos;s 100% focused on fitness, so that decision is going to come down to how well you can live without Samsung or Google&apos;s apps and services on your watch.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Galaxy Watch 7 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You are new to smartwatches and want the most consistent experience without being forced into a subscription.</li><li>You've had issues with past Galaxy Watches not tracking you properly and are ready to give it another try.</li><li>You're already invested in Google and/or Samsung's ecosystem and want a watch that integrates with them.</li><li>You want a smartwatch that doesn't require a subscription.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Galaxy Watch 7 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You already own a Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 or 6.</li><li>You absolutely, positively have to have all the bells and whistles of the latest model. (If you do, you'll want to go look at the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>.)</li><li>You prefer a more flashy or weighty watch on your wrist.</li></ul>
<p>Samsung&apos;s insistence on Galaxy AI&apos;s greatness and trendy features hides the core tracking and performance boost given by Wear OS 5, a new processor, and the upgraded health sensors. And I&apos;m okay with Samsung focusing on the tangible here, especially when the proof of these upgrades is not having lag or tracking inaccuracies. After all, if Samsung&apos;s done its job right, you&apos;ll think Samsung hasn&apos;t done anything at all and that the Galaxy Watch has always been this smooth and stable.</p><p>When this mix of flashy and understated adds up to a snappy smartwatch with a bright screen, the decked-out feature toolbox of One UI 6 Watch, and almost 2 days of battery life, it&apos;s easy to recommend the Galaxy Watch 7 to new smartwatch buyers and older ones looking to get back in the game. We may not have the fancy new watch band system or overhauled design that the Galaxy Watch Ultra does, but it&apos;s half the price and half the weight. (And it still uses standard 20mm bands, so you&apos;re not stuck with expensive, proprietary watch bands.)</p><p>I&apos;d heavily suggest trading in an old smartwatch to knock the price for however long Samsung is offering "any smartwatch, any condition" $100 trade-in, which makes this a $200 watch and a no-brainer upgrade for anyone who can dig that old LG Watch or Pebble out of your junk drawer. But even if you have to buy at list price, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 earns its keep better than any other sub-$500 watch on the Android stage. </p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 may not look any different, but it's got the upgrades where they count, solving sensor wonk of years past and tightening up an already smooth system. The expansion of gesture controls helps this watch feel like something new after two years of minor updates and like it truly deserves its throne atop the Android smartwatch mountain.</p></p>

<p>OnePlus has confirmed that it will deliver four guaranteed Android OS updates and six years of security updates to the Nord 4. As the device launched with Android 14, it will be eligible to be upgraded to Android 18 once it becomes available in 2028. Additionally, with six years of software updates, the phone will receive security patches until 2030 — making it the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phone</a> currently available in this regard.</p>
<h2 id="the-nord-4-will-get-more-software-updates-than-any-other-oneplus-phone-2">The Nord 4 will get more software updates than any other OnePlus phone</h2>
<p>OnePlus is switching up its strategy with the Nord 4, with the device getting six years of security updates. That&apos;s longer than the five-year guarantee of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, and it&apos;s interesting that the manufacturer is announcing the change on a mid-range phone instead of a flagship.</p><p>What this means is that the Nord 4 will get software updates until July 2030, and that&apos;s incredible. It allows OnePlus to go up squarely against the likes of the Galaxy A55 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> in this segment, and while Google&apos;s mid-ranger is still in the lead as it will get seven Android updates, this is a terrific starting point.</p><p>My only quibble with OnePlus is that the company doesn&apos;t roll out updates on time; sure, platform updates for flagships show up within a few months, but Nord devices haven&apos;t gotten the same level of attention in the past, and that needs to change. Thankfully, that might be the case with the Nord 4, and I will update this post with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> availability as and when the next version rolls out to the device.</p><p>Otherwise, the software situation on the Nord 4 is identical to that of the OnePlus 12 — both phones have the same UI and feature-set. It is just as fluidic in daily use, and while it doesn&apos;t quite handle demanding games as well, it comes close.</p><p>Overall, the fact that OnePlus will deliver four guaranteed Android updates alongside six years of security patches gives the Nord 4 a distinct edge over most phones in the mid-range segment.</p>

<ul><li>Meta AI is starting to roll out a new feature that plays off a user's selfie called "Imagine Me."</li><li>The feature requires three selfies of a user (from various angles) to then recreate them as a gladiator, on the moon, or as a flying space ranger.</li><li>Meta teased in a blog post that an "Edit with AI" button is on the way to bring users more creative agency.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta has a fun feature on the way for its array of platforms that&apos;ll transform users into new versions of themselves thanks to AI.</p><p>Meta AI continues to advance and the company&apos;s CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9xxBFYyF2X/?igsh=bGt0aG13MDF4YjJz">took to Instagram</a> to show off "Imagine Me." When messaging Meta AI on the platform, users can turn themselves into whatever they want by starting their prompt with "Imagine me" followed by a gladiator, football player, or whatever.</p><p>The short video shows that users can initiate an "Imagine Me" session but the AI will prompt them to take a few selfies. Users need to take three: one straight on, one from the right, and one from the left.</p><p>After, they can re-ask the AI to imagine them as a fictional or non-fictional person and see what it returns.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/meta-ai-is-now-multilingual-more-creative-and-smarter/">a blog post</a>, Meta explained that users will have some creative agency when asking the AI to imagine them as a DJ. The company states that if something isn&apos;t right after delivering a prompt, users can type "change" followed by the object or items they&apos;d like to be different.</p><p>Meta states that "next month," users will gain an "Edit with AI" button when texting with its software. The post doesn&apos;t explain what all the edit section will entail, but hopefully, filters, cropping, and more will be involved.</p>

<p>Users eager to get their hands on "Imagine Me" can begin doing so this week as Meta starts rolling it out. The company adds that folks can create an image of themselves directly in their feed, stories, comments, and Messages found on Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Messenger.</p><p>It was first discovered that WhatsApp would be receiving this feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-could-soon-let-users-create-ai-images-of-themselves">earlier this month</a>, with the ability to pull up the feature in other chats. The app&apos;s code highlighted the user&apos;s ability to type "@Meta imagine me" in another chat with a fellow user to show yourself off walking on the moon thanks to AI. What&apos;s more, it seems that more companies are getting in on the idea of reimagination <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/another-ai-packed-feature-could-be-on-the-way-for-youtube-shorts">such as YouTube</a>.</p><p>It seems Google is experimenting with an AI feature for YouTube Shorts that would let users simulate an AI-based green screen behind them while recording. "Dream Screen" would enable creators to make it seem like they&apos;re on top of a mountain or in the depths of the most beautiful ocean.</p>

<p>The wait is over: Samsung&apos;s newest lineup of foldable phones has landed and I&apos;ve done the work of gathering all of the best Galaxy Z Fold 6 deals so you don&apos;t have to. Whether you&apos;re looking for a trade-in opportunity, straight discount, or you simply have a question about the innovative foldable, everything you need to know about buying the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 can be found in this guide.</p><p>As described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">our recently-published initial review</a>, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 boasts the power of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, two gorgeous 120Hz displays, and one of the best folding hinges ever built into a smartphone. The problem is that the phone also starts at a whopping $1,899.99 for the 256GB version, which is why the following deals are so important. </p><p>A lot of these offers are holdovers from the Z Fold 6&apos;s preorder period, so we don&apos;t know how long they&apos;re going to last. In other words, don&apos;t wait too long if a deal catches your eye or you might end up paying full price on a super price-y smartphone. </p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="what-are-the-specs-of-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-2">What are the specs of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6?</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a refinement of nearly everything that made its predecessor such a groundbreaking device. The foldable phone is thinner, lighter, and, well, more foldable than the Z Fold 5, thanks to its newly-designed "dual rail" hinge structure. You also get a performance boost thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor (the same chipset that powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review#section-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-price-and-availability">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>), a brighter display, and seven years of OS updates straight out of the box. </p>
<h2 id="how-much-does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-cost-2">How much does the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 cost?</h2>
<p>The biggest issue that we have with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is its price. With a starting price of $1,899.99, the upcoming foldable is $100 more expensive than the already-very-expensive Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5, and you&apos;re not even getting new camera technology or improved battery life out of the deal. So considering the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs the Z Fold 5, is the new phone worth the upgrade? </p><p>That&apos;s ultimately your call, but hopefully the preorder deals above can soften any financial blow if you decide to buy.</p>

<hr>
<p>The supposed design for the upcoming Pixel Buds Pro 2 has leaked, which teases slight changes for the buds.</p><p>It seems phone accessory/case maker Spigen jumped the gun as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixelbuds/comments/1eaz8zt/pixel_buds_pro_2_design_leak/">a user on Reddit</a> discovered an ad for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/24/pixel-buds-pro-2-leaks/">9to5Google</a>). The Amazon ad a brief look at the Buds themselves, which appear to be slightly bigger than the O.G. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Buds Pro</a>. The device keeps its smooth surface for user touch controls, however, that top portion looks taller while the buds seem closer together in the case.</p><p>Another slight change is with the grills that the Pro edition features. Both instances of it are now colored the same as the Buds instead of retaining a black hue like before.</p><p>The slightly taller Buds make one wonder if there&apos;s a hardware reason behind it, like audio/battery upgrades.</p><p>The early glimpse gives us a look at a curious addition to the bottom of the Buds Pro 2 case — a new cutout. This appears quite important as Spigen&apos;s ad highlights "cutouts for easy pairing and sharing." The publication theorizes it could be a small speaker for users trying to relocate the device using Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">Find My Device network</a>.</p><p>For now, its purpose remains unclear. The case doesn&apos;t appear radically different from the previous generation as it still sports an egg-like shape in all white.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely, more information is surfacing regarding Google&apos;s next earbuds following its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-summer-vibe-colors-leak">recent color leak</a>. The Buds in Spigen&apos;s ad feature a "Raspberry" hue, which was rumored alongside Porcelain, Haze, and a summer-vibe Mojito. There&apos;s a chance that some of these color choices are done to match the Pixel 9 series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-leaks-in-pink-hands-on-video">which we&apos;ve also seen</a> previously.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Buds Pro 2 was reportedly spotted snagging its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-charging-case-spotted">battery certification</a> for the case. The listing showcased the case&apos;s 650mAh battery, which is a 30mAh increase over what the original iteration offers. But luckily we&apos;re not too far from knowing all the details as Google is preparing for an earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">hardware event</a> on August 13.</p>

Well, it&apos;s not <em>really</em> dead, but it seems that way, and it&apos;s not going to change in the next few years.</p><p>There are important changes in the bits inside things like our phones. Things you probably can&apos;t see or when you hear about them you&apos;ll respond with a shrug if anything. Powerful co-processors and dedicated NPUs just aren&apos;t very sexy to regular folks like us who buy this stuff. </p>
<p>Fancy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tsmc-qualcomm-2nm-chip">new chips from Qualcomm</a> or Apple and faster memory are important though, because they power the big changes we can see; new features and improvements to all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">software that powers our favorite tech toys</a> will be the thing that makes us want to buy them.</p><p>This isn&apos;t anything new. Software changes have long been a big selling point when some executive stands on a stage to tell you why their product is the best. What&apos;s going to change is the pace and scale of these changes, while the devices that provide them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">seem to be unchanged</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VBMaZUZdQBNrGEvpfo2xUC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-6-6.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 (left, black) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (right, silver) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VBMaZUZdQBNrGEvpfo2xUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A lot of folks aren&apos;t going to be happy about this. Expect to see headlines from the tech press saying that the next device from Apple, Samsung, or Google will be just like the last device—especially when some of the software changes will work their way back to the older models.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean a lot, though. The <em><strong>only</strong></em> reason to buy an older model of something like a phone or watch is to save money (it&apos;s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-refurbished-phones">a really good reason</a>). The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> is a big improvement over the Galaxy Watch 6 (for example) in every measurable way, even if it looks mostly the same on the outside. These improvements will show themselves when it comes to those software features designed to make them something we want to buy because they will work better. A lot better.</p>
<p>You already know why. It&apos;s that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">stupid little thing called AI</a> that companies want to cram into everything because they feel like it will make us want gadgets even more than we do now. Even the most mundane things, like your phone&apos;s home screen wallpaper, have AI forcibly injected into them. </p><p>This sort of thing needs better hardware to grow, but it&apos;s not hardware that seems like a showcase feature. Look at the latest processors from Apple or Qualcomm to see what I&apos;m saying. Yes, they are XX% faster and will supposedly get XX% better battery life because those are improvements we see every year, even when a chip isn&apos;t great.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1921px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.12%;"><img id="KmtCxVcApo2b3pcUbqRnKX" name="Google-IO-2023-pixel-emoji-wallpaper.jpg" alt="Emoji wallpaper at Google IO 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KmtCxVcApo2b3pcUbqRnKX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1921" height="1078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The big changes, and what makes these new components important, are the ways they can handle the copious amount of AI processing the devices using them will require. Everything from phones to smart doorbells are now miniature factories of AI software. All of them need better hardware under the hood, working in ways nobody cares about.</p><p>We should probably be excited about all of this. It&apos;s easy to get burnt out by "AI Everywhere" when all the tech companies are using it in all the things. But this will lead to that next big thing when it comes to the features we want. It simply needs a smart team to dream them up and develop them.</p>
<p>This will last for a few years, and then we&apos;ll go back to seeing phones that seem all new and different each year. Until then, expect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-and-pixel-9-pro-xl-leaked-hands-on-video">Pixel 9</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ios-16-features-android">iPhone 16</a> to be a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15</a> on the outside unless you count a different-shaped camera bump or a new color. Give them a few months, though, and we&apos;ll see where the real changes are and why we should (or shouldn&apos;t) want to buy them.</p>

<ul><li>According to The Verge, Google may be looking to partner with EssilorLuxottica to make Gemini-powered smart glasses.</li><li>However, EssilorLuxottica is already the maker of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses, and that's unlikely to change.</li><li>Meta and EssilorLuxottica have found success with their smart glasses, and Meta is reportedly considering an investment in EssilorLuxottica. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>EssilorLuxottica is the eyeglass retailer that you might not know is behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses</a>. To make these spectacles, Meta brought the tech smarts and EssilorLuxottica brought the experience — the company has been making eyewear under some name or another since 1849. Following the overwhelming success of the Meta Ray-Bans, Meta is reportedly interested in continuing its relationship with the eyeglass company, but Google might have something to say about that. </p><p>According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24202244/google-meta-ray-ban-essilorluxottica-partnership" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, Google reached out to EssilorLuxottica about making a new pair of smart glasses with Gemini, its AI assistant. It&apos;s unclear what a partnership between Google and the eyeglass maker might look like; however, The Verge&apos;s sources say it&apos;s “extremely unlikely” that Meta would be dropped in the process. That said, it&apos;s unsurprising that Google is starting to make real preparations for another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-all-different-types-smart-glasses-and-ones-are-best">smart glasses</a> product.</p><p>Of course, Google is known for infamously making Google Glass ahead of its time. More recently, the company has publicly made moves toward returning to the augmented reality space. For example, it briefly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">showed off a prototype version of AR smart glasses</a> with Gemini capabilities at Google I/O earlier this year. It also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">demoed Project Starline and Project Astra</a>, both of which make use of augmented reality and AI to provide new experiences.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JUMGmoxyTpwcMxKj3qkVb5" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wearing-blue-touch-pad.jpg" alt="Using the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses touch pad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JUMGmoxyTpwcMxKj3qkVb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I tried out Project Astra in a demo at Google I/O, and its easy to see how this kind of technology could integrate with a pair of smart glasses. Project Astra is a multimodal AI modal that can process visual input, voice input, and text. While most large language models (LLMs) only have the information stored in their data sets and training materials, multimodal models are more versatile. A model like Project Astra could tap into an LLM, multimodal input for context, and web results for up-to-date information, for example. </p><p>Currently, Project Astra seems to be in its early stages. Google released a pretty convincing pre-recorded video showing its capabilities ahead of its developer conference, but it didn&apos;t back that up in live demos. There also isn&apos;t an official release date for when Project Astra might release. Meanwhile, OpenAI is getting closer to fully debuting its multimodal GPT-4o model with voice. Meta updated its Ray-Ban smart glasses to support multimodal inputs, too. </p><p>A partnership between Google and EssilorLuxottica could result in a smart glasses product with Gemini, which has already started to take over in Android, replacing the Google Assistant in many areas. The version of Gemini that would ship with smart glasses would likely feature many of the experimental functionalities Google has shown off under the Project Astra name. </p><p>However, it seems likely that either Google or Meta would want some level of exclusivity with EssilorLuxottica. The two companies will be strong competitors when and if Google releases a pair of smart glasses. You could argue that they are already competing in the key areas of artificial intelligence, virtual/augmented reality, and social networking. While there is an obvious benefit for EssilorLuxottica to partner with as many companies as makes sense, I&apos;m not sure Meta or Google will go for it. </p>
<h2 id="why-the-meta-and-essilorluxottica-partnership-just-makes-sense-2">Why the Meta and EssilorLuxottica partnership just makes sense</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gfsiwsT4LqFHiCZyWgtB2Y" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Smart-Glasses-on-rocks.jpeg" alt="A side view of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gfsiwsT4LqFHiCZyWgtB2Y.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s reported interest in teaming up with EssilorLuxottica seems like a long shot if, for no other reason, its current partnership with Meta just makes sense. Meta was the first to pull off mainstream smart glasses, and they&apos;re in physical retail stores nationwide. Prior attempts from Google and from other companies — like Snapchat and Amazon — haven&apos;t been nearly as successful. </p><p>There&apos;s also another factor to consider. EssilorLuxottica&apos;s brands have real value, and the company can&apos;t waste its brand power and integrity on a half-baked project from Google. We already know that Google has a propensity to kill off projects before even giving them room to grow, and that creates a risky situation for a traditional retailer like EssilorLuxottica. Ray-Ban, for example, is a valuable brand with instantly-recognizable designs. Partnering with Google for a lesser product could cause more harm to that brand than good. </p><p>Finally, Meta isn&apos;t going to lose that partnership easily. In fact, the company is proactively looking to make a sizable investment in EssilorLuxottica. According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/4da37b6a-b241-4090-9445-467087694ab7" target="_blank">Financial Times</a>, Meta wants to buy 5% of the eyeglass maker in exchange for billions. Meta owning a stake in the company, even a small one, would go a long way in ensuring that their partnership will continue. Unlike the rumored Google talks, the Meta/EssilorLuxottica deal is said to be advanced and likely to be finalized. </p><p>It shouldn&apos;t be surprising that Google is opening up a line of communication with EssilorLuxottica. The company has a recognizable brand and more than a century of experience making eyewear. However, I think Meta and EssilorLuxottica are deeply intertwined at this point, and a new deal would be high risk and low reward for the European eyeglass conglomerate. Google might have to turn elsewhere if it wants to mass-produce a new pair of smart glasses.</p>
