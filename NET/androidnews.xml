<ul><li>As we await the Galaxy S25 series launch, new details of the Galaxy S25 FE emerge.</li><li>A new report indicates Samsung might bring the Fan Edition phone in a slimmer form factor.</li><li>The company might opt for a thinner battery while maintaining the same screen size as the predecessor Galaxy S24 FE.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is probably prepping for the launch of the Galaxy S25 series as we just entered the fourth quarter of this year. While the Fan Edition isn’t technically part of the flagship series, a new report reveals some interesting information about the Galaxy S25 FE, including its name change and other specs.</p><p>The report comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=30535">The Elec</a> (via tipster Abhishek Yadav on X) about the upcoming Galaxy S25 FE handset. It is believed to be slimmer this time and should tentatively be called Galaxy S25 Slim.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung's Galaxy S25 FE will reportedly launch as Galaxy S25 Slim, powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 9400 chipset and sporting a 6.7-inch dynamic AMOLED display, to rival Apple's iPhone 17 Slim, says The Elec (Korean publication).#Samsung #GalaxyAI #GalaxyS25Slim<a href="https://twitter.com/yabhishekhd/status/1845477499532370400">October 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The publication has revealed Samsung is trying to make the handset thinner by choosing a thinner battery with a larger surface area to bring the next Fan Edition phone in a slimmer form factor. While the device would still carry a 6.7-inch display like the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>, we should see a slimmer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phone</a> overall.</p><p>According to the tipster Yadav, the upcoming Galaxy S25 FE/ Slim would use a MediaTek chipset instead of Qualcomm or Samsung&apos;s own Exynos, which would certainly be an interesting choice from the Korean tech giant. The chipset, in this case, is likely the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400</a> SoC. The device is also likely to be paired up against the rumored iPhone 17 Slim from Apple.</p>
<p>While these details certainly appear interesting, we recommend considering them with a pinch of salt. The launch is probably several months away, and that too in 2025.</p><p>The Elec further notes that the Galaxy S25 FE or Slim is still in the product development phase while Samsung is gearing up for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series launch early next year. Interestingly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">some of the renders</a> of the upcoming flagship series have already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-alleged-rendering">surfaced online</a>, revealing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vanilla-galaxy-s25-model-alleged-render-leak">its design</a> and some of the specs through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultra-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4-hits-benchmark">leaked benchmark tests</a>.</p><p>Alongside the Fan Editon phone, the outlet has shared the Galaxy S25 series phones&apos; screen sizes. The regular Galaxy S25 has a 6.2-inch screen, followed by a 6.7-inch screen for the Plus model and a massive 6.9-inch screen for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. These screen sizes are, however, a tad bit larger than the existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> models.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is experimenting with a Quick View feature in Google Search in a limited test.</li><li>Users searching for online recipes can use Quick View to see ingredient lists, instructions, and more without clicking a webpage.</li><li>The experimental feature makes it easier to parse digital recipes, but makes it harder to find the original source of the content.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Search is excellent at making its highlighted results to your query so insightful that there&apos;s little need to click through to the original source it came from. The company uses things like Featured Snippets, AI Overviews, and more to pull content from webpages that are shown front-and-center in search results. Now, it&apos;s exploring using a feature called Quick View to show you a full recipe without needing to open the webpage. </p><p>The test was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-quick-view-button-on-recipes-38222.html" target="_blank">Search Engine Roundtable</a>, which documented how Quick View works. When you search for a recipe with Google, you&apos;ll see a collection of links in the results — that&apos;s normal and to be expected. What&apos;s new is that select recipes and sites will have a new "Quick View" icon overlayed on the thumbnail. If you click this button, a streamlined overlay appears with everything you need to complete the recipe, from ingredients to step-by-step instructions.</p><p>For those that have used a reader view before, the experimental Quick View feature works in a similar way. The idea is simple — provide a simple view for parsing recipes that can be increasingly hard to navigate on sites filled with ads and other distracting  elements. Of course, the benefit for Google is that Quick View keeps you on its search results page, rather than directs you to another site. </p><p>"We’re always experimenting with different ways to connect our users with high-quality and helpful information. We have partnered with a limited number of creators to begin to explore new recipe experiences on Search that are both helpful for users and drive value to the web ecosystem," a Google spokesperson told Android Central in an email. "We don’t have anything to announce right now.” </p><p>The spokesperson added that this is a limited, early-stage experiment. Additionally, the participating sites with recipes appearing in Quick View results reached agreements with Google to showcase their content. Though Google did not explicitly confirm that publishers are being paid for their recipes appearing in Quick View, it would stand to reason that these agreements include some form of compensation. </p><p>Google tests out new features in Search all the time, and being that this is a limited test, there&apos;s no way to know whether Quick View will become widely available in the future. It&apos;s easy to see how Quick View benefits Google and its users — Google gets to keep users on its search results pages, while users get to view streamlined recipes. However, to make this idea work at scale, the company would have to get recipe publishers to buy in. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Dde9kawJmSmbnq6JNLffYC" name="Google-AI-overview.jpg" alt=""Google will do the Googling for you" with Google AI Overview" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dde9kawJmSmbnq6JNLffYC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google, and search engines at large, initially served as a way to direct users to the webpage they were looking for. Advertisements and sponsored results are mixed in to drive revenue back to the search engine provider. However, in recent years, Google has tried the limit the need for users to navigate to the original source of content on the web. Through Featured Snippets and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overview-save-feature-expansion">AI Overviews</a>, it hopes to answer your question before you need to quick through to a third-party site.</p><p>The company even went as far to say that it wants Google to "do the Googling for you" at its developer conference this year. Part of that involves the use of AI Overviews, which extract the key points of one or more articles that aim to answer your search query. However, AI Overviews and Feature Snippets work best with a specific question. For things like recipes, there needs to be another solution. That could, one day, become Quick View.</p><p>A natural concern for publishers is how they will be fairly compensated for the content they create that appears in Quick View. If there&apos;s no reason for a user to click through to the original webpage, there&apos;s no way for a site to earn advertising revenue. While it appears Google is compensating publishers at the moment, it&apos;s unclear if that will be the case forever. Another valid concern is that if publishers become dependent on Google, they&apos;ll lose bargaining power when creating future deals. </p><p>We&apos;ll have to see how it all plays out. For now, Quick View looks like a good idea, and participating publishers have reached an agreement with Google for their recipes to be included. </p>

While there are plenty of changes to be found across the board, there is still a lot to be concerned about Google&apos;s plans for its future foldable phones. </p><p>That being said, Google marched forward, seemingly committed to offering an alternative option to Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Fold line. Considering that the options in North America are already slim, I&apos;m happy to see the 9 Pro Fold hit the market, even if it looked exactly like the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. </p><p>Thankfully, that&apos;s not the case here, as Google went back to the drawing board, and not just for the design. There are a bunch of new software features that you&apos;ll only find on Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, all aiming to provide the best Pixel experience that money can buy.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold was announced at the Made by Google event on August 13, 2024, alongside the rest of the Pixel 9 lineup, Pixel Buds Pro 2, and Pixel Watch 3. There are only two configurations available, as the 9 Pro Fold comes with either 256GB or 512GB of storage. These arrive with a price of $1,799 or $1,919, respectively. </p><p>Regardless of which storage option to choose from, everything else about the device remains the same. This includes featuring 16GB of RAM across both configurations. Additionally, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes in two colors, as you can get Google&apos;s latest foldable in Obsidian or Porcelain.</p>

<p>Going into the year, I wasn&apos;t exactly sure whether Google even had plans to release a successor to the Pixel Fold. Part of it was because of how divisive the company&apos;s first foldable phone was. On the one hand, it was great to see Google take this new form factor more seriously. On the other, it almost felt like the Pixel Fold was already out of style.</p><p>Google seems to be laser-focused on creating the thinnest* foldable. Really, it&apos;s just that Google wants something that can help it stand out from the crowd here in North America. Even with reports claiming that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is falling short of expectations, it&apos;s still Samsung&apos;s world that we&apos;re living in. </p><p>Now that I&apos;ve spent some time with the Pro Fold, I&apos;ve really come to appreciate its premium design. Unlike last year&apos;s model, Google&apos;s latest foldable does not look or feel cheap.</p><p>The only problem that I&apos;ve had is that it&apos;s just a bit too slippery to use comfortably without a case. It&apos;s not so much that I don&apos;t think the 9 Pro Fold would be able to withstand a drop or two. Instead, I&apos;m more worried about mucking up this beautiful device. Most of the time, the phone is housed in the excellent Thinborne case, but I&apos;ve found myself just taking it out of the case just to admire the way it looks and feels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4Pcpty7fGkKAHMEjU7xpE" name="google-pixel-9-pro-with-pixel-9-pro-fold-1.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro next to Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Pcpty7fGkKAHMEjU7xpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cover screen is small and wide enough to rely on it more than I anticipated. It&apos;s a "problem" that I had with the original Pixel Fold, along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, as I just don&apos;t find myself unfolding it as frequently as I did with the Fold 6. </p><p>In reality, it&apos;s not <em>actually</em> a problem; it&apos;s just something that I find funny. The best way I can think of to explain this is that the Fold 6 entices you to open it whenever you want to do something more than turn on some lights or respond to a text. at the same time, the 9 Pro Fold aims to provide a traditional phone experience with the added bonus of offering a larger screen if you want it.</p><p>Speaking to that larger screen, I really just don&apos;t find myself using it all that often, unless I want to play a game or need to do some split-screen multitasking. Well, there is one other reason, but I&apos;ll get to that in a bit. </p><p>That&apos;s not to say that the inner screen is bad, as that couldn&apos;t be further from the truth. You won&apos;t find headlines about the 9 Pro Fold not being able to fold flat or that the crease feels like you&apos;re running your finger across a canyon. It&apos;s just about as perfect as it can get, at least compared to other foldable phones that I&apos;ve used and tested.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, Google&apos;s Tensor series of chips would be able to rival Qualcomm, but we&apos;re simply not there yet. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> in the Pixel 9 lineup doesn&apos;t offer a lot in the way of overly meaningful improvements compared to the G3. Instead, Google opted for the "safe" approach of optimizing it for better battery life and for Gemini. </p><p>Sure, I wish this weren&apos;t the case and that Google was able to really take the battle to Samsung and Qualcomm. But, seeing as this is the hand we&apos;ve been dealt, there&apos;s really not much I&apos;ve found to complain about. Day-to-day tasks are a breeze, battery life lasts all day, and I can play most of the games I want to. </p>

<p>The only exception to this, that I&apos;ve found so far, is that I haven&apos;t been able to use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">Switch emulator</a>. However, part of this is likely due to the drivers not being compatible with the emulators I&apos;m using. </p><p>It could also just be the emulators themselves, as I haven&apos;t run into any other problems when using the 9 Pro Fold as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">portable retro handheld</a>. Still, it&apos;s rather curious seeing as every other Android phone and handheld I have is able to at least boot into a game, whereas I can&apos;t even make it that far with the 9 Pro Fold. </p><p>Besides that, I haven&apos;t run into very many issues in my time with the phone. The problems that I have dealt with have more to do with apps not working properly. With that, I put the onus and blame on app developers who continue to act as though foldable phones don&apos;t exist. I&apos;m looking at you, Discord and 1Password.</p>

<p>One gripe that I do have is that I <em>really</em> wish there was a way to put a third app on the screen. There have been more than a few times that I had two apps open and wanted to open a third, only to remember that it wasn&apos;t possible. The most common scenario has been wanting to have the three different fantasy football apps that I use open at the same time.</p><p>A more frustrating occurrence is when I&apos;m using two apps and need to fill in a password. Sometimes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-password-managers-android">1Password</a> works as intended, offering to auto-fill the password for me. But there are times when this isn&apos;t the case, so I need to switch over, go back to the split screen, paste the password, and then go back to copy my 2FA code before switching back again to paste that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BPAY9T9qMoxUh4BjGcnUMk" name="split-screen-apps-on-pixel-9-pro-fold.jpg" alt="Split-screen multitasking on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BPAY9T9qMoxUh4BjGcnUMk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For a type of device that is meant to be more efficient, that&apos;s definitely not always the case. Of course, this is probably a niche problem, but it&apos;s something that&apos;s really annoyed me about the two-apps-only approach.</p><p>My other gripe is with the Pixel Launcher, but this probably won&apos;t come as much of a surprise to some. I want more customization options within the launcher, starting with the icon grid size on the Home Screen.</p><p>I understand the cohesion that Google is trying to achieve between the inner and outer screens. The problem is that I want the ability to have more options than just 4x4, 4x5, or 5x5. It looks fine, most of the time, but if you lower the text size and screen zoom, everything just looks rather comical.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Can we please have more home screen customization options?</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In a perfect world, this could be solved by a third-party launcher, like Nova or Lawnchair, but that just isn&apos;t the case. Yes, I know all about Niagara Launcher and it&apos;s pretty darn wonderful, but that changes things to a completely different interface.</p><p>As it currently stands, I highly doubt that any of those potential changes would be implemented anytime soon. So while it&apos;s definitely possible to multitask on the 9 Pro Fold, there are limitations that might slow you down a bit.</p>

<p>Attempting to use AI is a funny and fickle thing. Sometimes, everything <em>just works</em>, and it feels like we&apos;re actually living in the future. Only to come crashing back down to Earth the next time they try to do something. This is something that is very obvious when using practically any of the various AI services. </p><p>However, it&apos;s a little bit different when AI is one of the key selling points as to why you should buy a phone. Google&apos;s throwing Gemini into anything and everything it can, and it&apos;s been infused across the entire Pixel 9 lineup, including the 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>There&apos;s essentially no difference between using it on the $999 Pixel 9 Pro or the $1,800 Pixel 9 Pro Fold. At least when it comes to the capabilities and limitations of what Gemini has to offer. </p><p>Something I recently realized is that it feels like there&apos;s an untapped potential just below the surface. This is especially true of Gemini, as it&apos;s just a long-press of the Power Button away. Between hallucinations or just misinformation, it&apos;s becoming tough to really rely on it, even though <em>I know </em>it can be better.</p><p>This point was further proven to me on a recent trip to meet up with some friends who were in town for a couple of days. We were trying to decide where to eat, so I figured this was a good time to give Gemini a pretty easy task. Instead of just searching for restaurants around me, I took a picture of a restaurant and asked Gemini what was on the menu. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1170px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:103.59%;"><img id="bFvPE3vMwXWoQyz9GNeWPb" name="google-gemini-image-prompt-majestic-grille.jpg" alt="Google Gemini Image Prompt restaurant menu request" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bFvPE3vMwXWoQyz9GNeWPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1170" height="1212" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It reeled off everything from appetizers to entrees and desserts, without skipping a beat. Cool, I thought, this is perfect! Then I reached the bottom of the entry, only to realize that this wasn&apos;t the restaurant we were standing in front of at all. Not only that, but it was also for a restaurant halfway across the country. </p><p>I told Gemini that it wasn&apos;t the right restaurant and that the right one was in Alexandria. It responded with the address of the correct restaurant, asking for confirmation before providing me with "their popular dishes." </p>

<p>Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m happy that Gemini managed to eventually provide me with the answer I originally asked for. I just don&apos;t understand how it came up with results from a restaurant that&apos;s almost 13 hours away. Maybe the picture that I used was too simple, or the restaurants have similar signage. </p><p>But if Gemini is analyzing an image, does that not include the metadata? That alone should have provided Gemini with all of the information I needed. It wasn&apos;t a screenshot or a picture I downloaded from the web, it was one that I took with my phone, standing in Alexandria, nowhere near Memphis. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1628px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Cgn7BnUprZMPsLPXESQ8Ri" name="majestic-grille-alexandria-to-memphis-maps.jpg" alt="Google Maps route to go to original restaurant Gemini presented" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cgn7BnUprZMPsLPXESQ8Ri.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1628" height="916" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Sorry Google, but this is the wrong restaurant </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This has pretty much summed up what my experience with Gemini has been like in my time with the trio of Pixel 9 Pro models. It will work, but even with underlying guardrails in place, it still needs guidance. So essentially, Google wants us to pay for the "luxury" of being beta testers. </p><p>Personally, it doesn&apos;t bother me all that much. I&apos;m a technology enthusiast and rather enjoy seeing how something progresses over time. That&apos;s not the case for everyone, and no matter how wonderful those commercials make Gemini look, it could end up being a detriment to Google in the long run. </p><p>And frankly, even that idea being a possibility just sucks. Google has finally caught up to Apple and Samsung in terms of hardware and the rest of the software experience. I just hope that Gemini doesn&apos;t push the company into going the wrong way. </p>

When attempting to do so, a message promptly appears, informing me that it isn&apos;t able to process the request.

<p>As I pointed out in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review" target="_blank">Pixel 9 Pro review</a>, I originally had higher hopes that the Tensor G4 would be able to go toe-to-toe with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. Unfortunately, this isn&apos;t the case when it comes to performance. However, there were some pretty massive improvements made in the efficiency department, which was another area where the 2023 Pixel lineup fell short.</p><p>While the 9 Pro Fold doesn&apos;t offer the same mind-bending battery life as its non-folding siblings, it&apos;s still quite a bit better than I expected. In order to back up my words with some numbers, I put the Pro Fold through the same video playback test that I used with the 9 Pro XL.</p>

<p>After changing all of the pertinent settings, I pulled up a 4K HDR video, and let it play on a loop for a few hours. Making sure to measure the battery life every hour.</p><p>The only difference between this test and the one from the 9 Pro XL was that the video was playing on the inner screen. I figured this would result in the battery draining faster, and that&apos;s exactly what happened. Not only that, but the phone was just a bit warm when I stopped the test for good. It wasn&apos;t hot to the touch, but even with a case on, I could feel a bit of heat coming through.</p>

<p>All-in-all, I&apos;d say this is about what I would expect, especially when playing a 4K HDR video on a non-stop loop for four hours. However, this is more of an "extreme" use case, as I rarely would need to find a charger before the end of the day.</p><p>Speaking of which, this brings me to talk about actually charging the Pro Fold. Shortly after receiving the phone, I also received the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinborne-Compatible-Aramid-Magnetic-Minimalist/dp/B0D86M1X4D/" target="_blank">Aramid Fiber Thin Case</a> from Thinborne. This has become a favorite of mine, as it adds MagSafe capabilities to various Android phones while we wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-will-stifle-innovation" target="_blank">Qi2 standard</a> to be adopted.</p><p>One benefit is being able to enjoy the MagSafe charger that sits on my nightstand, removing the need to actually plug in my phone overnight. However, after being alerted to a potential issue by Thinborne, I came to the realization that the Pro Fold wasn&apos;t actually being charged.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pUzmDQ5w4SXsb8AywoheAm" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-on-pixel-stand-v2.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold on Pixel Stand V2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pUzmDQ5w4SXsb8AywoheAm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As it turns out, this is because Google moved the placement of the charging coil, something that wasn&apos;t discovered until after the official Google Support page went live. However, Thinborne was quick to recognize and rectify the situation, shipping me a case with proper alignment so that I could use MagSafe chargers with the 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>Unfortunately, those hoping to continue using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-stand-2nd-gen-charger-review">Pixel Stand V2</a> are a bit out of luck. The coils in Google&apos;s charging stand are just too high to be used with the 9 Pro Fold. There is a workaround, but it means that you&apos;ll need to find something to place between the lip of the stand and the bottom of your phone.</p><p>Your better bet would be to grab a couple of wireless chargers from Amazon, returning the ones that don&apos;t work.</p>

<p>The photo on the left looks quite a bit more vivid, capturing the sun peaking through the trees, casting shadows on the trail. The other looks about as muted of a photo as you could get, with no life to the image and just looking rather bleh. It&apos;s not like I was taking a picture of anything specifically other than my surroundings, but it seems like a common trend.</p><p>There are also plenty of times when the Pixel 9 Pro Fold&apos;s camera shines and makes me happy to use it. One reason, specifically, is thanks to the "Made You Look" feature. As pointed out to me by Android Central&apos;s managing editor Derrek Lee, phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a> already offer something similar.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this feature is particularly important to a parent of an eight-month-old who&apos;s even more easily distracted than his father. With Made You Look, I&apos;m able to get him to pay attention long enough so that I can actually take a good picture.</p><p>This last part isn&apos;t specific to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, but is for foldables in general — they&apos;re amazing. It&apos;s incredibly convenient to be able to not only take <em>good</em> pictures of the sky at night but also do so without needing to worry about tripods or propping the phone up.</p>

<p>The biggest competition for Google is still the Galaxy Z Fold 6. That might be a different story if the OnePlus Open were available from carriers, but alas, it&apos;s not. Samsung still owns the foldable space in North America, and for good reason. Not only is the software experience refined, but you also have the option to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-support-stylus-input">use a stylus</a> with the S Pen. </p><p>Ignoring carrier availability, I would argue that the OnePlus Open provides even stiffer competition than Samsung. Both the Open and 9 Pro Fold offer similar designs, seeing as both devices have cover screens that align better with traditional smartphones. While Open might have better camera hardware, Google still leads the way in image processing. </p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a premium foldable phone with the Pixel experience.</li><li>You want fantastic battery life.</li><li>You would enjoy features like "Made You Look."</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You don't want to spend $1,800 on a smartphone.</li><li>You want the best cameras or performance.</li><li>You regularly use more than two apps at the same time.</li></ul>
<p>I&apos;ve done a lot of gushing over the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and it&apos;s the phone that I couldn&apos;t wait to return to after the Pixel 9 Pro review was complete. For the first time in a long while, I feel as though Google managed to recapture some of the magic that it was missing. The original Pixel Fold was close but didn&apos;t take long to fall apart.</p><p>In the matter of whether you should pick up the 9 Pro Fold for yourself, I give this one a big ole&apos; hearty recommendation. Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> might have more features and might be more powerful. But they don&apos;t offer the same comfortable experience as Google&apos;s latest offering. And while I&apos;m trying to not put the cart before the horse, I can&apos;t wait to see what a successor could bring.</p>

The X100 Ultra debuted in Q2, somehow managing to outshine the X100 Pro, and the device has the best cameras of any phone I used this year.</p><p>The Chinese manufacturer is now looking ahead to 2025 with the introduction of the X200 series. There are three models at launch: the standard X200, the X200 Pro, and interestingly, the X200 Pro Mini. The X200 brings considerable tweaks over the X100, including a new design with flatter sides with beveled edges, and attractive colors.</p>
<p>The X200 comes with a 6.67-inch AMOLED panel, and it has 12GB of RAM on the base model, 256GB of storage, and a 5800mAh battery. Vivo is continuing its association with MediaTek, and the X200 is powered by the latest Dimensity 9400, a powerhouse that uses all big cores, giving it a distinct edge over Qualcomm.</p><p>The phone has a trio of 50MP cameras at the back, and considering the amount of progress Vivo made in this area with the X100 series, I&apos;m interested in seeing what the brand managed to achieve this time around. On the software side, the phone runs OriginOS 5.0 out of the box, with Vivo using the skin in its home country.</p>

<p>Predictably, the X200 Pro is the more interesting device, and it has a bigger 6.78-inch AMOLED panel, larger 6000mAh battery, and is powered by the same Dimensity 9400 platform. It has a 50MP main camera and wide-angle lenses, and switches to a 200MP zoom lens — similar to that of the X100 Ultra that debuted in May.</p>
<p>The X200 Pro Mini is of interest as it caters to a niche; ASUS didn&apos;t bother launching a smaller version of the Zenfone 11 Ultra, and there is a clear dearth of small phones with high-end hardware. The X200 Pro Mini has a lot of the same hardware as the X200 Pro, but you get a smaller 6.31-inch panel, and a trio of 50MP cameras at the back. There&apos;s still a sizeable 5700mAh battery,</p><p>The X200 Pro Mini starts at 4699 RMB ($662), while the X200 Pro debuts at 5299 RMB ($747). The standard X200 is a reasonable 4299 RMB ($606), and all three devices are set to go on sale in China in the coming weeks. Not much is known about the global launch at this moment, but if history is any indication, Vivo won&apos;t take too long to bring these models to India and SE Asian markets ahead of a broader global rollout.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Meta Quest 3S has been a wonderful escape from the clunkiness of life brought about by the aftermath of Hurricane Helene for me. Being able to literally jump into another world by popping a headset on during the day has been more than just mood-changing for me, it’s been an important part of recovery time to return to normal life again.</p><p>Throughout this, the most impressive thing to me is how little of a compromise this feels when compared to the $200 more expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>. While the lenses aren’t as clear, I didn’t notice any other real differences while playing. Even with that in mind, most people won’t be able to appreciate the lens difference unless they’ve already used a Quest 3 before, anyway, so it’s a bit of a moot point.</p><p>While the experience is unbelievably close to the Quest 3, I don’t want to write a full review after using it for just a week. Instead, I’ve come up with five takeaways and why this should absolutely be the VR headset you buy this year, especially if you’re a Quest 2 owner who’s looking to play games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-hands-on">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mixed-reality-is-stunning-2">Mixed reality is stunning</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VimKDKShuDZe9icGaoqDRT" name="Meta-Quest-3S-mixed-reality-gameplay-starship-home.jpg" alt="Viewing my living room in mixed reality as a starship in Starship Home through the lenses of a Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VimKDKShuDZe9icGaoqDRT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I first put the headset on, I marveled at how similar the Meta Quest 3S’s color mixed reality vision was to that of the Meta Quest 3. It was easy to see the room around me, put my controllers on, and interact with things in the room — including petting my kitten who was roaming around.</p><p>The best mixed reality games all feel and play nearly identically on the Meta Quest 3S. Turning your living room into a racket ball court in Racket Club still feels magical, and unique mixed reality-only games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/starship-home-mixed-reality-game-impressions">Starship Home</a> still transform your existing room into something new and special. In fact, I still had that funny feeling of something missing in the room every time I stopped playing Starship Home because the mixed reality quality was so convincing.</p><p>For Meta Quest 2 owners <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-2">upgrading to a Meta Quest 3S</a>, color mixed reality will be the biggest, most immediate difference. Mixed reality simply doesn’t exist on a Quest 2. Calling the ultra low-res black & white passthrough vision “mixed reality” is simply inaccurate, and it’s this that will bring that immediate “wow” factor to your purchase.</p>
<h2 id="the-graphics-upgrade-will-blow-you-away-2">The graphics upgrade will blow you away</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="z9dvVxNDx8rDtDQ7LF7YiP" name="Batman-arkham-shadow-ratcatcher-still.jpeg" alt="Screenshot from Batman: Arkham Shadow showing the Ratcatcher in his cell in Arkham." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z9dvVxNDx8rDtDQ7LF7YiP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ve already been able to play some Quest 3-exclusive games on the Meta Quest 3S that I’m not allowed to talk about yet, but let me tell you that the graphics on these titles are going to blow you away. This is a 100% full generational upgrade from the Meta Quest 2, and it’s immediately palpable on many of the biggest upcoming Meta Quest games.</p><p>While some existing games you might have already played got impressive visual upgrades — The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners is one of the best examples of impressive updates to existing games — the new games coming out this year are the ones that’ll truly blow you away. That’s because it’s not just about the upgraded details, better textures, improved lighting, and other graphical improvements. It’s about scale.</p><p>The extra RAM and 100% improved processing power over the Quest 2 mean that games made for the Quest 3 can feel bigger and more robust. Many Oculus Quest games from the 2019 and 2020 eras often felt like mobile games in a new perspective because of their graphical and environmental simplicity. Meta Quest 3 games feel straight out of the PS4 era of gaming, and that’s something to truly celebrate.</p>
<h2 id="backwards-compatibility-with-quest-3-accessories-is-a-game-changer-2">Backwards compatibility with Quest 3 accessories is a game changer</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sFifyjSfuH6Ym2pYnN5k4d" name="Meta-Quest-3S-accessories.jpg" alt="A bunch of Meta Quest 3S accessories including stands, batteries, head straps, and controller grips" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sFifyjSfuH6Ym2pYnN5k4d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From day one, I was able to use nearly every single one of the best Meta Quest 3 accessories (link) that I had on hand with the Meta Quest 3S. The lone exception is the facial interface, which is a different shape and size compared with the Quest 3. But every alternative head strap I had, every controller accessory — including fancy golf clubs and controller grips — and every battery pack or haptic feedback vest worked with the Quest 3S without any tinkering.</p><p>That means Quest 3S users have access to an entire year’s worth of third-party accessory work, allowing them to choose the best accessory for the job instead of settling with overpriced options that end up disappointing. That&apos;s a massive change from every other Meta Quest product launch, which often saw only first-party accessories available for months at a time.</p><p>If you’re picking up a Quest 3S, I&apos;d recommend two accessories to get a significantly better experience. First, grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/bobovr-m3-pro-review-meta-quest-3-headstrap">BoboVR M3 Pro</a> head strap replacement. Its brilliant design helps offload the Quest 3S&apos;s weight from your face, balancing it better on your head with cushy, easily removable, washable padding. It also includes a magnetically hot-swappable, rechargeable battery pack that adds hours of playtime to your experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rdmNGVbwguSdwJMDUPRTMZ" name="Meta-Quest-3S-Kiwi-Design-H4-side.jpg" alt="Wearing the KIWI Design H4 head strap on a Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rdmNGVbwguSdwJMDUPRTMZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m also testing out KIWI Design&apos;s H4 and K4 head straps, both of which offer much better comfort over the stock strap while adding a big battery for additional playtime. KIWI Design prides itself on battery safety, which is something to think of since it&apos;s strapped to your head!</p><p>Next, grab these inexpensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/amvr-quest-3-controller-grips-review">AMVR controller grips</a>. They replace the battery cover on your Quest 3S controllers with one that has a grippy texture and a comfortable hand strap. That strap not only more evenly distributes the controller&apos;s weight but also makes it easier to throw things in VR since you can actually let go of the controller without it falling out of your hands.</p><p>I personally dislike the stock facial interface for any Meta Quest headset and often prefer ones from AMVR or Kiwi Design, but neither company has one that works with the Quest 3S yet. Once I use one I like, I&apos;ll add a recommendation.</p>
<h2 id="the-catalog-of-games-is-downright-impressive-2">The catalog of games is downright impressive</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8QBDhjnRvnuo4t5WD62FwS" name="meta-quest-3s-games-library.jpg" alt="Looking at the upcoming games section of the Meta Horizon store on a Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8QBDhjnRvnuo4t5WD62FwS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We just overhauled our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> list, and let me tell you how difficult it was to narrow down the selection of "best games" to just a few. The Meta Quest platform sports thousands of games, and while plenty of 2024 games have been phenomenal, there are still plenty of classics worth playing.</p><p>New releases like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/dimensional-double-shift/4449903565103159/">Dimensional Double Shift</a> put a new spin on the old VR classic Job Simulator by adding in multiplayer and hand tracking, plus a new theme with tons of unique interactions. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/metal-hellsinger-vr/6490578927725908/">Metal: Hellsinger VR</a> takes the console classic into VR with a head-banging good original soundtrack and gameplay that feels straight out of the best Doom games.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/nfl-pro-era/4193975210678121/">NFL PRO ERA 2025</a> just upgraded its gameplay and roster to give you the fantasy football experience you&apos;ve been dreaming of, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/hotel-rnr-rockstar-simulator/6684805738279353/">Hotel RnR Rockstar Simulator</a> lets you step into the shoes of a rockstar who is fed up with not getting their way all the time.</p><p>In just a week, you&apos;ll be able to play Batman Arkham Shadow, the first original game in the Arkham franchise in a decade. That, of course, is a game for free with the Meta Quest 3S, so you don&apos;t have to purchase the game separately.</p><p>And the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> list is stacked with other big-name releases we&apos;re sure to love. Alien: Rogue Incursion is the first made-for-VR game in the classic Ridley Scott series. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/behemoth-hands-on">Skydance&apos;s Behemoth</a> brings Shadow of the Colossus-style gameplay to VR, and Metro Awakening is an original VR entry into the acclaimed Metro 2033 series that gamers have loved for years.</p>

<p>The worst part of buying any new system is having to shell out a bunch of money to play games on it. That&apos;s where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-plus-subscription">Meta Quest Plus</a> comes in. It&apos;s a subscription service similar to something like Xbox Game Pass, giving you access to 22 of the best Quest games right away.</p><p>Each Meta Quest headset comes with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/meta-quest-plus/">three-month trial</a> of the service, and it&apos;s just $7.99 per month thereafter. Here&apos;s how it works. A library of 20 games is available to play right away, giving you access to a regularly rotated, curated list of titles. You don&apos;t own these games, so be sure to play them when they&apos;re available.</p><p>Beyond that, you&apos;ll get access to two games each month that you can claim permanently on your account. That&apos;s 24 games per year added to your library and accessible so long as you keep a subscription to the service. That&apos;s in addition to the regularly rotated list of 20 games, meaning you&apos;ll have <em>plenty</em> to play for just a few bucks a month.</p>

<p>Meta absolutely knocked it out of the park with the Meta Quest 3S. This is the Quest 2 follow-up the VR industry needs because it comes in at the price people want. A $299 headset is probably the single most important thing to get VR into more hands and on more heads, and a product as good as the Meta Quest 3S is going to absolutely blow people’s minds this Holiday season.</p><p>I don’t hesitate at all when I say this is the most important VR product ever made. It takes all the lessons Meta learned from the Quest 2 era, adds in all the improvements made with Quest 3 hardware and the software experience over the past year, and somehow melds them perfectly into a $299 package. It’s an unbelievable feat for the company to have achieved, and yet, here it is for all to enjoy.</p><p>The VR boom cycle is about to be back in business after a year of slow down, and the Meta Quest 3S is leading the charge.</p>

<ul><li>Honor’s Magic 7 series will launch in China on October 30, just a week after the Magic OS 9.0 debut on October 23.</li><li>The Magic 7 series is likely exclusive to China at launch, with a global release expected in early 2024.</li><li>The Magic 7 series will likely feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite or Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, making it one of the first phones to use this chipset.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor&apos;s next-generation flagship lineup is landing in China later this October, a week after the launch of the next iteration of Magic OS.</p><p>Honor&apos;s CEO, George Zhao, confirmed the news on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1788052133/OBtx7CSy0" target="_blank">Weibo</a> today, announcing that the Honor Magic 7 series will be unveiled on October 30 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/honor-magic-7-series-magicos-9-0-launch-dates-revealed/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a>). To amp up the excitement, he shared a poster for the launch event, highlighting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-ifa-2024-next-flagship-teaser">AI features of Magic OS 9.0</a>, which is set to launch on October 23.</p><p>Built on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, Honor&apos;s next Android skin promises a bunch of AI features in keeping with the growing smartphone market trend.</p><p>It is highly likely that the upcoming Magic 7 series launch will be exclusive to China. Honor usually rolls out its flagship devices to international markets in the first quarter of the year, so anyone outside China will have to hang tight for the global release in the months ahead.</p><p>It’s interesting to note that both Magic OS 8.0 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6</a> series were launched last January. So, the upcoming releases of Magic OS 9.0 and the Magic 7 series are quite a shift for Honor, as they’re coming out much earlier than usual.</p><p>The upcoming Honor lineup is expected to pack the latest Qualcomm flagship chipset, likely called Snapdragon 8 Elite or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>. This move positions the Magic 7 as one of the first phones to rock this new processor. Unless other OEMs can sneak in a launch before Honor does, Honor is ahead of the pack, leaving rivals like the Xiaomi 15 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> in the dust.</p><p>Qualcomm has locked in October 21 for the unveiling of the Snapdragon 8 Elite/Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/10/12/four-snapdragon-8-elite-phones-launching-in-october-one-in-november/" target="_blank">recent report</a>, flagship launches featuring this chip are expected to kick off starting October 28. This opens the door for Xiaomi and other brands to possibly snag the title of the first smartphone powered by the new SoC.</p><p>The Magic 7 series is expected to include two models: the standard and a high-end Pro version. According to reliable leaker Digital Chat Station on Weibo, the Honor Magic 7 Pro will come with advanced security features like an ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint sensor. On the charging front, it’s tipped to support 100W wired fast charging and 80W wireless charging options.</p><p>Recent rumors suggest the Magic 7 Pro could sport a 6.82-inch 2K OLED display with curves on all four sides. This screen is expected to deliver a smooth 120Hz refresh rate and be reinforced with Kunlun Glass.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Sonodyne is an Indian audio manufacturer that has been around for over 50 years, and while it usually caters to enthusiasts, its latest products are aimed at a wider audience. The Malhar joins Alaap, Antara, and Bandish, and it is the most powerful wireless speaker Sonodyne has to offer.</p><p>I used dozens of Bluetooth speakers over the course of the last decade, including portable options like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tribit-stormbox-2-review">Tribit StormBox 2</a> and the oversized StormBox Blast, or bigger units that are meant to be plugged in, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/trettitre-tresound-1-review">Trettitre&apos;s unique TreSound 1</a> or the Marshall Stanmore. In fact, I used the Stanmore continuously for nearly a decade now, and it has served me very well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7pV9fmpZzf4skhgYYiqkEf" name="sonodyne-malhar-1.jpg" alt="Sonodyne Malhar on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7pV9fmpZzf4skhgYYiqkEf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Malhar is in the same category as the Stanmore in that it needs to be connected to a wall outlet. That&apos;s understandable when you consider that the speaker produces 180W of sound, and it is even larger than the Stanmore. The Malhar debuted at ₹37,500 ($445) back in 2022, and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Sonodyne-Handmade-Wireless-Bluetooth-Connectivity/dp/B0B6VBRQRV">now available for ₹31,999 ($380) on Amazon India</a> — which is less than what you&apos;d <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Marshall-Stanmore-Bluetooth-Wireless-Speaker/dp/B09GYPKTGM/">shell out for the Stanmore III</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yS5E5HKTC8tSFHZw69mgog" name="sonodyne-malhar-3.jpg" alt="Sonodyne Malhar side view with drivers highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yS5E5HKTC8tSFHZw69mgog.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The speaker has a distinctive design, and the chassis is made out of MDF — giving it rigidity — and finished in a glossy coat. I&apos;m not a big fan of glossy designs in general, but the Malhar looks good in its own right, and the build quality is exquisite. There are no rounded edges, but the blocky design works in the speaker&apos;s favor, and the sizing gives it a domineering presence.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nrE6c7fKshseZ5FSB2h9Kg" name="sonodyne-malhar-4.jpg" alt="Sonodyne Malhar control buttons with ambient lighting shining" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nrE6c7fKshseZ5FSB2h9Kg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;ll find the power and volume buttons at the top of the unit, and you can switch between 3.5mm in, USB, optical, or Bluetooth modes with relative ease. The buttons are on the smaller side, and fiddly to use. Thankfully, the Malhar has an IR sensor located up front, and you get a remote bundled in the package. This is how I controlled the speaker in the month I used it.</p><p>The remote lets you control music playback, change connectivity modes, adjust volume, and it has a mute button. Rounding out the connectivity, the optical, 3.5mm in, and USB ports are located at the back, and there&apos;s a secondary USB-A port that delivers 5W of power. Coming in at 8kg (17.6lb), the Malhar is considerably heavier than the Stanmore III as well (5.4kg (11.9lb)). This isn&apos;t a speaker you can easily carry around; it&apos;s instead to be placed in one location.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ELuzHQx8pjaSbjQpDCENnj" name="sonodyne-malhar-8.jpg" alt="Sonodyne Malhar passive radiator" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ELuzHQx8pjaSbjQpDCENnj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sonodyne sells the Malhar in white, black, red, and natural wooden variants, and I got the black version of the unit. If anything, the black version does a disservice to the Malhar, making it look a little dull; if you&apos;re interested in the speaker, you should get it in white or red. Given the glossy finish, the speaker picks up a lot of dust, and it is easily visible on the black variant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nBFV3huD2j44i58AW8jMhi" name="sonodyne-malhar-6.jpg" alt="Sonodyne Malhar tweeters and woofers at the front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nBFV3huD2j44i58AW8jMhi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a metal grille covering the woofer and tweeter units, and it adds a bit of contrast to the design — if you&apos;re getting the white model. Like all other Sonodyne products, the Malhar is designed and manufactured in India. The Sonodyne logo is highlighted at the front, and the way the logo is written is reminiscent of certain dental brand, and it&apos;s amusing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rRAhw4rquTRrd7Q3TUqYRh" name="sonodyne-malhar-5.jpg" alt="Sonodyne Malhar tweeters and woofers at the front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRAhw4rquTRrd7Q3TUqYRh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the Malhar has two 5-inch woofers, two 1-inch silk-dome tweeters, and dual 5-inch passive radiators located on the sides. The speaker uses a Class D amp, and it goes up to 180W. I connected the Malhar to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-was-wrong-about-the-pixel-9-pro-xl">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> and iPhone 16 Pro Max, and I didn&apos;t see any problems with Bluetooth connectivity — it maintained a rock-solid signal.</p><p>Interestingly, the Bluetooth pairing sound should be immediately familiar if you&apos;ve taken a train in India; Sonodyne installed the PA systems in several Indian railway stations, and the Malhar uses the same jingle when you connect a phone to the unit. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="o8aCHeNYm2AvyvKHe5xLXm" name="sonodyne-malhar-13.jpg" alt="Sonodyne Malhar with Pixel 9 Pro XL connected" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8aCHeNYm2AvyvKHe5xLXm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sound quality is nothing short of phenomenal; the Malhar produces a reverberating bass with plenty of vigor, but it is controlled, and doesn&apos;t bleed into the mid-range. The mids are natural and clear-sounding, and vocals shine through. The treble has excellent range, and this is where the Malhar stands out against its rivals.</p><p>Sonodyne clearly knows what it&apos;s doing when it comes to tuning its speakers; the Malhar is just as capable at handling orchestral ensembles as it is at heavy metal — and everything in between. I used the speaker for dozens of hours, alternating between RATM, Ghost, Nightwish, Batushka, Thylacine, Daft Punk, Com Truise, and Miles Davis. The Malhar had no trouble with any genre, and it has a definite edge over the Stanmore in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YpyyGCF5f2gkLuPQqZAzzm" name="sonodyne-malhar-14.jpg" alt="Sonodyne Malhar with Pixel 9 Pro XL connected next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YpyyGCF5f2gkLuPQqZAzzm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only omission (as it were) is that you don&apos;t get the option to adjust the EQ. This isn&apos;t strictly necessary as Sonodyne did a masterful job with the tuning of the Malhar, but there were instances where I wanted to crank up the bass a bit, and that isn&apos;t doable. I constantly adjust the dials on the Stanmore to tailor the sound to my preferences, but there isn&apos;t a way to do the same here.</p>

<p>That said, there&apos;s a vibrancy to the sound that you just don&apos;t get with other Bluetooth speakers, and it is addictive. Ultimately, the Malhar is one of the best — if not the best overall — Bluetooth speaker I have used, and the fact that it doesn&apos;t cost more than the Stanmore makes it an instant recommendation.</p>

<ul><li>New Google app beta findings reveal Google Assistant actions run by Gemini itself.</li><li>Once the roll out begins, users would be able to send texts on WhatsApp, Google Messages using Gemini instead of Google Assistant.</li><li>Similarly, there is also Spotify Extensions that works similar to YouTube Music.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Over the past couple of years, it has become evident that Google&apos;s Gemini will soon fully replace the good old digital assistant on Android devices. New findings indicate the start of it as the latest Google app beta version contains evidence that some of the existing actions, which rely on Google Assistant, are now being run by Gemini.</p><p>According to Assemble Debug, in collaboration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-assistant-actions-gemini-extensions-3488963/">Android Authority</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> has been able to perform actions such as sending messages on WhatsApp or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>. But with the potential shift to Extensions, Gemini may be taking over these actions, as shown in the beta version of the Google app (15.40.31.29). A screenshot even confirms it, with a pop-up stating that "Google Assistant actions are becoming Extensions."</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/VivaCut_video_1728448309122_1080HD.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/VivaCut_video_1728448309122_1080HD.mp4"></video></div>
<p>Similarly, Gemini will probably learn which extensions users prefer for tasks like calling or messaging. These can be managed individually, and users can request other extensions or disable any they don’t want. Android Authority also mentions that to use Extensions, users need to make sure the Gemini Apps Activity setting is enabled.</p><p>The publication shared demo videos showing Extensions in action, including ones for WhatsApp, Google Messages, and Spotify. The videos suggest that with Gemini, making calls and sending texts on WhatsApp is totally doable.</p><p>Also, the Google Messages Extension offers similar features, like sending and reading messages. In the demo, though, they could only send messages with Gemini and weren’t able to read any recently received ones.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/screen-20241009-102617.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/screen-20241009-102617.mp4"></video></div>
<p>Spotify is the latest extension that has been added to Gemini. It works similarly to what we have seen with the early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-youtube-music-extension-rollout">integration of YouTube Music</a>. The publication points out that the extension seemed to be working both for free and premium accounts on Spotify.</p><p>Enabling the Spotify Extension is simple, and users can directly ask Gemini to play a song or an album, which then throws in a thumbnail of the song that is being played. Tapping it will take users directly into the Spotify app.</p><p>It is encouraging to see Google bringing on these nifty new capabilities to Gemini alongside the major Gemini Live roll out, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">happened very recently</a>. It was also made free for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> including the addition of new languages. The Extensions as mentioned are currently seen in the Google beta app, it could likely mean the official roll out is not too far.</p>

<hr>
<p>We bet you didn&apos;t see this coming; NVIDIA is rolling out a fall update for its Shield TV experience.</p><p>NVIDIA detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/shield-tv/9/522242/shield-experience-upgrade-911-hotfix-image/3478201/">the patch notes</a> for the October update for its Shield TV (Android TV-based) streaming experience. The company packages this update as a hotfix, which is reportedly a continuation of the initial v9.1.1 variant from July 2023. Starting from October 8, users can begin downloading/installing the "second hotfix," version 33.2.0.252.</p><p>NVIDIA states it&apos;s updating the "Match Frame Rate" beta feature for its Shield TV devices. The October patch also rectifies an issue with the "SHIELD drive filling up." A "no audio" problem experienced on Shield TV via headsets connected to a controller should also be fixed.</p><p>A crash concerning GeForce Now was fixed alongside a "distortion" effect seen when using the "RGB 8-bit Rec.709" display mode.</p><p>The remainder of NVIDIA&apos;s changelog is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Ability to clear HDMI 1.4 flag via factory reset</li><li>Resolved USB HDD/Flash drive showing corrupted after hotplug</li><li>NAS folder info shows 0 B and not the actual capacity</li><li>Mounted storages aren't listed after upgrade</li><li>Fixes occasional crashes in DRM apps</li></ul>

<p>It&apos;s a wonder the NVIDIA Shield TV is <em>still </em>receiving upgrades nearly ten years after its original model launched. The company has continued to improve the series as it released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review">a 4K variant</a> in 2020. What&apos;s keeping this device relevant is its amazing upscaling capabilities for 4K content, thanks to AI. There was even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-shield-pro-vs-standard">the Pro model</a> from 2019, which arrived as a secondary choice to the base version.</p><p>In 2019, it was stated that the NVIDIA Shield TV was an Android device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-longest-support-life-isnt-phone-its-nvidia-shield-tv">with the longest support life</a> that <em>wasn&apos;t</em> a phone. Keep in mind this was when phones received an abysmal two years of OS and security updates. Now, we&apos;re seeing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">upwards of seven</a>. What&apos;s funny is that NVIDIA&apos;s Shield TV is <em>still </em>a long-living Android-supported device. It&apos;s nearly 2025, and the original model launched in 2015.</p><p>The device has also continued to find ways to remain in contention for one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">best streaming devices</a> of 2024 (at #4).</p>

This is because Google was found to be abusing monopoly powers during the trial in August 2024.</p><p>I agree that Google abuses its power, and severe penalties should be imposed on the company. Google is not your friend or a "nice guy;" it's simply another tech company that happens to control the software that powers seven of every 10 phones in the world. It needs to be kept under control. Then again, my opinion matters the same as yours: none. The DoJ and a judge are in control of this one.</p>

<p>I also want to make sure everyone understands that right now, this holds the same weight as the last time we heard Google was going to be broken up. until it happens, after all appeals and alternatives are exhausted, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-pulse-google-is-now-a-monopoly-but-nothing-will-really-change">it's business as usual</a>.</p><p>If it does happen, you should probably just buy an iPhone because Android will wither and die.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5tzYfu562FUyQzhtMLCc7Q" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-5.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL angled view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5tzYfu562FUyQzhtMLCc7Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google makes no money directly from Android. I'm not saying that having Android around isn't profitable for Google, but the cost of building, maintaining, hosting, and deploying a free smartphone operating system is astronomical, and the profit from doing it is zero.</p><p>Google makes more money because Android exists. Android is a vehicle for Google's free apps and services, which are used to build <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-google-sell-your-data">comprehensive advertisement profiles</a> for everyone who uses them. Having that kind of customer data means Google can charge a lot for ad services and still have plenty of customers. Every name you can think of advertises through Google, from tech items to groceries and clothing. Google ads work better than any other company's, partially because of the billions of Android phones used daily.</p>
<p>In the end when all the finances are tallied, Android is a net benefit for Google. But it wouldn't be for anyone else.</p>
<h2 id="no-company-that-could-maintain-android-would-want-it-2">No company that could maintain Android would want it</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3774px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8wNc88sFgWN2ay2k6stBCo" name="Microsoft-logo.jpg" alt="The Microsoft logo at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8wNc88sFgWN2ay2k6stBCo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3774" height="2123" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are probably a few giant tech corporations that could maintain Android well enough for it to remain competitive. I can think of one: Microsoft.</p><p>Maybe Apple could, maybe Mozilla could, and maybe IBM or Oracle could, but Microsoft has both the development infrastructure and experience to "control" a huge software project that is deployed on thousands of different hardware configurations. And Microsoft wouldn't want it.</p><p>Microsoft would much rather see Android (and Chrome) go away because owning it would lead to the same antitrust concerns that we see from Google owning it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.">Microsoft knows a thing or two about those</a>.</p>
<p>I don't think Apple could manage Android very well because it has a very different philosophy when it comes to software. Even if it could, Apple would also love to see Android die.</p><p>Any other smaller company that would have the ambition, like Mozilla, couldn't afford to do it without billions of dollars from Google. Those dollars would come with strings attached that would spur another DoJ investigation.</p>
<h2 id="android-phone-makers-can-t-and-shouldn-t-2">Android phone makers can't and shouldn't</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="m9nBdBGHXUwKxDeYWdkv6K" name="Samsung-logo.jpg" alt="Samsung logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m9nBdBGHXUwKxDeYWdkv6K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The obvious answer, at least on the surface, is Samsung. That's the worst option of all.</p><p>Ask any software developer who has looked at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsungs-tizen-powered-z1-rival-android-one-if-not-all-android">Tizen</a> source code if Samsung can maintain and develop Android. They'll tell you "No," probably while laughing. Software is not something Samsung does particularly well.</p><p>Samsung is a fabulous phone hardware maker. Misguided people will say <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">Samsung doesn't innovate</a>, but Samsung single-handedly made Android what it is today and drives its growth because the phones it makes are so good. Being a Korean (and not Chinese) company helps build some trust, but people know the Samsung name and know their products aren't likely to disappoint. </p>
<p>When it comes to the software side of things Samsung struggles. Android phones running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-one-ui-611-is-finally-here-for-these-galaxy-phones">One UI</a> are its best software product and another company is doing 90% of the work and helping them with the final 10%. Samsung could invest billions into hiring the right people and changing its company culture, but it won't.</p><p>Motorola or OnePlus can't possibly afford to develop and maintain Android. Chinese phone makers (yes, I know <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-quarterly-profits-soar">Motorola is technically one of them</a>) would immediately face backlash if they even tried because the U.S. is more afraid of China than it is of monopolies.</p>

<p>In the end, Google is the company that needs to keep tending to Android if it is to continue to get better. Google is "evil" now in a lot of ways but it is very competent when it comes to running a software project like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">AOSP</a>.</p><p>If the incentive to tend to Android is taken away, Google probably won't want to do so. Google only wants Android with Gmail, the Play Store, Google Play Services, and all the other Google bits baked into it. Take those away, and Android will become a burden rather than an opportunity.</p>
