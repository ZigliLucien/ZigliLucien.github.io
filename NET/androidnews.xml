<ul><li>A flag tucked away in Android 15's first beta shows Google is working to simplify and declutter an app's notification toggles in Settings.</li><li>Users will only see toggles where notification channels they've been alerted through, while everything else is hidden in a sub-menu.</li><li>Google pushed a Beta 1.1 patch for Android 15 testers on April 16, which fixes NFC for Pixels.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is working on a way that streamlines app notification management for the user in Android 15.</p><p>As spotted by Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-hide-unused-notification-channels-3436165/">Android Authority</a>, enabling a new flag in the first Android 15 beta produces its ability to hide unused notification channels. Currently, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, the entire list of available app notification channels is available, which makes it hard to find what you don&apos;t need.</p><p>Many of these channels are created and toggled on despite the app never pushing an alert through it. Google&apos;s latest support allows the OS to hide notification channels that an app has never used.</p><p>Android 15 code shows that users will only see notification toggles for things they&apos;ve been alerted to, like DMs, live videos, reminders, and more. Rahman states that everything else was tossed into a "Show unused channels" menu option in an app&apos;s three-dot menu in Settings.</p><p>From there, users can scroll through and see every channel an app possesses but has never been called to action. Once the function arrives, it should make it less daunting and a lot easier to quickly toggle off a notification you don&apos;t want.</p>

<p>Rahman states that the "show unused channel" option isn&apos;t appearing appropriately in the Android 15 beta unless the flag is enabled. While this likely means Google is still developing it, the feature&apos;s functionality appears quite stable and ready to go. It&apos;s likely Google could slide this into the software&apos;s stable release later this year.</p><p>The company achieved its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">first beta milestone</a> with Android 15 on April 11. Enrolled testers and developers could hop in and experiment with new app archiving and improved TalkBack support. Regarding the latter, Google stated its boosted TalkBack support involves those with braille displays using HID standard over USB and secure Bluetooth.</p><p>More recently, Google rolled out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-1-1">minor Beta 1.1 patch</a> for Android 15 testers. One of its highlight fixes pertains to an NFC bug that previously rendered its functionality useless. Users were unable to use their Pixel phones for contactless payment; however, things seem to have been fixed. Several more fixes rolled in, such as one that solved an issue that prevented devices from installing the initial beta.</p>

The $18 Chu II is among the best entry-level IEMs you can buy, and the brand released innovative products like the Dash75 — a retro-styled mechanical keyboard that houses a DAC — in the past. </p>

<p>Moondrop also makes planar headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/moondrop-venus-review">Venus</a>, but it has loftier ambitions for its next product, the MIAD01. Abbreviated for Mobile Internet Audio Device, MIAD01 is a phone that has a balanced 4.4mm connector alongside a single-ended 3.5mm jack, a flagship decoding chip, and independent audio circuitry that should mitigate any interference.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the phone hardware itself. The MIAD01 will have a 6.7-inch flexible OLED panel with 1080p resolution, 120Hz refresh, and interestingly, 1920Hz DC dimming. In renders shared by the brand on X, the device looks like any other giant slab, with the ports located at the top.</p><p>As someone who tests enthusiast audio products along with a gazillion phones a year, it feels like the MIAD01 is tailored to my needs. Moondrop teased details of the MIAD01 at the start of the year, but I didn&apos;t take those seriously — audio brands tend to share grandiose plans all the time, but most of them don&apos;t come to fruition. In this instance, however, it looks like the brand is actually going to follow through and launch a phone.</p>

<p>Obviously, that invites a lot of questions. Why is Moondrop making a phone? Will it have the Play Store? How many updates will it get? What about after-sales service? Making a phone is significantly more challenging than audio products, and most brands instead choose to go with digital audio players. These players have a screen, decent hardware, dedicated audio circuitry, and usually run an AOSP build of Android. Think of these devices as phones without all the connectivity bits.</p><p>Fiio&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m11s-review">M11S</a> is a good example; it is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 660, comes with ESS Sabre&apos;s high-end ES9038Q2M DACs, a 5-inch 720p screen, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 5300mAh battery. It runs Android 10, and will make the switch to Android 12 later in the year. While Android 10 is outdated, it is still usable in this setting, as all you&apos;re doing with the interface is playing your music streaming service of choice.</p><p>Designing a phone is much more complex; it needs cellular radios, and should be able to handle a variety of mundane tasks — send texts, make calls, browse the web, use social media, play games, and everything else you do with a phone — in addition to playing music. Moondrop just doesn&apos;t have the resources or the technical knowhow to make a phone, so the MIAD01 will be a rebranded version of an existing device.</p>

<p>Considering the MIAD01 has 1920Hz PWM dimming, it limits the options to a Chinese entity. I don&apos;t see Xiaomi, Honor, or any of the BBK brands somehow turning into a white label manufacturer, so if I had to venture a guess, the MIAD01 is using an ODM that caters to smaller manufacturers, like Blu.</p><p>The blocky design of the MIAD01 is reminiscent of ZTE&apos;s Nubia Z60 Ultra, but the MIAD01 will be a mid-ranger. The brand confirmed that it will be powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7050, which uses older Arm v8 cores, including two Cortex A78 and six A55 cores. It will have 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage, 12GB of RAM, and a MicroSD slot that holds up to 2TB cards.</p>

<p>While it&apos;s interesting to speculate on the hardware, it&apos;s the software that is the biggest limiting factor for a new brand venturing into this segment. And unlike digital audio players, AOSP doesn&apos;t cut it on a phone, so the MIAD01 will need differentiated software. And somehow, I doubt Moondrop&apos;s ability to deliver on that front; the brand&apos;s Link app to connect to its earbuds is riddled with issues, and is often unusable.</p><p>It would be ideal to have a phone that also doubles as a music player, and LG did a great job catering to this niche. But that&apos;s in the past, and I don&apos;t quite see Moondrop rising to the challenge. The brand had its share of misses in recent years, and it may have taken on too much with the MIAD01. The device will need to deliver terrific audio, and simultaneously go up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best mid-range phones</a>.</p><p>A more sensible option would have been to launch a digital audio player like Fiio, HiBy, Shanling, Sony, Astell & Kern, and other audio brands, but as we&apos;ve seen in the past, Moondrop doesn&apos;t like to play by conventional rules.</p>

<p>Xiaomi’s budget-friendly Redmi brand is back with yet another affordable tablet, dubbed Redmi Pad SE, which was just launched in the Indian market.

The screen is enclosed in an aluminum unibody design that is 7.36 mm thick and looks quite similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmi-pad-launch">Redmi Pad</a>. The tablet&apos;s available color options include Mint Green, Graphite Gray, and Lavender Purple.</p>

<p>Underneath, the tablet is powered by a Snapdragon 680 SoC with 2.4GHz clock speeds — the same chipset that powered the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-accidentally-announces-redmi-10-ahead-august-18-launch">Redmi 10</a> back in 2022. It is further backed by up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage, with support for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> for up to 1TB of additional storage. </p><p>The device relies on a sole 8MP primary sensor enclosed in a rectangular camera housing. On the front, there’s still a 5MP selfie camera for video conferencing. </p><p>Keeping the lights on, the Redmi Pad SE has a massive 8,000mAh battery capacity with 10W wired charging speeds. The other notable parameters of the entry-level tablet comprise AI face unlock, Wi-Fi, support for Bluetooth 5.0, a quad-speaker system, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and an Android 13-based MIUI Pad 14 operating system. Also, the budget tablet gets support from Redmi Stylus for Pad, which is likely sold separately.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="#section-update"><strong>Update (April 24, 8:55 pm ET)</strong></a>: Google says the PIN requirement for using Google Wallet on Wear OS for tap-to-pay is actually just a glitch.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Wallet might start asking for a PIN on Wear OS watches, potentially making payments less convenient.</li><li>Some Reddit users report having to input a PIN for every payment attempt on their Wear OS watches.</li><li>The PIN prompt seems limited to a few users, suggesting it could be a test, a glitch, or a gradual rollout by Google.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Paying with your Wear OS watch with Google Wallet might get annoying soon, as the app might start asking for a PIN before you can use the speedy payment feature.</p><p>Google Wallet taps into your Android phone and NFC to make payments super easy. It even jumped onto your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">beloved Wear OS watches</a>, so you could pay straight from your wrist. But here comes a security update that might make paying with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-3">Wear OS</a> a tad more irritating.</p><p>Some users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1c8iqw7/gpay_now_needs_to_input_pin_everytime_you_make/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> are reporting about Google Wallet making them enter a PIN every single time they try to pay with their watch (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/20/google-wallet-wear-os-pin-pay/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). This is different from before, where just a tap did the trick. Unless your device figures out it&apos;s far enough from your body, it&apos;s not going to bug you for a PIN.</p><p>Wear OS smartwatches already make you set up a PIN for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> security, so this new pop-up for every tap seems like a bit much, especially on those tiny screens.</p><p>Since it seems like only a few users are getting hit with this new prompt, there are a couple of things that might be going down, as noted by 9to5. Maybe Google is testing out this feature on a select few watches. Or, it could be a glitch in the app. Or, Google might be slowly introducing the PIN requirement to everyone, one watch at a time.</p><p>Google recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-verification-change">made phone users re-verify their Wallet information</a> after a few minutes. So, it&apos;s possible the company is doing something similar for Wear OS, which definitely removes the convenience you get with those speedy wrist taps.</p><p>However, the updated Google Wallet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12059519" target="_blank">support page</a> doesn&apos;t even mention smartwatches, hinting that this new authentication requirement might not be on purpose.</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s important to remember that this could be a security improvement Google is testing (even if it is a bit annoying), assuming this new feature is indeed heading to smartwatches.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update"><span>Update</span></h2>
<p>Google told Android Central via email that it is working on fixing the problem with Google Wallet&apos;s tap-to-pay feature on Wear OS, where it keeps asking users to enter a PIN for each transaction.</p><p>"We are aware of an issue that requires a small number of Wallet users to re-enter their PIN in order to make a payment from their Wear OS device, and we are working to address the issue," a Google spokesperson said. "There is no new authentication requirement for Wear OS users."</p><p>The company also clarified that this issue isn&apos;t connected to the recent changes it made, which now require Wallet users on Android phones to authenticate their device before making a payment through Google Wallet.</p>

<hr>
<p>Swedish EV (electric vehicle) maker Polestar has debuted its first smartphone aimed at the Chinese market.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-23/polestar-joins-ev-tech-crossover-with-made-for-china-smartphone">Bloomberg</a>, Polestar debuted the new phone at an event in Beijing, China, ahead of an auto show it plans to attend. The move appears to be part of a technological shift between automakers and smartphone OEMs.</p><p>Polestar states that its device is the culmination of work between its team in Gothenburg, Sweden, and China&apos;s smartphone manufacturer, Xingji Meizu Group.</p><p>Xingji Meizu&apos;s chief executive officer, Shen Ziyu, noted that the move was something of a "defensive measure due to Huawei and Xiaomi starting to make cars" and that the phone is the result of a shift as the "auto industry incorporates more intelligent technologies and consumer electronics."</p><p>The Swedish company states its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polestar.cn/zh-cn/polestar-phone/">Polestar Phone</a>" is its first "AI-designed flagship phone" for Chinese consumers. The device features a 6.7-inch display with a 21:9 aspect ratio and an 1250 nits of peak brightness. Powering the device is Qualcomm&apos;s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC.</p><p>The device&apos;s AI features include image generation, image search, and text summaries.</p>

<p>On the back, the Polestar Phone provides a vertical triple camera setup. Consumers will discover a 50MP primary lens with OIS (optical image stabilization), a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 10MP telephoto lens. The front contains a 32MP punch-hole selfie lens.</p><p>A 5,050mAh battery will keep the lights on throughout the day, with support for 50W Super Wireless charging. Additionally, consumers can pack up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care">UFS 4.0</a> storage in the Polestar Phone.</p><p>Elsewhere, the company teases a strong marriage between the phone and its EVs. Polestar has equipped the device with software developed based on Meizu&apos;s "Flyme Auto." Polestar states this will create a "seamless interconnection between mobile phones and cars."</p><p>Moreover, this pairing allows messages, calls, music, and videos to be displayed on a Polestar vehicle&apos;s dashboard while driving. The device&apos;s "Polestar Link" functionality lets users utilize their phone as a UWB digital car key. </p><p>The Polestar Phone starts at 7,388 yuan in China, which is roughly $1,019.</p>

<p>Polestar&apos;s entrance into the smartphone space may seem odd; however, other Chinese makers like Nio Inc. have done the same. More importantly, smartphone OEMs like Huawei and Xiaomi have gone the opposite way, entering the EV industry with their own cars. Similarly, Waymo, owned by Google&apos;s parent company, Alphabet, operates an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/automotive/waymo-uber-partnership-announcement">array of self-driving cars</a>.</p><p>Polestar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://media.polestar.com/global/en/media/pressreleases/677700/polestar-announces-global-volumes-for-the-fourth-quarter-including-a-strong-start-to-polestar-4-deli">reported in January</a> that its EV sales have hit a slump. Polestar missed its 60,000 vehicle sales projection as it tallied 54,000 by the end of Q4 2023.</p><p>Additionally, the publication notes that Polestar is cutting 450 people to help cover its losses.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>New information reveals the first possible handsets to feature flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 SoC.</li><li>The Xiaomi 15 and 15 Pro will be the first, followed by OnePlus 13 and iQOO 13.</li><li>The Oryon CPU chipset will likely debut at the Snapdragon Summit in October 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Xiaomi has often been among the first OEMs to first debut Qualcomm&apos;s latest flagship chipset, like the Xiaomi 14, which was announced during the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 launch. According to new information, the same is likely to happen this year.</p><p>Xiaomi is believed to still hold the rights of the first OEM maker to launch the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> chipset, per the noted tipster Yogesh Brar on X. The new flagship chipset from Qualcomm will most likely be unveiled in the fall of this year at the Snapdragon Summit and make its way first to the Xiaomi 15 series — the successors of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a>. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xiaomi still has the exclusive first launch rights for Snapdragon 8 Gen 4Followed by both OnePlus & iQOOLineup includes Xiaomi 15 / 15 Pro, OnePlus 13, iQOO 13<a href="https://twitter.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1782643566424264712">April 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Presumably, the launch of these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a> from Xiaomi will happen during Q4 of this year if last year&apos;s models are any indication. The launch will perhaps be limited to the Chinese region, later followed by a Xiaomi 15 Ultra model (with the same chipset), the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, in select regions.</p><p>While Xiaomi may get first dibs on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 this year, Brar further shares the line-up of phones that will be among the first to arrive with the new chip. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> is expected to be next in line and could launch by the year&apos;s end or at the early start of next year. It will likely first cater to the Chinese region, followed by a global launch sometime in Q1, 2025.</p><p>Next up would be the iQOO with its iQOO 13, which could also see its China launch in Q4 2024 and global launch early next year. </p>
<p>As for the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, we have some idea of what to expect from the next top-tier processor from Qualcomm. </p><p>The chipset&apos;s possible launch was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">already revealed</a> by Don McGuire, Qualcomm&apos;s CMO, at MWC early this year, and the company has also teased the incorporation of Oryon CPUs for the first time, which is expected to boost performance significantly over the current Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Likewise, some benchmark leaks have already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-early-benchmarks">showcased</a> the upcoming chipset&apos;s performance ranking, meaning we have a lot to look forward to with Qualcomm&apos;s next-gen chipset.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing&apos;s budget sub-brand could have a smartphone in development as a curious model number appears for certification.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/04/exclusive-nothing-phone-3-is-coming-out-this-summer.html">Android Headlines</a>, a Nothing product with the model number "A015" was spotted in a database under the brand&apos;s manufacturer title. It was originally theorized that the number referred to the Nothing Phone 3; however, the model number doesn&apos;t follow Nothing&apos;s typical internal naming behavior.</p><p>Remember: the Phone 1 featured the "A063" tag while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> had "A065."</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nothing-phone-3-model-number-leaked-expected-launch/">91Mobiles</a> quickly picked up on the appearance of the same model number in the BIS certification database. Curiously, its listing swaps "Nothing Technology Limited" for "CMF by Nothing" under the brand category.</p><p>This discovery seemingly reduces the chance of the A015 device representing the Phone 3 to (almost) zero. Aside from the supposed model number, the product&apos;s specifications and more substantial information were unavailable.</p><p>There&apos;s a chance that this model number refers to a completely different product. So, it&apos;d be best to take this rumor with caution.</p>

<p>CMF by Nothing is the London-based company&apos;s sub-brand that tries to merge style at a lower cost. The brand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cmf-by-nothing-buds-pro-watch-pro-announced">debuted</a> last September as it launched the Buds Pro, Watch Pro, and a 65W GaN charging adapter. It&apos;ll be interesting to see if this CMF by Nothing smartphone rumor holds water — and where such a device would fit.</p><p>Nothing debuted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> early in April as a budget option nestled right below the capabilities of the Phone 2. The device diverged from Qualcomm&apos;s chipset in favor of MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 7200 Pro. The phone launched in the UK, India, and other regions, leaving the U.S. out of the loop.</p><p>Current speculations are that CMF by Nothing&apos;s phone would become available in specific countries, similar to Phone 2a, to avoid self-competition.</p><p>While this rumor seemingly turns us away from the Phone 3, a recent report purported to have some details on the chipset powering the Phone 3. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-qualcomm-chip-price-rumors">report claimed</a> that the Phone 3 would lean on Qualcomm&apos;s latest flagship chip variant: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>. The rumor added that Nothing could increase the price of its upcoming phone, which could put it at roughly $540 in the U.S. if true.</p>

<p>Best Buy is no stranger to great Android phone deals, but they just quietly launched a limited-time Spring Sale that deserves some particular attention. There hasn&apos;t been a lot of pomp surrounding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c">the Best Buy sale</a> just yet, but I&apos;m noticing some major price drops on AC favorites like the Samsung Galaxy S24 series, the Google Pixel 8 Pro, and many others. In other words, if you want to beat the crowds, keep reading: I&apos;ve gathered a selection of my favorite offers below. </p><p>In addition to good old-fashioned discounts, it&apos;s worth noting that many Best Buy deals also include free stuff like streaming services and additional savings when you activate a device or trade in. I&apos;ll make note of those goodies whenever they&apos;re available. How long will these Android phone deals last? It&apos;s hard to know for sure, but I wouldn&apos;t wait too long. It&apos;s also worth noting that Amazon appears to be matching Best Buy&apos;s prices at every turn, so if something is sold out, use our <strong>Price checker</strong> to see where you should go next.  </p>

<hr>
<p>It&apos;s been a long road for smart display glasses, but Rokid seems to have finally cracked the code. The company just announced Rokid AR Lite, a new product that encompasses two separate products into one sleek package: Rokid Max 2 smart display glasses and the Rokid Station 2 compute module.</p><p>Rokid Max 2 glasses include a new display that&apos;s capable of wider FoV, creating a virtual 300-inch screen at what looks like 6 meters away. The glasses include a motion mode that keeps this screen stable even during airplane turbulence, helping to reduce motion-induced dizziness. Rokid Max 2 comes equipped with what the company called "ultra-light air nose pads" and soft, bendable temples.</p><p>However, the real innovation here is the Intelligent Interpupillary Distance Adjustment (IPD) adjustment system. My biggest comfort problem with nearly all existing smart display glasses is that there&apos;s no way to adjust the spacing between the lenses, a basic necessity in assuring long-term comfort on VR headsets.</p><p>Everyone&apos;s eyes are spaced apart a little differently, and the wrong spacing between the glasses&apos; lenses can cause dizziness and eye discomfort. Rokid isn&apos;t using a physical IPD slider though. Rather, the company will have software IPD adjustment so you can move things around as needed. Hopefully, this will fix the cropping issue seen around the edges of the display on other smart glasses, too.</p><p>Additionally, Rokid Max 2 ships with non-destructive diopter adjustment for near-sighted individuals. Some other glasses have this — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/smart-glasses-mwc-2024">Viture One</a>, for instance — but having this ensures that more folks can comfortably use these glasses without having to outfit them with a special pair of prescription lenses. That, combined with the IPD adjustment, should make these the most comfortable smart display glasses ever made.</p>

<p>The Rokid Station 2 is part of the Rokid AR Lite package, an upgraded version of the compute module Rokid previously shipped. Companies like Xreal have shipped similar products, but Rokid Station 2 looks like a substantial upgrade in several ways.</p><p>Rokid Station 2 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and runs the company&apos;s proprietary YodaOS-Master operating system. It&apos;s got a 5,000mAh battery inside, dual USB-C ports, and supports 18W charging. Rokid Station 2&apos;s top acts as a touchpad, capable of being used like a mousepad when placed flat on a surface. Additionally, the unit ships with 3DoF sensors, which can be used as a pointer remote for quick navigation.</p><p>Rokid Station 2 enables multiscreen mode and spatial screen casting so you can run multiple windows in 3D virtual space as if you had a set of monitors floating in front of you. This should enable use of your favorite apps and services without needing native apps, as you should be able to connect your computer or phone. The original Rokid Station ran Android TV, but we&apos;re not yet sure what Rokid Station 2 uses. We&apos;ve reached out to Rokid and will update this article when we find out.</p><p>The company is launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.rokid.com/pages/rokid-ar-lite">Rokid AR Lite Kickstarter campaign</a> soon where we&apos;ll find out pricing and a tentative release date. The company offers a slew of goodies for "pioneer" investors for $9.90 on its website, including a T-shirt, badge, priority shipping, VIP group service, and offline priority experience.</p>

<ul><li>Android already has an accessibility feature called "extra dim" that allows your phone's display to get dimmer than usual. </li><li>Now, with Android 15, Google appears to be working on an "even dimmer" option that might make it easier to use your phone at lower brightness levels than are usually possible.</li><li>While the "extra dim" feature needs to be set each time you want to use it, the new "even dimmer" feature might affect Android's inbuilt Adaptive brightness setting. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android 15 might give you more control over your phone&apos;s minimum brightness, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-even-dimmer-3436221/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> spotted in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">Android 15 Beta 1</a> code. A new setting is referenced in code strings called "even dimmer," and this is related to your phone&apos;s brightness settings. Android already has an option called "extra dim" which needs to be manually enabled each time you want to use it. </p><p>Unfortunately, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> don&apos;t give you full control over your smartphone&apos;s brightness level. You can set preferences like Adaptive brightness or adjust the actual brightness slider; however, phones are still bound by minimum and maximum brightness settings set by the manufacturer. In many cases, these minimums don&apos;t match the actual lowest brightness level your phone&apos;s display panel is capable of. </p><p>This could change with the newly discovered setting. According to the report, the option will be located below the Adaptive brightness toggle on the Display page of the Android 15 settings app. This setting isn&apos;t actually visible in the current version of the Android 15 beta, though, so the functionality of "even dimmer" isn&apos;t certain yet. In the code strings, Google says the feature will "allow the device to go dimmer than usual."</p><p>An alternate explanation Android Authority found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">Android Open Source Project</a> flag related to "even dimmer" says that it will be used "for extending the brightness below [the] traditional range."</p>

<p>Based on the way the feature is described, the folks at Android Authority think that "even dimmer" might be functionally different than "extra dim." While the "extra dim" option is a manual setting that needs to be intentionally used every time you need a really dim phone display, the "even dimmer" choice could affect the Adaptive brightness settings. In practice, this means users could set and forget this toggle in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> settings app. </p><p>The AOSP description seems to support this theory, as the phrase "extending the range" of your phone&apos;s brightness suggests that the brightness levels are still variable.</p><p>However, this is all just speculation, so we&apos;ll have to wait for future beta releases of Android 15 that may include this feature in a working capacity. If it does indeed appear in the final Android 15 release, "even dimmer" would make your Android phone easier on the eyes in dark lighting situations, although depending on how it works, it could be a headache for people with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>.</p>
