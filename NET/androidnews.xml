<p>The cat&apos;s finally out of the bag with the squeaky new Pixel 9 family of smartphones. Google gave us not two, not three, but four new flagship phones in one go. That&apos;s quite a lot to process. While our final verdict is still pending, it&apos;s easy to say that the Pixel 9 series gets a lot right. There are plenty of upgrades and AI magic to make the devices enticing for anyone. Yet, despite all that, there&apos;s one problem with the Pixel 9 series that bums me out, and it has to do with the pink color option.</p><p>I won&apos;t lie; the biggest draw for me was purely superficial at first. My inner Elle Woods screamed in dignified delight when the leaks first showcased a pink Pixel. To top it off, it turned out to be an all-pink lineup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> with pink accessories to match! How can a girl say no to that?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HdM9m3JvCLfJq2LSvZT75d" name="Elle_Woods-google-pixel-9-pink-2.jpg" alt="Elle Woods holding a Pixel 9 in Peony wearing all pink to match the pink phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HdM9m3JvCLfJq2LSvZT75d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that we know for sure that three of the four Pixel 9 models come in pink, all I needed to decide was which model to buy. To me, Rose Quartz is the most interesting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-google-pixel-9-pro-or-9-pro-xl-should-you-buy">shade of the upper-tier Pixel 9 Pro</a> series, followed by the deeper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-google-pixel-9-should-you-buy">Peony hue of the basic Pixel 9</a>. The Pixel 9 Pro stood out as the obvious choice since it has practically no other difference compared to the 9 Pro XL in any aspect other than size. I prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">smaller phones</a> as they&apos;re easier to use one-handed.</p><p>My mind was pretty much made up about bumping my Pixel 8 over to the 9 Pro, but that&apos;s when I ran into an unexpected problem. When I&apos;m looking to buy a phone, naturally, I value other specs as well. Storage is a very important factor, especially because Pixels are famously superior photographers. So it was shocking to me that Google does not offer the Pixel 9 Pro or the 9 Pro XL in Rose Quartz with more than 256GB of storage.</p><p>That&apos;s a major roadblock for me because I&apos;ve already got around 200GB of images and videos on my current phone. If I were to upgrade to 256GB — not all of which is usable — I&apos;d run out of space on my brand-new phone in a few short months. It&apos;s not like I can use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">nice microSD card</a> to fix that issue, seeing as most flagships like the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL have ditched expandable storage slots.</p>

<p>Even with the underwhelming performance of the Tensor G4 and the stuttering fingerprint sensor, I was onboard with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. The cameras and the Pixel UI are what I was willing to pay for, and of course, the sweet coat of pink paint. All things considered, storage simply isn&apos;t something I can compromise on.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> is one possible solution here, offering additional online storage and a few bonus features for a monthly or yearly fee. However, this requires you to be connected to the internet at all times. Additionally, relying on a cloud storage solution also means that any of the files that don&apos;t fit on your Pixel will have to be stored in the cloud fully, with no on-device availability. In areas with poor or no connectivity, this is a big drawback.</p>

<p>I don&apos;t know why Google passed on a 512GB option for the pink Pixel 9 phones, but based on experience and my gut, I&apos;m assuming it&apos;s because someone doubted the popularity of this color. When a brand doesn&apos;t have enough confidence in color, they don&apos;t offer larger storage options for it because it assumes that the demand will be low. I reached out to Google for clarification regarding color and storage options but did not get a response in time for publication. I will update the article if I hear back.</p><p>But let&apos;s be honest, 256GB doesn&apos;t cut it anymore. Each colorway should have enough storage to last for a phone that&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">promised seven years of upgrades</a>. Samsung offers more than twice as many colorways on its phones, and you can go as high as 1TB on many of them. If Samsung can do it, why can&apos;t Google?</p>

It&apos;s a new app powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-need-to-try-googles-imagefx-ai-image-generator">Google&apos;s Imagen 3 model</a>, giving users the ability to generate impressive images on-device just by typing in descriptive prompts. That includes being able to render text pretty accurately, something that seemed difficult for text-to-image models until now.</p><p>The idea is to create fun or interesting images straight from your phone, either from scratch or by using any of the samples present in the app. If you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series phone, you&apos;ll have access to this feature out of the box without needing to subscribe to any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> subscription. Here&apos;s how you can get started creating your own images with Pixel Studio.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-use-pixel-studio"><span>How to use Pixel Studio</span></h3>
<p>1. Open the app and follow the prompt to <strong>download the AI model</strong>. Once downloaded, you can scroll through the app to view the different example images, with different categories presented at the top.</p><p>2a. <strong>Select an image</strong>, then <strong>tap the</strong> <strong>text field</strong> to edit the prompt and begin changing it to your liking.</p><p>2b. When you&apos;re done, <strong>tap the checkmark</strong> and wait for the updated image to generate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.37%;"><img id="QdRaNpxVJVAK6qJF79bqXD" name="Using-Pixel-Studio-1.jpg" alt="Using Pixel Studio to edit an existing image generation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QdRaNpxVJVAK6qJF79bqXD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2524" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>3. Alternatively, you can also create your own image from scratch by tapping the <strong>Create button</strong> on the main <strong>Pixel Studio home screen</strong>. Once an image is generated, you can press the <strong>circular arrow button</strong> at the bottom to regenerate an image. If you&apos;ve generated multiple images from the same prompt, you&apos;ll be able to scroll back to see what you&apos;ve already generated.</p><p>4. You can change the style of the image by <strong>tapping the middle icon</strong> in the text field. You can also add stickers, add captions, or edit images by tapping the <strong>Stickers and tools</strong> button at the bottom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.37%;"><img id="n72saUJW8vY8ut7oWz9jCH" name="Using-Pixel-Studio-2.jpg" alt="Using Pixel Studio to generate a new image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n72saUJW8vY8ut7oWz9jCH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2524" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>5. Once you&apos;ve generated an image you like, you can select from the options in the top right corner to: copy the image, share it, download it, or delete it.</p><p>6. From the main <strong>Pixel Studio home page</strong>, tap the <strong>folder icon</strong> in the top left corner to access your previous creations.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.37%;"><img id="r8JrC65HjRjXALoA4mFhKF" name="Using-Pixel-Studio-3.jpg" alt="Viewing your image generations in Pixel Studio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r8JrC65HjRjXALoA4mFhKF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2524" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You also have the option to import your own images for editing, although this function is much more limited, as it only lets you move or erase objects and add captions or stickers.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-reporting-bad-pixel-studio-image-generations"><span>Reporting bad Pixel Studio image generations</span></h3>
<p>1. Tap the <strong>three dots</strong> in the text field bar.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Bad generation</strong>.</p><p>3. <strong>Fill out the form</strong> by choosing a reason you selected the image as bad and provide any additional feedback in the text field. <strong>Tap the check mark box</strong> at the bottom to agree to send a copy of the image and related content (i.e., the text prompt) to Google.</p>

<h2 id="pixel-studio-is-a-work-in-progress-2">Pixel Studio is a work in progress</h2>
<p>Pixel Studio is intended to be a fun feature that allows a user&apos;s imagination to run wild. However, given that this is a preview, it&apos;s important to note that the results won&apos;t always be perfect. The company notes that it is working on the ability to generate humans. It also warns that Pixel Studio "might misinterpret your prompt" and that you should be as specific as possible.</p><p>Additionally, while Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15236074?visit_id=638599394150771349-2108561604&p=pixel_studio_restrictions&rd=1#image-restrictions">safeguards</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy">in place</a> to help keep Pixel Studio from generating potentially offensive content, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-not-the-only-way-to-create-unhinged-ai-photos" target="_blank">some things may slip through the cracks</a>. Google is continuously working to address this with the app, but fortunately, you can rate individual generations and report ones you think are bad for whatever reason. This way, Google can better filter out certain types of content from being generated in Pixel Studio.</p>

Despite Google completely overhauling the design of its second-generation foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold does not support the use of a stylus.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="no-stylus-support-here-2">No stylus support here</h2>
<p>Although it was a bit of a long shot, there was still hope that the original Pixel Fold would offer the ability to use the phone with a stylus. That same sentiment held true after rumors began picking up that Google was working on a new iteration of its book-style foldable phone.</p><p>Unfortunately, Google didn&apos;t answer the call with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, as the company&apos;s latest foldable doesn&apos;t support stylus input. That leaves the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phone</a> for those who want to use a stylus.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/using-oppo-pen-with-oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a> can technically be included, the only way you can acquire a stylus that works is by importing an Oppo Pen from abroad. This is due to the fact that while the OnePlus Open and Oppo Find N3 are practically identical, there&apos;s no official stylus support from the OnePlus side of things.</p><p>That being said, it&apos;s still a bit disappointing to see the Pixel 9 Pro Fold miss out on such a useful capability. However, Google is continuing to put more of a focus on keeping its foldable phones as slim as possible. In order to make its phone compatible with a stylus, the company would have to rely on a different type of digitizer layer.</p><p>For example, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 uses an "active digitizer," which recognizes the tip of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">S Pen Fold Edition</a>. So while we&apos;re talking about extremely thin layers of materials, even making this one change could result in Google needing to take a different approach.</p><p>There is hope for stylus support in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, provided that Google follows a similar path to Samsung. S Pen support didn&apos;t arrive for Samsung&apos;s foldable phones until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a>, but this also required a different type of S Pen to be created and released. With any luck, Google will make similar improvements with its next foldable phone.</p>

<p>After a rather disappointing entrance into the foldable phone space, Google is righting the ship with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The company introduced an all-new design, while packing it full of fun and useful AI features. However, you'll have to look elsewhere if you were hoping to see stylus support added to the mix.</p></p>

POCO decided to limit the F6 Pro to just a few global markets, and the device didn&apos;t make its way to India and most Southeast Asian regions. Instead, POCO offered the F6 as the default option in these countries.</p>

<p>In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO F6 review</a>, I called it one of the best value-focused phones of the year, and that&apos;s down to how affordable it is in India, where it retails for just ₹27,999 ($336). That said, POCO doesn&apos;t quite offer the same value in other regions; the F6 is available for £359 ($457) in the U.K., and that isn&apos;t nearly as enticing.</p><p>Thankfully, there&apos;s a better option available: the F6 Pro. The phone is now down to £449 ($572), and that makes it worthy of consideration if you&apos;re interested in a new mid-ranger. I didn&apos;t use the F6 Pro when it came out, but I switched to it after using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-sunset-dune-hands-on">OnePlus 12R Sunset Dune edition</a>; it didn&apos;t take long to realize that POCO is onto something special with its 2024 flagship.</p><p>The F6 Pro has a much better design than the standard model, and the white color variant in particular looks striking. I don&apos;t usually prefer phones with flat sides, but POCO added beveled edges, and that makes a big difference in daily use. The glass window around the rear camera housing has been a mainstay on POCO phones going back four years now, and it ends up looking elegant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ddDr5r9ex4XT8zjddqd49K" name="poco-f6-pro-12.jpg" alt="POCO F6 Pro home page against white background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ddDr5r9ex4XT8zjddqd49K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO didn&apos;t shortchange users with material choices either; the F6 Pro uses an aluminum frame that&apos;s sandwiched between panes of glass, and it looks just as premium as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> — if anything, I like POCO&apos;s design more. The only drawback in this area is that the phone has IP54 ingress protection, and that isn&apos;t adequate; even the regular F6 gets an IP64 rating, so I&apos;m not really sure what POCO was thinking.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GNMfigPxwZHmyh5zXv9GwM" name="poco-f6-pro-10.jpg" alt="POCO F6 Pro bezels highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNMfigPxwZHmyh5zXv9GwM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than that and an in-screen module that sits a little too low on the screen, there&apos;s nothing to complain about the design; the F6 Pro has ideal weight distribution, and the textured pattern underneath the glass looks fantastic. There&apos;s a lot to like about the panel too; POCO went with a 120Hz AMOLED panel with QHD+ resolution, and it is easily the best screen of any of its devices to date.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CSJrHWKsNu8k8iC6eTfNZM" name="poco-f6-pro-9.jpg" alt="POCO F6 Pro selfie lens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSJrHWKsNu8k8iC6eTfNZM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The panel doesn&apos;t get quite as bright as other mid-rangers I used this year — the 12R is noticeably brighter outdoors — but it is still a strong showing. On that note, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> is absolutely the right call; Qualcomm&apos;s 2024 chipset still has a lot to offer, and it is just as fast in daily use.</p>

<p>Considering that the 12R is also powered by the same silicon, the F6 Pro is on an equal footing. I didn&apos;t see any issues in the week I used the phone as my daily driver, and it handles demanding games with ease; the only tangible gain you&apos;ll see with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-3-vs-8-gen-2-vs-a17-pro-benchmarks">8 Gen 3</a> is better battery life.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eGFpkfkpfhHdZkgn8bJmEL" name="poco-f6-pro-3.jpg" alt="POCO F6 Pro camera module with all sensors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eGFpkfkpfhHdZkgn8bJmEL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s a similar story with the cameras; the F6 Pro manages to take better shots than the F6 in just about every situation, and it holds up incredibly well in low-light scenarios. The 12R has a slender edge in this area, but on the whole, the F6 Pro isn&apos;t far behind.</p><p>That said, the biggest issue with the cameras is that the auxiliary 8MP wide-angle lens isn&apos;t anywhere as good as the main camera, and I still don&apos;t understand why POCO can&apos;t deliver two usable sensors at the back. This is true of the 12R as well, and only Google manages to deliver a mid-ranger with a wide-angle camera that&apos;s actually decent.</p>

<p>POCO didn&apos;t change any software features from the standard F6, and while I still believe that the software is in need of a visual overhaul, it is much better optimized this year. The interface is fluid, there&apos;s a good amount of customizability, and it doesn&apos;t have any annoying bugs. There&apos;s still a lot of bloatware out of the box, and POCO isn&apos;t good at delivering updates on time — these are things it needs to actively change.</p><p>Overall, the F6 Pro is one of the best phones currently available in the mid-range segment. POCO&apos;s decision to not launch the device in most global markets is puzzling; it is the ideal alternative to the OnePlus 12R and Galaxy A55, and with the manufacturer setting lofty goals this year, wider availability of the F6 Pro would have highlighted the brand&apos;s ambition in this segment.</p>

AT&T attributed the issue to a software glitch but has since resolved it.</p><p>There has been a major 911 outage nationwide, with a huge spike in reports popping up on Downdetector around 5:00 PM PST.</p><p>An AT&T spokesperson told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/27/business/att-outage-software-issue-tuesday/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a> that the network carrier had fixed a software glitch that affected some customers’ connections.</p><p>"We apologize for the inconvenience, and we appreciate our customers’ patience as we worked to resolve this issue," the spokesperson added.</p><p>The outage didn’t affect everyone, just a portion of AT&T&apos;s user base, according to the spokesperson. On Tuesday evening, police in Pinole, California, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PinolePD/status/1828602202006737400" target="_blank">warned on social media</a> that some AT&T wireless users might have trouble calling 911, but landlines and other carriers weren’t affected.</p><p>In Florida, Seminole County’s X account <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/seminolecounty/status/1828598590643589293" target="_blank">mentioned</a> a 911 service disruption on Tuesday night. The local government advised residents to use a non-emergency number for urgent issues until things were fixed.</p><p>Downdetector’s report showed that Dallas, Charlotte, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, and New York City had the most AT&T service disruptions in the last 24 hours, as per CNN&apos;s report.</p><p>Details on how many customers were affected and how long the disruption lasted weren’t available. However, by 10:00 PM ET, Downdetector showed that the number of reported incidents was dropping quickly.</p><p>This outage comes right after AT&T’s $950,000 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-settles-att-2023-911-outage-violations-950000" target="_blank">settlement with the Federal Communications Commission</a> over a 911 outage from August 2023.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Pixel 9 Pro XL has big design improvements for durability and repairability, such as the new dual-entry design lets you replace the screen or battery more easily.</li><li>The phone is also tougher now, spreading impact better to protect the screen and back panel.</li><li>A nice touch is the USB-C port on a separate daughterboard, making it simpler to replace.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent teardown of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> by iFixit shows Google’s major upgrades in durability and repairability, showcasing a big leap in its smartphone design, though there are still a few areas that could use some fine-tuning.</p><p>One notable improvement is the dual-entry design, which lets you remove either the display for screen fixes or just the rear panel for battery replacements (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/27/pixel-9-pro-teardown/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>This design also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-durability-test-results">makes the phone tougher</a>, so it handles drops and bumps better by spreading out the impact away from the screen and back panel.</p><p>Even though it’s easy to start taking apart the Pixel 9 Pro XL from the front or rear, the display can get damaged during removal, with some delamination happening. The iFixit team had a tough time getting it off without hurting it. And while the top glass panel is a bit delicate, it’s not too hard to remove.</p><p>There are just a few stickers hiding some screws, but other than that, getting to the battery is pretty straightforward.</p><p>On the other hand, removing the battery from the Pixel 9 Pro XL turned out to be a real struggle. The iFixit team couldn’t get the battery pull tab to work, so they had to forcefully pry it out. It’s a tricky situation also seen with the Pixel 8 Pro.</p><p>On a brighter side, Google has moved the USB-C port to a separate daughterboard, making it easier to replace. This design change allows for smooth removal and replacement of the port, which is great considering how prone USB-C ports are to damage.</p><p>To sum it up, the Pixel 9 Pro XL brings some impressive design upgrades for better repairability and durability. However, there are a few hiccups, like the fragile display and tricky battery pull tab, where Google could have done better.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Telegram founder Pavel Durov has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tribunal-de-paris.justice.fr/sites/default/files/2024-08/2024-08-26%20-%20CP%20TELEGRAM%20.pdf">arrested in France</a> on charges of enabling illegal transactions, failure to provide documents to authorities, complicity in possessing child sexual abuse material and in distributing CSAM, complicity in the distribution of drugs, complicity in organized fraud and money laundering.</p><p>This has naturally created controversy, with many calling it politically motivated, an attack on free speech, and oddly enough, an attack on encrypted messaging. I&apos;m not going to wade into anything about political hit jobs or free speech, but I do have to mention one thing—the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-encryption">encryption</a> argument isn&apos;t really valid because Telegram isn&apos;t always encrypted.</p>
<p>People didn&apos;t realize that every Telegram group message is sent in plain text through a Telegram server and much of it is saved. The French government will have plenty of evidence sitting there for them to look at. </p><p>The only way to use encryption with Telegram is to have a one-on-one messaging session with someone and enable the "Secret Chat" setting. If you don&apos;t do that, it&apos;s not encrypted.</p>
<p>It&apos;s good that people are realizing that their group chats are wide open. It also brings up a couple of other things to consider: do you really care about encrypted messaging, and if you do, which apps are better at it than Telegram?</p><p>The first question is something only you can answer, but I can give you <em>my</em> answer: yes, I care. I&apos;m not worried if someone knows I texted my wife to remind her to bring home a bottle of orange juice when she&apos;s out at the store or that anyone sees me send my grandkids a goofy picture of Snoopy on a jet ski. I just don&apos;t want them to be able to know it unless I tell them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2JerTCzhFTikA2hNMih6cF" name="whatsapp-logo-on-android-wide.jpg" alt="WhatsApp logo on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2JerTCzhFTikA2hNMih6cF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;re probably the same, and most of what you send over a messaging app is nothing you care about. But not always. There are plenty of things we do not want to share with the world, and you know which of those things apply to you. A way to protect your privacy is to only use a messaging app that is end-to-end encrypted, meaning only the intended recipient is able to decode and read it.</p>
<p>What&apos;s easier to talk about is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/telegram-vs-signal-vs-whatsapp">what apps are encrypted</a>. We&apos;ll start with the big ones — SMS and iMessage. SMS (texting) is never encrypted. Ever. Apple&apos;s iMessage is only encrypted if everyone in the message group is using a supported Apple device. This may change with the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-why-imessage-rcs-support-important">iMessage update that supports RCS</a>, depending on how Apple uses the RCS profile (RCS is only encrypted thanks to Google, and both companies need to cooperate). We&apos;ll know soon enough. </p><p>That leaves two really good messaging apps that, thankfully, are encrypted no matter which brand of phone you&apos;re using or how many people are in a group: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://signal.org/blog/private-groups/">Signal</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/820124435853543">WhatsApp</a>. Both apps support end-to-end encryption for one-to-one chats and group messaging by default and work on every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">modern smartphone</a>. You will need to install the app, of course, but there is nothing else for you to do.</p>
<p>While there may be other apps that use encryption properly, I can say I&apos;m sure about these two.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bofWDTwZsaHCH99BmaWcag" name="facebook-messenger-galaxy-active-2.jpg" alt="Facebook Messenger Galaxy Active" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bofWDTwZsaHCH99BmaWcag.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are also two apps to mention: Facebook Messenger and Google Messages. Both might be encrypted, but they might not.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/10252671?hl=en#:~:text=Your%20conversations%20are%20encrypted%20end,your%20individual%20and%20group%20conversations.">Google Messages</a> is like Apple&apos;s iMessage: if all parties in the chat are using Google&apos;s encrypted RCS, then it works. If not, it defaults to a regular MMS group and is not encrypted.</p><p>Facebook Messenger is a little weird. Chats are encrypted as long as everyone is using Meta&apos;s app or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/1084673321594605">computer with the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser</a>. If someone is using Safari or Opera, for example, encryption is broken.</p><p>It&apos;s also important to remember that social media DMs on services like X or Instagram are not encrypted.</p>
<p>This may or may not be important to you and only you can decide. But at least you know a little about what is and isn&apos;t encrypted just in case.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Chat just got a powerful IFTTT and UKG Flow integration, letting you set up almost all kinds of automations whether you&apos;re on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> or using a personal account.</p><p>With IFTTT, users can now link up Google Chat with over 1,000 popular apps, while UKG Flow brings UKG Pro WFM features straight into Chat for easy employee access, as detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/08/automate-your-workflows-on-google-chat-with-IFTTT-and-UKG-flow.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>IFTTT, which stands for "If This, Then That," is a platform that lets you create custom automations that kick in when certain things happen.</p><p>In Google Chat, IFTTT&apos;s main function is to help users create custom workflows and automate routine tasks seamlessly. With access to over 1,000 apps, it makes Chat way more efficient and personalized, according to Google.</p><p>For instance, you can set up automatic welcome messages for new space members, trigger alerts when files get added to cloud storage like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a>, Dropbox, or Box, and keep track of social media mentions by having tags from Discord, X, and Facebook instantly posted in a space.</p><p>For organizations, this means things run smoother and productivity gets a boost. Automating everyday tasks, like welcome messages, becomes a breeze.</p><p>To dive into IFTTT, just visit its Google Chat integration page and sign in with your Google account. It’s up for grabs now for Google Workspace users, Workspace Individual Subscribers, and anyone with a personal Google account.</p>

<p>Google Chat is also getting UKG Flow support. As the rollout begins, account admins will need to install the app first before it’s available for use across organizations.</p><p>With UKG Flow support, users can now handle tasks like logging in, clocking in and out, and requesting time off right within Google Chat.</p><p>These new integrations are here to make your workday easier by streamlining tasks and cutting out the need to hop between different apps.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>TECNO shows off a new tri-folding phone concept that measures 11mm when folded.</li><li>The phone has a 6.48-inch display when folded and opens up to a 10-inch 3K OLED panel and can by arranged in a number of ways.</li><li>TECNO is also preparing to launch two new foldable phones soon, the Phantom V Fold 2 and V Flip 2.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TECNO is no stranger to interesting concept devices, several of which it showed off earlier this year at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/coolest-things-mwc-2024">MWC 2024</a>. Now, after showing off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-is-the-latest-brand-to-unfurl-a-rollable-phone-concept">Phantom Ultimate</a> rollable phone concept, the company is switching things up with the Phantom Ultimate 2, a new tri-fold phone with an impressive and versatile design.</p><p>While we&apos;ve seen tri-fold concepts before, TECNO has implemented some rather impressive engineering to design one that measures just 11mm thick when folded. For reference, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is 12.1mm when its two halves are folded. The thickest part is the section that houses the triple camera system, which also holds the charging port and what looks like a speaker opening.</p><p>To achieve such thinness, TECNO is using a new hinge design that is capable of achieving a thickness of less than 9mm on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. The company also utilizes "the smartphone industry’s thinnest battery cover," measuring just 0.25mm and made of "super-compressed Titan Advanced Fiber material."</p>

<p>When closed, the primary display measures 6.48 inches. The phone then opens to feature a slim frame and a 10-inch 3K OLED panel with a 4:3 aspect ratio. Unfolded, the TECNO Phantom Ultimate 2 looks a lot like an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> but with significantly smaller bezels. However, instead of just being able to fold it completely open, TECNO has implemented various folding angles to bring more versatility to the device.</p><p>In one example, the Ultimate 2 is shown standing up with 1/3 of the phone folded flat on a table and the user typing on it like a regular laptop keyboard. It&apos;s a form aimed at productivity and sort of reminds me of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-yoga-book-9i-gen-9-review" target="_blank">Lenovo Yoga Book 9i</a> with a keyboard at the bottom. Another shows the bottom section folded back in a form that&apos;s seemingly meant for viewing media. A third form shows the phone folded in a tent-like mode, which TECNO says is ideal for scenarios like live dual-screen translation, a feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-october-2023">we see more foldable phones take advantage of</a>.</p><p>TECNO has also optimized the software to take advantage of the form factor, meaning wallpapers will adjust according to how you fold or unfold the phone, and users can take advantage of multi-panel multitasking.</p>

<p>To support all these various folding scenarios, TECNO says both hinges have been tested to support up to 300,000 folds and are enhanced with 2100MPa strength.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is a concept device, so TECNO has not revealed any additional specs in its press release, such as chipset, battery capacity, camera resolutions, and more. It&apos;s also unclear if and when TECNO plans to actually launch the product or one like it. Clearly, something like this wouldn&apos;t be cheap to produce, and TECNO prides itself on developing impressive devices at more affordable prices.</p><p>Speaking of, the company is also gearing up to launch its foldable devices, the Phantom V Fold 2 and Phantom V Flip 2. TECNO did not specify a launch date but says they are "scheduled for release soon." If they&apos;re anything like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-flip-review">previous models</a>, we expect to see great designs and prices that will undercut much of the competition, especially Samsung.</p>
