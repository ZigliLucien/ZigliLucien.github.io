<p>If there's one thing we know for sure, 2024 has been pretty odd when it comes to software updates. Google released its new flagship lineup of phones before Android 15 was out, Apple announced a bunch of features that won't arrive until at least March of next year, and we're midway through November with no sign of stable Android 15 for Samsung phones. However, with what little we know about One UI 7, I can't help but wonder if Samsung is following Apple's example in more ways than one, and for better or for worse.</p><p>For years, I abstained from even considering using a Samsung phone. I didn't care how cool or "reliable" Samsung phones were because the software was just so incredibly awful that it ruined everything else for me. However, that all changed once Samsung finally moved away from TouchWiz in favor of One UI.</p><p>Not only was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/touchwiz">TouchWiz</a> packed to the gills with features, but there were more issues than you could count. I'm actually grateful for how bad it was because otherwise, I might not have enjoyed the different offerings from LG, Motorola, HTC, and Google. Heck, if it weren't for Samsung, I might not even be sitting here writing these words.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GzB57RWu3DeXXxZ5ETmAUc" name="s3-new-3.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 in-hand unlocked on the Home Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzB57RWu3DeXXxZ5ETmAUc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nevertheless, here we are and Samsung is gearing up to release its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-first-beta-to-hit-galaxy-devices-after-november-17-in-us">first beta for One UI 7</a>. Although it has been a little over six years since One UI was originally unveiled, it shares one commonality with TouchWiz as Samsung still takes an "everything but the kitchen sink" approach to features.</p><p>I'm not expecting Samsung to really add any "game-changing" features to the mix, but it does seem as though a UI overhaul is in store. With the exception of a few differences here and there, One UI has largely remained the same since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-one-ui-40-android-12">One UI 4</a> in 2021. This was based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a>, which introduced the Material You design language.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Although Material You arrived with One UI 4, it didn't really get fully implemented until One UI 5.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Samsung's implementation with One UI 4 was half-baked, to say the least, but the company rectified those issues with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-5-review">One UI 5</a>. That puts us at about two years of using the same general software experience, meaning that we're definitely due for something new.</p><p>Most of the time, I don't really care about how the software looks on any phone, not just Samsung. However, given that it's taken Samsung this long to actually release the beta of One UI 7, I've grown a bit worried that we might be in store for a bit of a storm.</p><p>It really wasn't all that long ago that Samsung was considered among the worst companies when it comes to software updates. That's changed in recent years, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> receiving updates faster than any other phone besides Google's Pixel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1073px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.92%;"><img id="53xsrHgfAhYnTg8D9Lvd7d" name="one-ui-7-quick-settings-panel-sdc-2024-demo.jpg" alt="Samsung had a demo of One UI 7 on an S24 Ultra, which showed off its revamped Quick Settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/53xsrHgfAhYnTg8D9Lvd7d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1073" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can't help but feel like there's a little bit of writing on the wall with the One UI 7 update, considering the beta has already been delayed several times. And if it weren't for a few leaky faucets, we wouldn't have any idea what to expect.</p><p>That being said, we're likely to see Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">overhaul everything</a> and anything, ranging from icons and widgets to "smoother animations" and even a new Quick Settings panel. I've seen some suggestions that Samsung is trying to make One UI a bit more like iOS, especially when it comes to animations.</p><p>While I agree that animations could be better, I could really care less about whether the software <em>looks</em> like the Android equivalent of an iPhone. Why? Because I'm just going to download <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-good-lock-module-customization-update-spotted">Good Lock</a>, a few icon packs, and make my phone look the way I want it to anyway.</p><p>No, the bigger problem here is that Samsung is also rumored to be taking another page out of Apple's book, but it's not a good one. Instead of announcing features when they're ready, Samsung might announce its latest batch of features, only to delay some of them until One UI 7.1.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="TspK8cw2ucPMRV64qWaxHQ" name="apple-intelligence-prompt-imore.jpg" alt="Apple Intelligence prompt on iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TspK8cw2ucPMRV64qWaxHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Apple introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16</a> series, the company also leaned heavily into the "Apple Intelligence" aspect. Of course, this was just a part of the company's initial marketing push, but there was one problem — many of those features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/has-apple-lost-its-touch-as-android-innovation-grows">weren't available yet</a>.</p><p>In fact, there are some that we're still waiting for, as Image Playground and ChatGPT integration with Siri is currently only available if you're using the iOS 18.2 beta. Meanwhile, the <em>really cool</em> features, such as Personalized Responses and On-Screen Awareness, aren't expected to arrive until March 2025.</p><p>So without even knowing everything that Samsung has up its sleeve for new features, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it doesn't travel down this same path. If we are indeed getting an overhauled UI, that's plenty for Samsung to hang its hat on and promote. Then, the company can properly announce its AI features after they are fully baked and ready for primetime.</p><p>Some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">rumored AI features</a> include things such as "AI Notification," which summarizes your notifications. It has also been said that Samsung will introduce new options for its existing AI features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:694px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:86.46%;"><img id="g5R7Ra2k3tyXsbBdLpxQf6" name="one-ui-7-rumored-lock-screen-enhanced-notifications-example" alt="One UI 7 is rumored to debut an "enhanced lock screen" and other "smart management" tools for alerts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g5R7Ra2k3tyXsbBdLpxQf6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="694" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given the constant need for companies to figure out ways to get AI into headlines, I suspect that Samsung won't take the reserved approach. Instead, it will likely make the same mistakes as Apple, which could be pretty comical if One UI ends up looking like iOS.</p><p>I don't have a crystal ball and can't see what the future holds, so it's possible that I'm completely off base. Maybe Samsung delayed the release of One UI 7 so that it could release <em>everything</em> at once. Or maybe the plan all along was to release the final version alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>, but the lack of transparency and communication has let our imaginations go wild.</p><p>At the same time, I'm a bit worried that Samsung is about to revert back to its old ways when it comes to software updates. Samsung may try to do too much, which would result in delayed updates and half-baked promises.</p><p>Let's just hope it doesn't come to that and that this is just a blip on the radar.</p>

<ul><li>Google quietly started rolling out the first Google TV Streamer update with "other bug fixes and performance improvements."</li><li>However, users quickly noticed a new manual audio output format option in the TV Streamer's settings following the update.</li><li>Aside from the default <strong>Automatic</strong> format, users can now select <strong>Dolby Digital Plus</strong>, <strong>Dolby Digital</strong>, or <strong>PCM Stereo</strong>.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a>, a long-awaited successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast">Chromecast</a> with Google TV 4K, finally launched in September. Now, it's receiving its first OTA update, as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/15/google-tv-streamer-audio-format-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. The update's release notes are extremely light on details; in fact, Google's official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/7124014#zippy=%2Ccurrent-production-firmware-version" target="_blank">changelog</a> still lists the current TV Streamer version as <strong>UTT3.240625.001.K5</strong>, which was the original zero-day release.</p><p>Regardless, users are starting to see the new version <strong>UTT3.240625.001.K9</strong> appear for their Google TV Streamer. The update is roughly 35MB in size, and requires two steps to apply it, plus a restart. As for the update's contents, Google only shares that the new version includes "other bug fixes and performance improvements."</p><p>There is at least one significant change to the Google TV Streamer's software following the tiny update, though. As 9to5Google notes, the update brings a new settings menu that will let users pick a manual audio output format. This page can be found by navigating through Settings, selecting <strong>Audio options</strong>, and scrolling down to <strong>Output format</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oSCNoksGQT3qCR4JMPRpUV" name="TV-Streamer-Audio-Options" alt="New audio output settings on Android TV 14." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oSCNoksGQT3qCR4JMPRpUV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/15/google-tv-streamer-audio-format-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By default, the TV Streamer's audio output format will be set to <strong>Automatic</strong>. "Your system will choose the best audio quality format available," the screen explains. "You may need to power cycle your Google TV Streamer for a settings change to take effect."</p><p>Aside from the Automatic mode, the update adds manual selection of the <strong>Dolby Digital Plus</strong>, <strong>Dolby Digital</strong>, or <strong>PCM Stereo</strong> formats. It's worth noting that some users have reported seeing this menu on day one of owning their Google TV Streamer, so perhaps this update simply brings the experience to all users.</p><p>While this feature addition is welcomed by audiophiles and home theater fans, there still may be work to do for Google. Unlike the Chromecast with Google TV, the new Google TV Streamer does not support audio passthrough. Additionally, some TV Streamer owners are looking for a way to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-audio-review">Nest speakers</a> as a default audio output for their new set-top box.</p>

<p>Google will stop serving political <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-search-ads-video-function-update">advertisements</a> to users in the European Union ahead of new regulations taking effect in October 2025, the company announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/political-advertising-in-eu/" target="_blank">blog post</a> Thursday, Nov. 14. Google says the EU's upcoming Regulation on Transparency and Targeting of Political Advertising (TTPA) introduces "new operational challenges and legal uncertainties for political advertisers and platforms." As such, it is pulling political ads from the region altogether, and paid political YouTube promotions will be disallowed as well.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/03/11/eu-introduces-new-rules-on-transparency-and-targeting-of-political-advertising/" target="_blank">According to the European Union</a>, there are three main aspects of the TTPA. First, every political advertisement must have transparency labels that are easily accessible. These labels must clearly explain the advertisement's "sponsor, the election or referendum to which they are linked, the amounts paid, and any use of targeting techniques."</p><p>Additionally, the TTPA's regulation will significantly restrict the types of targeted advertising that can be used for political content, and when they can be used. The person seeing the ads must have given "explicit and separate consent" for not only the data's collection, but its collection and use specifically for the purposes of political targeted advertising. Some types of data, like racial or ethnic origin and political opinions, cannot be used for targeting at all.</p><p>Finally, the TTPA will ban third-country sponsors from political advertising three months before an election or referendum in the EU.</p><p>Google takes exception with the scope of the TTPA and some of the regulation's specifics, starting with the definition of a political advertisement itself.</p><p>"The TTPA defines political advertising so broadly that it could cover ads related to an extremely wide range of issues that would be difficult to reliably identify at scale," said Annette Kroeber-Riel, Google's vice president of government affairs and public policy for Europe, in the blog post. "There is also a lack of reliable local election data permitting consistent and accurate identification of all ads related to any local, regional or national election across any of 27 EU Member States. And key technical guidance may not be finalized until just months before the regulation comes into effect."</p><p>Those are the company's reasons for ending political advertising in the EU, including a ban on paid political <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube">YouTube</a> promotions. Google says the measures will take effect sometime in 2025, and will share more information later. It adds that the company has already taken similar steps in Canada, Brazil, and France following regulation.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's latest app on the Play Store wants to lock down your chats and keep Android devices safe from cyber threats like scams and hacks.</p><p>Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-system-key-verifier-3499353/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> reports that the Android System Key Verifier app just rolled out with last week’s Google Play System update.

<p>As per Rahman, the app probably taps into the Contact Keys feature, similar to Contact Key Verification on iOS. Basically, it’ll give you a heads-up in Apple Messages if an unfamiliar device connects to one of your contacts.</p><p>At the moment, no apps can use the Key Verifier, but the Play Store <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.contactkeys&pcampaignid=web_share" target="_blank">listing</a> gives a look at how it works. The app operates in two main steps. First, it stores encryption keys for messaging apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a>, ensuring conversations stay protected with end-to-end encryption.</p><p>Second, it lets users confirm contacts by exchanging QR codes. When adding a new contact, both people can scan each other's QR codes to verify they’re chatting with the right person.</p><p>Down the line, if a different device is used, the keys won’t line up. This could mean the person you're talking to isn’t actually who they say they are—or they might just be on a new device, which would need a quick QR code scan to confirm.</p><p>Right now, the Android System Key Verifier’s on its own, but it looks like Google might mix it into Messages next year. Google started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">working on a contact verification feature for Messages last month</a>, set for a 2025 release. So, it’s likely that the Key Verifier app is a step toward that integration.</p>

<h2 id="you-get-the-latest-internals-2">You get the latest internals</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like most other 2025 Android phones, the OnePlus 13 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Obviously, there&apos;s a lot of excitement in the latest Qualcomm platform given the sizeable upgrades — including the custom cores — and it will be interesting to see how these hold up in daily use.</p><p>The OnePlus 12 is no slouch in this regard, but the OnePlus 13 should deliver meaningful gains. That said, it remains to be seen if you&apos;ll actually be able to use the hardware to its potential; OxygenOS throttles most games to 60fps, so even if the hardware theoretically allows 120fps gaming, the software needs additional tweaks.</p><p>Although the rest of the hardware is relatively unchanged, you get other niceties, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 dust and water resistance</a>. While IP68 is still great, the new standard safeguards against water jets in addition to submersion, making the device that much more resilient. </p>
<h2 id="it-should-take-even-better-photos-2">It should take even better photos</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="quDzk7qjpypqXDWpK2ThqW" name="OnePlus-13" alt="OnePlus 13 back camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/quDzk7qjpypqXDWpK2ThqW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 uses the same 50MP f/1.6 main camera as last year, and that&apos;s not a bad thing at all. The sensor is clearly among the best around, and we should get better photos and videos with improved tuning.</p><p>What I&apos;m excited about is the auxiliary cameras; the OnePlus 13 has 50MP wide-angle and telephoto cameras, and they&apos;re the same as the ones on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppos-answer-to-the-galaxy-s25-is-launching-globally-on-november-21">Find X8 Pro</a>. That should give the device a considerable edge; while I generally like the OnePlus 12, its auxiliary lenses don&apos;t quite measure up, so it&apos;s good to see that changing this year.</p>
<h2 id="there-apos-s-a-massive-battery-2">There&apos;s a massive battery</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LK6ZtRVbAb4To3UytPsuiY" name="oneplus-13-official-01" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LK6ZtRVbAb4To3UytPsuiY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the biggest changes with the OnePlus 13 is the battery size. The phone features a massive 6000mAh battery, and what&apos;s interesting is that OnePlus is using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon battery tech</a>. The battery uses a silicon-based anode, and this allows better density, allowing the brand to use a bigger battery without increasing the size of the device.</p><p>As a result, even though the OnePlus 13 has a battery that&apos;s 500mAh larger, it is thinner and 7g lighter than the OnePlus 12, and that&apos;s a big deal. The silicon-carbon tech also has better durability, and that should be noticeable after two to three years of use. You still get 100W charging tech, but the charging time is slightly longer as the device is using a single 6000mAh cell this time.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-shouldn-apos-t-wait-x2014-the-oneplus-12-has-a-better-design-2">Why you shouldn&apos;t wait — the OnePlus 12 has a better design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GnPze5fyzHuLY7FMUtPGNY" name="oxygenos-15-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 with OxygenOS 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GnPze5fyzHuLY7FMUtPGNY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 clearly has a lot going for it, and while I&apos;m looking forward to testing the device, I&apos;m not a fan of the new design. OnePlus phones have always followed a similar design aesthetic — going all the way back to the OnePlus 3 — that was characterized by smooth curves and a "horizon line" that made the devices great to hold and use.</p><p>But the OnePlus 13 switches to a blocky design with flat sides, and that just doesn&apos;t look as exciting to me. The renders suggest that the device has beveled edges, so it won&apos;t be as uncomfortable to hold as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, but it still doesn&apos;t have the same elegance as the OnePlus 12.</p>
<h2 id="the-oneplus-12-is-much-more-affordable-2">The OnePlus 12 is much more affordable</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KP77ktFmGJABimSRhbDnmE" name="oneplus-12-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KP77ktFmGJABimSRhbDnmE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another factor to consider with the OnePlus 13 is that it comes with a noticeable price hike. Although the device should still cost less than the Pixel 9 Pro XL and the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-should-you-wait">Galaxy S25+</a>, there is likely to be a $100 increase over the OnePlus 12 when you account for what the OnePlus 13 is selling for in China.</p><p>That means you may have to pay as much as $899 to get your hands on the device in most global markets. To put things into context, the OnePlus 12 is routinely available for $649, and it will go down to $599 during the upcoming holiday sales window.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 is a better overall device, but is it worth $300 more? I don&apos;t think so at this moment in time. Obviously, I haven&apos;t used the device yet, so I can&apos;t make any qualitative judgement in this regard, but the phone upgrade cycle is such that you don&apos;t get too many noticeable gains year-on-year. </p><p>The OnePlus 13 will be a considerable upgrade if you&apos;re on an older device, but even then, the OnePlus 12 is just as good a choice. If I had to put my own money on the table, I&apos;m picking the OnePlus 12 instead of waiting for the OnePlus 13.</p>

<hr>
<p>The OnePlus 13, fresh off its Chinese launch, just got a new macro feature for its camera through a system update, letting you capture super close-up shots.</p><p>OnePlus announced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5100612069101992" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> users can now dive into macro photography (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-13-gets-a-new-camera-feature-ahead-of-global-launch.918271.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). This means users will be able to hit the “little petal” icon (a standard for macro cameras) in the camera app to start capturing all those tiny details.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-goes-official-in-china">Released in late October</a>, the OnePlus 13 packs a punch with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> SoC, up to 24GB of RAM, and fast charging at 100W wired and 50W wireless—making it a strong contender in next year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphone</a> race.</p><p>OnePlus' latest flagship has been exclusive to China, but executives have confirmed a global launch is just around the corner. So, the new macro photography feature is a great addition ahead of its worldwide debut.</p><p>While the exact date for the phone's global unveiling is still under wraps, rumors hint at a January release, possibly alongside other OnePlus models, and likely at a higher price than its predecessor.</p><p>While there may be some regional differences, it’s set to impress on the software side.</p><p>The OnePlus 13, developed with Hasselblad, originally came with a triple-camera setup but didn’t support a macro camera feature. The latest update fixes that.</p><p>While the exact lens for macro shots isn’t specified, the OnePlus 13's Hasselblad-powered camera system packs a punch with a 50MP f/1.6 main sensor, a 50MP 3x telephoto lens, and a 50MP f/2.0 ultra-wide sensor. Plus, it has a 32MP selfie camera for top-notch self-portraits.</p><p>The update is rolling out in stages, with all compatible devices expected to get it by November 17. Users can check manually by going to <strong>Settings </strong>> <strong>System and Updates</strong> > <strong>Software Update</strong> or speed things up by selecting the "Apply for trial" option in the update settings.</p>

The app, which became a clone of the carrier's new T-Life app this summer, was recently unlisted from the Google Play Store (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tmo.report/2024/11/the-t-mobile-app-is-finally-dead-time-to-start-your-t-life/" target="_blank">The Mobile Report</a>). While it still appears to be working for users, it's not available for new downloads, and it's unclear how long the T-Mobile app will remain functional.</p><p>The "un-carrier" has slowly made sweeping changes to its mobile apps throughout the year. In January 2024, it rebranded the T-Mobile Tuesdays app — originally the place for rewards and promotions — to T-Life. Eventually, more features and functionality came to the T-Life app, including account management and chat support.</p><p>This summer, the T-Mobile app was essentially a duplicate version of the T-Life app. The two applications even shared the same logo. The carrier began marketing the T-Life app as the new "everything app" for the company, and sent emails to some customers that pushed them to switch. As such, it seemed like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a> was moving away from the original app that first launched in 2012.</p><p>Now that the T-Mobile app is unavailable for download, it would appear that the transition is now complete. T-Mobile USA currently has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=T-Mobile+USA" target="_blank">22 apps on the Google Play Store</a>, but the original is not one of them. The app's most recent update came earlier this month, although it's unclear whether it'll receive any more updates — or when the app might stop working entirely.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to T-Mobile about the future of the T-Mobile app, and we will update this story when we hear back.</p><p>For now, it may be finally time to switch to the T-Life app if you use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-t-mobile-phones">T-Mobile phone</a> and haven't already. All signs point to the former T-Mobile Tuesdays app becoming the so-called "everything app" for the company.</p>

<ul><li>In a recent change, Partner Sharing in the Google Photos app no longer supports photos that originated from a third-party Android app.</li><li>Google confirmed the shift in an update to a support document made sometime in the last month.</li><li>The change seems to also affect unedited screenshots, and Google didn't explain why Partner Sharing now works differently.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Users picked up on a major change to the way Partner Sharing works in Google Photos this month, and now Google confirmed the shift in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/7378858?hl=en" target="_blank">updated support document</a>. Partner Sharing will no longer automatically share photos that come from "other apps on Android," according to the document. The confirmation was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techissuestoday.com/google-photos-android-share-photos-from-other-apps-with-partner-account/" target="_blank">TechIssuesToday</a>, which noted that the support document was updated sometime in the last month based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241008002627/https://support.google.com/photos/answer/7378858" target="_blank">Wayback Machine archives</a>.</p><p>Partner Sharing is a convenient, and automatic, way to share photos with someone you trust, like a family member or significant other. Using this feature, you can choose which photos are automatically shared with your partner. For example, photos can be shared if they include a specific person, or were taken after a specific date.</p><p>Additionally, you can share all photos with a partner if you'd like. Since the feature was introduced in 2017, the <strong>All Photos</strong> option really included every photo, but there are new limitations. Now, there's a disclaimer in the Partner Sharing support document reading: "Tip: Photos from other apps on Android aren't shared with your partner account."</p><p>Reddit users spotted the change about two weeks ago, discovering that certain metadata determines whether a photo is shared or not. Downloads, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">screenshots</a>, and photos from other Android apps won't be sent to another person with Partner Sharing.</p><p>This doesn't change if you alter the photo's origin in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos app</a>, like removing the "screenshot" badge. However, screenshots will be sent through Partner Sharing if they've been edited in Google Photos.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlephotos/comments/1gjyasy/screenshots_not_sharing_through_partner_share">Screenshots not sharing through Partner Share</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlephotos">r/googlephotos</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Google hasn't shared the reasoning behind the changes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-share-your-library-google-photos">Partner Sharing</a>. The move could be to protect user privacy, as some users might want to share their photos but not their downloads, screenshots, or pictures from other apps. With that being said, there are already ways to customize which photos are shared with Partner Sharing, so it's puzzling that Google doesn't give users the option to share photos originating from other apps.</p><p>At the moment, it does not appear that Google is communicating this change directly to users in the Photos app. Though a new <strong>Updates</strong> page in the Photos app now exists for changes like this, Partner Sharing users apparently haven't received a message.</p>

<ul><li>Google published a new support page to inform users of an ongoing problem between Android 15's Private Space and Wear OS watches.</li><li>Users have reportedly received notifications from apps they've stored within Private Space, which isn't how the feature should function.</li><li>Google recently resumed its Wear OS Pixel Watch updates this week after Wear OS 5 caused devices to seize up.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's major 2024 Android OS release features enhanced privacy, but the company is aware of a glaring problem.</p><p>The company published <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wearos/answer/15597337">a support page</a> with information regarding the recently surfaced Private Spaces issues with Wear OS (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/13/android-15-private-space-wear-os/">9to5Google</a>). Google reiterates that Private Spaces are meant to hide apps that you don't want others to see. However, it notes that some users with a Wear OS device <em>paired with </em>a Private Space-enabled Android phone are receiving notifications.</p><p>The post states users with a Wear OS watch set up to receive "bridged notifications" face this problem.</p><p>Naturally, such devices are not supposed to receive notifications from apps placed within a Private Space. Google states users might receive an alert from an app if their "private space is unlocked on your phone." Moreover, these notifications could appear with a "work profile" icon even if you don't have a profile on your smartphone.</p><p>Google's highlight post lacks information regarding a potential fix for Wear OS devices and Android 15's Private Spaces. The publication assumes a fix <em>could </em>arrive with a future Wear OS or Android 15 patch. At this time, Google hasn't detailed a fix, meaning another may appear later.</p>

<p>During Android 15's launch, one of the major features highlighted was Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-create-private-space-for-your-apps-on-pixel">Private Space</a>. The feature functions like a "digital vault," storing away your sensitive apps that you'd prefer no one else see. Private Space is useful for keeping apps like banking and health separate from the rest of your device. Users can secure the space with a PIN or fingerprint, similar to how you'd lock your phone.</p><p>Unfortunately, Wear OS devices are experiencing a disconnect that defeats the purpose behind hiding these apps in a "private space."</p><p>It's unclear if we are waiting for an update to fix this issue. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-rollout-resumes-for-all-pixel-watch-models-but-theres-a-caveat">resumed its Wear OS updates</a> for the Pixel Watch this week after taking a break to correct a severe software problem. The latest Wear OS 5 upgrade caused several watches to seize up and stop all (proper) functionality.</p><p>More importantly, that update post featured an advisory: the next major OS update won't arrive until March 2025. While that'll be a lengthy wait, hopefully, we won't have to wait that long for a fix for Android 15's Private Space.</p>

<p>Amazon has already launched its first wave of Black Friday deals, including a huge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank"><strong>46% off the Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet</strong></a>—so long as you don't mind lockscreen ads.</p><p>This tablet is a great pick for casual users with its decent-looking 10.1-inch HD display, 32GB or 64GB of storage, and a price tag low enough to make justifying your purchase easy. It also features up to 13 hours of battery life, along with dual stereo speakers, Dolby Atmos, and a useful headphone jack that some tablets today don't include.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for something with a long battery life; you don't mind lockscreen ads and just want one of the most affordable tablets there is; you don't expect to need a lot of storage.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don't want a tablet with lockscreen advertisements; tablets with a good suite of cameras are a priority for you; you'd rather go with a lighter tablet.</p><p>The 2023 Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet is a great little companion, especially at such a low price point. Users love it for its roughly 13 hours of battery life, its 10.1-inch display, and its ease of use for gaming, video streaming,, and more.</p><p>This particular configuration comes with lockscreen ads, and unfortunately, there isn't a deal available for the non-ad version. Still, both the 32GB and 64GB storage options are around half off right now, making these Fire tablets a great deal compared to their usual price point. Storage can also be expanded up to 1TB with the included microSD port.</p><p>It's worth noting that the Fire HD 10 isn't a lightweight tablet, so if this is something that bothers you, it might be worth looking at other options. For those looking to upgrade, it also may be worth considering the slightly larger and better Fire HD 11 tablet, which was launched last year as a more powerful offering from the company.</p>
