<ul><li>The next version of Wear OS, called Wear OS 5.1, is now available for testing as a developer preview.</li><li>The Android 15-based software update can be manually tested within the Android Studio emulator in a virtual Wear OS device.</li><li>Although it's still early, new features include the ability to play audio out of smartwatch speakers and access the new Credential Manager API.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is giving us our first look at the next Wear OS update, which is based on Android 15. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/versions/5-1" target="_blank">released</a> the first developer preview of Wear OS 5.1 last week, and it's now available for testing in an Android Studio virtual device. Although it's still early, Google already revealed two key Wear OS 5.1 features: watch speaker audio playback and a credential manager.</p><p>The build number for the initial Wear OS 5.1 preview release is <strong>AP4A.241205.004.F1</strong>, and there are a few known issues. Google recommends developers start testing their Wear OS apps with the latest version to adjust to behavior changes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. Notably, some Android 15 behavior changes won't be arriving on Wear OS 5.1, like Private Spaces and predictive back animations. The known bugs are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The emulator doesn't always allow the user to add an account during the setup flow following a device reset.</li><li>When tapping on a notification, the app that sent the notification doesn't open until the user scrolls the screen.</li><li>Wear Health Services sometimes fails to start an exercise.</li></ul>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Confirmed: Wear OS 5.1 is the next version of Wear OS, and it's based on Android 15 just as I previously reported. https://t.co/t0pgSRpCW6 pic.twitter.com/lXLkbyxti6<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1861064684826251701">November 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The update currently includes two "notable features," as described by Google. The first is watch speaker playback, which will allow users to listen to audio sources through a smartwatch's inbuilt speaker. This could be a convenient way to listen to music or podcasts, albeit at low volume and subpar quality. To use your watch speaker as an audio output option, both the device's hardware and the specified app must support it in Wear OS 5.1.</p>

<p>The other notable feature is support for the Credential Manager API. This is already available on Android, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/upgrading-to-a-new-phone-android-can-now-keep-your-apps-signed-in-after-restoring-from-a-backup">enables features like auto-sign-in after restoring from a backup</a>. On Wear OS 5.1, the new credential manager will handle passwords, passkeys, and Sign in with Google. It'll also allow this information to be synced across Wear OS 5.1 and Android 15 devices.</p><p>Depending on the release date of Wear OS 5.1, this update could signal the platform catching up with Android. Typically, Wear OS updates have been based on preceding Android versions. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. The naming of Wear OS 5.1 could indicate that Google is trying to sync up Wear OS and Android. Or, it could simply mean that this year's Wear OS update is a minor one and not worthy of a full numbered version. After all, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Developer Preview 1</a> is here, so it's not that surprising that we're seeing a new version of Wear OS made available for testing as well.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung's next higher mid-range phone to sport same design as the predecessor.</li><li>The Galaxy A56 will again sport three rear cameras, flat display, Key Island, and probably a new pink shade.</li><li>The Galaxy device is also tipped to sport 45W fast charging and with a Exynos 1580 chip underneath.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung might be more than a couple of months away from launching the Galaxy A56 for the masses. However, that doesn‚Äôt stop leaks of renders showcasing the device in full.</p><p>OnLeaks and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-a56">Android Headlines</a> have shared the first high-quality renders of the Galaxy A56, the company‚Äôs one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range smartphones</a> for 2025. It should be launched sometime in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good Morning #FutureSquad!

<p>The shared CAD-based renders again reveal a familiar design as its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-galaxy-a55-and-a35">Galaxy A55</a>, featuring flat edges and rounded corners. It will have a flat punch-hole display and three rear cameras stacked vertically on the back. A slight difference; however, is that the A55‚Äôs rear cameras were placed individually, whereas the placement on the Galaxy A56 appears to be stacked in a single camera module.</p><p>The publication also implies Samsung should be borrowing the ‚ÄúKey Island‚Äù design elements introduced in Galaxy A55 alongside the budget Galaxy A15 and Galaxy 25 phones from last year, where the power button and volume rockers are a bit raised on the right pane of the device to spot them easily.</p>

<p>While the expected specifications are still unclear, Android Headlines highlights that the device might feature 45W fast charging similar to the flagship Galaxy phones despite the Galaxy A56 being a mid-range phone. According to a recent Chinese certification, the device is also expected to be powered by the Exynos 1580 SoC, which was announced in October.</p><p>If the launch of the predecessor models is any indication, the Galaxy A56 should be released in March 2025 in markets starting with Europe and likely priced under ‚Ç¨500.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Samsung‚Äôs other Galaxy A series device, dubbed Galaxy A26, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a26-renders-surface-online-revealing-its-design">spotted in the renders</a>‚Äîalso shared by OnLeaks last week‚Äîgiving us a good look at the design and some of the expected specifications of the sub-$300 Galaxy phone.</p>

<p><em><strong>Jeremy asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I just noticed that Google seems to have duplicate copies of my whole photo library, which, I'm guessing, is a waste of space.  There's a whole directory in My Drive that seems to be a duplicate of old family photos I scanned years ago, sorted by year and, I guess, not really needed.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>What's going on here? Does this count against my Google storage limit? Most importantly, can I delete all this?</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Jeremy! You've stumbled across a secret Google feature that gives you a look at what sets Google apart when it comes to online services: the unintended, multilayered problem.</p><p>On a serious note, this happens (or <em>happened</em>, as we'll see later) to some folks who used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-google-photos">Google Photos</a> in its early days but didn't affect others. The short answer to your questions: you're seeing duplicates because Google Photos stores its files in a hidden folder in your shared Google storage. Yes, it counts against your storage the same way any files you purposefully uploaded to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a>, and you can delete the folder(s) from Google Drive after you verify you have copies in the Google Photos app. For a discussion of the mess, read on!</p>
<p>Not everyone sees these old duplicate files. At some point, Google changed how Photos stores its data, but it still is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos-uploads-will-soon-count-towards-your-google-drive-storage">part of your overall storage space provided by Google</a>. Before this, you could see your Google Photos storage in Drive if you knew where and how to look for it, but it was intended to be hidden.</p><p>During the transition, some people had folders duplicated while the way they were stored changed. I've heard this has to do with specific metadata, how the files were added to Photos, or what device was used to upload them. These theories could be correct, or they could be 100% wrong; regardless, it happened, and when it happened, the folders became visible like any other folder in Drive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kyyZs7NSMFx6cQgMZZ3abg" name="google-photos-lifestyle-widescreen-crop.jpg" alt="Google Photos on a Pixel 4a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kyyZs7NSMFx6cQgMZZ3abg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These folders are no longer associated with Google Photos and that means they are duplicated elsewhere in a way you can't (easily) find them. It also means they are taking up space.</p><p>You have a limited amount of space associated with your Google account. You <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">can pay to have more if you need it</a>, or you can manage your stored and saved files so you don't reach the limit.</p><p>These duplicate folders can be safely deleted once you've double-checked to make sure the photos are also stored in the Google Photos app. <strong>Do not delete them until you have checked. </strong>Never trust anything without verifying it for yourself.</p>
<p>One thing you might want to look at before you delete anything is the quality of the photo being stored, <em>especially</em> if you used to have an original<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2024-early-discounts-and-how-to-prepare"> Pixel</a> or a Pixel 2.</p><p>It used to be that if you had a Pixel phone, your photos were stored at full quality without any cost to your shared storage allotment. Other photos had their quality reduced; it was still high-quality and is likely good enough for anything other than trying to have physical prints made, but there is a difference.</p><p>There is a chance that these "duplicate" photos would be full quality and the photos in Google Photos are not. This situation happened to me when I got hit with the weird duplication bug/mess/Googleism. A bunch of photos I took with the first Pixel phone were stored in full resolution and quality in my Google Drive but the "copies" in Google Photos were not.</p><p>It's up to you to decide if you want or need these larger-sized files (I didn't), but if you don't know and don't check, you can't decide.</p>
<p>One last thing to note ‚Äî this happened to a <em>lot</em> of people, and it's probably worth checking if you are one of them and don't know it. Just open your Google Drive and look through all the stuff that's stored there. If you see folders full of pictures, this is probably why.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google TV already offers a bunch of free content on its platform, including The Roku Channel. However, it will become much easier to discover and use The Roku Channel on Google TV thanks to deeper integration between the two services, Roku <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roku.com/blog/trc-googletv" target="_blank">announced</a> today. This will bolster Google TV's free content and make it easier to find and watch the tens of thousands of movies and TV shows made available as part of The Roku Channel.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/roku">Roku</a> first added The Roku Channel to Google TV last year, in limited form. There wasn't support for Google TV's search or discoverability functions at the time. That's beginning to change, as Roku says a more integrated experience will be available "in the coming weeks." For starters, Google TV users will be able to search for content from The Roku Channel using the native search function in Android TV.</p><p>Additionally, 500 live TV channels from Roku will join the live tab on Google TV.  The platform already offers nearly 1,000 free or ad-supported live TV channels, and the new ones from The Roku Channel will provide even more options, including channels with news, sports, cooking, DIY, music, and other types of programming.</p>

<p>A big part of Google TV is the platform's recommendations. There is so much free content on the platform that some users might want help finding what to watch next, and Google recommends content based on your previous watch history. Soon, free Roku movies and TV shows will appear in the <strong>Featured on The Roku Channel</strong>, <strong>Continue watching</strong>, and <strong>Free live TV</strong> on the Google TV home screen.</p><p>Roku says that the free content available via The Roku Channel includes select live MLB games, ABC News broadcasts, and over 80,000 movies and TV shows.</p><p>Whether you have a brand-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a> or an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-vs-chromecast-with-google-tv-4k">older Chromecast</a>, your Google TV device will get The Roku Channel integration. It'll also be available on any third-party device with Google TV built-in.

<ul><li>Rumors on X state the OnePlus Watch 3 will "launch soon" in global markets outside of China.</li><li>The tipster lists the watch's upcoming launch alongside the global debut of the OnePlus 13 and 13R, though it's unclear if they will all roll out together.</li><li>Early Watch 3 rumors suggest it could arrive with a 500mAh battery, LTE, and eSIM support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus rolled out its 2024 smartwatch early this year; however, a new set of rumors claims it's looking to double dip.</p><p>According to a post on X by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1860932345097867411">Yogesh Brar</a>, OnePlus is gearing up to launch its next flagship smartwatch with some friends (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-3-global-launch-13-13r-3502836/">Android Authority</a>). Brar states in their post that the OnePlus Watch 3 will "launch soon in global markets." Unfortunately, they don't state how soon consumers can expect this device, especially considering we're a week out from December.</p><p>The X post states the Watch 3 is a part of the Chinese OEM's "upcoming product schedule," and alludes to some additional devices.</p><p>Brar lists the next watch alongside the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R series phones.</p><p>The publication notes that the OnePlus 13R didn't join the top-of-the-line model during its launch at the end of October. This development is curious, to say the least, as we're unsure how OnePlus will go about releasing these three devices in global markets since one hasn't appeared on home soil (China).</p><p>A perfect scenario would see them all dropped at once globally, but the odds of that could be lower than we want.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OnePlus 13 OnePlus 13ROnePlus Watch 3These are the upcoming products scheduled to launch soon in Global markets.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1860932345097867411">November 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Whispers about a OnePlus Watch 3 started earlier this summer when it appeared for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-oneplus-watch-certification-specs-rendering">its TENAA certification</a>. Leaked specs suggest the watch will sport LTE and eSIM support alongside a strong 500mAh battery like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">its predecessor</a>. Additionally, it seems the watch could feature 10W wired charging.</p><p>Considering how recently the Watch 2 debuted, those earlier rumors felt closer to a variant rather than a jump in the series.</p><p>On the other hand, the "launching soon" rumor sort of makes sense when you consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-goes-official-in-china">one-month launch difference</a> for the OnePlus 13. The phone debuted in China on October 31, which was a month and some change earlier than the OnePlus 12's December 5 launch last year. A global launch for that device is expected sooner since it's already out in its home China market.</p><p>With that, perhaps we're looking at a December rollout for the OnePlus 13 overseas ‚Äî but that's just speculation. For context, the OnePlus 12R rolled out in January 2024, a month after the top-tier model. In any case, these devices might slowly trickle out in a similar cadence to OnePlus' past.</p><p>As always, we'll have to wait and see.</p>

I know that sounds like something a deal writer <em>would </em>say, but I&apos;m being serious here. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones </a>of 2024 are getting major discounts through the MVNO carrier, and Mint is pairing the savings with some deeply discounted wireless when you transfer your existing phone number. For instance, you could get the Google Pixel 9 AND a full year of the Unlimited plan for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>a single payment of $479 (or $20 per month using affirm)</strong></a>. Alternately, you can grab the Samsung Galaxy S24 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-s24/5418243/"><strong>simply have your phone bill covered for a year</strong></a>.</p><p>Sure, they aren&apos;t straight discounts, but if you&apos;re looking to switch wireless carriers, just imagine: you could make a single payment right now and not have to think about your phone bill again until December 2025. Plus, you&apos;ll get an incredible 2024 device out of the deal. Yeah, it&apos;s that good.¬†</p><p>Keep reading for all of the best deals from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>Mint Mobile&apos;s Black Friday sale</strong></a>, but don&apos;t wait too long to make your move ‚Äî Mint has been known to run out of stock during events like this.

<p>Page Annotations appear differently than regular in-text links, potentially signaling to the user that you're clicking a Google Search link rather than a redirect link from a third-party website. However, it's still possible that Page Annotations pull users away from the site they're browsing.</p><p>More likely, though, is that Page Annotations will simply be a new way for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google">Google app</a> users to quickly find out more information about a person, place, or thing. The Google Search results cards that appear as Page Annotations are designed in a way that makes it easy to return to the site you were previously browsing. It's also worth noting that iOS has a native <strong>Look Up</strong> feature that basically allows users to do the exact same thing, except it works system-wide on any highlighted text.</p><p>When you consider this context, it's unlikely that Page Annotations will materially change how iPhone users browse the web. If publishers are concerned, they do still have the ability to opt-out. While not explicitly listed as a test, it's fair to wonder whether Page Annotations might make their way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">Chrome</a> or Android if they are successful in the Google app for iOS.</p>

<ul><li>Following an assumed Nothing Phone 3 database listing, it seems the device could arrive with a midrange-level SoC.</li><li>From the listed chip details, it seems Nothing could pack Qualcomm's Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 into the Phone 3 instead of the 8s Gen 3.</li><li>Nothing's CEO Carl Pei stated that the Phone 3 will have AI at its core when it arrives in 2025 following a purposeful delay this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing is developing a Phone 3, but a recent discovery suggests its internal SoC isn't so "flagship."</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nothing_phone_3_appears_on_geekbench_-news-65473.php">GSMArena</a> found a new listing via the Geekbench database from Nothing. The device in question, with model number "A059," is rumored to be the next Phone 3 flagship. The listing is a little vague, stating this device in development could debut with 8GB of RAM and Android 15.</p><p>However, the more pressing matter is its supposed chip architecture of one processor and eight cores.</p><p>Per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/9045583">database listing</a>, it seems the assumed Phone 3 will have one "main" core at 2.50GHz. The rest of the setup includes four cores at 1.80GHz and three cores at 2.40GHz. These are likely to arrive as "efficiency" and "performance" cores, respectively.</p><p>The publication notes that this particular core, though the listing lacks its name, points toward Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> SoC. Elsewhere, the post claims the rumored Phone 3 could debut with a 6.5-inch OLED display. Early speculation throws a $600 starting price on the table, as well.</p><p>Take such rumors with a grain of salt as the publication adds a "Phone 3 Pro" could join the lineup.</p>

<p>Rumors about the Nothing Phone 3 have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-qualcomm-chip-price-rumors">been extremely scarce</a> with the "latest" detailing a chance for a Qualcomm variant. It was rumored this past summer that the device could debut with the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3. The chip is a slightly toned-down version of the 2023 SD 8 Gen 3 flagship. It reached 3.0GHz speeds, which was 0.3GHz slower than the higher-tier chip.</p><p>Qualcomm stated the chip was designed for more on-device AI. However, the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, which is <em>now </em>rumored for the Phone 3, is aimed at "budget-friendly smartphones." It's based on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-plus-gen-3-launch">midrange SD 7 Plus Gen 3</a> from March.</p><p>With that, the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 is a bit slower than the flagship 8 or 8s chips. Still, it focuses heavily on AI as it boasts support for several models like Baichuan-7B and Llama 2.</p><p>AI is a phone aspect that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">Nothing's CEO, Carl Pei, stated</a> he wanted to focus heavily on with the next device. In June, Pei stated that the company had been "prototyping AI interactions." Moreover, it seemed evident that Nothing purposefully delayed the Phone 3's launch to better flesh out its AI software. The company confirmed that it wouldn't arrive in 2024, pushing us into 2025 for an eventual debut.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-one-ui-6-watch-wear-os-5-official-rollout">highly-anticipated One UI 6 Watch update</a> is slowly making its way to older Samsung Galaxy Watch models. Users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1gzl3oe/its_finally_here/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> began reporting seeing updates for One UI 6 Watch become available for their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 and Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> devices today in the U.S. The rollout comes following Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-availability-of-latest-wearable-experiences-to-more-users" target="_blank">announcement</a> of the One UI 6 Watch release schedule last week, which is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>.</p><p>One UI 6 Watch debuted on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra earlier this year, packing a few Samsung Health features powered by Galaxy AI. They include <strong>Energy Score</strong>, which is similar to Garmin's Body Battery metric, and <strong>Sleep Analysis</strong>. On top of that, <strong>Race </strong>and <strong>Workout Routine</strong> will help athletes train for their next big event ‚Äî or simply hit their personal goals. Now, these features and more are set to come to a slew of older Galaxy Watch models.</p>

<p>The One UI 6 Watch update may arrive in a few different build numbers, including <strong>R965USQU1BXJ5</strong> and <strong>R965UOYM1BXJ5</strong>. It's nearly two gigabytes in size, and some users are reporting that the update takes hours to apply to their Galaxy Watch 6 or Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. The exact details and rollout timeline will depend on your device model, and whether you have the GPS or GPS + LTE versions of the Galaxy Watch.</p>

<p>Samsung warns that the included Galaxy AI features are only guaranteed for free until the end of 2025. After that, their future is up in the air. The idea of Samsung offering a subscription for Galaxy AI and/or Samsung Health features has been floated, but nothing is concrete at the moment.</p><p>For now, the One UI 6 Watch update is only available for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 and Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. Eventually, One UI 6 Watch will come to Galaxy Watch 5, Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, Galaxy Watch 4, Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and Galaxy Watch FE.</p>

<p>Samsung recently launched the Galaxy S24 FE, its latest midrange phone retailing for $650. Surprisingly, it's a pretty big update. There's an emphasis on Galaxy AI and seven years of software support, plus a fresh Samsung Exynos 2400e chipset that's actually faster than older midrange chips from Google and Qualcomm. The design and cameras are all too familiar, though, heavily resembling the Galaxy S23 FE.</p><p>While the Galaxy S24 FE and the Galaxy S23 FE appear similar from afar, the differences are easily noticed up close. However, should you upgrade if you already own a Galaxy S23 FE, or should you look to buy a discounted Galaxy S23 FE instead of the newer model? After testing both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">great phones</a> for ourselves, we're here to help you find the answers to all these questions and more.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-galaxy-s23-fe-design-2">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE vs. Galaxy S23 FE: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="inn2brzTWTMaKiHcFYu3UA" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-colors-4.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/inn2brzTWTMaKiHcFYu3UA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In this case, pictures won't tell you the entire story. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE</a> appears to have an eerily similar design to the Galaxy S23 FE, and it's true that they do look alike. But a closer look reveals more similarities than differences. For starters, the Galaxy S24 FE now sports a larger 6.7-inch form factor than its 6.4-inch predecessor. The bigger size allowed Samsung to include a larger battery while making the Galaxy S24 FE slimmer than the Galaxy S23 FE.</p><p>This year's model measures 162.0 x 77.3 x 8.0mm, while the older variant measures 158 x 76.5 x 8.2mm. Expectedly, the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on"> Galaxy S23 FE</a> is a few grams lighter due to its compact size and smaller battery. Both devices are plenty durable, with IP68 certifications and Gorilla Glass 5 coverings. You can choose between five colors on the Galaxy S24 FE and only four on the Galaxy S23 FE, but both midrangers offer a lot of room for choice.</p><p>The newer Galaxy S24 FE takes a few design cues from recent Samsung phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. That includes the company's most rectangular design yet with flat, matte aluminum side rails and only a slight chamfer along the edges. This can make the phone feel slightly uncomfortable, but the curved corners help limit the potential discomfort.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ioVFeHRPFQnVzsTJD6eQ4U" name="samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-family-colors-4.jpg" alt="Different colors of the Galaxy S23 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ioVFeHRPFQnVzsTJD6eQ4U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the smaller Galaxy S23 FE will feel nicer in the hand than the Galaxy S24 FE. Both phones have raised triple-camera lenses on the back, and an under-display fingerprint reader on the front. There's a hole-punch camera on at the top of the display, too.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-galaxy-s23-fe-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE vs. Galaxy S23 FE: Hardware and specs</h2>
<p>Aside from the difference in display size, the 6.7-inch Galaxy S24 FE and the 6.4-inch Galaxy S23 FE have the same screen specifications. Both are AMOLED displays offering a 1080p resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. They also both have asymmetrical screen bezels with corner radii that don't match the corners of the chassis perfectly; those kinds of things may or may not matter to you, but they're something I've noticed.</p><p>On the inside, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is powered by the Exynos 2400e chipset. It's faster than both variants of the Galaxy S23 FE, which had the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset in the U.S. and the Exynos 2200 processor worldwide. In benchmarks, the Galaxy S24 FE outperformed the Galaxy S23 FE, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, <em>and</em> the Tensor G3-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>.</p><p>In terms of memory and storage, these two midrangers are identical. You get 8GB of RAM and the option of either 128GB or 256GB of storage. Since there's no microSD card support, you'll need to pay for extra storage at the time of purchase if you think you'll need it.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S24 FE packs a larger battery than the Galaxy S23 FE, with the former having a 4,700mAh capacity and the latter having a 4,500mAh capacity. Surprisingly, the bigger size plus the efficiency of the Exynos platform helped the Galaxy S24 FE provide all-day battery life during heavy usage. It's a real reason to pick the newer model over the competition.</p><p>Connectivity is identical between these two phones, and unfortunately so. The devices support 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.3. However, at a time when we're seeing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">flagships start to support Wi-Fi 7</a>, it would've been nice to see that spec make its way to the Galaxy S24 FE.</p><p>Similarly, the camera system is unchanged. Both phones provide a triple-camera system with a main, ultrawide, and telephoto lens. The main camera is a 50MP, f/1.8 OIS primary shooter, and that's paired with a 12MP, f/2.2 ultrawide and an 8MP, f/2.4 telephoto with 3x optical zoom. That telephoto lens is crucial for both models, because the Galaxy S24 FE and Galaxy S23 FE are some of the only midrangers to feature true optical zoom.</p><p>Really, the biggest differences between these phones are on the inside. The new processor, bigger battery, and larger screen all add up to be the main differentiators for the Galaxy S24 FE.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-galaxy-s23-fe-software-and-performance-2">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE vs. Galaxy S23 FE: Software and performance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nFMkDSensEgPivRafCToGQ" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-home-screen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE home screen in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nFMkDSensEgPivRafCToGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The reason it's hard to recommend the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE as a new smartphone in 2024 is its software support. The phone runs Android 14, just like the newer Galaxy S24 FE, although it launched with Android 13. However, the older Galaxy S23 FE will only get full Android upgrades through 2027, which will come sooner than we think. Compared to the full seven-year upgrade promise that comes with the Galaxy S24 FE, there's no discussion needed. The newer phone will outlast the older one by a mile.</p><p>Additionally, it's likely that the Galaxy S24 FE will have a better time running new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features than the Galaxy S23 FE. It's true that the Galaxy S23 FE did get Galaxy AI via an OTA update this year; it's unclear what features it will get in the future. If AI matters to you, the Exynos-powered Galaxy S24 FE will be better in the long run than the Galaxy S23 FE and its aging Snapdragon chip.</p>

<p>For those looking to buy a new Samsung midranger today, the choice is pretty simple. The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is bigger and faster than its predecessor, and it has longer battery life and software support. It's closer to the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> than ever.</p><p>Usually, I'd recommend looking out for a great Galaxy S23 FE deal if you want to save a few bucks. This time around, it's hard to find a Galaxy S23 FE in stock, let alone at a compelling price. It's actually the new Galaxy S24 FE that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/not-a-typo-samsungs-brand-new-galaxy-s24-fe-is-already-usd175-off-ahead-of-black-friday">already up to $275 off with activation</a> ahead of Black Friday.</p><p>If you already own a Galaxy S23 FE, you probably don't need to upgrade immediately. You still have Samsung's newest midrange camera system and a handful of Galaxy AI features. But if you're in the market for a new midranger, the Galaxy S24 FE is the one to buy.</p>
