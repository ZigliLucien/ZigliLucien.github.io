<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-prime-day-faq"><span>Prime Day FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="when-is-amazon-prime-day-2024-2">When is Amazon Prime Day 2024?</h2>
<p>Although Amazon hasn&apos;t specified exact dates just yet, the retailer has confirmed that Prime Day will run sometime in July. Last year&apos;s 48-hour sale event occurred on July 11th and 12th, while Prime Day 2022 ran from the 12th through the 13th. </p><p>Assuming Amazon doesn&apos;t make any drastic changes, it seems likely that the sale will be scheduled for either the week of July 8th or the week of July 15th. We&apos;ll update this page as soon as we learn more. </p>
<h2 id="what-tv-deals-can-i-expect-during-prime-day-2">What TV deals can I expect during Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Amazon&apos;s Prime Day sale is arguably the best time of the year to buy a new smart TV. Mainstream brands from LG and Samsung to Insignia and onn. will be dropping historic discounts on their most popular models, so if you can wait until next month to order a smart TV, we recommend it. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-to-be-a-prime-member-2">Do I need to be a Prime member?</h2>
<p>Prime Day is reserved exclusively for Prime members, so if you want to take part in the sale, you&apos;ll need to sign up. Fortunately, Amazon offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>30-day free trial</strong></a> that you can cancel at any time, so if you don&apos;t want to join for good, you could feasibly sign up on July 1st, enjoy all of the Prime Day festivities, and cancel once the sale ends without paying a dime. </p><p>If you don&apos;t want to join Prime or take advantage of the free trial, the goods news is that many of Amazon&apos;s biggest competitors are likely to offer rival sales that run concurrent to Prime Day without requiring a membership. Needless to say, we&apos;ll be sharing <em>all </em>of the best deals from across the web during those 48 hours, not just Amazon&apos;s offerings. </p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-look-for-in-a-smart-tv-2">What should I look for in a smart TV?</h2>
<p>When you&apos;re shopping for smart TVs, you&apos;ll immediately notice that manufacturers throw a bunch of impressive-sounding jargon in your face to make their models seem more appealing. Some of this information is <em>actually </em>important, while other details are just filling space. To cut through the noise, we&apos;ve gathered a few of the most important things to worry about when making your final decision. </p>
<ul><li><strong>1. Resolution: </strong>Although TVs with 8K resolution are starting to be released, they're quite expensive, and most TV shows and films aren't made to support that resolution anyway. For now, you can save some money and have a nearly-identical experience by going with a 4K TV. If you want all of your favorite shows and films to look as good as possible, look for a set with 4K upscaling.  </li><li><strong>2. Refresh rate:</strong> To put it simply, a TV's refresh rate will affect how smooth and lifelike moving images appear on your display, whether you're watching live sports or playing video games. 60Hz is generally fine for smaller TVs, but 120Hz is even better, especially if your TV is larger than 60 inches. Some TVs may even come with a game optimization mode that boosts the refresh rate up to 240Hz. </li><li><strong>3. OLED vs. LCD: </strong>Despite all of the many proprietary varieties touted by manufacturers (QLED, ULED, etc), all you need to know is that smart TVs are broken down into two categories: LCD and OLED. LCD technology is generally found in more-affordable TVs and looks pretty great most of the time. If you can afford it, however, OLED makes a big difference in larger TVs, with consistently richer colors and better contrast. Technologies such as Samsung's "QLED" and Hisense's "ULED" are basically just marketing terms used to describe the companies' proprietary takes on LCD. Rule of thumb: if you have over $1,000 to spend on a TV, go OLED; otherwise, an LCD with 4K support should be just fine. </li><li><strong>4. Price: </strong>Smart TVs are some of the only pieces of tech that haven't gotten more expensive in recent years. Depending on the size you need, you could probably get away with spending $500 or less on a great 4K TV for your home. Don't be fooled by all of the high-tech jargon: as long as the reviews seem consistent and the TV comes with 4K resolution, a refresh rate over 60Hz, and three or four HDMI ports, you should be all set. </li></ul>
<h2 id="what-size-smart-tv-should-i-get-2">What size smart TV should I get?</h2>
<p>If you&apos;re trying to figure out which size TV you should buy, the first thing to know is that the size of a TV is determined by measuring one corner of the screen to another. Take a tape measure and hold it "corner to corner" in the space you&apos;re hoping to place your new smart TV and consider how far away you&apos;ll be sitting from the screen. For example, if you&apos;re sitting around six feet away from your TV screen, a 50-inch to 70-inch TV should be sufficient. </p>

<ul><li>A report from an inside source claims that Spotify will launch its new HiFi music tier as an "add-on" for an extra $5 monthly for existing users "later this year."</li><li>The plan will reportedly bring "new tools" for unique playlist creations that "learn and adapt" to users alongside song library management options.</li><li>Spotify recently announced its plans to raise prices across the board for its users in July.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new report suggests that Spotify is (actually) planning on debuting its new "HiFi" music tier at some point this year.</p><p>Citing an unnamed person close to the matter, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-11/spotify-to-introduce-more-expensive-subscription-tier-for-music-lovers?leadSource=uverify%20wall&embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> states that Spotify is working to launch its HiFi tier to users "later this year" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/11/spotify-hifi-add-on-5-dollars/">9to5Google</a>). The publication&apos;s source added that Spotify will turn its HiFi music plan into an "add-on" so existing customers can get in on the higher-quality tunes.</p><p>This add-on will reportedly charge users an extra $5 monthly. The source claims that the pricing "will vary depending on each user’s base plan." However, this is said to "average" out for a 40% increase no matter which plan users are adding HiFi on top of.</p><p>This new HiFi plan will reportedly bring "new tools" for playlist creation and song library management. Users may be able to create playlists through HiFi for specific dates, times of the year, and "certain activities."</p><p>Additionally, these unique playlists will supposedly be able to "learn and adapt" to their users.</p><p>We&apos;ve been waiting on Spotify&apos;s HiFi music tier for quite a while and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-hifi-lossless-audio-expectation-leak">a leak from May</a> teased what we could expect from its launch. For its Lossless audio quality, it seems Spotify will inform users if their device is compatible and how much bandwidth the quality setting is soaking up.</p><p>The leak also showed that the company could push Spotify Connect on users as the "best way" to enjoy their music.</p><p>Also, when it comes to pricing, the picture is a little clearer after we dig into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotifys-price-hikes-and-lack-of-hifi-make-me-want-to-own-music-again">the price hike</a> slated for July. A week ago, Spotify announced that it would raise prices for the Premium individual plan by $1, bringing it to $11.99 monthly. The Premium Duo plan is rising by $2 to $16.99 while the Premium Family plan jumps by $3 to $19.99.</p><p>If Bloomberg&apos;s source is true, and HiFi will land as a $5 add-on, then users could see their monthly bills at $16.99 if they own the individual plan at the start.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>AT&T deals have been really growing on me lately, namely because the Big Three carrier keeps dropping offers that give you dirt cheap (or even free) devices without requiring a trade-in. As someone who writes about deals every day, that&apos;s music to my ears. Case in point: you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/google-pixel-8a.html"><strong>buy the brand new Google Pixel 8a for a mere $2.99 per month</strong></a> when you add a qualifying data plan to your AT&T wireless account. As if that wasn&apos;t good enough, if you add an additional service line for a smartwatch, you can get the Google Pixel Watch 2 for 100% free. I don&apos;t know how AT&T does it, but I&apos;m certainly not complaining. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a> has only been out for a few weeks, but we've already been impressed by the midrange device's powerful camera tech and flagship-level performance. Purchase and activate the Pixel 8a with a qualifying data plan at AT&T and the carrier will give you the phone for only $2.99/month for 36 months. That's over $400 in savings, no trade-in required!</p>
<p>To make the deal even sweeter, AT&T will also give you a free Google Pixel Watch 2 when you bundle the watch with your new smartphone. All you need to do is add an additional service line. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/google-pixel-8a.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="15042a91-81c0-4b96-b224-7693347a0fd3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 8a 128GB: $519.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 8a 128GB: $519.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> you&apos;re an AT&T customer or ready to switch; you want flagship-quality camera technology and fancy AI features for cheap. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;re happy with your current phone plan or can afford to buy the Pixel 8a unlocked; you&apos;re looking for a trade-in deal. </p><p>Of course, like most carrier deals, there&apos;s a lot of fine print to consider before hopping on board. Like I mentioned above, you&apos;ll need to sign up for one of AT&T&apos;s qualifying unlimited plans to get the huge discount on the Pixel 8a. These start at $75.99 for one line, although it&apos;s worth noting that you can stack discounts (like for multiple lines, AARP members, students, and more) without losing eligibility. Additionally, both new and existing AT&T customers can receive the savings, which is a pretty rare incentive when it comes to mainstream carrier deals. </p><p>All things said and done, if you can meet the fairly flexible eligibility requirements, you&apos;ll end up with a sweet midrange device that boasts a gorgeous 120Hz display, loads of software support, and some of the best camera tech found on any Android phone to date — all for the price of a cup of coffee every month. And that&apos;s before you even consider the free Google Pixel Watch 2 that you&apos;ll get when you add another service line (starting at $10.99 per month).</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/the-best-atandt-deals-of-month-year-up-to-dollar1000-off-galaxy-s24-ultra-free-flagships-and-more">AT&T deals</a> like this don&apos;t come around very often, so if you&apos;re interested in the new Google Pixel 8a and ready to make a change to your wireless service, don&apos;t miss this opportunity. </p>

<hr>
<p>It is that time of year when we expect Google to launch its feature drops for Pixel devices, and the search giant just did it for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-june-2024-feature-drop-detailed">Pixel phones</a> next to the Pixel Watch models.</p><p>The popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-car-crash-detection-pixel-4">car crash detection</a> feature that was only on Pixel phones is now available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, with the latest feature drop. Pixel Watch 2 users can now dial emergency services if they get into a severe car crash. The new feature is paired with Emergency Sharing on the Pixel Watch 2 to help share real-time locations with the user&apos;s emergency contacts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="kMRm7cMHhoycbzrZnkvYqM" name="Pixel-Watch-2-car-crash-detection.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 2 Car Crash detection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kMRm7cMHhoycbzrZnkvYqM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, improvements to fall detection can be seen with the new update, especially for falls from bicycles. The latter applies to both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> and the Pixel Watch 2.</p><p>Next up is the Google Wallet, a handy app for smartwatch users. As part of the new update, both Pixel Watch models&apos; can link their Paypal account to the wallet app. The feature will be available for users based in the U.S. and Germany. The new feature aims to allow its users to make payments hassle-free by providing multiple options.</p>

<p>Google is also bringing a major revamp for its Home app for users running on WearOS 3 and above-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a>. It allows users to easily access their smart home devices faster and easier from their wrists. It includes accessing users&apos; Google Home favorites with just a swipe on the Pixel Watch — thanks to a new Wear OS tile. Users will then be able to adjust the temperature and dim the lights, as well as more, from the latest Google Home app. </p><p>Further, users can access their smart home from their preferred watch face complication on the Wear OS-powered smartwatch. They can add a shortcut to the watch face, and tapping the shortcut allows the users to make adjustments right on their wrists. Similarly, users can adjust the rotation of blinds or fan speeds and more from their smartwatch.</p>

<ul><li>Google has announced its June feature drop, which includes several updates like rolling out display port support for its Pixel devices.</li><li>The Pixel 8 and other Pixel Pro devices can now be rediscovered when offline or without power through the Find My Device network.</li><li>Other updates involve Pixel Tablet doorbell notifications, Recorder app improvements, a manual camera expansion, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Here in June, Google is announcing a few new updates to its Pixel phones and the Pixel Tablet.</p><p>As detailed in a press release, Google is bringing some useful user-facing features to its Pixels, such as display port support. With a USB-C cable, Pixel users can now watch movies and shows on a larger, secondary display. Once connected and with a video running, your Pixel devices will ask if you&apos;d like to "mirror" your display to an external screen.</p><p>This is rolling out on the Pixel 8, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>, and 8a.</p>

<p>Next, Pixel users are now picking up "power-off Finding" through the Find My Device network. Google states that users can begin rediscovering their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> or Pixel Pro devices even if it&apos;s turned off.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-pixel-8-find-my-device-powered-off">explained how this works</a> in May, stating Pixel owners can relocate their phone "several hours" after its battery dies or manually powered off. Before it&apos;s turned off or all power is lost, your Pixel device will send one final ping to the Find My Device network of its last known location.</p><p>Unknown callers are a curious occurrence, which is why Google is rolling out "Reverse Phone Number Lookup." The company states users can conduct a reverse search on a number in their call logs.</p><p>From the "Recents" tab in the Phone app, users can find that unknown caller, tap the number, and tap "Lookup." The search will begin from there, delivering any relevant information users need about that unknown phone number.</p>

<p>The Pixel Recorder app is getting a useful update today (June 11) that brings more detailed summaries. Google states that these summaries will include the names of speakers. Additionally, important transcriptions can be exported into Google Docs or simple text files.</p><p>Google&apos;s Pixel camera is gaining some additional HDR enhancements via HDR Plus. The company states this new feature will let Pixel owners find the "best moment from your photo in HDR Plus with just a single shutter." Google hopes this aids users in finding the best shots with folks who are smiling and in focus without blurring. </p><p>This is rolling out for Pixel 6 and newer phones, as well as the Pixel Tablet and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>.</p><p>Additional camera updates are here through "Manual Lens Expansion." Google states this update lets users manually decide which camera should capture a photo. The Pixel 8 Pro, 7 Pro, 6 Pro, and Pixel Fold are in line for this camera enhancement.</p><p>Lastly, the company is bringing its Gemini Nano AI model to the developer options for the Pixel 8 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>.</p>

<p>Joining this June Pixel feature drop is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> with an update that helps users keep tabs on their homes. The post states that the tablet is picking up doorbell notifications in Hub mode when docked. If someone has rung the doorbell, your docked Pixel Tablet will display a quick snapshot of who&apos;s at the door <em>before </em>you go and check.</p><p>The Pixel Tablet is also picking up a Google Home "Favorites" widget for the home screen. This will let users quickly access their most important smart home devices without needing to dive into the main Home app. From the widget, users will find a device&apos;s appropriate controls, like sliders for managing the lights, locking your doors, and more.</p><p>These features for Google&apos;s Pixel phones and the Pixel Tablet should begin rolling out throughout the week.</p>

<hr>
<p>Apple previewed iOS 18 at the company’s WWDC 2024 developer conference, and there’s one big highlight for Android users — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone">RCS messaging</a>. After years of dealing with SMS and MMS messaging when texting an iPhone user from an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, the experience will improve starting this fall. Android users have been waiting for this for a <em>long </em>time, yet Apple barely spoke about RCS messaging during its iOS 18 showcase. It was an afterthought that came separate from all the other messaging features in iOS 18.</p><p>It’s clear that Apple is not thrilled about adding RCS to the iPhone. The company wasn’t <em>technically </em>forced to support RCS, but the industry assumption is that it did so to try and appease the European Union. After all, at one point, iMessage was at risk of becoming a cross-platform service under Digital Markets Act requirements. A few months after Apple announced support for RCS messaging, the EU announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-dma-core-service-apple-imessage-ruling">iMessage wouldn’t fall under the “core platform service” designation</a>.</p><p>Make no mistake, Apple’s choice to subtly reference RCS messaging during WWDC was intentional. The company isn’t thrilled about supporting it, and it doesn’t want to undercut iMessage in any way. There was a clear separation between iMessage and RCS in the keynote — both in terms of the times the features were announced and in the features themselves. </p><p>This isn’t surprising at all. Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/16/apple-rcs-coming-to-iphone/">dropped</a> the original announcement of RCS right in the hands of 9to5Mac, neglecting to even put out a press release or provide further details about the move, only adding that your bubbles will still be green. Apple doesn’t care about RCS, and to be honest, neither do the company’s users. It’s a move to appease regulators and nothing more, so why give it a bunch of stage time at WWDC?</p>
<h2 id="rcs-is-coming-to-ios-18-but-who-knows-what-it-will-look-like-2">RCS is coming to iOS 18, but who knows what it will look like</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6AzNj8935kArmVpTEVcAhK" name="imessage-android-thumb-cisj.jpg" alt="iMessage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6AzNj8935kArmVpTEVcAhK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Apple officially announced RCS messaging would come to iOS 18 at WWDC — before, we knew it was coming in 2024, but weren’t 100% sure when — it didn’t provide any new details. Apple is using the RCS Universal Profile, and this should let RCS messages send over Wi-Fi or data, allow for higher-quality photos and videos, and add key features like message reactions and read receipts. However, we also know that Apple is <em>not</em> replacing iMessage with RCS. Plenty of things that people love about iMessage will still be exclusive to that service. </p><p>We loaded up the first iOS 18 developer beta to see if there were any hints at how RCS might be implemented. When you draft a message in the Messages app on iOS, an empty text field will read either <strong>iMessage </strong>or <strong>Text Message</strong>. On iOS 18, the language is further clarified, reading "<strong>Text Message SMS</strong>." For now, there isn’t a way to send an RCS message in iOS 18. There isn’t even a new setting in the <strong>Messages</strong> tab in the redesigned iOS 18 Settings app related to RCS.</p><p>If Apple <em>really</em> doesn’t want RCS to come to iOS 18, it could delay its addition to the operating system until closer to its public release. We assume that Apple will want this tested externally before iOS 18 fully rolls out, so it’ll probably appear in a developer beta at some point. Until that happens, what RCS messaging will really look like in iOS 18 is anyone’s guess.</p>
<h2 id="everything-new-to-imessage-won-x2019-t-work-with-rcs-xa0-2">Everything new to iMessage won’t work with RCS  </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kZ7KqDVLAUUMALmRBYbdc3" name="iMessage-Text-Formatting.jpg" alt="New formatting options for iMessage." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kZ7KqDVLAUUMALmRBYbdc3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple announced a few new Messages features in iOS 18, but didn’t bring up RCS at all during this portion of the showcase. I think this was intentional, making the point that the latest and greatest iOS has to offer won’t work with RCS. You can schedule iMessages for a later date or time, use new text formatting options like bold or strikethrough, and use any emoji to ”tapback” to messages. </p><p>Of these, we know that the <strong>Send Later</strong> feature won’t come to RCS chats, and neither will the new text formatting options. The new tapback emoji choices <em>might</em> work on Android with RCS, but if they do, it’ll be of no thanks to Apple. Google has already found ways to show tapbacks on Android with clever workarounds, and there’s no reason it couldn’t do the same with an expanded emoji library. After all, Android users have been able to react to messages with any emoji for a while now.</p><p>Either way, the point is the same. Apple didn’t talk much about RCS because there isn’t anything to talk about. It’s focused on adding new features to iMessage, and RCS is just <em>there</em>. </p>

<p>The movement for RCS is twofold. There are technical reasons for wanting RCS, like improved security, more advanced features, and better media quality. Another important reason for wanting RCS on the iPhone is to try to erase the “green bubble” stigma. It’s a real thing, especially among younger generations. iPhone users don’t mock Android users because their texts use SMS instead of RCS. They mock them because any green bubble message is <strong>not iMessage</strong>. It’s that simple. </p><p>To be clear, I don’t think shaming people for their phone of choice is an okay thing to do, and not every iPhone user behaves this way. However, some do, and it’s why younger generations are flocking to iPhones at impossibly-high rates for fear of being labeled as an outcast. </p><p>For that, the RCS move does nothing. At the end of the day, RCS is not iMessage. And by the way Apple chose to reference (or, <em>not</em> reference) RCS at WWDC, I think it wants to remind users of that. </p>

<ul><li>Apple is considering adding third-party AI models like Google Gemini to iOS 18, following the integration of ChatGPT.</li><li>Apple's Craig Federighi emphasized that users might prefer different AI models for specific tasks, and Apple aims to let users choose their preferred model.</li><li>Allowing users to choose their AI model could set Apple apart from competitors like Google and Samsung.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>An Apple executive has revealed that the company is open to adding third-party AI models like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> to iOS 18, after bringing ChatGPT to the platform.</p><p>At WWDC24, Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI to integrate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-use-chatgpt-on-chromebook">ChatGPT</a> into iOS 18. This means that if Siri can&apos;t answer a question, it will pass it on to ChatGPT for a detailed response. This collaboration boosts Siri&apos;s abilities and combines the strengths of both AI models.</p><p>After the keynote, Craig Federighi, Apple&apos;s software engineering chief, hinted at even bigger plans for AI in iOS. In an interview, he mentioned the potential of adding Gemini alongside Apple&apos;s current OpenAI partnership (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/10/craig-federighi-says-apple-hopes-to-add-google-gemini-and-other-ai-models-to-ios-18/" target="_blank">9to5Mac</a>).</p><p>Federighi&apos;s comments back up reports of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-google-in-talks-gemini-ios-18">Apple&apos;s potential partnership with Google</a>, hinting at the integration of Gemini into iOS. He suggested iOS 18 might adopt a multi-model approach, offering more choice and customization in mobile AI assistants.</p><p>"We think ultimately people are going to have a preference perhaps for certain models that they want to use, maybe one that’s great for creative writing or one that they prefer for coding," Federighi said during the interview moderated by YouTuber iJustine. "And so we want to enable users ultimately to bring a model of their choice."</p><p>Federighi said Apple’s pick of ChatGPT reflects the company&apos;s focus on top-notch tech for users. With this partnership, Siri gets to use OpenAI’s GPT-4o without extra costs or new accounts. Plus, Apple keeps your privacy safe by not logging queries or IP addresses. Basic features are free, but you can subscribe for premium AI perks.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that while Federighi confirmed Apple&apos;s plans to bring more AI models to iOS 18, especially through its partnership with OpenAI, he didn’t actually mention Gemini.</p><p>Anyway, this could be a big deal for the future of AI on Apple devices. Allowing users to choose their AI model would set Apple apart from competitors like Google and Samsung, who stick to one AI assistant. If Apple takes this route, it could lead the way in giving users more control over their AI experience.</p><p>The first beta of iOS 18 doesn&apos;t yet have Apple Intelligence features. These smart functionalities are set to be tested over the summer. The full public release of iOS 18 is expected in September.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There&apos;s a lot of choice if you&apos;re interested in buying a Xiaomi phone in mid-2024; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> continues to be my recommendation if you need a smallish phone, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">14 Ultra</a> has one of the best overall camera packages you&apos;ll find today. Then there are the value flagship offerings — the 13T Pro in particular is a standout choice.</p><p>While most manufacturers moved away from the idea of a mid-cycle refresh, Xiaomi&apos;s T series devices are an integral part of its phone portfolio, and last year&apos;s 13T series picked up a huge upgrade: Leica integration. Xiaomi needed a way to differentiate the 13T series against the POCO F5 and F5 Pro, and adding a few Leica effects and filters goes a long way in achieving that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Me938xzHVTwNNvx4wxBfGf" name="xiaomi-13t-pro-3.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 13T Pro long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Me938xzHVTwNNvx4wxBfGf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the 13T Pro when it launched, and I switched back to the device recently to see how it holds up against 2024 value flagships. I&apos;m still not a fan of the design; the large rectangular camera island at the back with curving sides just doesn&apos;t look cohesive, and it comes across as half-done. While the blue version of the phone has a faux leather back, the black model has a glass back with a glossy finish that&apos;s just mundane.</p><p>The plastic sides don&apos;t quite have the same feel as the likes of the Xiaomi 14, but they don&apos;t have a glossy coat either, and that at least makes using the device a little easier. That said, I like the way the back curves to meet the mid-frame; even though the front of the phone has a flat panel, the curves at the back make a noticeable difference in usability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5LgUajSateJYfsC3ktQ7Qh" name="xiaomi-13t-pro-9.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 13T Pro long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5LgUajSateJYfsC3ktQ7Qh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the 13T Pro comes into its own is the screen; the 6.67-inch AMOLED panel has excellent colors and contrast levels, and it gets incredibly bright in daily use. The Xiaomi 14 managed to get a smidgen brighter in auto mode while outdoors, but the 13T Pro has absolutely no issues in this area, and like most Xiaomi phones, the stereo sound coming out of this thing is highly detailed, and <em>loud</em>.</p><p>Interestingly, Xiaomi went with a 144Hz refresh for the 13T series, and while I didn&apos;t notice too much of a difference between 120Hz and 144Hz, the 13T Pro has a level of immediacy and fluidity that I didn&apos;t notice outside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>. Of course, you&apos;ll need to go into the settings to manually toggle the 144Hz mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kgnM2WqRZXWn7ddY3caapi" name="xiaomi-13t-pro-12.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 13T Pro long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kgnM2WqRZXWn7ddY3caapi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a similar vein, the Dimensity 9200+ continues to deliver outstanding performance. It delivers stable framerates in demanding games, and the best part is that there is no noticeable overheating. Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> has better figures in synthetic testing, it tends to get hotter as well, so if you want a gaming-focused phone that manages thermals, this is still a great option.</p><p>Another upgrade is around ingress protection, with the 13T Pro getting IP68 dust and water resistance as standard. This brings it closer to the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> and Xiaomi 14, and is a good move from Xiaomi, considering the 12T models only had IP54. On that note, the vibration motor is much better this time as well, and it has granular feedback.</p>

<p>Where the 13T Pro truly differentiates itself from its predecessors is the cameras; the phone has a 50MP Sony IMX707 main camera with OIS, a 50MP zoom lens with 2x optical zoom, and a 12MP wide-angle that&apos;s much better than previous years. The camera isn&apos;t as good as the Xiaomi 14, but it has much better versatility than previous years, and the Leica collaboration means you get more shooting modes and effects.</p><p>But what I liked better is the battery life. The 13T Pro is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-xiaomi-phones">best Xiaomi phones</a> in this regard, and the 5000mAh battery managed to last a day and a half with relative ease. There wasn&apos;t a single day where the battery went below 20% even with heavy use, and there just isn&apos;t any need to be anxious in this regard. On that note, the 120W charging tech ensures a full charge takes just 28 minutes, and that party trick doesn&apos;t get old.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Z3c7sMvvWCeRebjvSXY4jh" name="xiaomi-13t-pro-10.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 13T Pro long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z3c7sMvvWCeRebjvSXY4jh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the software, the 13T Pro switched to HyperOS in February, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>-based interface isn&apos;t noticeably different to MIUI 14. What is noticeable is that the overall interface has better fluidity and optimization, and in that sense, it is distinctly better than MIUI 14. The software itself is identical to what you get on other Xiaomi phones, and if you&apos;ve used MIUI for a while, you&apos;ll be immediately familiar with what&apos;s on offer.</p><p>The 13T Pro will get four Android OS updates, but given Xiaomi&apos;s glacial pace in this area, it&apos;s likely you&apos;ll need to wait at least until Q1 2025 to pick up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. That said, the phone will be updated to Android 17 when that becomes available, so it should be good for long-term use.</p>

<p>Xiaomi sells the 12GB/512GB model of the 13T Pro in the U.K., and while it went on sale earlier in the year, it is back up to its £699 ($890) retail price. That&apos;s still £149 ($190) less than the Xiaomi 14, and you get a larger screen and a bigger battery. If you want to maximize value, the standard Xiaomi 13T retails for £549 ($699), and while you don&apos;t get as much storage (it&apos;s sold in an 8GB/256GB configuration), it has the same set of cameras, same AMOLED panel, and same battery.</p><p>The only difference is that the 13T takes an additional 15 minutes to charge the 5000mAh battery as it has 67W charging tech. Honestly, you don&apos;t notice the difference in daily use, and for my money, I&apos;d get the Xiaomi 13T — it is the best value in Xiaomi&apos;s portfolio.</p>

<p>Considering where the 13T series is in its product cycle, Xiaomi is bound to start heavily discounting the devices as it starts to shift attention to the upcoming 14T models. I also like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO F6</a> quite a bit, and while it has better cameras, they&apos;re not quite in the same league as the 13T series, so if that&apos;s a priority, you should pick up the 13T or 13T Pro.</p>

<p>Jabra announced this morning (June 11) new versions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-review">Elite 8 Active</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-review">Elite 10</a>, featuring what it claims to be the world’s first LE Audio smart case. </p><p>The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 and Elite 10 Gen 2 each offer unique features. The Elite 10 is perfect for daily use, while the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 is built tough for your workouts. However, the real game-changer is the smart case, which enables wireless streaming from any device with a USB-C or 3.5mm port. With dual USB-C and 3.5mm compatibility, it provides universal streaming and connectivity.</p>

<p>A built-in chip in the case makes connecting and streaming audio from various devices a breeze. It also offers lower latency than standard Bluetooth, ensuring better audio and video sync and Hi-Fi sound quality. Plus, the 2-in-1 cable turns the charging case into a versatile adapter for spatial sound streaming directly to the earbuds.</p><p>The new models feature improved Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) that blocks up to twice as much noise as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-true-wireless-earbuds">previous versions</a>, especially in the mid- and low-frequency ranges. They also have six-microphone call technology and enhanced AI algorithms for clearer calls, prioritizing your voice over background noise.</p><p>Battery life is solid, too. The Elite 10 Gen 2 offers six hours of playback, extendable to 27 hours with the wireless charging case and ANC on. They’re IP57-rated for dust and water resistance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 provides up to eight hours of battery life, extendable to 32 hours with the case and ANC on, and is fully sweatproof, waterproof, and workout-proof with an IP68 rating for the earbuds and an IP54 rating for the case.</p><p>Both models support hands-free voice assistance, as well as Google Fast Pair, Swift Pair, and Spotify Tap playback. They also feature a semi-open design to relieve ear pressure and make ANC listening more comfortable, with soft silicone tips for added comfort.</p><p>The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 starts at $229 and comes in navy, black, and new colors Coral and Olive, available from mid-June. The Elite 10 Gen 2 will retail for $279 and will be available in Titanium Black, Gloss Black, Cocoa, and the new colors Denim and Soft White.</p>
