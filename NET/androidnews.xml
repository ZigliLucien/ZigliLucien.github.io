<ul><li>The Galaxy S24 FE might cost around $100 more than the S23 FE, potentially hitting $699 in the U.S.</li><li>However, the base model will still have 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, even with the price increase.</li><li>The camera setup remains the same, but the S24 FE will have a bigger battery for longer use.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE has been making waves, as Fan Edition phones usually bring flagship features at a lower price. But a new rumor suggests this year&apos;s model might not be as budget-friendly.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,145122.html" target="_blank">WinFuture</a>, the Galaxy S24 FE could see a price jump of around €100 in Europe compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>. If this carries over to the U.S., we&apos;re looking at a $100 bump, bringing the price to about $699. That’s a step up from the S23 FE’s starting price of $599.</p><p>Samsung isn&apos;t expected to offer more RAM or storage with the higher price—the base model still supposedly comes with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. However, the Galaxy S24 FE is expected to get some key upgrades that could make the price hike worth it.</p><p>First off, the Galaxy S24 FE is set to sport a 6.7-inch display, a nice upgrade from the S23 FE’s 6.4-inch screen. This upgrade marks a major shift in screen size for Samsung&apos;s Fan Edition lineup.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 FE is likely to draw its power from a 4nm Exynos 2400e chipset, a slightly toned-down version of the Exynos 2400 used in the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>. This move taps into the efficiency and performance improvements of the Exynos 2400 over the previous Exynos 2200, potentially giving the S24 FE a welcome performance boost.</p><p>On the optics side of things, the S24 FE will likely keep the same camera setup as its predecessor, including a 50MP main lens, a 12MP ultrawide, and an 8MP 3x telephoto.</p><p>While the camera specs are familiar, the new model is expected to come with a bigger battery, thanks to its larger body, which could mean longer usage times.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 FE is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-fe-fcc-certification-listing-launch-rumors">expected to stick with the same 25W charging speed</a> as its predecessor, keeping things consistent with the previous model.</p>

<ul><li>A massive batch of leaked information regarding the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Ultra might've left nothing for Samsung to tease.</li><li>The Ultra model is rumored to feature a 14.6-inch display with an S Pen, a 13MP primary lens, and an 8MP ultrawide lens on its back panel.</li><li>Rumors claim the devices will retain the same battery capacities as the Tab S9 series and they may hit the shelves in "Moonstone Gray" and "Platinum Silver."</li><li>The tablets may launch in October alongside the Galaxy S24 FE.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We might be on the cusp of Samsung&apos;s next Galaxy Tab release, but the latest round of leaks might tell us all we need to know.</p><p>Information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/09/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-plus-images-specs.html">Android Headlines</a> begins with the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, stating the device could have a 14.6-inch display. Rumors claim it will be an AMOLED 2X "anti-reflection" screen; however, its proposed refresh rate is unknown. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9 Ultra</a> offers a Super AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, so perhaps we&apos;re in for an upgrade.</p><p>Speaking of the past, the Tab S10 Ultra is still rumored to feature a design similar to its predecessor. The leaked imagery suggests it will retain that notch at the top-middle of its display, housing the selfie lens. Moreover, the publication claims that the upcoming iteration will sport "thinner bezels."</p><p>It&apos;s hard to discern the truth through the renderings, meaning we&apos;ll have to wait once it&apos;s in hand.</p><p>Speculation states the Tab S10 Ultra will debut with a 13MP primary camera and an 8MP ultrawide lens for its dual array. It&apos;s suspected that the front will continue Samsung&apos;s trend of dual-12MP lenses (wide-angle and ultrawide) like last year.</p><p>The tablet is rumored to deliver up to 16GB of RAM and a maximum of 1TB of storage. Rumors suggest consumers can "expand" the device&apos;s storage. The Tab S9 Ultra could do that, too, so long as you had a microSD card handy. Additionally, an 11,200mAh battery could greet consumers, meaning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-s10-ultra-charging-speed-leak">we&apos;re unlikely to see a change</a> in this department.</p><p>Consumers may find the tablet available in "Moonstone Gray" and "Platinum Silver" colorways.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the leaks dive into the Tab S10 Plus, which might launch with a smaller 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X "anti-reflection" screen. This tablet&apos;s battery is supposedly hitting the market with a 10,090mAh capacity like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">the S9 variant</a>. The similarities continue as the report states users may see up to 512GB of storage and only 12GB RAM.</p><p>Similar to the proposed Ultra model, the Tab S10 Plus seemingly sticks close to the S9&apos;s design. Additionally, rumors purport that the cameras on the S10 Plus will remain similar to the Ultra option. The difference lies in the selfie camera, which is reportedly a singular lens at 12MP.</p><p>Speculation claims the Plus and Ultra will receive an IP68 rating for dust and water and share the same color choices.</p><p>There&apos;s little doubt that the Galaxy Tab S10 duo will arrive <em>without </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>, especially following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-galaxy-ai-same-design-leak">a recent leaked image</a> of its transcription capabilities. The current leaks haul in even more information, suggesting the tablets will be capable of Circle to Search, Note Assist, Drawing Assist, Photo Assist, Interpreter, Live Translate, and Chat Assist.</p><p>Another rumor from last week theorizes that Samsung could upgrade the keyboard accessories for its next series with a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-galaxy-ai-key-keyboard-rumor">Galaxy AI key</a>." With One UI 6.1.1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-one-ui-611-is-finally-here-for-these-galaxy-phones">finally hitting devices</a>, the rumored AI features alongside this quick AI shortcut seem plausible.  It&apos;s currently unknown how this AI key would work and if users can customize which features they&apos;d like to surface when pressed.</p>

<ul><li>Google's fight against the EU's proposed ~$2.8 billion fine against it for antitrust practices has ended following arguments with the region's highest court.</li><li>The EU's investigations showed that Google conducted antitrust practices with its comparison shopping services in 2017.</li><li>Google is currently wrapped in two other antitrust investigations: one for the AdTech space and another regarding the U.S. DOJ.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A long-standing antitrust case between Google and the EU has come to an unsavory conclusion for the former.</p><p>As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-court-upholds-googles-27-bln-eu-antitrust-fine-2024-09-10/">Reuters</a>, the European Union&apos;s 2.4 billion euro (~$2.8 billion) antitrust fine against Google will stand. This case between the two parties stretches back to 2017 when the EU deemed Google guilty of abusing its dominance in the search industry by pushing its comparison shopping service above the competition.</p><p>The publication cites a CJEU judge standing firm on the matter stating, "in particular, the conduct of undertakings in a dominant position that has the effect of hindering competition on the merits and is thus likely to cause harm to individual undertakings and consumers is prohibited."</p><p>This isn&apos;t the first time Google has tried to appeal this major antitrust lawsuit against their practices in the realm of shopping. Though things began in 2017, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-loses-appeal-against-eu24-billion-eu-antitrust-fine">appealed the ruling in 2021</a> and Europe&apos;s second-highest court promptly dismissed its attempt. The court reiterated at the time that Google favored its comparison shopping service and put itself in a more favorable position amongst consumers.</p><p>That initial appeal three years ago saw the court confirm "the amount of the penalty and rejected Google&apos;s arguments that no penalty should have been imposed on it."</p><p>All that was left was for Google to take its arguments to Europe&apos;s highest court. We&apos;ve already seen the outcome of that today as the EU will stand with its antitrust fine, causing Google to lose once more.</p><p>Tough times continue as Google has two more ongoing legal battles: its dominant position in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-statement-objections-google-ad-business">the AdTech space</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-doj-could-break-up-google-following-ruling">recent DOJ ruling</a> in the U.S. Regarding the former, Google was accused of making its AdX ad exchange platform stand higher above the competition in 2023. The European Commission found that the company made it "difficult" for its competitors to compete with it due to the process behind the ad exchange process.</p><p>If guilty, Google would violate Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).</p><p>In the U.S., the Department of Justice is still deciding whether or not to break up Google following its illegal monopoly ruling. The DOJ has considered forcing Google to break up, which would see the company divest Android and Chrome. Alternatively, Google could be forced to share more data with the competition.</p>

<hr>
<p>Apple took to the stage on September 9, 2024, for its annual iPhone show, debuting the iPhone 16 series. While the dedicated camera button took center stage, another feature didn&apos;t get much attention, and for good reason. The display on both the $800 iPhone 16 and $900 iPhone 16 Plus is still the same tired old 60Hz OLED that Apple has been fleecing customers with for years.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300">best Android phone under $300</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">CMF Phone 1</a>, sells for just $200—with a $289 RAM and storage upgrade option—and sports a 120Hz LTPS OLED panel. That means its display can run at a buttery smooth 120Hz and drop down lower than that to save battery when needed. A 120Hz display makes even cheap phones feel fast, and similarly, a 60Hz display makes even the fastest phones feel sluggish and ancient.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>A 120Hz display makes even cheap phones feel fast and, similarly, a 60Hz display makes even the fastest phones feel sluggish and ancient.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>To make matters worse, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/greengart/status/1833216951818088877">hands-on photos</a> show that Apple has done nothing to improve the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> rate of its phones, once again leaving them at a slow 480Hz flicker rate. The CMF Phone 1 utilizes a much more eye-friendly, flicker-free dimming method above 18% brightness, then switches to 960Hz PWM dimming below that. In other words, if you&apos;re worried about eye health or sensitive to flickering lights or displays, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Phone-256GB-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0D7ZT1XDC/">saving over $500</a> on a CMF Phone 1 is the smart buy.</p><p>The CMF Phone 1 even sports the same 2,000 nits peak brightness level as the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, so it&apos;s nice and easy to see outside.</p>

<p>Looking back at history, seeing Apple lag behind with display specs isn&apos;t a big surprise. The company&apos;s first phone with an OLED panel, the iPhone X, launched seven years after Android phones began adopting OLED. Similarly, the first Android phone with a 120Hz display, the Razer Phone, launched in 2017, while it took until the iPhone 13 in 2021 for Apple to follow suit with its first 120Hz phones.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Apple has long lagged behind Android phones in display quality, often taking years to adopt new and better features.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Since then, Apple has kept 120Hz as a "pro-level" spec, which is reserved for its most expensive phones. In other words, if you want a display that&apos;s at least partly up to spec with some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200">$200 Android phones</a>, you&apos;ll need to spend at least $1,000 to get it on the iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p>On the flagship level, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> comes in at around the same size as the iPhone 16 with the same price tag—that&apos;s $799—and sports a 120Hz LTPO display that can go from 60Hz to 120Hz dynamically. It also comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> and a host of truly interesting AI tricks up its sleeve like the amazing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a> that gets <em>everyone</em> in the group photo.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The one area where Apple continues to excel is processing speed, and the comparison isn't even close.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The obvious advantage Apple has over any Android phone on this list is the A18 processor, which is more powerful than most Android chips. However, we don&apos;t yet have benchmarks for direct comparisons. We do know that Apple claims a 15% improvement in AI processing, which will set it apart significantly in this area.</p><p>For reference, the Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> in most Android flagships is the slowest in AI-based processing tasks based on Geekbench AI scores, with scores of 485, 485, and 1117 in each of the three test results. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> inside the Google Pixel 9 lags behind in the first test with a score of 289 but handily beats the Snapdragon in the next two tests with scores of 4145 and 6103, respectively.</p><p>Apple&apos;s older A17 Pro chip boasts scores of 3878, 21324, and 26213. No, those aren&apos;t typos, and the A18 is supposed to be even faster than that. If we&apos;re playing an AI processing race, Apple wins handily.</p><p>However, Apple doesn&apos;t seem to be using all this extra processing power to do anything truly new, particularly with the display. The company is launching a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens</a>-like feature on the iPhone 16 series, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everything-the-iphone-16-and-apple-watch-series-10-stole-from-android">Android users have been enjoying these same features since 2017</a>. Likewise, even camera features like computational processing were pioneered by companies like Google and have been staples of Pixel and Nexus phones for over a decade.</p>

Apple isn&apos;t one to introduce drastic hardware changes year-on-year; what it does better is roll out unique features that actually make a difference.</p>

<p>This year, that honor belongs to Camera Control, a button that&apos;s located on the lower right corner. The button is available on all iPhone 16 models — including the standard variants — and that&apos;s good to see. As the name suggests, Camera Control is a dedicated button that lets you launch the camera, take photos and videos, and adjust modes — all without having to interact with the viewfinder.</p><p>It is essentially a capacitive button with a haptic motor that delivers feedback, and it is pressure sensitive. The best part is the versatility it offers: a short press launches the camera, and once you&apos;re in the viewfinder, another short press takes a photo, and a long press starts recording video.</p><p>My favorite feature is the ability to adjust the zoom level just by swiping on the button; I constantly fiddle with the lenses on my phones, so that&apos;s bound to come in handy. Of course, the ability to launch the camera and take photos or videos with a button isn&apos;t new on Android — most phones have that feature baked into the power button.</p>

<p>In fact, ASUS offered a similar feature on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-9-review">Zenfone 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10</a>, integrating a capacitive module into the power key that had decent customizability. The ZenTouch key allowed you to pull down the notification pane to view notifications, scroll through websites, and even adjust media playback. It was one of the best features on previous Zenfone devices, and I&apos;m annoyed that ASUS didn&apos;t retain it on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a> this year.</p><p>That said, I want to see a similar button make its way to more Android phones. It isn&apos;t unreasonable to think that might be the case; Android brands love borrowing features from the iPhone, as evidenced from the half-baked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oxygenos-14-dynamic-island-ui-clone">Dynamic Island clones</a> you get with ColorOS. A hardware button to control the camera has greater potential on Android — particularly on devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> and Vivo X100 Ultra, which have outstanding cameras.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="W8xJKgVsSyPpMnfebUDHJn" name="xiaomi-13-ultra-kit-12.jpg" alt="Shutter button of Xiaomi 13 Ultra camera kit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W8xJKgVsSyPpMnfebUDHJn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Xiaomi doesn&apos;t offer any extra buttons on the 14 Ultra, it sells a Photography Kit that&apos;s fantastic; it includes a case, a photography grip that attaches to the device, and it has a 1500mAh battery. The attachment brings a traditional shutter button, record button, an adjustable dial, and zoom controls, and it utterly transforms the 14 Ultra, making it easier to hold the phone and take photos and videos.</p><p>Using the accessory with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra made me realize that there&apos;s a definite need to have physical camera controls, and if it can be achieved by offering something like Camera Control, then manufacturers need to start doing so on Android. Chinese brands in particular have pushed the boundaries of imaging tech over the last two years, and hardware buttons to make the cameras easier to control would go a long way — at least in my own use case.</p>

<ul><li>While users expect a sooner Galaxy S24 FE launch, a new leak reveals interesting color options.</li><li>The latest leak shows the device from all angles, including in Graphite, Blue, Green, and Yellow hues.</li><li>After FCC, the Galaxy S24 FE reaches WPC, pointing out the device's wired and wireless charging speeds.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As Samsung is almost done with the major phone launches this year, the Fan Edition phone of the flagship series is yet to see the light of day. While we await the launch, a new leak reveals the device&apos;s design and some interesting specs.</p><p>You can see the full gallery of images over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/09/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-colors-renders-images.html">Android Headlines</a>, which has shared images of the upcoming Galaxy S24 FE color options, revealing the device in Blue, Graphite, Green, and Yellow. Per the renders, the upcoming mid-range phone from Samsung can also be seen from all angles, revealing an interesting flat design similar to the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series, as opposed to the predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>, which featured slightly rounded corners and edges.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="UeFPKLTfKuBBWJ8V9RboxB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-FE-leaked-render-colors.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S24 FE in four colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UeFPKLTfKuBBWJ8V9RboxB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new design appears to be a welcome change, and the colors look promising, too. Graphite looks interesting over regular black, while blue and green look more conventional. Yellow seems to be a new addition to the Galaxy S24 FE, and Samsung recently introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-now-comes-titanium-yellow">Yellow Titanium</a> shade as well.</p><p>The publication showcased five colors, but the Silver option appears missing. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-marketing-images-leak">earlier leak</a> (as shown in the featured image) also showcased the device&apos;s colorways. Samsung is likely to have the device ready in five color options when it launches.</p>

<p>Aside from the colors, both sides of the device will have a glass back. It will have a flat display with a punch hole cut out and thinner bezels measuring 1.99mm. The display will likely be 6.7 inches with Full HD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is expected to be up to 1900 nits and will be offered with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ protection.</p><p>Some of the specs were leaked earlier through marketing images. The device sports three rear cameras: a 50MP primary camera, a 12MP ultrawide-angle lens, and an 8MP telephoto sensor.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Galaxy S24 FE bearing the SM-S721U model number has reached the Wireless Power Consortium website, according to tipster Abhishek Yadav. This comes after the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-fe-fcc-certification-listing-launch-rumors">FCC certification</a>. The WPC not only confirmed the device&apos;s wireless and wired charging speeds but also confirmed its design.

<ul><li>A report claims to have obtained information regarding the Galaxy Tab S10's pricing in Switzerland.</li><li>The rumor states the Tab S10 series will feature Wi-Fi and 5G connectivity and that the prices of both devices could jump by a couple hundred bucks.</li><li>The Tab S10 series is rumored to gain a "Galaxy AI key" for its keyboard accessories and is suspected to look awfully similar to the Tab S9.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s been rumored consistently that Samsung&apos;s next tablet series will only offer two devices; however, this new rumor claims it&apos;ll come at a higher cost.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Tab S10 Ultra prices have reportedly come into the possession of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://svztechinfo.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-global-pricing-revealed/">svztechinfo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-tab-s10-prices-switzerland-leak/">SamMobile</a>). The publication claims that the prices regard Samsung&apos;s marketing of its tablets in Switzerland. Both devices will supposedly have two connectivity options: a Wi-Fi and a 5G variant.</p><p>Starting with the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, its Wi-Fi variant with 12GB (RAM) and 256GB (storage) will potentially go for 1179 CHF (~$1,389). The higher 12/512GB configuration will reportedly hit shelves for 1299 CHF (~$1,531).</p><p>For its 5G option, the Tab S10 Plus may see a 1319 CHF (~$1,554) price tag in Switzerland for the lower RAM/storage setup. The higher configuration may see 1419 CHF (~$1,672).</p><p>The publication claims the Ultra model will feature three RAM/storage choices: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, and 16/1TB. Its purported prices are as follows in order from lowest to highest configuration:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Wi-Fi</strong> - 1399 CHF (~$1,649)</li><li>1519 CHF (~$1,790)</li><li>1829 CHF (~$2,156)</li><li><strong>5G </strong>- 1549 CHF (~$,1826)</li><li>1669 CHF (~$1,967)</li><li>1979 CHF (~$2,332)</li></ul>

<p>As the publication noted, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Ultra</a> models featured the same RAM/storage and connectivity options. However, this time, it states the prices are roughly $170 to $200 higher than last year&apos;s Android tablets. It&apos;s worth advising that these U.S. estimates are truly <em>estimates</em> and that Samsung can always rework the pricing to fit the region.</p><p>Samsung has been rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-drops-basic-tab-s10-rumors">to focus on larger displays</a>, starting at 12 inches and ending at around 14.6 inches for the Ultra model. These tablets are expected to feature AMOLED screens alongside the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-s10-ultra-charging-speed-leak">boring charging speeds</a>. A rumor from August claims the tablets will continue to offer 45W wired fast charging. If consumers are looking for change, it seems that it will come from other areas, as 45W has become quite a trend for Samsung.</p><p>Speaking of, the Tab S10 duo was recently rumored to feature a change to its keyboard accessories in the form of a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-galaxy-ai-key-keyboard-rumor">Galaxy AI key</a>." The report claimed that the key would arrive for basic keyboard accessories and ones provided in cases. It&apos;s unclear what this key could look like, but speculation states the key would give users quick and easy access to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-galaxy-ai-same-design-leak">provided Galaxy AI features</a>.</p>

<ul><li>The Google Pixel Stand 2 was introduced alongside the Pixel 6 series and offered a streamlined charging experience and great software features for $79.</li><li>The charger wasn’t compatible with the new Pixel 9 Pro Fold due to the placement of its charging coils.</li><li>Now, it appears the Pixel Stand 2 is officially discontinued as it’s no longer available for purchase on the Google Store.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The charging speeds and compatibility offered by the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a> was a hot topic when the four phones were launched, and there’s a new development in the saga. After the Pixel Stand 2 was marketed as delivering the fastest wireless charging speeds for the Pixel 9 lineup, it is now “no longer available” from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Google Store</a>. The apparent discontinuation comes after the Pixel Stand 2 was found to be incompatible with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> due to the placement of its charging coils.</p><p>As of Thursday, Sept. 5, people who tried to purchase a second-generation Pixel Stand from the Google Store found that the “add to cart” button was greyed out (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/05/google-pixel-stand-2nd-gen/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Other parts of the Google Store show that the product is “no longer available” or redirects to the store’s homepage. The Pixel Stand 2 is still available at third-party retailers, like Best Buy, as of Sept. 8. However, it’s unclear how long retail stock will last or whether new stock will become available when existing inventory runs out. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-stand-2nd-gen-charger-review">Pixel Stand 2</a> has been available for purchase since 2021, but things have gotten complicated as the Google Pixel lineup continued to expand. It’ll work with most Pixel phones, as well as select compatible models of Google Pixel Buds. However, the entire situation became finicky with the release of the original Pixel Fold last year. It only supported 7.5W of wireless charging, even when paired with the Pixel Stand 2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ig2feRhJcB7YDn6fLWTRMM" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-made-you-look.jpg" alt="Made You Look on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ig2feRhJcB7YDn6fLWTRMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Things somehow got worse with the release of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. It’s better than the original Pixel Fold in just about every way — I’ve been using them side-by-side for about a week and can’t believe this is a generational jump. However, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is incompatible with the Pixel Stand 2 outright. Whereas most Pixel devices have centered wireless charging coils, the coils on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold are placed lower. This means that, without coming up with a janky solution, the $1,800 Pixel 9 Pro Fold won’t work with the $80 Pixel Stand 2.</p><p>This development is disappointing as Google continues marching toward a complete ecosystem that can rival the likes of Apple and Samsung. However, people still use the Pixel Stand 2 for many reasons, including reliability and fast-charging support for most Pixel phones. However, the lack of support for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watches</a> has left some prospective buyers and current Pixel Stand 2 owners disappointed.</p><p>That leads us to the present. While the Pixel Stand 2 was available for purchase alongside the release of the entire Pixel 9 series, it’s now “no longer available.” The timing is strange, to say the least. It’s possible that Google saw the mixed response to the aging Pixel Stand 2’s compatibility concerns and decided to pull it altogether. If there was a Pixel Stand 3 ready and waiting, you’d think we would’ve seen it at August’s launch event. After all, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-launch">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> were showcased there and won’t be available until Sept. 26.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google about the Pixel Stand 2’s availability and the potential for a successor, but did not hear back in time for publication. We will update this article with more information if we receive a response.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="MrDsyumahA4xLEVKAP5ykR" name="google-pixel-buds-pro-pixel-stand-v2-case-open.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Buds Pro in charging case on Pixel Stand v2 with case open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MrDsyumahA4xLEVKAP5ykR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Due to the incompatibility of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold with the Pixel Stand 2, I’ll admit that I’m surprised we didn’t see a redesigned Pixel Stand 3 arrive at last month’s Made by Google event. The fact that a successor didn’t arrive alongside the Pixel 9 series and how the Pixel Stand 2 was seemingly discontinued quietly doesn’t give me much hope that we’ll see another Pixel Stand. I hope to be wrong because the Pixel Stand 2 was one of the better first-party chargers out there, thanks to its elegant look and unique software features.</p><p>The other reason why I’m doubtful we’ll get a Pixel Stand 3 is due to how large the Pixel lineup has become. When the second-generation Pixel Stand first debuted, Google only sold a few very similar phone models each year. Now, the Pixel lineup is massive. Google introduced four phones last month alone, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Google Pixel 9a</a> is presumably still on the way. Five phones per year, multiple pairs of earbuds, a tablet, and two smartwatches make the Pixel lineup tough to cover with a single charging accessory.</p><p>The varying sizes and form factors in the Pixel family today make it hard for a single charging stand to fit them all. Rather than offering a charging stand, I wonder if a charging pad could be in the works. Samsung does that with some of its wireless chargers, and it means that a variety of phones, earbuds, and other products can charge comfortably—regardless of the exact placement of their charging coils.</p><p>Still, I know there are <em>a lot</em> of people who love the Pixel Stand, so there’s certainly a market for the Pixel Stand 3 if Google can work out some of the kinks.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's next flagship Galaxy S25 Ultra renders are out showcasing its design.</li><li>It will likely have more flatter sides than the predecessor and cameras similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</li><li>The latest leak also reveals interesting camera specs of the upcoming Ultra model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After carrying similar design elements for the last two models, Samsung is likely trying to spice things up next year with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Thanks to a new leak, the first possible renders of the flagship phone are now out, revealing some exciting design changes.</p><p>Prolific leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer, aka OnLeaks, has revealed new renders of the Galaxy S25 Ultra in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra">Android Headlines</a>. In these renders, we can see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phone</a> from all angles with the latest design changes.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK #FutureSquad... Here finally comes your very first and very early look at the #Samsung #GalaxyS25Ultra (360° video + stunning 5K renders + dimensions)!😏On behalf of @Androidheadline 👉🏻 https://t.co/6oqZVqQlMI pic.twitter.com/RTDbuVeVrc<a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1833524605006336407">September 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The primary difference between the Galaxy S25 Ultra and its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, is the frame, which appears to be completely flat. The Galaxy S24 Ultra has a slight curve on its sides, while the top and bottom are more or less completely flat, but the S25 Ultra appears to be flat across the entire frame. </p><p>Another interesting element is that Samsung appears to be slowly moving away from the previous look of its rear camera lenses in favor of all-black sensors. This approach appears similar to what we have seen on the latest Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>That said, we should take the renders with a grain of salt, as Iceuniverse points out that there are some mistakes with the render, including the design of the cameras.</p>

<p>Speaking of, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is believed to carry the 200MP H2 primary camera accompanied by a 50MP ISOCELL JN3 sensor acting as an ultra-wide-angle lens, notes Android Headlines. Users will also see the 10MP IMX754 lens acting as a 3x telephoto camera and another 50MP IMX584 lens acting as another 5x telephoto lens.</p>

<p>The publication further notes that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be lighter in hand, weighing around 219 grams, while the previous iteration weighed 232 grams. With the new design, the upcoming Ultra will also appear smaller, although it will retain the same screen size as the S24 Ultra. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-dimensions-leak">A recent leak</a> also revealed the dimensions of the phone, pointing to a thinner device.</p><p>Like the previous Ultra models, the upcoming model will feature the same 5000mAh battery and, again, support up to 45W wired charging. Other expected specifications include the yet-to-be-launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> chipset. Interestingly, the renders also seem to omit the S Pen, although it seems likely it will be included with a dedicated slot as previous models have been.</p><p>Per the latest renders, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will have a boxy overall look, flatter sides with a glossy finish, and a tad bit lighter to go easy on your hands. The launch of the Galaxy S25 Ultra is still several months away, and these are the first renders that showed up today, so we expect to consider these renders with a grain of salt.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>HMD has a new phone on the horizon, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_us/hmd-fusion?sku=101SQ503H043">HMD Fusion</a>. If you simply look at the tech specs, it&apos;s a decidedly middle-of-the-road device with a great $299 price tag and a few great additions like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sustainable-repairable-phones">easy repairability</a> and a 5,000 mAh battery, but those aren&apos;t the greatest things about the phone. That would be the metal pins across the bottom rear of the phone and what they represent.</p>
<p>The Fusion is not really a modular phone because you simply can&apos;t build one; some parts are permanent. Instead, we get the next best thing. Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-mods">Motorola&apos;s Moto Mod system</a> before it, you can switch out the back of the Fusion with customizable shells that are integrated with the phone&apos;s OS, software, and hardware.</p><p>Some of the shells HMD has announced are mostly cosmetic and colorful, while others offer a degree of functionality like a ruggedized body or integrated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins">Qi2 charging</a>. Others, like a gamepad or a shell with a ring light integrated right into the camera app, bring features to the Fusion that wouldn&apos;t otherwise exist.</p>
<p>And still, that&apos;s not the best part. The system is fully open hardware. Everything you need to design a shell and develop software to power something new and different is free from HMD and free for you to use to make your own products. Using free resources from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_us/fusion-development-toolkit-download">HMD</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/">Google</a> alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-apps-3d-printing-hit-or-miss-tons-fun">a 3D printer</a> is all you need to design and develop something great—or at least great to you.</p><p>The one problem is that this innovation comes from a small player like HMD. I like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">what HMD has been trying lately</a>, and I think its products offer good value when it comes to buying a nice phone. There are things I don&apos;t care for, and no company is perfect, but I&apos;m warming up to its products.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.13%;"><img id="ETn6QVPvMddEasEA6uXXck" name="HMD FUSION ALL OUTFITS & GAMING.jpg" alt="HMD Fusion" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ETn6QVPvMddEasEA6uXXck.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1404" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HMD)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But let&apos;s be honest for a moment; nothing a company like HMD does will make much of a difference. There are three companies making phones that matter: Samsung, Apple, and Google. For the actual hardware and feature set, even Google doesn&apos;t make much of a splash, and it is important only because it fosters Android itself.</p><p>There&apos;s always a chance that a phone like the Fusion will gain attention, but it&apos;s a very slim chance. With an idea this good, that&apos;s a shame. The people working for Samsung who design phones are incredibly bright and full of ideas, but somewhere out there is someone who would do something better because they&apos;re doing it for fun. They aren&apos;t working; they&apos;re just trying things because they can. Without any budget to adhere to, a person with some simple tools and a curious mind can do something <em>better</em> than all the engineers at a company like Samsung.</p>
<p>We see some innovation from companies that are doing things differently every year. None of it ever matters because the Samsungs of the world refuse to take a chance the same way <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-are-oneplus-3-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">OnePlus did</a> back in the day or the way HMD is doing right now.</p><p>I&apos;d love to buy a Galaxy model designed for makers and tinkerers. I already spend a lot of my free time goofing around with electronics, and it&apos;s a large part of my background. I don&apos;t know what I could "invent," but I know I would have a lot of fun while trying and failing. And I know I&apos;m not alone.</p><p>Instead, I&apos;ll be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_us/hmd-fusion/buy?sku=101SQ503H043">buying an HMD Fusion</a> when it goes on sale here in the U.S. later this year. If you like to "mess" with stuff, you might want to do the same.</p>
