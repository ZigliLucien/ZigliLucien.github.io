You can tag your run with "#GlobalRunningDay" on your social media app of choice and probably get some love from fellow runners. Simple!</p><p>For those motivated by challenging other runners, rewards, medals, or other swag, we&apos;re here to help. You can find plenty of organizations, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-apps-android">running apps</a> that treat Global Running Day as a serious event.</p><p>Here&apos;s how we recommend getting the most out of Global Running Day 2024!</p>
<h2 id="run-or-walk-a-virtual-5k-2">Run (or walk) a virtual 5K</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3300px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:77.27%;"><img id="nbnYJMhdRNfst4sanrZUbd" name="Global-Running-Day-2024-cheet-sign.jpg" alt="A Global Running Day 2024 cheer sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nbnYJMhdRNfst4sanrZUbd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3300" height="2550" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NYRR)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>New York Road Runners (NYRR) conducts the "official" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nyrr.org/Races/VirtualNYRRGlobalRunningDay5K" target="_blank"><strong>Global Running Day 5K event</strong></a>. At that link, you can register for the event — it&apos;s free so long as you don&apos;t want to pay for a Brooklyn Half Marathon entry — and sync your Strava account. </p><p>Once you&apos;re registered, you have until June 9 to run a 5K and upload it to Strava; your name and result automatically appear on the leaderboard and will climb the ranks if you upload a faster 5K in the contest window. Now you can compare your best effort against runners around the world, which is some awesome motivation!</p><p>Another major aspect of this event is fostering a love of running in children. You can also find a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nyrr.org/youth/active-at-home/virtual-challenges/global-running-day" target="_blank"><strong>Virtual Rising NYRR Global Running Day Kids Run</strong></a> that encourages you to "pledge" to run or walk a mile with your kid between now and the end of June. Then you can print out a bib for your child to wear and a finisher certificate for them to hang afterwards, to reward them for working hard.</p>
<h2 id="find-a-local-running-club-or-event-2">Find a local running club or event</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A3RqLHv9Ssu2dU4mCznxLY" name="strava-live-segments.jpeg" alt="Strava app showing Live Segment records" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A3RqLHv9Ssu2dU4mCznxLY.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3200" height="1800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We can&apos;t list out every local running event out there, but plenty of organizations use Global Running Day as a pretense to gather for social running. They&apos;re typically open to newcomers and will run at a reasonable, matching pace. </p><p>Check social event sites like Eventbrite or Meetup, or look at local Clubs in Strava, where they might list Global Running Day meetups. Then do a quick search for local running, sports, or shoe retail locations in your area; they often have running clubs that meet regularly at that storefront. Even if they don&apos;t, the store&apos;s workers may have scuttlebutt on local running events you may not know about!</p><p>Otherwise, I recommend simply Googling "Global Running Day [your city name]" and seeing what comes up. </p>
<h2 id="motivate-yourself-with-digital-rewards-or-audio-frights-2">Motivate yourself with digital rewards or audio frights</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b9AuNgniECpxjapT9pxmNg" name="fantasy-hike-screenshots.jpeg" alt="Screenshots of the Fantasy Hike app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b9AuNgniECpxjapT9pxmNg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1520" height="855" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Fantasy Hike app </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Forge7)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re more of a solitary runner, you may still get a rush of endorphins when your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watch</a> or app gives you a reward for hitting certain fitness goals. If so, you may be interested to know that some brands specifically reward you for working out on Global Running Day.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a> owners who run at least 5K on Wednesday will get that limited-edition award in the photo above, for you to look at in your Apple Fitness award shelf. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> owners will get a limited-time "Global Running Day 2024 badge" simply by recording any running activity on June 5. It&apos;s not a "Challenge," so you don&apos;t need to opt into anything to get the badge.</p><p>I didn&apos;t find any other specific badges related to Global Running Day aside from the aforementioned Strava NYRR challenge badge. But you can still look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-favorite-running-and-walking-apps-for-motivation">motivational running or walking apps</a> like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.walkthedistance&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank"><strong>Walk the Distance</strong></a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantasy-hike/id1557127861" target="_blank"><strong>Fantasy Hike</strong></a><strong> </strong>that convert your steps into progress towards a goal, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-zombies-run-marvel-move-helped-me-hit-personal-best">Zombies, Run! missions</a> that will turn your 5K run into a life-threatening race against zombie foes that feels more meaningful.</p>
<h2 id="turn-global-running-day-into-a-habit-2">Turn Global Running Day into a habit</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.87%;"><img id="zgAxnAYx5jbYqVzqmmNTSQ" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-review-HERO.jpeg" alt="The Polar Vantage V3, showing the wearer's VO2 Max score after a Running Fitness test." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zgAxnAYx5jbYqVzqmmNTSQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everyone worries about making New Year&apos;s resolutions, but starting fitness goals in the middle of summer when nights are long and warm makes more sense. You can <em>start</em> a fitness renaissance on Global Running Day, and then try to keep up your momentum after work ends.</p><p>One simple goal almost anyone can accomplish (with dedication) is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">walking 10,000 steps a day for a month</a>, as I did last summer. You can make your personal goal 6,000 or 8,000 steps; the number is mostly arbitrary, according to doctors, so long as you&apos;re generally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">moving and standing during the day</a>. But walking consistently is the starting point for being able to <em>run</em> more consistently. </p><p>Another goal is to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">improve your VO2 Max</a>, or your body&apos;s ability to convert as much oxygen into energy as possible during exercise. Most fitness watches estimate your VO2 Max or "cardio fitness level" based on your activities, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-i-love-polars-manual-vo2-max-and-recovery-tests">Polar lets you test your VO2 Max</a> directly. </p><p>Regardless, improving this stat encourages you to make your runs more purposeful. Max-effort intervals, hill training, or sprints can all help you improve, but you&apos;ll also want to mix in low-aerobic activities at about 55–75% of your max heart rate, to improve your body&apos;s ability to move without immediately overworking your heart. Watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a> can help guide you on the right training to steadily improve.</p>
<hr>
<p>If this is all getting a bit overwhelming, just remember this: Global Running Day 2024 isn&apos;t meant to be a gatekeeping event for runners, but rather a way to inspire anyone and everyone to join in on the experience. If you want to treat this as a one-off workout and leave it at that, then that&apos;s totally okay.</p><p>Now, get out there on the nearest trail, track, or treadmill and enjoy the day!</p>

<ul><li>Google has started rolling out Android 15 Beta 2.2 to enrolled Pixel users.</li><li>The patch aims to solve some persistent problems users still reported involving "Private Spaces" alongside some issues with NFC.</li><li>The company quickly pushed Beta 2.1 to users in May following severe issues with Private Spaces.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is starting to push another "minor" update for Android 15 Beta 2, which seeks to fix problems caused by the beta&apos;s initial rollout.</p><p>The company detailed the contents of the Beta 2.2 patch in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1d7cjx4/android_15_beta_22_now_available/">post on Reddit</a>. According to the notes, enrolled Pixel owners should begin receiving an OTA (over-the-air) patch labeled as version AP31.240426.023.B4. This update will apply to those with devices ranging from the Pixel 6 up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>, and 8a.</p><p>The Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet are also getting in on this minor patch. The download size for the Pixel 8 Pro has been reported to be 55.78MB. However, another user reported a 2.57GB download. </p><p>Google explains that Beta 2.2 continues to focus on the lingering problems users have faced with "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">Private Spaces</a>." The patch solves an issue where "creating a private space on a device for the first time removed app icons from the Home screen."</p><p>Additionally, there are a couple of crucial fixes for Pixel devices&apos; NFC capabilities. The patch explains that a fix for the "Wallet role" that previously a device&apos;s NFC feature from functioning should be solved. NFC payments that failed to progress should also be fixed with the Beta 2.2 patch.</p><p>The remainder of the fixes, as detailed in the full changelog, are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed an issue where the app drawer didn't open when swiping up.</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused videos that were recorded using 10-bit HDR to have a green tint.</li><li>Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability, interactivity, and connectivity.</li><li>Fixed issues that sometimes caused mobile data connections to drop, even when the device was receiving a strong cellular signal.</li></ul>

<p>With Google continuing to fix problematic issues, one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1d7cjx4/comment/l6ykqkk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user on Reddit</a> stated that the share sheet bug persists despite the patch. It seems as though the bug was marked "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/340936670">closed</a>," per another user&apos;s comment, but the fix hasn&apos;t been implemented.</p><p>As usual, Google states that enrolled testers should give their devices around 24 hours before picking up the OTA update. Users can check manually by hopping into their <strong>Settings > System > System updates </strong>to check and begin downloading/installing.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-rolls-out-android-15-beta-21-in-haste-following-user-woes">rolled out Beta 2.1</a> for Android 15 quickly in May following severe problems with Private Spaces. Users reported that after interacting with the feature and assigning apps to its secluded space, they found that Private Spaces deleted icons from their home screens. Beta 2.1 pushed hurriedly to users to fix those problems and we&apos;re seeing with its 2.2 patch that some lingering issues were still around.</p>

<ul><li>The latest system update brings a new "Full PWM" option to the Vivo X100 family.</li><li>This new setting enables 2160Hz PWM at all brightness levels, an improvement over the previous 360Hz.</li><li>Full PWM is the latest candidate for a more eye-friendly, flicker-free way of dimming OLED displays.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Vivo just unleashed its latest weapon to combat eye strain for folks who are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitive</a>, and it&apos;s something many users have been asking about for a long time. The latest June update for the Vivo X100 series of phones introduces a new "Full PWM" option in developer settings, supercharging the PWM rate from 360Hz to a rather eye-friendly 2160Hz.</p><p>This update is surprising because Vivo is introducing a major new feature half a year after debuting the X100 series instead of reserving this kind of feature for a new phone release. If you have a Vivo X100 series phone, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/community-guide/273205728/how-to-enable-developer-options-on-android-pixels-6-secret-android-tips?hl=en">enable developer options</a>, then find the "Full PWM" option inside developer options to test it out.</p><p>Previously, the 2160Hz frequency wouldn&apos;t kick in until the phone reached low brightness, which meant some PWM-sensitive users had difficulty using it at high brightness levels. Enabling Full PWM mode ensures that this rate stays consistent at 2160Hz, a number verified <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PWM_Sensitive/comments/1d6eonz/vivo_x100_pro_new_full_pwm_mode_measured_with/">by one Reddit user</a> using an Opple Light Master light meter, the same meter I use for phone reviews on Android Central.</p><p>One reviewer, linked in the video below, shows how the perceived pulse rate has been notably lowered with the new update, keeping it under the magic 15% number that often causes eye strain.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pbp7WkQjo6Y?start=494" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Our own Harish Jonnalagadda tested his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro review</a> unit and confirmed the numbers, showing that Vivo&apos;s new update provides not only a high PWM rate but also a sine-shaped waveform. Typically, a sine wave shape has smoother transitions between on and off and is more comfortable for users as it more closely mimics an incandescent bulb.</p><p>As a quick refresher, PWM dimming is a method display manufacturers use to lower or raise the perceived brightness of certain types of displays. This method flashes the screen on and off rapidly, often hundreds or thousands of times per second, tricking our eyes into thinking the display is brighter or dimmer depending on how long the display stays off during these periods of flashing.</p><p>OLEDs most often use PWM dimming and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-display-flickering">some users like myself</a> have been negatively affected by this dimming tactic, getting headaches, eye aches, and even nausea when the flickering frequency is too low. A higher flickering frequency generally lowers the potential for these negative affects.</p>

<ul><li>Strings in Google's app point toward the possibility of an upcoming Spotify extension for Gemini.</li><li>The discovery highlighted two strings: a message informing users that their content is starting and another prompting them to "sign in."</li><li>YouTube Music recently picked up its Gemini extension, providing users with a host of prompts for Gemini to begin playing their custom playlists or radios.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A discovery in Google&apos;s app seemingly points toward the company working on another music-related extension for Gemini.</p><p>As spotted in version 15.22.2 of the Google app by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-google-gemini-extension-coming-soon-apk-teardown-3448585/">Android Authority</a>, a Spotify extension for Gemini might be on the way. The availability of a Spotify extension would (ideally) let users quickly access their created playlists and discover songs, genres, artists, and more.</p><p>The app&apos;s code isn&apos;t extensive, as the dive only uncovered a couple of strings. Firstly, it looks like Gemini will alert users that it&apos;s beginning their play session as the string reads "Starting to play on Spotify." This could be the message users see after telling the AI to play a certain song or playlist.</p><p>Following that is a string that states "Spotify requires sign-in." A requirement like this isn&apos;t anything strange as all of Google&apos;s extensions require the user&apos;s account before proceeding.</p><p>Aside from the light discovery, there wasn&apos;t anything else in the Google app&apos;s code to give us more to work with. There&apos;s hope that the Spotify extension will work on the web and the Android variant of Gemini, but we&apos;ll have to wait a while before knowing.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, YouTube Music <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-youtube-music-extension-rollout">picked up a Gemini extension</a> for its web app and on Android. Google highlighted on its support page that users will have access to an array of prompts for the bot for different actions. Users can tell Gemini to find a specific song by a particular artist or start a radio station for a specific genre.</p><p>After signing in, your entire YouTube Music library of custom playlists becomes accessible, and you can prompt Gemini to play one.</p><p>In other news, Spotify <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotifys-price-hikes-and-lack-of-hifi-make-me-want-to-own-music-again">recently detailed</a> a price hike users should prepare for. Beginning in July, consumers who&apos;ve purchased the Individual Plan will see the price rise by a dollar from $10.99 to $11.99. Moreover, those with Spotify Premium Duo and Spotify Premium Family will experience a sharper increase.</p><p>The former will rise by $2 to $16.99, while the former is set to jump by $3 to $19.99.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s AI chatbot <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> has been encountering issues as users begin reporting strange instances of gibberish.</p><p>A user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleGeminiAI/comments/1d7lw4u/i_think_i_broke_it/">on Reddit</a> posted a screenshot of a response from Gemini, which was full of jumbled pieces of code and characters from other languages (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/04/google-gemini-gibberish-repeating-word-replies/">9to5Google</a>). In the user&apos;s provided photo, Gemini responded with a massive chunk of repeating words that didn&apos;t help the user with their query.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleGeminiAI/comments/1d7use9/anyone_knows_what_is_this/">Another report</a> showed the AI responding to the question, "If 0 was a Roman numeral, how would it look?" Gemini delivered another huge wall of text full of words and symbols that didn&apos;t help. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleGemini/comments/1d7ee8y/not_cauchy/">Redditor posted</a> an example of Gemini being completely off base when asked about satellite TV channels.</p><p>The AI promptly delivered a wall of "Not Cauchy, Cauchy, Cauchy," which is about the Cauchy Sequence, a mathematical concept.</p><p>While not widespread, these problems with Gemini are annoying at worst. The AI isn&apos;t entirely broken, as a quick refresh or asking the question again has seemingly worked fine. The publication notes that Gemini&apos;s odd gibberish responses have been reported on the web and its mobile Android variant.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s generative AI has been on a weird kick lately as users may remember its AI Overviews delivering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-head-of-search-ai-overview-fix-inbound">erroneous responses</a>. Users were receiving tips to glue cheese onto their pizza and a multitude of other outlandish ideas. The company&apos;s Head of Search Liz Reid chimed in last week, stating that this is likely the result of its AI not understanding how to weed out "nonsensical" and "satirical" questions.</p><p>Such questions create an "information gap" as the questions aren&apos;t typical, so there&apos;s not much (factual) information. Google&apos;s AI pulls much more "user-generated" content which, as we all know, can be a little <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overview-problems">on the humorous side</a>. Reid stated Google has gone to work to implement a limiter for Search&apos;s AI to reduce the "inclusion of satire and humor content."</p>

<hr>
<p>We know how Google is trying to integrate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> into all its apps; the newest addition is to YouTube Shorts.  </p><p>According to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167/youtube-test-features-and-experiments?hl=en">blog post</a>, YouTube is testing a new feature called the "Dream Screen." This feature uses text-based prompts to generate AI images/videos that can be used as green screen backgrounds for Shorts. It is currently being tested only on a small group of people to let them "bring their imagination to life."</p><p>If you&apos;re the "chosen one" for this experiment, you can access this feature by opening the YouTube app > <strong>Create</strong> > From the right menu, tap <strong>Green screen</strong> > From the bottom, <strong>select Create an Image or Video</strong>.</p><p>After that, users can describe the content they&apos;d like to use and tap on "<strong>Create Preview." </strong>For instance,  if you&apos;d want the Shorts&apos; background to be an "enchanted rainbow flower forest or a fancy hotel pool on a tropical island," you can simply type in the prompt in the space provided.</p><p>YouTube will then create the AI-generated background with the user&apos;s prompts— showing multiple options. Users can then pick the option that closely matches their prompt, use the image/video as a green screen to record themselves and tap on <strong>Upload Short </strong>to publish.</p>
<p>While all this may sound pretty magical,  Google is cautioning users about sharing confidential or personal information that users wouldn&apos;t want Google’s products, services, and technologies to utilize in the future. </p><p>However, the bigger issue is that there isn&apos;t any confirmation of whether YouTube Shorts will indicate when a video uses Dream Screen&apos;s AI-generated backgrounds. This means that there&apos;s no way to differentiate between an AI-generated background and a real location that was filmed by a creator. </p><p>While it remains unclear whether or not Dream Screen is here to stay for good, the company said it will keep other creators posted on its plans to roll out the feature  "later this year."</p><p>In May, YouTube also experimented with instrumental-only soundtracks in Shorts with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-watermarks-for-ai-generated-music">Dream Track tool</a> introduced in November 2023. This AI tool whips up original tunes mimicking the style of your favorite singers a suite of experimental tools designed to help creators make fun, unique music for their Shorts. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>It appears that Google's repair policy allows it to retain Pixel devices containing unauthorized parts.</li><li>Similar practices by Samsung suggest a potential industry trend limiting independent repair options.</li><li>Google's policy also discards accessories sent in with Pixels for repair.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent discovery by a YouTuber highlights Google&apos;s sneaky repair policy meant to confiscate your Pixel if it&apos;s got parts the company didn&apos;t approve.</p><p>A recent discovery by YouTuber <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n4y9mrep9Y" target="_blank">Louis Rossmann</a>, reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-keeps-phones-with-non-oem-parts-3448350/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, revealed a potential point of contention within Google&apos;s service policy. The policy, effective since July 19 of last year, grants Google the right to retain Pixel devices sent in for repair if unauthorized components are discovered. This raises questions regarding consumer choice and repairability within the tech industry.</p><p>The specific clause, as found on Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/device-repair/" target="_blank">website</a>, states: "You will not send in a Device containing non-Google-authorized parts – if You do, Your Device will not be returned to you."</p><p>A key caveat within Google&apos;s repair policy pertains to the use of non-authorized components. Individuals who choose to use aftermarket parts for Pixel repairs should be aware that Google reserves the right to retain the device should it be sent in for subsequent repairs containing such parts.</p><p>This policy creates a bit of a clash between your right to fix your own stuff and Google wanting to keep things under their control.</p><p>The recent discovery of Google&apos;s anti-consumer repair policy echoes a similar controversy that surfaced around two weeks ago. Leaked Samsung service contracts revealed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/leaked-samsung-contract-user-data-device-disassembly">protocol mandating repair technicians to immediately dismantle and report devices containing non-OEM parts</a>.</p><p>This recurring trend suggests a potential industry-wide practice, raising concerns about consumer choice and restrictions on independent repair options within the mobile tech sector.</p><p>But that&apos;s not all. The document supposedly spilled the tea on a practice that might be a privacy nightmare. Apparently, Samsung wanted repair shops to hand over a ton of customer data in exchange for genuine parts. We&apos;re talking names, phone numbers, IMEI details, and all the juicy details about why the phone needed fixing in the first place.</p><p>Google&apos;s repair policy extends beyond component scrutiny. Any accessories, like your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-pixel-8-cases">favorite Pixel 8 cases</a>, adorning your Pixel during its repair journey will likely be relegated to the lost and found bin, assuming your phone even passes the "authorized parts" inspection.</p><p>This throws some shade on Google&apos;s repair practices. The company wasn&apos;t exactly known for sunshine and rainbows before when it came to fixing Pixels, and now this policy adds another layer of frustration.</p>

<p>Summer Games Fest might officially air this Friday, June 7th, but Meta isn&apos;t saving all the big announcements for Geoff Keighley&apos;s annual show. Instead, we&apos;ve already got a slew of new games, Quest updates, and even free-to-play weekends to look forward to over the next few months.</p><p>Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded is officially coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> as an exclusive title, featuring dual-wielding for the first time in the series history as well as mechanics built for the ground up for VR, a completely new visual overhaul, and more. You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/8012387035448196/">preorder it now for 10% off</a>.</p><p>We just published our hands-on of one of the biggest VR games of the year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/behemoth-hands-on">Skydance Games&apos; Behemoth</a>, which can be described as Shadow of the Colossus meets Dark Souls. Plus, we expect a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-alien-rogue-incursion-meta-quest-3">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> trailer and gameplay for Alien: Rogue Incursion at the Games Fest show this Friday.</p>

<p>Beat Saber fans just got a free new update with OST 7 which includes five new songs by F.O.O.L., Camellia, Teminite x Boom Kitty, Lindsey Stirling, and Nitro Fun. In fact, this new Lindsey Stirling song is making its debut <strong>first</strong> on Beat Saber, meaning you won&apos;t be able to hear it any other way until the new album debuts in a few weeks.</p><p>Workout app Supernatural is getting a mixed-reality mode just in time for that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/alo-moves-yoga-mixed-reality-quest-3">mixed-reality yoga game</a> to launch, meaning you&apos;ll be able to see your living room while you work out with your headset on. That adds a lot of confidence to your workouts which is good since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/supernatural-vigorous-cardio-new-mixed-reality-mode/">a new study</a> proves that VR workouts are as effective as cardio workouts like running, swimming, boxing, and cycling.</p>

<p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-update-v66-beta-features">Meta Quest update v66</a> is introducing lots of new features, the Quest 3 is getting improved passthrough with less distortion, as seen in the above GIF. That means the room around your hands won&apos;t warp as much as before, making mixed reality look significantly better, as a result.</p><p>That should make the aforementioned mixed-reality experiences much nicer and will even lend to better experiences while viewing videos and movies. That&apos;s especially true now that Netflix will work completely through the built-in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/browser/1916519981771802/">Quest Browser</a>, and should make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/travel-mode-lufthansa-airplane-flight-entertainment/">travel mode</a> a lot nicer to use now that it&apos;s fully rolled out to everyone.</p><p>Speaking of watching things, 20 new WNBA games will be streaming live to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/xtadium/7281839885191361/">Xtadium app</a> on Meta Quest, meaning you can grab courtside seats with full 180-degree VR viewing, making it feel like you&apos;re <em>actually</em> there. If you&apos;d rather see your living room with a giant stadium in the middle of it, that&apos;s also now an option.</p>

<ul><li>Your first Samsung Galaxy Watch might be unable to install apps next year.</li><li>TizenOS support clarified upcoming changes coming to the operating system from next year to a Reddit user.</li><li>The first changes will occur in September this year, and all TizenOS-powered smartwatches will be affected.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s first Galaxy Watch shipped with Tizen OS, followed by the next batch of Samsung smartwatches featuring the same operating system. It&apos;s been a while since Samsung cared about the Tizen OS — as most new ones come with WearOS. The Korean tech giant looks like it is officially pulling the plug next year.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1d4m0z7/samsung_is_dropping_galaxy_store_support_for/">Reddit user</a> who interacted with Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Store Operations team (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-tizen-smartwatches-galaxy-store-termination-schedule-3447771/">Android Authority</a>) revealed some interesting details about the Tizen OS and its future support for Galaxy Watches released before the Watch 4 series. Predominantly, Tizen service "will only be available until September 2025," the team noted, citing Galaxy Store&apos;s policy.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1d4m0z7/samsung_is_dropping_galaxy_store_support_for">Samsung is dropping Galaxy Store support for Tizen Watches </a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch">r/GalaxyWatch</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Currently, Tizen OS-powered smartwatches released by Samsung include the Galaxy Watch, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review">Galaxy Watch 3</a>, Active 1, Active 2, Gear, and others launched before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a> series — all the aforementioned will be the primary devices losing support in phases. Starting September 30, the Galaxy Store won&apos;t provide paid Tizen watch content.</p><p>Secondly, Tizen OS users cannot download new watch content from the Galaxy Store after May 31, 2025, while the already downloaded apps "will still be available" unless users delete them from their smartwatch. If the users delete them, they won&apos;t be available to re-download after September 30, 2025.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="BWFYukKJW7UMmPt6RN8e93" name="galaxy-watch-3-45mm-black-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 45mm Black" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BWFYukKJW7UMmPt6RN8e93.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Per the publication, the Tizen developer portal also no longer allows new Tizen watch apps or updates. Despite a successful run of Tizen OS with the first Galaxy Watch and the succeeding models until the Galaxy Watch 3, Samsung chose to shift to WearOS since the Galaxy Watch 4. Hence, Samsung&apos;s ending support for Tizen OS is an expected move. </p><p>However, users of the earlier Galaxy Watch models may have to settle for the current and upcoming versions from Samsung, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> series, which is anticipated to launch alongside the foldable phones in July. Alternatively, users can continue to use the services through the next year; as Samsung notes, "core services related to this watch will stop everywhere except Galaxy Store after May 2025." In that case, they can look for an upgrade.</p><p>It is also worth mentioning that Samsung is unlikely to shut down Tizen entirely as the company still runs the Tizen operating system on some of the Smart TVs available in the market.</p>

<p>Enabot never lets us down with its quirky smart robots. The brand&apos;s products are designed to be pet companions but also home security cameras at the same time. Combining several functions into one capable product makes a lot of sense and also maximizes value for money.</p><p>More than anything, though, Enabot&apos;s pet robot pals have a fun personality and that&apos;s what gives them life. It makes robots like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/smart-home/enabot-ebo-air-review">EBO Air</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/enabot-ebo-x-review">EBO X</a> fun to use. The addition of wheels is what really sets these smart cameras apart from the overcrowded sea of smart home surveillance gear available. You can move your Enabot robot around the house from anywhere in the world, as long as your phone has internet connectivity.</p><p>Enabot has added a new member to its family, introducing the RolaPet PetPal to the brand&apos;s smart robot lineup earlier this year. What makes the newest member so different is that it is shaped more like a robot vacuum rather than the round Enabot pet pals of the past. Needless to say, I was intrigued and decided to go hands-on with the device.</p>

<p>Enabot launched the RolaPet PetPal on March 21, 2024, along with two modular extensions for the robot that can be bought separately, as well as a cloud subscription service. The Cloud+ Subscription service gives you access to 24/7 cloud playback, smart alerts, and daily pet vlogs. It doesn&apos;t take away much from the experience if you don&apos;t get the subscription since there&apos;s local storage and the option to store images and videos on your phone. But you definitely need the extensions to tap into the robot&apos;s full potential.</p><p>Setting up the RolaPet PetPal is extremely simple. It hardly took me ten minutes to set it up, including downloading and logging in to the RolaPet app. I don&apos;t know why Enabot creates a whole new app for every robot. At this point, I have three different Enabot apps on my phone.</p>

<p>The app itself is user-friendly and pretty straightforward. You can control two-way comms with it, make the RolaPet PetPal play tricks, toggle night mode, automatically play tag with your pet, set it to randomly shoot pictures, or do a host of other things. The "head" bit on top of the 2.5K QHD camera unit is also a big button, and every time your cat or dog taps it, they can give you a call on your phone.</p><p>I love, love, love the fact that Enabot brought back the cutesy sounds of the robot. Everything from it saying its own name, uttering "pew pew", or screaming "ouch" when it bumps into obstacles is hilarious. The playful moves that were missing on the EBO X are back, although there&apos;s no Alexa integration. I can live with that — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-alexa-speaker">Alexa speakers</a> don&apos;t cost much anyway.</p><p>Each of the modular extensions for the RolaPet PetPal unlocks different options in-app. There are two extensions that you can swap out the basic storage unit with: a treat dispenser and interactive toys. By the way, switching the extensions takes just a few seconds of your time.</p>

<p>Enabot did a very good job with the RolaPet PetPal, and there&apos;s one extremely enticing feature about the smart home camera: the price. Following up after the thousand-dollar EBO X, this thing only costs about $230.</p><p>It would be an unbeatable bargain if it weren&apos;t for the add-ons that cost $50 apiece. That&apos;s darn expensive for modular extensions meant to do one or two functions each. Luckily, you can get a bundle deal with everything included for about $300. If you&apos;re interested in buying this robot, I&apos;d suggest the bundle deal.</p>

<p>While I am very happy with the Enabot RolaPet PetPal, there are a few downgrades to consider. I won&apos;t compare it to the EBO X because they&apos;re just very different kinds of products. Looking at just the RolaPet PetPal on its own, it has room for improvement based on my testing.</p><p>Firstly, Enabot really needs to fix the robot&apos;s charging station positioning software. It took nearly an hour for the Enabot RolaPet PetPal to go back to its charging station. Actually, it never made it back a couple of times. Those times, I got tired of hearing it bumping and sighing and just ended up putting it back at its station manually.</p><p>Another big problem with the RolaPet PetPal is that its controls are not as smooth as some of Enabot&apos;s other smart cameras on wheels. Its movements are jerky and sometimes feel choppy when being controlled manually via the RolaPet app. I checked my internet connection just to make sure that wasn&apos;t the issue, and it wasn&apos;t it. Hopefully, a firmware update can fix these issues.</p><p>Lastly, I have a bone to pick with the basic Enabot RolaPet PetPal attachment that you get out of the box. It has no practical use at all. The compartment is basically a storage box with no functions or features. Why bother including it at all? Enabot could just give users the option to buy the RolaPet PetPal with a treat dispenser or toy add-on instead of the stupid storage extension. It feels like a shameless money grab.</p><p>Enabot has promised more modular extensions down the line and I&apos;m excited to see what they deliver. The robot&apos;s self-charging function is essential for a camera-on-wheels and the feeding compartment is a game changer. You can literally chase your pets from outside the house and feed them at will. If you&apos;re into robots and leave your pets at home for extended periods, the Enabot RolaPet PetPal is a fun and useful smart camera to have.</p>
