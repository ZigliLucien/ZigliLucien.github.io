<p>If you’re looking to get into the Samsung Galaxy world but don’t have thousands to spare, the Samsung Galaxy A35 is a solid budget phone worth considering. You get tons of great features, long battery life, and the peace-of-mind knowing it is supported by years of software and security updates.</p></p>

<p>Even though the Google Pixel 7a is a generation old and considered a budget Pixel device, it still sports impressive features when it comes to functionality, cameras, and even aesthetics. It’s a budget phone that doesn’t look nor act like an affordable option that saves you some coin.</p></p>

<p>If you’re in the market for a budget phone, whether it’s for yourself, an older parent, a younger child, or even as a secondary device to use alongside a work phone, the Samsung Galaxy A35 vs. Google Pixel 7a is a head-to-head comparison worth examining. Both phones are considered affordable models in the respective line-ups. But they are impressive in many respects.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BSwt6DXZkofsYCEn5E8Xv9" name="samsung galaxy a35 water.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A35 wet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BSwt6DXZkofsYCEn5E8Xv9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy A35, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-galaxy-a55-and-a35">introduced in March 2024</a> (shown above alongside the similar A55), comes in Iceblue, Lilac, Navy, or, in some countries, just Black. It sports a 6.6-inch FHD+ Infinity-O Super AMOLED display with 2,340 x 1,080 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, impressive given the price. It taps out at 1,000 nits peak brightness, but with Vision Booster, you can still get a pleasurable experience when viewing the screen outdoors in bright sunlight. </p><p>To keep the price down, it has a plastic frame, but this is combined with a glass back featuring the linear camera layout with a flat housing. The screen is Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+, so it’s relatively durable for a phone in this price range. </p><p>Boasting an IP67 water- and dust-resistant rating, the 5,000mAh battery is rated for up to two days of battery life, which is great for power users. It also supports Super Fast Charging, though you’ll need to buy the 25W wall charger separately since this one doesn’t come in the box. Wireless charging is also supported. </p><p>Available with either 128GB or 256GB storage, the good news here is that unlike many of the latest smartphones, the Samsung Galaxy A35 does have a memory card slot. It can accommodate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD cards</a> up to 1TB in size, so add this to the overall cost, as you’ll probably need one.</p><p>Additional features include USB-C, Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, 5G, a fingerprint reader, and face unlock. Some users report that the optical fingerprint scanner takes a few seconds to register your print before unlocking the device, which may be frustrating for some. It has stereo speakers as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="imgvxRR8FUb2cmw5XGDHNL" name="Google-Pixel-7a-back-08.jpg" alt="The back of the Charcoal Google Pixel 7a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imgvxRR8FUb2cmw5XGDHNL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>You can choose from a variety of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-pixel-7a-should-you-buy">colors for the Google Pixel 7a</a>: Sea, Charcoal, Snow, and a Google-exclusive Coral finish. It’s a much more compact phone with a 6.1-inch display, which will be important if screen size matters to you, and you want something bigger. </p><p>The screen is an FHD+ OLED with a slightly higher 2,400 x 1,080 pixel resolution. It offers the same 1,000 nits peak brightness with a high brightness mode option similar to Samsung’s Vision Booster. Android Central’s Nicholas Sutrich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">reviewed the Google Pixel 7a</a> and didn’t have any issues viewing the screen outdoors in direct sunlight. </p><p>Since it’s a smaller phone overall, it’s also lighter in weight. The screen is covered with scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 3, which has a fingerprint-resistant coating. This is combined with the 3D thermoformed composite plastic back with a tactile alloy frame and visor. Sutrich observes that the phone looks just as expensive as its higher-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-review">Pixel 7</a> sibling, though he notes that it can be slippery without a protective case and attract lots of dust and fingerprints. </p><p>You’ll only get an up to 90Hz refresh rate, but in Sutrich’s experience, the phone is “buttery smooth.” With that said, if you plan to do a lot of gaming, you might prefer the Samsung Galaxy A35, which has other features for games that we’ll discuss in the next section. </p><p>The Google Pixel 7a has the same IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and a slightly smaller 4,385mAh battery that can last for a day or more. There is an Extreme Battery Saver mode and support for both fast and wireless charging, so you can keep it going for longer. </p><p>A deciding factor for some may be that the Google Pixel 7a only comes in a single 128GB variant and does not have a memory card slot. While you can leverage Google Cloud storage with the phone, including using the free trial, this limits how much you can store on the phone itself. </p><p>Other features of the 5G phone include USB-C, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, fingerprint reader (which can be finicky at times as well), and face unlock. It has stereo speakers but does not support Spatial Audio like the more premium Pixel phones.</p>

<p>Before we dive deeper, let’s run down the specifications of these two comparable phones.</p>

<p>There are some notable differences and similarities between these two smartphones when looking by the numbers alone. But there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes as well.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a35-vs-google-pixel-7a-power-processing-and-more-2">Samsung Galaxy A35 vs. Google Pixel 7a: Power, processing, and more</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="86GdhXXZUA8bEU3A3EZNm9" name="samsung galaxy a35 gaming.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A35 gaming" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/86GdhXXZUA8bEU3A3EZNm9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung hasn’t officially confirmed what processor is in the Galaxy A35, but all evidence points to the Exynos 1380 octa-core processor, which is decent enough for most phones but won’t rival the top-tier ones. It comes standard with 6GB RAM, but some countries may get a variant with 8GB, although this isn’t fully confirmed. If you can get your hands on the 8GB RAM option, this phone will fall in line with the Google Pixel 7a. </p><p>Running on the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> OS with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">Samsung One UI 6.1</a> overlay, you get both the familiar Android experience with some Samsung personality added for good measure and customization of the look. The phone is supported by four generations of OS updates and five years of security, so if you decide you want something more premium a few years from now, you can hand this phone over to someone else, sell it, or trade it in and it will still have years of value left. </p><p>Along with security through Samsung Knox Vault, which can protect sensitive information like your PIN, password, and pattern, it can also encrypt your data. This is actually a pretty big deal as it’s the first time Samsung has introduced the technology to its mid-range line. A large vapor chamber cooling system will prevent the phone from overheating, even during demanding tasks like gaming. </p><p>The phone also works with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-transfer-old-galaxy-phone-new-one-smart-switch">Smart Switch</a> for easily transferring content and apps from another device as well as Quick Share for easily wirelessly sharing content, like photos and videos, with other users. You won’t find, however, the same Samsung DeX support you’d find in higher end Galaxy devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ncLYM4JiccDc7rKBGHDrEF" name="google-home-app-redesign-2023-dark-Pixel-7a.jpg" alt="The new Google Home app 2023 redesign in dark mode on a Google Pixel 7a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ncLYM4JiccDc7rKBGHDrEF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What about the Google Pixel 7a? It is powered by the Google Tensor G2 processor, a step down from the new G3 but still a pretty powerful processor, all things said and done. In his tests, Sutrich plated various mobile games and had no issues with performance. This is also thanks to the standard 8GB RAM. </p><p>Since the Google Pixel 7a was introduced in 2023, it ran the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> OS out of the box, but it is updateable to the latest OS. Google supports up to three OS updates and five years of security. Since Android 14 is the first, you only get two more OS updates. But Google also releases Feature Drops all the time. </p><p>Among the latest feature drops for the Google Pixel 7a include cool options like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pixel-call-assist">call assis</a>t, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-clear-calling-pixel-phones">clear calling</a>, real-time language translations, and more. Some of the latest AI features, like Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, should be coming to the Pixel 7a soon as well, so the phone is consistently kept fresh and new. But you won’t get all the AI features Google has to offer since many require the G3 processor.</p><p>Google has built-in security, too, for the Pixel 7a, including VPN by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a>, Tensor security, and the Titan M2 security chip. There&apos;s also end-to-end encryption, anti-phishing and anti-malware protection, and automatic security checks. So you&apos;ll get a secure experience with this phone, too.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="M7AAXjyzjpLpGQm8m5jD9N" name="Google-Pixel-7a-on-side-camera-bar.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 7a's metal camera bar up close" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M7AAXjyzjpLpGQm8m5jD9N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to camera performance, the Samsung Galaxy A35 provides decent cameras, but these won’t rival more premium phones, which is reflected in the price. The main camera has a 50MP sensor and it’s a wide angle one, along with the secondary back camera that is just 8MP ultra-wide, so don’t expect to get printable photos. There’s also a 5MP Macro camera you might have fun playing around with along with a 13MP front “selfie” camera. </p><p>Samsung promises improved Nightography performance with this phone’s cameras, offering clear photos with detail in low light. We haven’t played around with one yet, but you can expect typical Samsung performance in this respect. </p><p>There are also some cool photo editing features, including background blur, photo remaster, and the ability to erase shadows. You don’t get the more powerful AI photo editing options found in the more advanced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy phones</a>. If you just want to be able to take decent snapshots to share on social media, however, the cameras in this phone will suffice. </p><p>The Google Pixel 7a has wonderful cameras, including a 64MP Quad PD Quad Bayer wide camera, 13MP ultra-wide camera, and 13MP front camera. Google, too, offers useful photo editing features like Photo Unblur, Night Sight, portrait mode, Super Res Zoom, Frequent Faces, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, and Face Unblur. All of these practical fixes can turn otherwise throwaway pics into ones worth keeping. You won’t, however, see all the cool new photo editing features powered by AI that are available in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, like Best Take and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>.   </p><p>Nonetheless, in his review, Sutrich was impressed with the Google Pixel 7a cameras, saying they surpassed his expectations.</p>

<p>It’s time to decide between the Samsung Galaxy A35 and Google Pixel 7a. The Samsung Galaxy A35 is the newer of the two devices, and it will be supported for longer. It has a much larger screen and can support an optional memory card of up to 1TB, making it ideal for tasks like gaming and watching videos. If you prefer a larger phone size and plan to download tons of apps and take lots of photos and videos, the screen size and storage alone make the Samsung Galaxy A35 the better choice. </p><p>Google, however, excels in the camera department with the Pixel 7a. You’re limited in terms of storage, and it’s a much smaller phone. If you want something bigger with more storage, your best bet is to spend a bit more for the Google Pixel 8 instead. You also get more standard RAM with this phone, and while the battery is slightly smaller, you may find that it’s negligible with the fast charging options. The processor is also more powerful. </p><p>The price is right with both these phones, and they each have their pluses and minuses.

<p>The Google Pixel 7a is an older phone so it will only be supported for a few more years. But you get fabulous cameras, a fast processor, some cool photo editing options, and a more compact design with a smaller screen if that’s what you prefer.</p></p>

Grab an unlocked Galaxy A35 from Best Buy, for instance, and you&apos;ll get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-a35-5g-128gb-unlocked-awesome-lilac/6576851.p"><strong>free $40 gift card</strong></a> with your purchase, no strings attached. Activate the phone instead of going unlocked and you&apos;ll score a straight $100 discount in addition to the gift card. Either way, you&apos;re getting a sweet deal on a hot-off-the-presses Samsung device, which I&apos;d call a win-win. </p>

<p>The Galaxy A35 has only been out for a few days, and yet you can already grab the phone unlocked from Best Buy and get a sweet $40 gift card with your purchase. Activate the phone through a carrier on Best Buy's site and you'll also get a $100 discount, no trade-in required.</p>
<p>The A35 comes with Samsung's proprietary Exynos 1380 processor for some flagship-level performance, plus you get a 5,000mAh battery and loads of software support. Will the A35 earn its place among the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> of 2024? It's too soon to tell, but I certainly wouldn't bet against it. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-a35-5g-128gb-unlocked-awesome-lilac/6576851.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7103ee1f-64f7-4ad8-927a-42dcaf8ee394" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy A35 5G 128GB: $399.99 with FREE $40 gift card, or $299.99 with activation at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy A35 5G 128GB: $399.99 with FREE $40 gift card, or $299.99 with activation at Best Buy">View Deal</a></p></div>

Priced at just $399.99, the Galaxy A35 comes with an efficient Exynos chipset, a stunning 6.6-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and a microSD slot that lets you easily expand the 128GB of storage to up to 1TB. There&apos;s also 5G support and a 50MP camera, and Samsung is guaranteeing software updates for four generations. We may not be getting the Galaxy A55 here in the states, but thanks to the Galaxy A35, it feels like we&apos;re coming pretty darn close. </p>

<hr>
<p>Mobvoi is kickstarting its beta for TicWatch owners who&apos;ve been eagerly awaiting Wear OS 4.</p><p>The company posted a quick teaser in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2952679438107711/permalink/25315036631445339">Facebook group</a>, announcing the start of its Wear OS 4 beta for TicWatch Pro 5 owners. Mobvoi states its recruitment period for Pro 5 watch owners has started and users must fill out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIGSY6ePZJgpCvpceKG5DU4NcYHDfPKF49ZCED3IuBGw-JbA/viewform">a questionnaire</a> beforehand. The form will ask questions about your Android device, such as name, age, and more if you have the appropriate device.</p><p>Mobvoi has a few requirements before users can submit their names into the pool to be randomly chosen.</p><p>The company says users must retain confidentiality throughout the testing period, meaning no photos or videos of the software are allowed. If selected, users will be given an NDA to sign before being granted entry. This is similar to previous betas Mobvoi has launched for Wear OS 3. The company encourages any accepted testers to use their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> "daily" with the Wear OS 4 software and update it "promptly."</p><p>Moreover, discussions are encouraged (feedback, too). However, testers can only do this within Mobvoi&apos;s designated Slack group channels.</p><p>Mobvoi states its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a> beta recruitment period will last until April 30. If you&apos;re lucky, the company states that selected testers will be notified one week after its recruitment period concludes.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this is the start of Mobvoi getting back into the good graces of its consumers after many became <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-waiting-game">weary of the Wear OS 3 waiting game</a>. The company was lagging behind many of its competitors in the smartwatch space when it came to rolling out its Wear OS 3 update to eligible devices. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-explains-wear-os-3-holdup">finally explained</a> the cause for the delay in July 2023, stating its "proprietary dual architecture" was the culprit.</p><p>Mobvoi stated users could expect its Wear OS 3 update to arrive during Q3 2023, but that didn&apos;t happen. Instead, the update landed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-3-rollout">during Q4 in December</a> 2023 — two years after Wear OS 3 originally launched.</p><p>The company had to completely rework the internal architecture inside many of its devices a part of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ticwatch-pro-3-ultra-gps-review">TicWatch 3 series</a> for the software to function. There is hope that Mobvoi will get things right this time with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1</a> chipset and not force its consumers to wait another two years.</p>

<ul><li>A set of alleged "live photos" of the upcoming Pixel 9 Pro have leaked, and highlight several previously rumored changes.</li><li>The device is seen with a completely flat display, flat edges, and a thicker, Pixel Fold-like camera array.</li><li>The assumed Pixel 9 Pro "prototype" appears to feature 16GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, per its fastboot screen.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Live photos claiming to represent Google&apos;s upcoming Pixel 9 Pro have supposedly surfaced to give us a good look at what&apos;s in store.</p><p>The images were obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rozetked.me/news/33143-eksklyuziv-zhivye-foto-google-pixel-9-pro-ot-rozetked">Rozetked</a> (Russian) and are said to be of a Pixel 9 Pro prototype device. It&apos;s stated that the Pixel 9 Pro is "similar" in size to Apple&apos;s iPhone 15 Pro, which features a 6.1-inch display. A photo from the front highlights how flat Google is looking to keep the upcoming model.</p><p>On its back panel, the live snapshots showcase the previously rumored major change for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series: the horizontal camera housing array. The photos suggest that consumers will see a continuance of a triple camera setup.</p><p>The supposed images also give us a good look at how thick the Pixel 9 Pro&apos;s camera bump maybe once it officially launches. More importantly, the array doesn&apos;t cover the back panel from edge to edge. Instead, it&apos;s giving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> vibes.</p><p>Another note is that the sides of the device in these photos are quite straight, similar to Apple&apos;s iPhone line. It seems Google may opt for a more flat overall look for the device and with a more matte-like finish on the back panel, too.</p><p>Since the device in question is a "prototype," the device was only available in fast boot mode. This spilled smaller specifications like 16GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It&apos;s unclear if this signals an overall increase in RAM from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro&apos;s</a> 12GB or if this is another option.</p><p>Additionally, 128GB was the smallest available internal storage size last year, so perhaps we can expect the same later in 2024.</p>

<p>A batch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-renders-leak">leaked renders from January</a>, which a tipster claims is now of the Pixel 9 Pro, double down on these live photo contents. Those supposed renders showcased the Pixel Fold-like camera array change and suggested the device could arrive smaller with a 6.1-inch display. The device was also rumored to feature the Pixel 8 Pro&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-google-pixel-8-pro-temperature-sensor">temperature sensor</a>.</p><p>The Pixel 9 series isn&apos;t expected to launch until later this year, potentially in October if the past is anything to go by. A recent rumor states that the trio&apos;s Tensor G4 chip could feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-likely-to-bring-satellite-connectivity-to-pixel-9-series">Samsung&apos;s Modem 5400</a>, bringing satellite connectivity to the flagship models.</p><p>Other rumors say the Pixel 9 Pro isn&apos;t the last of the series in 2024, as Google could return the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">Pixel XL</a>" name. That device is rumored to feature a 6.5-inch display, signaling that Google&apos;s upcoming flagship trio might be smaller than the 2023 models.</p>

<ul><li>Meta is adding its artificial intelligence chatbot, Meta AI, to its four core social media apps: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. </li><li>Meta AI now uses Llama 3, the latest large language model (LLM) from Meta, and that results in faster image generation and other benefits.</li><li>The chatbot will be integrated into the existing search bar of these apps, making it easy to access without needing a standalone app. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta is finally deploying its full arsenal of artificial intelligence features, starting now. That includes a new large language model (LLM), Meta AI integration with core apps, and a new Meta AI web client. The company launched Meta AI in September 2023, and it has since appeared in limited fashion in Meta apps and on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses</a>. </p><p>Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/meta-ai-assistant-built-with-llama-3/">Meta AI will appear basically everywhere</a>, including in the default search bars on the company&apos;s four core apps: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. This move alone means that Meta AI will be put in front of billions of users, at least when the rollout concludes. In addition to becoming part of the apps&apos; search bars, Meta AI can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-starts-testing-meta-ai-on-whatsapp">still be accessed through app DMs</a>, and it will also begin showing up in the regular Facebook feed.</p><p>This release of Meta AI isn&apos;t fully global yet, but it will expand beyond the U.S. for the first time. Meta is debuting the chatbot in Australia, Canada, Ghana, Jamaica, Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It&apos;ll be limited to just English at the start, but Meta plans to expand on that in the future. </p><p>Alongside the expanded rollout of Meta AI, the company revealed an open-source LLM called Llama 3, which is the successor to Llama 2. It touts that Llama 3 can beat other LLMs of comparable sizes in benchmarks and succeed in real-world applications as well. But the killer Meta AI feature is the chatbot&apos;s ability to access Bing and Google in real time to respond to requests. This could give Meta AI an edge because chatbots reliant on LLMs become outdated virtually as soon as they&apos;re released.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1616px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.83%;"><img id="js3RDxmoUgmHaXUqohkCVA" name="Meta-AI-Image-Generation.jpg" alt="Image generation using Meta AI." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/js3RDxmoUgmHaXUqohkCVA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1616" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta also says that Meta AI is better at image generation, and its new trick is animation. After creating a still image, giving Meta AI a request like "animate" will turn the still into something like a boomerang GIF. It isn&apos;t quite text-to-video generative AI, but it&apos;s still a neat feature nonetheless. </p><p>Though Meta AI isn&apos;t fully released yet, there are plans for expansion already in the works. The company says it will bring Meta AI to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest</a> at some point, and the chatbot will presumably come to more languages and regions eventually too. You might not see Meta AI in Meta apps immediately, but a few Android Central staffers already noticed the chatbot in apps like Instagram. </p><p>Derivatives of the Llama 3 model are also in the works, including two smaller-sized variants and a larger multimodal version. If you don&apos;t want to use Meta AI in your apps, there&apos;s a new web client hosted at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.ai" target="_blank">meta.ai</a>.</p>

<p>The Sennheiser Momentum Sport launched in April 2024, and are available at a wide range of retail and online outlets. They start out at $329, and it may be some time before Sennheiser (or retailers) begin dropping the price for a better deal. They come in polar black, metallic graphite, and burned olive.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MvBUZRJFivz99QngMwosYW" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Sport-wearing.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Sport earbuds side view in ear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MvBUZRJFivz99QngMwosYW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking back at the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/sennheiser-sport-true-wireless-review">Sennheiser Sport True Wireless</a>, the company clearly went in a different direction with the Momentum Sport. A svelte build coupled with a reasonably custom take on fit and placement make these buds better suited to staying active. They come with three pairs of ear tips and four pairs of wings to help find the most stable fit. You can take that further with the Fit Test in the Sennheiser Smart Control app to figure out which tip gives you the tightest seal. As is always the case with earbuds, the tighter the seal, the thicker the bass.</p><p>Much of the actual surface is matte, covered with the rubberized trim of the wing. This combination proves very effective in holding the Momentum Sport buds in place at all times. While there were moments when I had to adjust them, they weren&apos;t common. If anything, the sensitivity of the touch controls made the adjustments somewhat frustrating.</p><p>What&apos;s easier to appreciate is that a good fit matches great sound, not least because Sennheiser gives you different ways to get there in the Smart Control app. The equalizer is a solid option for using presets or creating your own, while Sound Check is well worth going through to tweak the audio profile to your ears. It&apos;s a non-invasive process where you listen to tones at varying volume levels to set a benchmark EQ preset that differs from the default one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.58%;"><img id="CJpGiKwtTiJ8QEgPk2Nx8V" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Sports-screenshots-1.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Sport screenshots from Smart Control app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJpGiKwtTiJ8QEgPk2Nx8V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1466" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart Control is critical to managing everything the Momentum Sport buds can do. Sound Zones are another option where you can have audio and active noise cancelation (ANC) or Transparency applied based on where you are. It&apos;s a geolocation feature that requires the app to track where you are in order to apply the changes so that music and ANC sound different, say, in the gym, compared to in a quiet office. </p><p>You can&apos;t control noise cancelation the same way you can with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-review">Momentum True Wireless 4</a>, but you do have some flexibility in how Transparency and Anti-Wind work. Given the sound leans more toward bass response, the earbuds are ideally suited to the kind of tunes you might listen to while working out or running. Even if you prefer podcasts, there&apos;s a preset made for that in the app. </p><p>Either way, Sennheiser gives these earbuds the right sonic treatment. Music sounds great — even better when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">listening to hi-res tunes</a> using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">aptX HD Bluetooth codec</a>. You don&apos;t have to subscribe to a hi-res audio <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming service</a> to hear the goods here, but it is a bonus if you have that option. If the bass is too heavy, it&apos;s a simple thing to tweak in the app&apos;s EQ. </p>

<p>The bigger deal may be the fact that Sennheiser squeezes heart rate and temperature sensors into the left earbud, letting you keep track of heartbeat and body temperature metrics in real-time. You might think it odd to do it this way, given <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a>, fitness trackers, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">chest straps</a> already cover those features, but in-ear tracking is arguably more precise because nothing moves in the ear. There are no muscles or tendons contracting like those in the wrist that could potentially delay or throw off tracking. Here, it feels instant and continuous, which is a cool thing to have.</p><p>Sennheiser isn&apos;t doing it alone; it is partnering with Polar to make the earbuds tracker compatible with the Polar Flow app. While Sennheiser&apos;s app can always show you the basics, Flow tracks your actual activity, so you can go for a run or hike and glean more from the data the in-ear sensors help deliver. Polar Flow offers dozens of exercises to choose from, making things interesting if you ever want to compare the accuracy of the earbuds with that of a smartwatch or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness tracker</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.58%;"><img id="F5us6B2weFBQiGNf5b9SqU" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Sports-screenshots-2.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Sport screenshots showing integration with Polar.." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F5us6B2weFBQiGNf5b9SqU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1466" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The setup isn&apos;t all that hard when you have both apps installed on your phone, though you will need a Polar account to get it done (subscription not required). Tracking is quite accurate when the fit is nice and snug, adding confidence to any metrics you&apos;re keenly tracking throughout a day or workout. </p><p>As for sound control while staying active, don&apos;t expect ANC to match the best in the business, such as Sony or Bose. I would even argue Sennheiser&apos;s Momentum True Wireless 4 are better at blocking out background noise, but the Momentum Sport are still close. They dampen the clinks and clangs of the gym, as well as street noise, though aren&apos;t quite as effective with droning sounds like those on a subway train. </p><p>Transparency and Anti-Wind are solid, letting you control the effect you want. Anti-Wind is very good at cutting back gusts enough to make podcasts and phone calls sound clearer. You won&apos;t need it in quieter spaces, but it&apos;s nonetheless good to have when you have to take a call outside. Onboard wear sensors also automatically pause playback when you remove either earbud.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e3C3rJmnwoJaXf5mHhyoCU" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Sport-case-closed.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Sport earbuds in case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e3C3rJmnwoJaXf5mHhyoCU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Multipoint connections mean you can use the Momentum Sport with two devices simultaneously, perfect if you plan to utilize them for work or to watch something on one device while taking calls on another. I also like that you can accept an incoming call by simply taking either earbud out of the case, where it instantly connects and takes the call. Doing this ends up being a battery-saving move and negates having to wear the earbuds all the time in case calls come in.</p><p>Call quality is good, too. Sennheiser has long been good at this sort of thing, though I noticed callers felt it was obvious I wasn&apos;t talking through a phone.  </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sennheiser-momentum-sport-what-s-not-good"><span>Sennheiser Momentum Sport: What's not good</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1307px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cthDMb4cY8giQqhYxLuJXU" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Sport-close-up.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Sport earbud close up in ear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cthDMb4cY8giQqhYxLuJXU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1307" height="735" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve tested a ton of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>, and the Momentum Sport may be one of the most sensitive pairs I&apos;ve tried as far as onboard controls go. Anytime I had to adjust the fit, I ran the risk of inadvertently resuming play, skipping a track, or worse yet, hanging up on a call. The default sensitivity is set to Medium, which only makes the High setting feel like tapping on eggshells. Low isn&apos;t bad, but even there, you may end up with unintended consequences. Non-responsive controls are often a problem for wireless earbuds, but these somehow take that to the other extreme.</p><p>Battery life is another one that will require compromise and patience on your part. Sennheiser claims up to six hours per charge, but you&apos;re not likely to get that far if you factor in ANC, volume levels, and fitness tracking. There is a Battery Eco mode to help squeeze more life out per charge at the expense of the aptX codec. I get between four and five hours per charge, which is more than enough for workouts and runs but not quite as high as I would like to see for the price. </p><p>That also goes for durability. The IP55 protection for the buds themselves is pretty good, though I would think "sport" earbuds costing this much would ramp that up a bit. The case itself is IP54, and has a nice rubberized coating, only the lid isn&apos;t as secure as it should be. Hence, I would be wary of using the included lanyard to hang them. These are always better off in a pocket.</p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-review">Jabra Elite 8 Active</a> truly stand out as competitors in the search for sweaty earbuds, especially given their impressive IP68 protection, physical button controls, superior battery life, and cheaper cost.

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want more ruggedized earbuds for runs or workouts.</li>
  <li>You want very good sound and noise cancelation.</li>
  <li>You want customization and personalization.</li>
  <li>You want a comfortable fit.</li>

  <li>You want something even more ruggedized.</li>
  <li>You want more battery life.</li>
  <li>You prefer to spend less.</li>

<p>The Sennheiser Momentum Sport offer a lot out of the box and through the Smart Control app, but you have to pay a premium to get it all. These are expensive wireless earbuds by any metric, leaving it to you to make a calculated decision both for your own budget and the value you think you would gain from the unique integration available here.</p><p>They clearly sound great, and are rugged enough to handle most runs and workouts, along with all the customization in the app, so it&apos;s a compelling package. You won&apos;t come away disappointed with what they can do, though only you can decide if it&apos;s all worth it in the end.</p>

<p>Modern phones are designed to last; most devices will get at least three Android updates, allowing them to be relevant for several years after they&apos;ve launched, and in the case of the latest Google and Samsung devices, you will get seven years of software updates.</p><p>It will be interesting to see if these devices are able to hold up to the rigors of extended use — battery degradation continues to be a real issue that affects long-term use — but with features like optimized charging and slow charging available, you can reasonably get several years worth of use out of these devices.</p><p>And if you have an older phone that isn&apos;t getting much use, there are a lot of things you can do with it. I&apos;m sharing a few ways I reuse older phones that aren&apos;t quite capable of being daily drivers, but still have decent hardware.</p>
<h2 id="turn-it-into-a-security-camera-or-baby-monitor-2">Turn it into a security camera or baby monitor</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dXZmSn938KwwPDXRrYPu9S" name="earth-day-phones-4.jpg" alt="OnePlus 7T security" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dXZmSn938KwwPDXRrYPu9S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most security camera brands take a lackadaisical attitude toward customer data — just look at what Eufy got up to — so I&apos;m picky about the brands I trust. I used Nest cameras in the past, and while they&apos;re reliable and have a lot of useful features, they don&apos;t record any footage locally. Ubiquiti&apos;s UniFi Protect cameras are still the best choice if you need local storage, and I use them as outdoor cameras. The main issue is that it&apos;s a hassle to set up the network, as you&apos;ll need to use the cameras with Ubiquiti&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-ultimate-ubiquiti-unifi-home-network-2022">UniFi network gear</a>.</p><p>That&apos;s why I use an old phone if I need to record footage indoors. AlfredCamera is the best utility in this regard, and you can easily turn an old device into a security camera or baby monitor. Obviously, you can&apos;t use it as an outdoor camera, but if you want an indoor camera, you can reliably use your phone. AlfredCamera has a free tier lets you set up the camera and view footage, but any event-based recordings, zooming into the image, and HD video is locked behind a private tier that costs $5.99 a month or $29 annually.</p><p>I&apos;ve been using AlfredCamera in conjunction with an old phone for just over two months as a baby monitor, and it does everything I need. It has activity detection, two-way mic, continuously records footage up to eight hours, and stores events on the cloud.</p>

<p>If you have an older phone with a 3.5mm jack, you can turn it into a dedicated music player. Most music streaming services have a lossless tier, and while there are dedicated music players like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m11s-review">Fiio M11S</a>, they&apos;re basically phones without the cellular connectivity and additional DAC hardware.</p><p>Even if your phone doesn&apos;t have a 3.5mm jack, you can get a USB-C dongle — like the $30 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka11-review">Fiio KA11</a> — and pair it with IEMs to get much better sound. Music streaming isn&apos;t resource intensive, and an old phone holds up well as a media player. LG devices in particular had decent DACs built in, so if you have the LG G6, G7, or any of the V series models, you can easily use them to play media.</p><p>This is  a good route to take if you have a large offline music library and want to stream songs on a dedicated device. </p>

<p>The Boox Palma may just be the best choice if you want a pocket-sized e-reader, but you can also use an older phone. This is a particularly good choice if you have a phone that&apos;s older than five years — device makers cared about usability back then.</p><p>Bonus points if you have an old OnePlus phone; legacy OxygenOS versions have a Reading Mode that turn the screen monochrome, making these devices a terrific choice to read. I got a lot of utility out of that feature in the past, and it is annoying that OnePlus doesn&apos;t have anything as good in the current iteration of ColorOS.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-just-the-start-2">This is just the start</h2>
<p>Obviously, there are plenty of other things you can do with an older phone; you can set up an emulator and play retro games, use it as an alarm clock on your nightstand, or set it up as a smart home dashboard. I set up older devices with all of these use cases in mind, and at the end of the day, it&apos;s down to what you&apos;re looking to get out of your phone.</p>

<p>I/O 2024 is right around the corner, but Google probably just made a bigger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-hardware-team-restructuring-merge">announcement</a> than anything we&apos;ll see next month. Rick Osterloh is no longer just running devices and services, but instead, will take the lead for a new "Platforms and Devices" team. With this reorganization, Osterloh is now in charge of Android, Chrome, ChromeOS, Photos, and more, while still overseeing the Pixel team.</p><p>If it weren&apos;t for listing out all of the different departments, it might only seem like a surface-level change within Alphabet. However, there&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/building-ai-future-april-2024/">another major change</a> as Hiroshi Lockheimer will be starting "work on some new projects across Alphabet." While I&apos;m happy to see that Hiroshi will remain with the company, it will be a bit odd not to see him steering the Android and ChromeOS ship.</p>

<p>In a statement made to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133881/google-android-pixel-teams-reorg-rick-osterloh">The Verge</a>, Osterloh explained that AI was at the center of this dramatic reorganization. Considering how hard Google is determined to throw AI and Gemini into everything it can, this consolidation makes a bit more sense. But I can&apos;t help but feel as though we&apos;ve heard this before.</p><p>When Google unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tensor">Tensor chip</a>, it was under the premise that the hardware and software teams were working hand-in-hand. Essentially, giving the Pixel lineup the same treatment enjoyed by the iPhone, with the SoC being tweaked and tuned to the hardware it&apos;s powering.</p><p>There&apos;s an argument to be made on both sides as to whether Google has followed through on the proposition laid forth just a few years ago. But then, the consumer availability of AI was shot of out a cannon with OpenAI and ChatGPT lighting the fuse. Google fumbled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/now-is-the-wrong-time-for-google-bard">launch of Bard</a>, which has since been rebranded to Gemini. Meanwhile, Google continues to stumble a bit, as evidenced by its claiming that the Pixel 8 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-not-getting-gemini-nano">wouldn&apos;t be getting</a> Gemini Nano, only to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">backtrack</a> on those claims.</p><p>Not all hope is lost for Google, as it&apos;s still relatively early in the AI game. However, Osterloh needs to grab the bull by the horns, so to speak, and actually fix the problems that still plague users. That means turning Google into the leader it&apos;s supposed to be and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-better-at-updates-than-google">stopping Samsung from taking all of the credit</a>.</p><p>Perhaps this is the fundamental shift that is needed to avoid issues like Gemini Nano on the Pixel 8. Instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">promising seven years of updates</a>, don&apos;t make users of the most expensive Pixel phone feel like second-class citizens. Act like you own the place, and not just like you&apos;re a temporary resident. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Is this reorganization really just all because of AI? Probably not, but that's Google's story and its sticking to it.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It&apos;s not like this is Google&apos;s first foray into consumer-facing AI products or features. Pixel phones have long ranked among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, even when the camera hardware was laughably outclassed. This was all made possible by the Machine Learning models that were (and still are) being used on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review">Pixel phones</a>, which allow us to take a clear picture of the starry night sky.</p><p>The difference now is that Google is attempting to be more systematic in how it implements AI without being seen as falling behind. Rumors and speculation suggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/ios/ios-18/apples-major-iphone-ai-upgrade-could-have-no-cloud-processing-initial-wave-of-ios-18-features-will-work-entirely-on-device">Apple is planning</a> some big AI-focused announcements at its upcoming developer conference. But Google has a chance to get ahead of the curve simply because I/O is happening first.</p><p>If there&apos;s one common denominator between Google and Apple, it&apos;s that both Siri and Assistant are a bit lost. You can&apos;t get Assistant to reliably set a reminder, and while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-fiasco-proves-ai-is-moving-too-fast-for-googleso-whats-next">Gemini</a> might seem superior, it lacks a lot of the basic functionality we&apos;d expect. Sure, it&apos;s cool to ask Gemini to help you plan and book a trip, but go ahead and try asking it to turn off your lights. Meanwhile, Siri is laughable at best, so much to the point that I&apos;ve remapped the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-made-the-right-decision-to-ditch-the-mute-switch-on-the-iphone-15-pro">Action Button</a> on my iPhone 15 Pro Max to use Perplexity instead of invoking Siri.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Assistant fails me once again. Asked it to remind me in an hour to reply to an email. It performs a Google search instead.

<p>One recurring thought that I have is that it&apos;s almost like Osterloh is running a company (Pixel) within a company (Google) within a company (Alphabet) This thought is driven even further home <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/building-ai-future-april-2024/" target="_blank">after reading</a> that "the Google Research teams focused on computational photography and on-device intelligence will also be moving over to join the new org to bring deep AI expertise across platforms and devices."</p><p>In doing so, Osterloh has essentially all of the functioning bodies of a phone manufacturer reporting to him. Basically, I think of it as Osterloh forming a "Pixel Phone" company without going the startup route like Carl Pei did with Nothing. Not to mention the added benefit of having teams of people he&apos;s already familiar with, combined with the financial backing of Google/Alphabet. </p>

<p>We knew that Google would be working to implement AI into the devices and tools that we use every day. It really was only a matter of time, but there&apos;s just one more aspect of today&apos;s announcement that has left me scratching my head. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon provided the following statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133881/google-android-pixel-teams-reorg-rick-osterloh#:~:text=And%20Cristiano%20Amon%2C%20the%20CEO%20of%20Qualcomm%20and%20one%20of%20the%20first%20people%20briefed%20on%20this%20change%2C%20said%20in%20a%20statement%20that%20%E2%80%9CI%20look%20forward%20to%20working%20with%20Rick%20to%20deliver%20leading%20Android%20experiences%20powered%20by%20Snapdragon%20not%20only%20in%20mobile%20but%20across%20Auto%2C%20XR%20and%20Compute.%E2%80%9D">The Verge</a>: "I look forward to working with Rick to deliver leading Android experiences powered by Snapdragon not only in mobile but across Auto, XR and Compute."</p><p>Has Google&apos;s partnership with Samsung come to an end? Will Qualcomm manufacture Tensor chips moving forward? Is this Google reaching for the "white flag," signaling the end of the Tensor program as we know it? Am I over-analyzing a single sentence? Other than that last question, only time will tell.</p><p>If this is the end of the <em>current</em> iteration of Tensor, the writing has kind of been on the wall for a while now. Last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-made-by-tsmc-in-the-works">reports claimed</a> that Google was "pushing back" the launch of its "first custom Pixel chip" until sometime in 2025. Initially, the plan was for this "custom Pixel chip" to be the Tensor G3. It would be built by TSMC, as opposed to Samsung, while looking to provide a true flagship experience, one that could rival the best from Qualcomm and maybe even Apple.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Are we witnessing the "beginning of the end" for Tensor? Or maybe Tensor is next in line to be overhauled.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It wouldn&apos;t be completely out of left field for Google to pivot and work with Qualcomm. It happened with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, which ditched the modified Samsung Exynos SoC in favor of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-wear-risc-v-upgrade">Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon W5</a>.</p><p>Perhaps instead of working with Samsung on the design, Google is looking to shore up its relationship with Qualcomm. It seems as though the forthcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite</a> chips are capable of rivaling Apple Silicon, something that Windows and ChromeOS devices have sorely needed for years. that means improved performance, paired with sorely-needed improved efficiency, while also being able to provide the same experience on Arm devices as you find with non-mobile processors.</p><p>Maybe all of this is just a long example of how one tries to think "outside of the box." I just can&apos;t help but think that Google has much bigger plans in store for the future. If I&apos;m right, Google&apos;s biggest announcement in years is just the first drop in the bucket.</p>

<p>A newly surfaced rumor suggests smartphone makers might have to include a larger battery in their flagship device if it&apos;s to contain the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4.</p><p>The rumor stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5023710107669290">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) on Weibo, who states the next generation of phones could feature "high-density" batteries (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-8-gen-4-flagships-featuring-large-batteries-due-to-high-power/">WCCFTech</a>). They add that, so far, three flagship devices preparing to run Qualcomm&apos;s next chip have started development with 5,500mAh batteries.</p><p>Rumors add that the core materials for such batteries are still being developed to support the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5024143802109701">follow-up post</a> by the leaker on Weibo states that batteries could reach upwards of 6,000mAh in order to satiate the chip&apos;s power hunger.</p><p>Speculation surrounding the SD 8 Gen 4&apos;s increased power hunger could be due to its alleged 2+6 core setup, the WCCFTech noted. This rumored setup supposedly removes the possibility for Qualcomm to include any efficiency cores to cut down on how much power it draws.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-reportedly-causing-issues-before-launch">similar speculation</a> was made about MediaTek&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-launch">Dimensity 9300</a> before the chip launched. Word spread that the chip&apos;s weight on power started causing overheating issues with devices that featured it. MediaTek promptly denied such rumors, stating it was "completely false and has no source or basis in fact."</p><p>It&apos;ll be wise to remain cautious until Qualcomm&apos;s chip is out to see how it behaves.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Qualcomm&apos;s chief marketing officer, Don McGuire, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">confirmed some specs</a> about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 during MWC 2024. McGuire stated that users can expect the chip to launch during the Summit in October and that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">will feature Oryon CPU</a> cores. Qualcomm stated the cores can output 2x greater CPU performance and 4.5x faster AI processing.</p><p>The cores will likely be accompanied by Qualcomm&apos;s seventh-generation modem with 5G and non-terrestrial network support for satellite communication capabilities.</p><p>The chip is also rumored to be built off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4-tsmc-rumor">TSMC&apos;s 3nm process</a>, and the cores could reach 4.0GHz speeds. With Qualcomm seemingly going all in on power, the latest rumors make a little more sense.</p><p>There is speculation that the three manufacturers testing devices with increased batteries could involve OPPO and Xiaomi. However, OnePlus had its name tossed into the mix as the company (usually) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-battery-charging-speeds">quickly incorporates</a> the latest Qualcomm chips into its flagship phones.</p>
