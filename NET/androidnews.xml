<hr>
<p>Vivo&apos;s V-series is expanding with the new V40 Pro. Alongside it, the company is reintroducing the regular V40, which made its debut in June.</p><p>The two new models now both feature Zeiss-branded lenses and portrait shooting modes, potentially giving our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">favorite cheap Android phones</a> a run for their money.</p><p>Since 2020, Vivo has been collaborating with Zeiss, a move also seen with other major Chinese smartphone brands. Historically, this partnership was mostly exclusive to Vivo’s flagship models.</p><p>The Vivo-Zeiss imaging system first debuted with the X60 series. Earlier this year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v30-pro-review">Vivo V30 Pro</a> brought Zeiss to Vivo&apos;s mid-range lineup. Now, both models expanding on this with Zeiss optics and a versatile focal length range is a thrilling development.</p><p>The V40 series features a 50MP main camera with Zeiss optics and Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) on both models. For sharp detail, both phones use a large 1/1.156-inch sensor: the V40 Pro has the Sony IMX921, while the V40 sports the Samsung ISOCELL GNJ.</p><p>Both V40 models also come with a 50MP ZEISS ultra-wide camera, equipped with an f/2.0 aperture and autofocus tracking.</p><p>What sets the Pro model apart is its 50MP Zeiss telephoto camera featuring a Sony IMX816 sensor. It provides a 2x optical zoom and a 50x Zeiss-branded digital zoom. This setup allows the V40 Pro to cover focal lengths from 24mm to 100mm, thanks to a mix of optical and Zeiss-enhanced digital zoom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1810px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="b4V87c6wiDQ6oB5YGN2Xy9" name="Vivo-V40-Pro.jpg" alt="Vivo V40 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b4V87c6wiDQ6oB5YGN2Xy9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1810" height="1018" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vivo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the Pro model, the V40 features focal lengths of 24mm, 35mm, and 50mm using its main and ultra-wide cameras. To elevate portrait shots, Vivo has added Zeiss Style Bokeh effects.</p><p>The V40 series keeps the signature LED fill light from previous V series models but now features the AI Aura Light Portrait. This revamped version is more compact and delivers three times the brightness at 2x zoom compared to the previous model, all while providing a soft light that&apos;s 50 times gentler than a standard flash.</p><p>Alongside the physical Aura Light, both models offer the AI 3D Studio Lighting feature. This tech uses advanced algorithms and facial recognition to mimic natural fill light in tricky conditions.</p>
<h2 id="upgraded-screen-brightness-and-reliable-chipsets-2">Upgraded screen brightness and reliable chipsets</h2>
<p>On the front, the V40 and V40 Pro feature a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 2800 x 1260 resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of 4500 nits, making visuals pop even in the sunniest conditions.</p><p>Under the hood, the V40 Pro runs on MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9200+ processor, while the V40 uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 SoC. Both models come with 12GB of base RAM, expandable by another 12GB.</p><p>The V40 series combines a lightweight design with a robust 5,500mAh battery, making it Vivo’s thinnest model with this capacity. To top it off, the phones support rapid 80W FlashCharge technology for quick recharges.</p><p>The Vivo V40 series is launching first in India, with global availability expected in the coming weeks. Vivo says that pricing, configurations, and availability will differ by region.</p>

And it&apos;s not like you&apos;re paying down a ridiculous amount of cash to become eligible, either: this bundle offer starts as low as $649 for BOTH the phone and the full year of wireless, or $55 per month when you pay through Affirm. </p>

<p>This offer is essentially one of our favorite phones teaming up with one of our favorite <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carriers,</a> so of course we're going to get excited. The big catch is that Mint Mobile is likely to run out of phone stock pretty soon, so don't wait if you're interested. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-8-pro/4367961/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5567a1f7-37ae-48f1-bfc0-5b5d8e50ffe4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes"><em><strong>See Android Central's guide to the best Mint Mobile deals of the month</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>The offer has been around for most of the year, but if past <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes">Mint Mobile deals</a> are any indication, you can expect it to finally expire once Google&apos;s newest flagship phones get revealed next week. The bright side is that we <em>might</em> see a similar, albeit lesser, deal on the Pixel 9 Pro when it finally hits store shelves, but only time will tell.</p><p>We once gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a> the title of "King of the Androids", thanks to its sophisticated balance of gorgeous design choices and premium specs. The flagship boasts the efficiency of Google&apos;s proprietary Tensor G3 chipset, plus you get outstanding haptics, seven years of software support, and all of the cutting-edge camera technology that has become synonymous with the Pixel brand.</p><p>Powered by T-Mobile, Mint is a popular prepaid carrier that provides affordable wireless by selling service in 3, 6, or 12-month increments of time. There are four data options available, ranging from 5GB per month to an unlimited plan capped at 40GB per month before speeds slow. All plans come with unlimited talk and text, plus you get free calls to Mexico and Canada and a mobile hotspot. Pair the company&apos;s straightforward approach to wireless with deals like this, and it&apos;s no wonder we called Mint one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">best wireless carriers</a> in the biz. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s back in the high-end streaming scene <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">with its new Google TV Streamer</a>, offering 4K, smart home integration, and a wide app selection. Surprisingly, it may be using a different processor than expected.</p><p>Even after unveiling the Chromecast replacement, Google has kept the TV Streamer’s processor details under wraps. The company only promises an "improved" chipset but hasn&apos;t revealed the manufacturer or model.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-tv-streamer-processor-3468418/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> recently discovered that the mysterious processor is the MediaTek MT8696. Although details are limited, this chip seems to be a variant of the one in Amazon&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review-obnoxious-ads-ruin-fun">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a>. This suggests support for advanced video codecs like AV1, Dolby Vision, and HDR10+, matching the TV Streamer&apos;s features.</p><p>Android Central has contacted Google for a comment on the streaming device&apos;s chipset and will update this article once we receive a response.</p><p>If accurate, Google&apos;s choice of a MediaTek chipset for the Google TV Streamer signals a shift from its previous reliance on Amlogic processors. The 2020 4K and 2022 HD Chromecast models used Amlogic&apos;s S905X3 and S805X2 SoCs, respectively.</p><p>MediaTek has been tight-lipped about the MT8696 processor&apos;s specs, including its clock speed. However, by looking at the similar MT8696(T) chipset in Amazon&apos;s Fire TV Stick, we can guess some performance details. Amazon&apos;s version has a quad-core CPU running up to 2.0GHz, giving us an idea of the Google TV Streamer&apos;s potential processing power.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Amlogic processors in previous Chromecast models maxed out at 1.9GHz. This implies the MediaTek chipset could offer a performance boost, though we&apos;ll need official specs from MediaTek to confirm.</p><p>Anyway, the Google TV Streamer solves a major Chromecast shortcoming with a big upgrade in RAM and storage. It comes with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, a huge leap from the previous model’s 8GB.</p><p>The box also uses the familiar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> interface (formerly Android TV) to give access to a wide range of TV apps from the Google Play Store. It integrates smoothly with Google Home and Nest smart home systems.

But I went back to the device following an update to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and it was an entirely different beast. In fact, it was so good I ended up using the device as my primary phone for several months, and nearly a year after its release, it continues to be one of the best around.</p><p>This would be the time when OnePlus normally released a new model, but the Chinese manufacturer is doing things differently in 2024. Instead of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">Open 2</a>, the company is introducing a new version of the foldable with a few tweaks, dubbed the OnePlus Open Apex Edition. This particular model comes in a gorgeous new Crimson Shadow color variant, gets 1TB of storage as standard, and includes a dedicated security chip that&apos;s similar to what Google offers on its Pixels.</p><p>Essentially, the Open Apex Edition inherits the same great features as the regular model: a gorgeous design, terrific cameras, smooth hinge with a crease that isn&apos;t noticeable, and decent battery life. On the flip side, it retains all of the foldable&apos;s foibles; it won&apos;t get as many updates, there&apos;s no meaningful water resistance, and it misses out on the latest hardware.</p><p>Is the Open Apex Edition a worthy choice against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables</a>? Let&apos;s take a look.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-apex-edition-pricing-and-availability"><span>OnePlus Open Apex Edition: Pricing and availability </span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Vt9d39yGn73ZWWxKmsURiV" name="oneplus-open-2024-8.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vt9d39yGn73ZWWxKmsURiV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus unveiled the Open Apex Edition on August 7, and the foldable is now on sale in all regions where the standard model debuted last year, including India, the U.S., U.K., and Germany. It is available in a single variant with 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage, and it costs $1,899 in the U.S. and ₹1,49,999 ($1,786) in India.</p><p>It isn&apos;t as good a value in the U.S. — particularly considering there&apos;s no carrier backing — but it is a decent showing in India. Vivo&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">X Fold3 Pro</a> is available in the country for ₹1,59,999 ($1,910), and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> retails for ₹1,76,999 ($2,112). OnePlus managed to undercut both of these devices, and while the hardware isn&apos;t the latest, it still holds up incredibly well in 2024.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-apex-edition-design"><span>OnePlus Open Apex Edition: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eGyLKviAK3wq4uCoqV8HdX" name="oneplus-open-2024-18.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eGyLKviAK3wq4uCoqV8HdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It goes without saying that the most striking feature of the OnePlus Open Apex Edition is the color. Officially dubbed Crimson Shadow, this burgundy red color is exquisite, and it attracts attention a lot better than the regular Voyager Black model. OnePlus went with the same faux leather finish at the back, and that&apos;s a good choice — it is much better to hold and use than a standard glass pane.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AQxSSYtjCKrE74bFidfA8U" name="oneplus-open-2024-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AQxSSYtjCKrE74bFidfA8U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The switch to a bold red hue makes the camera island that much more distinctive, and this in part because of the matte red band that encircles the outside of the housing. OnePlus says the design of the camera housing is meant to mimic luxury watches, and that is evident. The cameras within the housing are slotted within individual rings, and the stylized Hasselblad logo is on the right.</p>

<p>The overall design is elegant, and the red leather back contrasts well with the polished metal sides. OnePlus says the red hue used on the device is an homage to Hasselblad&apos;s 503CW 60 Years Victor Red Edition, and while I don&apos;t know anything about that camera, I can say that the hue looks really good on the phone, and it gives it a lot of character.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pchZxFFcqcq5cbbSHCAMKX" name="oneplus-open-2024-17.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pchZxFFcqcq5cbbSHCAMKX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the biggest positives on the design front is the size; the foldable is shorter than its immediate rivals, and that makes using it much more comfortable. The cover screen in particular is a delight to use, and most of the time, I didn&apos;t have to unfold the device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TsvP2Pi2rnsEdAgkoakAuY" name="oneplus-open-2024-13.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TsvP2Pi2rnsEdAgkoakAuY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The chassis of the Open Apex Edition is made out of the same combination of cobalt, molybdenum, and titanium alloys, and it ends up being lighter and more durable than steel. It has the same 239g weight as the standard model, and while that&apos;s on the lower end of the scale, it isn&apos;t the thinnest or lightest foldable around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5VEqQ3Ah5DyuAJhYnx4yVV" name="oneplus-open-2024-7.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5VEqQ3Ah5DyuAJhYnx4yVV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo&apos;s X Fold3 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Honor Magic V2</a> (and the upcoming V3), Xiaomi&apos;s Mix Fold 4 are all thinner and lighter than what OnePlus is offering, and even Samsung managed to bring the weight of the Z Fold 6 down to the same as the Open. OnePlus clearly had the edge in this regard when the Open debuted, but a year of innovation in this area means it doesn&apos;t have an advantage anymore.</p>
<p>That said, the hinge is still one of the best around, and switching from the X Fold3 Pro, there were no issues. It has a smooth articulation, doesn&apos;t need much force to open, and if my usage of the standard model is anything to go by, it is clearly built to last. The alert slider is also intact, and it picks up a new VIP mode. The slider itself has been redesigned and features a better texture and an orange accent that makes it stand out just a bit more than the one on the regular model.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-apex-edition-hardware"><span>OnePlus Open Apex Edition: Hardware</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wrHv7wvnPKQsJ4tqnNZ93X" name="oneplus-open-2024-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wrHv7wvnPKQsJ4tqnNZ93X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus isn&apos;t making many changes to the hardware itself, so I&apos;m not going to spend too much time talking about it. The Open Apex Edition has the same 6.31-inch cover screen and a 7.82-inch inner panel as the standard model. Both AMOLED panels go up to 120Hz, offer Dolby Vision, and use LTPO 3.0 to dynamically adjust the refresh according to content on the screen.</p><p>You get vibrant colors and excellent contrast levels, and the same level of customizability as the OnePlus 12. I didn&apos;t see any issues in outdoor use, and the foldable has adequate brightness levels. Built-in sound is great too, and it is among the loudest in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dXEAa8WVpZvUdAtztpADwX" name="oneplus-open-2024-20.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dXEAa8WVpZvUdAtztpADwX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the internals, the Open Apex Edition is powered by last year&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. Its still just as fluid and performant as the 8 Gen 3, but it doesn&apos;t quite manage to deliver the same efficiency figures, and that&apos;s evident in the battery life. I still managed to get a day&apos;s worth of use consistently between charges, but with heavy use, you will need to plug in the device before turning in for the night.</p><p>It uses the same 80W charging tech, and it takes just over 45 minutes to fully charge the 4805mAh battery. With the latest slate of foldables offering bigger batteries, the Open no longer has the edge in this area. That said, you don&apos;t miss out in terms of connectivity, with the device offering global 5G bands, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, USB-C 3.1, and the entire suite of AptX codecs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1963px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="nYakyXauxUpCJjCEZvMSBZ" name="oneplus-open-2024-12.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nYakyXauxUpCJjCEZvMSBZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1963" height="1106" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest difference with the Open Apex Edition is the storage; the foldable now comes with 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage, and that&apos;s in line with the highest-storage variant of the Magic V2 and Z Fold 6. You still get 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and in my use, there wasn&apos;t any scenario where I felt the RAM wasn&apos;t adequate.</p><p>Also new is a Goodix GSEA0 security chip that is powered by Arm&apos;s SecurCore SC300 platform. This chip debuted in last year&apos;s Find N3, and with the commingling of OnePlus and OPPO, it is now making its way to the Open. The chip oversees the VIP mode that limits access to the mic and camera, and while its efficacy may be limited in daily use, it is a novel addition nonetheless.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="A3iePL45GuS8bkhXuYCiNU" name="oneplus-open-2024-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A3iePL45GuS8bkhXuYCiNU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rounding out the hardware, the Open Apex Edition has the same cameras: a 48MP main camera based on Sony&apos;s LYT-T808 module, a 64MP OmniVision OV64B telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, and a 48MP wide-angle lens that uses the Sony IMX581. There&apos;s a 32MP camera on the cover panel, and a 20MP module on the inside.</p><p>While the camera hardware hasn&apos;t changed, OnePlus rolled out a series of updates to the phone over the course of the last year, and they make a sizeable difference in the caliber of photos and videos. I still prefer the X Fold3 Pro, but there&apos;s no arguing the Open is a close second, and it easily outshines the Z Fold 6.</p>
<p>That&apos;s true in other areas as well. Although the hardware isn&apos;t the latest available, the Open Apex Edition holds its own in demanding games, and I didn&apos;t see any lag or slowdowns whatsoever. It would have been nice to get the 8 Gen 3, but the 8 Gen 2 still has plenty to offer.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ozwGNvUL9zyb7SM8snz8oW" name="oneplus-open-2024-14.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozwGNvUL9zyb7SM8snz8oW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like the most about the Open Apex Edition is that it has one of the best multi-tasking capabilities of any foldable today, with OnePlus adding a ton of utilities to maximize the available real estate. It&apos;s incredibly easy to launch split-screen mode, and you get the ability to stack windows and change orientation without any hassle.</p><p>The foldable runs OxygenOS 14.1 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and while the interface is similar to OxygenOS 14, there are new AI-based image editing features similar to Magic Eraser on the Pixels. The interface is fluid and doesn&apos;t have any lag or slowdowns, and there&apos;s extensive customizability.</p>

<p>The biggest change in this area has to do with the alert slider; you still get the ability to switch between ring and silent profiles, and there&apos;s now a new VIP mode that&apos;s designed to safeguard your privacy. In this mode, app access to the mic and camera is disabled, and no app is allowed to take photos, videos, or record audio.</p><p>You can still use the camera to take photos and videos in this mode and share them within an app like Instagram or WhatsApp, but if you want to access the viewfinder within Instagram, that isn&apos;t possible. You&apos;ll get a dialog box stating that camera access is disabled, and you&apos;ll need to exit the VIP mode to be able to use it.</p>

<p>The feature made its debut in the Chinese build of ColorOS at the start of the year, and I put it to good use on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>; with OxygenOS differing in name only, it&apos;s no wonder that OnePlus is adding this feature to its devices. That said, I don&apos;t think it deserves a slot on the alert slider; it isn&apos;t something that most users need (or would consider using), and it would have been better to include it as a tile in the notification pane.</p><p>Now, the main problem with the foldable is that it won&apos;t get long-term software updates. OnePlus is guaranteeing three Android OS updates and four years of security updates — same as the standard model. That just isn&apos;t enough in 2024, and what&apos;s particularly annoying is that the mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-review">Nord 4</a> is slated to get more software updates than the Open Apex Edition. The Nord 4 will pick up the Android 18 update, while the Open won&apos;t go beyond Android 17.</p>

<p>Obviously, Samsung isn&apos;t a contender this year, and the Z Fold 6 doesn&apos;t really have anything meaningful to offer. But Vivo&apos;s X Fold3 Pro is thinner, lighter, has better cameras, and is more powerful than the Open Apex Edition. The biggest differentiation is the battery life, with Vivo&apos;s foldable able to last well over a day even with heavy use.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a foldable that's easy to hold and use</li><li>You need good cameras</li><li>You want meaningful software extras</li><li>You want an elegant design</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want long-term software updates</li><li>You need the latest hardware</li><li>You want the best battery life</li></ul>
<p>With the Open Apex Edition, OnePlus is showing that it doesn&apos;t need to release a new phone yearly to stay relevant. Other manufacturers should consider going the same route, because at the end of the day, the Open still has a lot going for it, and it holds up well against its 2024 rivals.</p><p>The only issue with the foldable is the lack of long-term updates; OnePlus needs to roll out more updates to the phone, because as it stands, it is outmatched by the Nord 4, which costs four times less. As I&apos;m picking out flaws, IPX4 water resistance doesn&apos;t measure up in 2024, and with other foldables now offering IPX8 as standard, the Open is on the backfoot.</p><p>Outside of that, I can&apos;t really find any faults with the foldable. It has a ton of useful multitasking features, the design is easily one of the best — if not the best — and the burgundy red color option is utterly gorgeous. If you care about the design and want a foldable that looks as well as it performs, the Open Apex Edition is a great choice in 2024 and beyond.</p>

<p>Thanks to this OnePlus Nord 4 vs. Nothing Phone 2a face-off, you can get the information you need to decide which phone is best for you. One phone will have fantastic lights to alert you of notifications, while the other will not. However, a deeper look into the specifications of both phones will reveal which one comes out on top and can be called the better model.</p><p>These phones are not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>, but they still have specs to help you get through your day. One of these phones has slightly better Ingress  Protection, but is it enough to become your next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range Android phone</a>?</p>

<p>In this OnePlus Nord 4 vs. Nothing Phone 2a comparison, you can see a stark difference in design. One phone has a unique design with cameras in an unusual location, but the other has a more elegant design.</p><p>The OnePlus Nord 4 features an aluminum body with a dual-tone finish, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-3-review" target="_blank">Pixel 3XL</a>. The phone also features a laser-engraved texture and a compact antenna design. The only issue you might encounter is that OnePlus put the in-screen model a little too low on the screen, which might make using the sensor a little weird, as Harish Johnnalagadda says in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-review#section-oneplus-nord-4-design">OnePlus Nord 4 review</a>. The phone also features a three-position slider on the side to efficiently handle your notifications. It has a slightly better IP65 Ingress Protection rating that makes the phone dust-tight, but be careful around water since it can&apos;t be submerged. The phone can resist water jets from a 6.3mm nozzle at 12.5 liters per minute.</p><p>The OnePlus Nord 4 has different color options, such as Mercurial Silver, Obsidian Midnight, and Oasis Green. It measures 162.6 x 75 x 8mm, and OnePlus made it to be the first 5G phone that weighs 200 grams and is 8mm thick. However, the Nord 4 falls short by having Panda Shield protection instead of Gorilla Glass, which offers better protection.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a> has a design you won&apos;t find in its competitor (or any other, for that matter). For example, the see-through back with the camera bump in the center makes you feel like it&apos;s looking at you. There is also an NFC coil that surrounds the camera with the three LED bars. You might clean it often since the back is a smudge magnet.</p><p>It also has some exposed screws, some text, and even a red square on the back that is just for looks. The bezels are also all around the front of the phone. It has an ultra-phone design, and if you like big phones, you might like the Nothing Phone 2a. There is also music visualization when playing music that gives you a small light show.</p><p>The phone also measures 161.7 x 76.3 x 8.5mm, weighs 190 grams and comes in Black, Milk (Glyph Interface), and White. You can also count on Gorilla Glass 5 protection on the screen.</p>

<p>While the OnePlus Nord 4 and the Nothing Phone 2a have the same 6.7-inch AMOLED display and 120Hz refresh rate, one has a slightly better resolution.</p><p>The OnePlus Nord 4 has a high peak brightness of 2,150 nits, 451 ppi, and a higher 2,772 x 1,240 resolution. Its display also supports HDR10+ and 10-bit color depth and has the same Aqua Touch feature as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>.

When you&apos;re using the phone, the refresh rate goes up to 120Hz, but when idle, it goes down to 60Hz. You&apos;ll also find an under-display fingerprint reader. </p><p>The Nothing Phone 2a, on the other hand, has a 1,080 x 2,412 resolution AMOLED display with HDR10 support and an inferior peak brightness of 1,300 nits. The display also has a 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+, 10-bit color depth, and 394 ppi. The phone doesn&apos;t have LTPO, but you can use the High or Standard modes. There is also the always-on mode, but it doesn&apos;t offer much regarding customizability.</p>

<p>Specifications differences between the OnePlus Nord 4 and Nothing Phone 2a notably distinguish the two phones.</p><p>The newer OnePlus Nord 4 has storage options such as 128GB and 256GB, with UFS 3.1 and UFS 4.0 storage speeds. It also has a more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-plus-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3</a> chipset with an Adreno 732 GPU and 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM. UK residents have a different variant, such as the 16GB RAM and 512GB storage option.</p><p>There is also a massive 5,500mAh battery, which supports OnePlus&apos; 100W SuperVOOC charging, but the downside is that it doesn&apos;t have wireless charging. Regarding cameras, the Nord 4 offers a 50MP wide lens (Sony LYTIA) with an f/1.8 aperture, an 8MP ultra-wide angle lens with an f/2.2 aperture, and a Sony sensor. Selfie enthusiasts will love the 16MP selfie camera that can record in 1080p. If you want 4K video, you&apos;ll need to use the rear camera. There are also dual stereo speakers and a USB 2.0 Type-C port.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 2a features a less powerful MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro, but you can try the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a>&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen processor if you want a more powerful processor. It also features 8GB and 12GB of RAM and as much as 256GB of storage, but it doesn&apos;t offer expandable storage. The phone also comes with Wi-Fi 6, giving you faster connection speeds.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 2a has over 660 nits of peak brightness with the manual slider and almost 1,300 nits in auto mode. It also has an excellent 5,000mAh battery that gives you up to two days of usage and 45W of wired charging. However, the box does not include the charger.</p><p>Regarding cameras, the Nothing Phone 2a has an impressive 50MP Samsung Gn9 sensor with OIS and the Samsung JN1 wide-angle lens, the same as the one on the Phone 2. Yet, it does not support 4K video at 60fps, custom filters, or shooting modes. The primary camera can also offer 2x zoom, HDR, flash, and effects. There is also a 32MP front-facing camera with which to have fun.</p><p>Thanks to the wide-angle lens, you&apos;ll get great daylight pictures, but you&apos;ll notice overly saturated colors.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Nord 4 comes with some fun AI features, such as AI Writer, AI Summary, and AI Best Face, which opens your eyes in pictures. There is also OxygenOS 14.1, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-oneplus-nord-4-get">four years of OS updates</a> and six years of security updates. You get a lot of pre-installed apps out of the box, but at least you can uninstall them.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 2a doesn&apos;t waste your time with bloatware but has a lovely dot aesthetic. You can make an app icon bigger and change the look of your app folder. It also features an AI wallpaper generator, allows you to customize your lock screen widgets, and allows you to choose from device control apps.</p><p>You also get three years of major Android updates and four security updates. When you set it up using the Nothing X app, you can use your voice to access ChatGTP on Ear and Ear.</p>

<p>Both phones have a lot to offer, but it all comes down to what matters most to you, such as having a better camera, more Android updates, or a more elegant design. Where you live is also crucial since the OnePlus Nord 4 can&apos;t be purchased in the United States at this time, although the Nothing Phone 2a can only be purchased in the U.S. via a beta program.</p><p>If a better processor is a must for your next phone, then you might be more interested in the OnePlus Nord 4, which features a Snapdragon processor. So, which one sounds more interesting to you?</p>

<ul><li>YouTube highlighted an upcoming test that brings picture-in-picture viewing during mid-roll ads.</li><li>The service intends to create a less disruptive experience as it continues its fight against ad blockers.</li><li>YouTube's war against ad blockers involved cutting users off from viewing its content if they had one while also testing new server-side ads.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube is kickstarting a test for a limited group of users that might alleviate the headache surrounding its recent ad war.</p><p>On YouTube&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en&msgid=289284231">features and experiments</a> page, the platform detailed the beginning of picture-in-picture (PIP) videos during mid-roll (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-tests-pip-ads-3468412/">Android Authority</a>). The post states that this feature will become available to creators, giving the option to enable picture-in-picture for ads played <em>during </em>their content.</p><p>YouTube didn&apos;t make the specifics clear about this new PIP format for mid-roll ads. So, either the creator&apos;s content will morph into a smaller display, leaving the ad to take over the player in full, or vice versa.</p><p>The service adds that the new format is intended to help creators facilitate a less disruptive experience for their viewers. Moreover, it seems that creators <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7385599?sjid=12635603178992791037-NA#channel_settings_midroll">can find this new option</a> within the "Monetization" settings of the Live Control Room.</p><p>"Some viewers on select devices" are said to experience the new PIP ad format in the months ahead. Those on mobile and desktop should keep their eyes out moving forward. YouTube creators should also gain the new mid-roll ad option around that same time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6pvjASLAuGSMQzSoFxqBqG" name="YouTube-Premium-lifestyle.jpg" alt="YouTube Premium homepage on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6pvjASLAuGSMQzSoFxqBqG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Less disruptive ads would be a welcome sight, as mid-roll ads currently rip users away from their content. More importantly, this alternate method could be seen as a way for YouTube to make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-global-efforts-clock-ad-blockers">its strong stance on ads</a> more palatable. The platform recently started cracking down on users packing an ad-blocker by cutting off the video stream if the website detects the add-on.</p><p>If they wanted their content back, users could whitelist YouTube or disable the ad-blocker altogether. The company gave ad-block users "three strikes" before they were banned from watching videos.</p><p>Google then reiterated how important ads are for YouTube, as they generate revenue for the platform, but watching ads supports your favorite creators.</p><p>YouTube&apos;s efforts don&apos;t end there, as it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-server-side-injectable-ads-test">spotted testing server-side ads</a> just before the summer. The ads would appear as an "injection" into the video stream instead of appearing as a separate entity. The latter is how your ad-blocker would spot and keep them from sight. With injectable ads, ad-blockers would have difficulties sensing and blocking them.</p><p>Of course, users can always grab <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a>, which is likely the road we&apos;re pushed toward. However, we&apos;ll have to see how this new, less disruptive mid-roll ad operates and whether we can stomach it.</p>

<ul><li>Google Pixel owners should begin receiving the August 2024 security patch, which packs a few notable fixes for odd issues.</li><li>The patch solves a screen flickering issue while also implementing a stronger fix for the reboot loop issue that bricked several Pixel 6 devices.</li><li>Google's next hardware event is set for August 13, where we may hear more about Android 15.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We&apos;re nearly midway through the first full week of August and Google is starting to push its latest security update to its portfolio of phones.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/289456705/google-pixel-update-aug-2024?hl=en&sjid=18076123174810562378-NC">community post</a>, Google detailed the contents of its August 2024 patch notes, which aim to solve some persistent Pixel problems. The Pixel 5a (5G), Pixel 7 series, Pixel 8, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> will download version <strong>AP2A.240805.005</strong>. </p><p>Those with a Pixel 6 series device will grab AP2A.240805.005.<strong>F1</strong> while the Pixel 8a sees AP2A.240805.005.<strong>A1</strong>.</p><p>Headlining the August update are a couple of display and graphics problems still plaguing the phones. Google states the patch should solve a "screen brightness flicker" that would occur under "certain conditions." The post states this fix specifically involves the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro.</p><p>Another supplementary fix rolls in to bolster the performance of a Pixel&apos;s screen alongside stability enhancements. Users with a Pixel 8 are in the crosshairs of this particular fix.</p><p>The rest of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Fix for issue occasionally causing devices to be in a reboot loop after factory reset in certain conditions (Pixel 6 series)</li><li>Fix for stability issues when switching from a user without a screen lock, to a user with a screen lock under certain conditions (every eligible Pixel phone)</li></ul>

<p>Google typically offers more insight into its latest security update via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2024-08-01">Android Bulletin</a>; however, this month&apos;s offering is light. The company mentioned that a "High" severity issue regarding a Pixel subcomponent was corrected in August. Three more "Moderate" level fixes arrived for Qualcomm components, such as the Pixel camera and WLAN, that showed signs of issues.</p><p>A standout fix for August is Google&apos;s fix for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6-factory-reset-might-zap-your-phone">reboot loop problem</a> <em>after </em>factory resetting a Pixel 6 series device. Users quickly reported that their Pixel 6 failed to turn on properly after a complete rest. The failure was accompanied by an error message stating that Android couldn&apos;t load and that the user&apos;s data "may be corrupt."</p><p>Google informed users of a workaround to avoid any problems, but a concrete fix wasn&apos;t readily available — until now.</p><p>This update comes just after Google started rolling out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-august-2024-update">August 2024 patch for the  Pixel Watch models</a>.</p><p>Let&apos;s also not forget that Google is preparing for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">hardware event on August 13</a> that should reveal the next Pixel 9 series, the Pixel Fold successor, and more.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has started rolling out the latest August update to Pixel Watch models as of Monday (August 5). The update will bring the latest security patch for the original Pixel Watch and the Pixel Watch 2.</p><p>The latest update doesn&apos;t bring any radical changes to the Pixel Watch models and is a pretty minor security update, as noted by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/289284148/google-pixel-watch-update-august-2024?hl=en&sjid=7303768851874470255-NA">changelog</a> shared via the community blog.</p><p>The Pixel Watch and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> owners will receive the Wear OS 4-powered update bearing <strong>TWD9.240805.001.A2</strong> version. Although it is the latest security patch, which should technically be August 5, 2024, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/pixel-watch-august-2024-update/">9to5Google</a> notes that it is still July 5, 2024, even after installing it.</p>
<p>Google says that the rollout will be in phases over the next week and will depend on the carrier and the device. Owers of both Pixel Watch models will receive a notification on their smartwatches once the OTA update becomes available. Meanwhile, Google has also started rolling out the August update for its Pixel phones, including models ranging from the Pixel 5a (5G) to the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>.</p><p>In other news, Google is gearing up for its Pixel products&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">launch event</a> on August 13, which should probably also mark the official rollout of Android 15 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the Pixel 9 series, which now includes a new Pixel 9 Pro XL next to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Google is expected to launch the Pixel Watch 3. Render leaks, leaked promo videos, and real hands-on videos have been coming up left, right, and center, giving us a clear idea of what to expect from the Made by Google event.</p><p>If you own a Pixel Watch or a Pixel Watch 2, you should check for the latest OTA update on your device to keep it secure and bug-free.</p>

<ul><li>The Connect IQ app for Garmin watch faces and apps will now take Garmin Pay payments.</li><li>Garmin recommends devs charge $4.99 for content.</li><li>Disney (Star Wars, Marvel), TaylorMade, Porsche, NASA, and GoPro make up the first wave of ConnectIQ paid faces and apps.</li><li>Previously, third-party devs could only make money through third-party services like PayPal.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Garmin wants to make its Connect IQ app more attractive to third-party developers by making it easier for users to pay for their content directly through the app and their Garmin Pay account. </p><p>Connect IQ had no payment method up until now, so developers employed third-party platforms, asking users to make voluntary donations after installing the watch face. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> owners, meanwhile, couldn&apos;t see in the app how much developers expected them to pay for their content.</p><p>Now, the Garmin Connect IQ app shows prices directly in the app, simplifying the process for both sides. Garmin will take a 15% cut of profits, lower than the typical 30% fee that app stores charge. They&apos;ve also confirmed that they "will continue to allow developers to use third-party monetization systems" if they prefer.</p><p>"Enabling premium apps allows third-party developers to be rewarded for their hard work," says Dan Bartel, Garmin VP of Global Consumer Sales. "We are thrilled that some of the largest brands in the world have joined us to launch new watch faces and apps."</p>

<p>To showcase the "new" Connect IQ marketplace, Garmin added a few premium watch faces from partners like Disney. For instance, there is a Grogu watch face with changing poses throughout the day, as well as Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, and Tony Stark watch faces. All of these cost $4.99, Garmin&apos;s "suggested retail price" for all watch faces.</p><p>Other new premium watch faces include NASA watch faces that showcase new space-themed photography every hour, a TaylorMade watch face with a matching "dimple pattern of a TP5 golf ball," and three Porsche watch faces based on its wordmark, crest, and 917 Salzburg livery design.</p><p>Most intriguingly, Garmin has added a GoPro Camera Control app that lets you start or stop recordings or take photos directly from your Garmin watch. That&apos;s the kind of smart function that Garmin watches traditionally haven&apos;t supported. It costs $5.99.</p><p>Connect IQ will still offer free watch faces, but developers who previously considered making them as a hobby and using PayPal donations to make money as too much of a hassle might now start charging users instead. This could lead to more creative watch faces, but it could also make downloading them a little costlier.</p><p>Garmin recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/youtube-music-is-now-on-compatible-garmin-smartwatches">added YouTube Music to Garmin watches</a> via Connect IQ, which already has a few well-known apps like Spotify, Deezer, Amazon Music, and Komoot — all of which require subscriptions to work. Beyond these, perhaps this Connect IQ facelift could attract more developers to sync their devices with Garmin watches, knowing they can profit directly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-laptops">Samsung laptops</a> don't get as much attention as some brands, but that's a shame, as these PCs easily rival the best models from Dell and HP with all of the performance and software features that made Samsung famous. Order the Galaxy Book 4 Edge before the back-to-school sale ends and you could get up to $500 of trade-in credit. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/galaxy-books/galaxy-book4-edge/buy/galaxy-book4-edge-14-qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-512gb-sapphire-blue-np940xma-kb1us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4d0fee55-8bd9-46dc-be17-af4e434fb288" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Book 4 Edge: $1,349.99, plus up to $500 of trade-in credit" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Book 4 Edge: $1,349.99, plus up to $500 of trade-in credit">View Deal</a></p></div>
