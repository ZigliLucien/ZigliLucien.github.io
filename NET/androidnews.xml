<ul><li>Google confirms that it has started a test with non-enrolled SGE users, giving them access to its AI overviews in Search.</li><li>The company stated it is eager to collect feedback from the general public about where it needs to improve its generative AI.</li><li>Google brought AI overviews through Lens to its main Android app in January, and its newly appointed head of Search, Liz Reid, stated she wants more AI in the engine.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly expanding the reach of its SGE test to include U.S. users who haven&apos;t signed up for its beta environment.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://searchengineland.com/google-starts-testing-ai-overviews-from-sge-in-main-google-search-interface-438680">SearchEngineLand</a>, users who aren&apos;t in Google&apos;s Search Generative Experience (SGE) environment have noticed new AI features (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/25/google-ai-powered-sge-expansion/">9to5Google</a>). Search users not in SGE should soon notice its AI overviews when running a query through the engine.</p><p>Google confirmed to the publication that it is "starting with a set of queries where it thinks generative AI can be especially helpful." The company adds its expanded generative AI test, which is aimed at users&apos; complex questions that will push its AI to scour multiple sources across the web.</p><p>Google commented that the purpose of expanding the test is to gather feedback from the general public.</p><p>The company states it is "confident" that the value and quality its SGE feature brings will help the end user. Moreover, these AI overviews may not appear in a widespread fashion for the bulk of Google Search users.</p><p>Google is testing several variations of its generative AI experience, and only a "small subset" of U.S. users will see it. 9to5 adds that this test will include those who haven&apos;t signed into Google, as well.</p>

<p>Google launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-opens-access-to-search-labs">Search Labs</a> in May 2023, and the test environment brought loads of generative AI features that users could playtest. One notable feature was a way users could ask the AI a follow-up question for additional information about a query&apos;s answer. AI was also seen urging users to consider certain factors related to technology, such as battery life or other quality aspects.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">rolled out</a> AI overviews onto the main Google app on Android alongside Circle to Search. The overviews are present during multi-search moments through Lens, giving users access to a wealth of information collected on a subject and the AI&apos;s sources.</p><p>More AI and SGE tests are on the horizon for Search as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-liz-reid-appointed-head-of-search">Google appointed Liz Reid</a> as its new head on March 19. Reid touted a background in AI at Google before rising to lead Search further through the use of the company&apos;s generative AI software. During her announcement, Reid stated that Search will implement more SGE and AI overviews, focusing on its ability to understand context-rich queries.</p><p>The test we&apos;re seeing roll out now for non-enrolled SGE users sings a similar tune, meaning we&apos;re likely on the cusp of those AI additions.</p>

<ul><li>The latest Motorola Edge 50 Fusion renders have now leaked, showing the entirety of the device.</li><li>It will feature at least three colorways and IP68 water resistance.</li><li>The device is expected to have a 50MP primary sensor, 13MP ultra-wide, and a 32MP selfie shooter.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As we near the Motorola Edge 50 Pro launch, another Edge series smartphone is also up for launch, and the official renders seem to have just shown up on the web.</p><p>The upcoming Motorola Edge 50 Fusion renders come from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/03/exclusive-leak-motorola-edge-50-fusion.html?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-androidheadline&utm_content=later-41941898&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio">Android Headlines</a> and reveal the device in full. The device&apos;s design appears similar to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-pro-debut-in-early-april">Edge 50 Pro</a>, except for the shorter camera module on the back. The visor blends into the back panel alongside the top middle frame of the device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qKTvhko6VimrrQZuxP826m" name="motorola-edge-50-fusion-02.jpeg" alt="Motorola Edge 50 Fusion" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qKTvhko6VimrrQZuxP826m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Edge 50 Fusion, per the latest renders, reveals a rounded corner design with a large display and very minimal bezels on the sides. In contrast, the top and bottom bezels appear more significant than the side ones because of their curved display measuring 6.7 inches and being a pOLED panel, which further has Gorilla Glass 5 on top, notes Android Headlines.</p><p>The renders further showcase the Edge 50 Fusion in three colorways: Ballad Blue, Peacock Pink, and Tidal Teal. All three color variants feature a textured back, and the blue variant notably features a vegan leather finish. The Edge 50 Fusion will also support an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance.</p>

<p>According to Android Headlines, the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 will power the Edge 50 Fusion, which recently seemed to have scored 913 and 2629 in single and multi-score when run through a Geekbench test. The device will also equip 8GB of RAM coupled with 256GB of onboard storage. Keeping the lights on is expected to be a decent 5000mAh battery with support to 68W fast wired charging.</p><p>The new camera visor will comprise a 50MP primary camera aided by another 13MP ultra wide-angle camera. And for selfies, the Edge 50 Fusion will be sporting a 32MP front camera.</p><p>This device is set to launch alongside the Motorola Edge 50 Pro, which will launch in India on the same date. The device is likely to be priced at around $300.</p>

<p>Spotify states the catalyst behind its Learning Courses is its partnership with BBC Maestro, PLAYvirtuoso, Skillshare, and Thinkific.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>WhatsApp beta for Android bearing the 2.24.7.6 version is bringing a new Status update feature.</li><li>Like Instagram, users will be able to share up to one-minute video as a status update.</li><li>Earlier, the same ability was limited to only 30 seconds.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is working on a new feature, which is apparently the most requested one — the ability to share longer status updates.</p><p>Currently, WhatsApp users can share a status update video with a runtime of 30 seconds, but this could be changing, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-7-6-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>. The latest WhatsApp beta bearing the <strong>2.24.7.6</strong> version has been found to test status updates that can be up to one minute long, a significant boost from the existing limit. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="aeD9sSGNjzmXvjKkCve8jf" name="whatsapp-status-update-one-minute.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Status update one-minute long" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aeD9sSGNjzmXvjKkCve8jf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>WABetaInfo further notes that the new feature is currently available only to a select group of beta testers. However, following an official update, more users will soon be able to use it. </p><p>Previously, users could only share short video forms through status updates or multiple 30-second clips of a longer video post. The new ability allows users to share longer, one-minute videos, similar to what we are used to on Instagram Stories. </p>
<p>Apparently, the new ability has been WhatsApp&apos;s most requested feature, and the decision to bring it was based on user feedback, notes WABetaInfo. </p><p>WhatsApp has been constantly on the verge of introducing/ testing new features to compete with and catch up with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">rival messaging apps</a>. The messaging platform has recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-testing-transcribe-voice-notes-feature">found testing</a> transcribing voice notes on Android, which earlier was available for iOS users. </p><p>Moreover, WhatsApp has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-beta-prepares-optional-link-preview">started testing</a> the ability to hide link previews in chats through the recent beta version of the app. Late last month, WhatsApp also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-will-now-let-you-format-text-as-lists-block-quotes-and-code">rolled out</a> new text formatting options to the existing bold, italic, strikethrough, and monospace formats.</p>

<ul><li>Google has started testing a new attachment in Messages for users snapping photos through its quick shortcut.</li><li>The page lets users snap more photos using "Add More," write in a message, or send.</li><li>The latest camera attachment refresh arrives quickly after the stable version of Messages picked up a brand new viewfinder.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems that Google is kickstarting another test in messages that provide a better experience when sending multiple images.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1771453603191898425">AssembleDeBug</a> on X, Google is testing a new attachment screen when taking photos in Messages using its shortcut (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/latest-google-messages-beta-add-more-shortcut-testing/">Android Police</a>). The app&apos;s latest beta, version 20240318 openbeta_dynamic, now shows an "Add More" and "Send" pill-shaped button instead of the current build&apos;s download and send options.</p><p>Additionally, beta testers are treated to an added box to type in a message for the image they&apos;re going to send. Further tinkering showed that opting to snap and attach another photo will refresh the screen, but Messages will keep your previously typed message intact.</p><p>Google&apos;s latest test for Messages is missing one notable function: editing. AssembleDeBug&apos;s find is missing the "edit" button that the stable version of Messages provides. Seeing as the test has just begun, it could be a matter of time before Google pops in an editing button for photos on its new attachment page.</p><p>The publication notes that it has experienced the new attachment page in Messages on multiple devices in the beta. This likely means that the majority of those with the beta version of Messages will see this test today (Mar. 25) and beyond.</p>

<p>Android user&apos;s latest camera-focused test in Messages arrived shortly after the app picked up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-new-camera-viewfinder-rollout">brand-new viewfinder</a>. Google pushed a server-side update for Messages on March 15 that reworked the UI users would find when snapping a photo. The simplified UI offered zoom options, an easy camera switcher, and options for photos and video capture.</p><p>Unfortunately, the latest UI changes ditched the gear icon for more camera settings. That small page previously let users tinker with their flash, camera timers, and aspect ratio.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google is preparing to implement Gemini into Messages, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-gemini-integration-capabilities-detailed">launched a beta</a> for those with eligible devices. Digging into the app&apos;s code showed that Gemini functions similarly to its desktop variation, giving users access to Google app extensions like Maps, Gmail, Flights, and more. The AI bot could also assist users with coding and could be placed into a group chat, though the latter didn&apos;t function properly.</p>

From now through the end of the sale (and <em>potentially</em> beyond, knowing Amazon) you can score an absolutely massive 28% discount on the 256GB foldable, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C34DL6Z7"><strong>knocking the price down to $1,299.99</strong></a>. </p>

<p>It took a long time, but the unlocked <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> is finally getting its first major discount during Amazon's Big Spring Sale. At $1,299.99, the Pixel Fold comes packed with a number of premium features, including some flagship-level camera tech, years of software support, and two vibrant OLED displays. It may not top its direct competition from OnePlus and Samsung, but at this price, it's a steal. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C34DL6Z7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b7b23950-5179-4b1d-ac97-edb5a198ea1b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,799.99" data-dimension48="$1,799.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you want an excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> at a discount; you need to take consistently great photos and video; you want a Pixel phone and tablet all rolled into one.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>you can wait until the Pixel Fold 2 is released (probably this summer); you don&apos;t care about Pixel and can afford an arguably better foldable, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>.</p><p>Even at $1,299.99, the Pixel Fold is still far from cheap, but if you&apos;re familiar with the premium foldable landscape, you&apos;ll get why this $500 discount is such a big deal. The Google Pixel Fold is essentially a cutting-edge tablet and flagship phone all rolled into one, with two gorgeous OLED displays, some amazing camera tech, and fluid, efficient performance from the Tensor G2 chipset. The Fold was also one of the first large-screen foldables to actually fold flat on a surface, thanks to its durable teardrop hinge, and you&apos;re guaranteed to receive years of software support straight out of the box. </p><p>This is the biggest discount that the unlocked Google Pixel Fold has ever received by a margin of hundreds. Will it end when the Amazon Big Spring Sale comes to a close at midnight on March 25th? That&apos;s the big question, but I wouldn&apos;t risk it.</p>

<ul><li>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 might feature more RAM, as rumors suggest it could see an additional 12GB option.</li><li>The clamshell may also feature a boost for its cover display, as its refresh rate could increase to 120Hz.</li><li>Rumors continue to speculate the Flip 6 will receive a larger battery array, which could reach 4,000mAh.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new batch of rumors suggests some welcome changes could arrive on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 later this year.</p><p>The rumors stem from X leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/kro_roe/status/1771446292805546038">kro_roe</a>, who states the Galaxy Z Flip 6 could launch with two chip variants (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-6-12gb-ram-120hz-cover-screen/">SamMobile</a>). The leaker purports the Flip 6 will feature Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 or Samsung&apos;s Exynos 2400 in certain regions. Rumors add that the clamshell&apos;s next cover display boost could impact its fluidity.</p><p>The Flip 6 could feature a 120Hz refresh rate cover display, up from 60Hz on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Z Flip 5</a>.</p><p>Internally, the foldable is rumored to offer an 8GB and a 12GB RAM variant. The RAM sizes also appear to be region-locked, meaning we&apos;ll need Samsung&apos;s official word to know for sure. The X leaker states consumers will likely see the same internal storage pairing of 256GB and 512GB as Samsung&apos;s 2023 launch.</p><p>Speculation surrounding a "larger battery" for the Flip 6 cropped up again, though the leaker didn&apos;t give specifics.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Flip 6 Spec SheetSnapdragon, Exynos up to 8 GB RAM, 12 GB depending on region256,512 GB of storageLonger battery than predecessor120Hz external screen in development<a href="https://twitter.com/kro_roe/status/1771446292805546038">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The Flip 6 could follow a pattern similar to the Galaxy S24 as it offered the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the U.S. but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-exynos-will-be-just-fine">gave other regions</a> its Exynos 2400. Samsung boosted its custom SoC with a new CPU and NPU, meaning the chip is fast and should be a worthwhile alternative if the rumors are true.</p><p>Meanwhile, the latest Flip 5 only offers one RAM choice: 8GB. Rumors give the impression that Samsung will finally give consumers the choice to go bigger with the popular foldable&apos;s memory for handling apps. Additionally, the soon-to-be predecessor features a 3,700mAh battery setup. The current leak didn&apos;t mention how "large" Samsung could go, however, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-larger-dual-batteries-rumor">previous rumor</a> suggested it could reach 4,000mAh.</p><p>The Flip 5 already saw a cover display boost as the Korean OEM opted for a larger 3.4-inch screen. Rumors clashed, as a leak stated the display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fold-6-larger-displays-rumored">could rise again</a> to nearly 4 inches, but a batch of alleged renders showed that things might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-renders-leak">stay the same</a> as their predecessor.</p><p>We&apos;re only a few months out, but speculations swirl that Samsung could host its summer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">Unpacked event</a> on July 10 in Paris, France. This event should reveal its next wave of foldables and the Galaxy Ring.</p>

Do you subscribe to Spotify’s free plan, or are you more of a premium-tier Tidal listener? Apple has a massive lossless quality music library right now but you probably don’t have the right equipment to fully take advantage of it. Same thing with Tidal, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.billboard.com/business/streaming/tidal-new-pricing-1235622516/">lowering its prices</a> starting April 10th, making its high-resolution music more accessible. Meanwhile, Spotify still doesn’t offer lossless after announcing “Spotify HiFi” back in 2021.</p><p>But even though the most popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming service</a> still doesn’t offer hi-res audio, is it something you actually care about? Could you tell the difference between the free lower-resolution offerings on Spotify and the lossless quality streams from Tidal, Apple Music, or Amazon Music Unlimited?</p><p>To truly discern the difference between them, you need the right wired equipment or the right combination of smartphone, Bluetooth codec, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-9-earbuds-support-high-res-codecs">quality Bluetooth earbuds</a>/headphones/mobile DAC, which support what’s being played from the phone.</p>

<p>That seems like a lot to go through, but that’s what I did, and I brought it right to your doorstep! My “Pepsi Challenge” was presenting a blind “taste” test to the average smartphone user to find out if all of this progress, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">these advances in audio technology</a>, really matter.</p>

<p>Let me take a brief moment to say RIP to my beloved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-v60-thinq-5g-review">LG V60 ThinQ</a> from 2020, which featured a Quad DAC built-in and a 3.5mm audio port. That was one of the easiest ways to get CD-quality audio out of a phone. </p><p>Some over-ear or on-ear headphones can be connected to modern-day 3.5mm port-less phones via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c">USB-C</a> or 3.5/4.4/6.3mm connectors and adapters when you use a USB-C mobile DAC/Amp. That said, how many of you reading this consider yourself an “audiophile” and would spring for both Bluetooth earbuds <em>and</em> over-ear headphones <em>and</em> a DAC (do you even know what that is)?</p><p>Did your eyes just glaze over reading that? So, I ask again, does the average consumer care enough to figure all of this out to leverage all of that high bit rate goodness? To figure that out, I devised a test to get some definitive answers.</p>

<p>For this test, I chose 10 people of varying ages, ethnicities, and genders and played low-resolution audio streams, followed by either lossless FLAC files or high-resolution Tidal streams. Some of the responses I received expanded my understanding of what influences people’s choices profoundly. I was taken aback by some of the answers because I hadn&apos;t considered the context in which some people enjoy music. </p><p>I set up the methodology for testing my sample group like so:</p><p>Some participants had more time than others, so the number of songs varied, but each song they sampled was played twice. I used a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a> to play each song once from Spotify, with the audio stream quality set to “Medium,” and then a second time directly from my Pixel using the USB Audio Player Pro app or Tidal. I had to use that app because Android downsamples the audio coming out of that USB-C port to 16bit, 44.1kHz, and the files I was playing were higher resolution than that. </p><p>HummingBird Media, who was as excited about this test as I was, outfitted me with the gear for this experiment. For round one, I used the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-review">Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4</a> over-ear headphones via Bluetooth. In round two, the same songs were played via those same headphones but wired now, using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ifi-audio.com/products/go-link/">iFi’s Audio GO link USB-C dongle DAC/headphone amp</a>. I had one instance where I employed some higher-end equipment that Hummingbird sent, but I’ll get to that in a moment.</p>
<h2 id="who-cares-about-hi-res-audio-and-why-2">Who cares about hi-res audio, and why?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d3j6LezfNWEoVr2T3ykCdf" name="pixel-7-pro-streaming-spotify-and-playing-FLAC.jpg" alt="Pixel 7 Pro displaying bluetooth codecs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d3j6LezfNWEoVr2T3ykCdf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A screenshot the codecs my Pixel 7 Pro used for Spotify and FLAC files </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, what were the results after my participants&apos; listening tests and then subsequent Q&A sessions? Most people said they could hear a clear difference. Literally. The most common feedback was that the locally played FLAC files or streamed Tidal tracks had more clarity. There was more separation with the instruments, meaning they could discern individual sounds better in the higher-resolution files and streams. Sounds like an easy “W” for hi-res audio, right? Wrong.</p><p>One tester, JT, a broadcast engineer by trade, remarked that despite the perceived difference, it wasn’t enough for him to pay for anything special to have higher-quality content. He likened it to 1080P vs. 4K TVs. He told me that he knows 4K is better, but 1080P is good enough for his needs. So, no Tidal and no hunting down and purchasing FLAC files; he’s fine with lower-quality music, technically speaking. </p><p>Some other testers had similarly nuanced responses. Two testers, whom I&apos;ll call CA and CF, said they would both pay, but in different contexts. CA could hear the difference in clarity but was only willing to pay the one-time cost for the $59.99 iFi GO link dongle DAC. He wasn’t willing to fork over the extra dough monthly for a premium music service.</p><p>CF already pays for Spotify because she doesn’t like ads, so she is also willing to pay for the difference she hears between the two streams. But she would expand on that and say that it wasn’t worth it in her car, and she’d only want to take advantage of paying for premium streaming or upgrading to more premium equipment like the Sennheiser Momentum 4 and iFi GO link for active, recreational listening at home.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Some people may be able to tell the difference between low-resolution and hi-res audio, but that still might not be enough to justify the extra cost often associated with it.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Hearing, or “audition,” as it may also be called in neuroscience circles, is highly subjective. It’s as much about perception as it is about the technical aspects of the sound source, and as such, it shouldn’t be a surprise that two of my testers didn’t hear any difference in quality. This also means that they had no incentive to pay for anything more than what they had already used. Hi-res doesn’t matter to either of them.</p><p>One of those testers is also an avid music listener. She cooks with music on and does chores with it on. When we get in the car, the first thing she does is turn on the radio and hit her favorite Spotify playlists on her phone. It’s my wife, so I know these things.</p><p>Since I had more time to test my wife, I had her listen to one of the test tracks a third time, “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes,” by Paul Simon. Only this time, I employed iFi’s impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ifi-audio.com/products/go-blu/">GO blu HD Bluetooth DAC</a> and streamed in the Hi-Res LDAC codec at 96kHz, 32bits through that DAC into a pair of audiophile-grade <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-US/p/hd-660s2/">Sennheiser HD 660S2</a> open-back over-ear headphones. If you don’t know, these are like seeing a movie in IMAX, where the Momentum 4 would be viewing that same movie on one of the standard large screens. Both are enjoyable, but the 660S2 is more dynamic.</p><p>With the 660S2, my wife was able to hear a slightly discernable difference from the lower-resolution music, but it still wasn’t significant enough to influence any action on her part toward the higher-resolution experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DK7d9iQaSvPk4bfmSqFfaX" name="sennheiser-660S2-momentum-4-group-shot.jpg" alt="Group shot of the Sennheiser HD 660S2 and Momentum 4 Wireless" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DK7d9iQaSvPk4bfmSqFfaX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The two most profound Q&As touched on perception and brought up questions of neurodiversity, which I hadn’t considered before. One of my testers preferred the lower-resolution music because of a phenomenon I actually enjoy. High-resolution music files paired with high-end headphones make me feel like I’m truly immersed in the music. At its best, it feels like the music is not playing at me but that it is actually in my head. It feels like it’s all around me, or more precisely, I’m in it. I’m on stage, sitting in the middle of the band.</p><p>She didn’t like that feeling, initially saying it was too loud even though I checked to be sure that the tracks were playing at the same perceived loudness. This made me think of people who have processing sensitivities, those for whom certain stimuli could lead to sensory overload. I realized that in that context, hi-res audio played through earbuds or high-end headphones could be “bad,” and the lower resolution, less dynamic streams, “good.”</p><p>Then there was SK. He heard and articulated the difference in clarity, but to him, an avid Spotify user, the difference in the higher-resolution tracks sounded too “digital.” He said the Spotify streams were “familiar, comfortable.” For him, the enjoyment was in the familiar, and the perceived difference took him out of that place of comfort and made it less enjoyable.</p>
<h2 id="final-conclusions-what-really-matters-2">Final conclusions: What really matters</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q5jEcBFb9uzzhWiFLcTtfZ" name="various-dacs-dongles-aux-cables-group-shot.jpg" alt="Various DACs and dongles needed to listen to Hi-Res audio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q5jEcBFb9uzzhWiFLcTtfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the end of my experiment, I’ve come to two conclusions:</p>
<ul><li>Almost all of my testers hadn’t listened to music playing in something they’d consider “high-end” headphones. They all remarked on how amazing the Sennheiser Momentum 4 sounded. So, part of answering my initial question requires first asking, “Has the average user even <em>heard</em> high-quality audio played through high-quality audio gear to know if Hi-Res audio matters?”</li><li>There is no “average” user. There are numerous contexts and reasons for smartphone users to care or not care about Hi-Res audio despite it being “better” on paper, and all of them are right.</li></ul>
<p>At the end of the day, technology will keep moving forward, and as things progress and wireless technologies are better able to handle lossless files, people will just have access to them, which will become the norm, much like how Apple made its entire library available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-music-hi-fi-lossless-dolby-atmos-spatial-audio-announcement">its lossless ALAC format</a>.</p><p>Those with reasons and contexts for not liking it will find the services that work for them if there&apos;s no option to retain the lower-resolution versions of the songs they listen to. The rest likely won’t even recognize that they’ve been “upgraded” because they don’t have the more expensive, higher-end listening gear, which would make that upgrade really pop like the Sennheiser and iFi gear I used here. They’ll continue to buy the earbuds whose focus is on cost and feature set first, and Hi-Res dynamic range audio second.</p>

<ul><li>The European Commission is investigating Alphabet, Apple and Meta for potential non-compliance with the Digital Markets Act.</li><li>The DMA requires gatekeepers to allow developers to alert consumers to offers outside their app stores, for free.</li><li>Meta is being investigated over its “pay or consent” model, which may breach rules on personal data gathering.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The European Commission has confirmed that it has placed Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Apple, and Meta under investigation for concerns over their potential failure to comply with rules established under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a>. Those rules were introduced in 2022 and came into full effect on March 7, 2024.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_1689">announcement</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-google-meta-eu-dma-investigation-3428386/">Android Authority</a>), the European Commission confirmed that several investigations are running alongside one another, each of which focuses on a specific aspect of non-compliance.</p><p>Alphabet and Apple are being investigated for a potential breach of steering rules on their app stores. According to the DMA, so-called “gatekeepers” are required to allow app developers to “steer” consumers away from the app store if there are cheaper offers available elsewhere.</p>
<p>Additionally, Alphabet is under scrutiny over concerns around “self-preferencing”, where Google search results may be highlighting Google’s own products and services through its search engine. </p><p>Apple is being checked over whether it makes it easy enough for consumers to use non-Apple software on their devices, such as search engines or web browsers. This is separate from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-doj-apple-antitrust-case-means-google-android">Apple antitrust case</a> recently announced by the US Department of Justice. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, we've opened five non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act.It concerns:🔹Alphabet’s rules on steering in Google Play 🔹Alphabet’s self-preferencing on Google Search🔹Apple’s rules on steering in the App Store 🔹Apple's choice screen for Safari… pic.twitter.com/kiZ7sLQa8B<a href="https://twitter.com/EU_Commission/status/1772207590212063397">March 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The proceedings against Meta concern its “pay or consent” model, which offers a paid membership tier for Facebook and Instagram. Users who pay can use the service without their data being used for adverts. However, users who don’t pay may be inadvertently giving Meta permission to harvest their personal data. The commission is “concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta&apos;s “pay or consent” model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent.” </p><p>In summary of the various investigations, the EC said: “The Commission suspects that the measures put in place by these gatekeepers fall short of effective compliance of their obligations under the DMA.” </p>
<p>Thierry Breton, the commissioner for the internal market, added that “the Digital Markets Act became applicable on 7 March. We have been in discussions with gatekeepers for months to help them adapt, and we can already see changes happening in the market. But we are not convinced that the solutions by Alphabet, Apple, and Meta respect their obligations for a fairer and more open digital space for European citizens and businesses.”</p><p>The investigations are expected to be concluded within 12 months, at which point the three companies will be informed of the preliminary findings of the investigation and what measures the commission expects them to take to ensure compliance. If any of the companies are found to have broken the rules, they can be fined up to 10 percent of their total worldwide turnover, with further sanctions for repeated infringements. </p>

<p>Last chance! For the first time ever, Amazon is slashing $150 off the 256GB Pixel Tablet as part of its Spring Sale. Thanks to the included charging speaker dock, this versatile device could easily double as a smart home hub, plus you get outstanding battery life and the fluid interface that Pixel fans love. The only problem is the tablet's abnormally large bezels, but if you can get over that design choice, it's an excellent device.</p>
<p>This historic discount is for 256GB version, but if you need less storage, you can also get a sweet <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1SLD1PK"><strong>$100 discount</strong></a> on the 128GB tablet. Keep in mind that the Amazon Spring Sale ends this evening, March 25th, so don't wait too long to make your move. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1SKS79W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="258901c3-fce0-44a7-be8b-0a2b7aa8af68" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$599.99" data-dimension48="$599.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Knowing Amazon, I wouldn&apos;t be terribly surprised if Amazon extended this discount beyond the confines of the Spring Sale, but I wouldn&apos;t risk it if you&apos;re interested. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> packs the recognizably sleek Pixel platform into the body of a tablet, but you get some surprises as well, such as a vibrant 11-inch LCD display, 8GB of RAM, and enough battery life to rival some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> on the market. You&apos;ll also enjoy the efficiency of the Tensor G2 chipset and, of course, all of the lengthy software support that Google is known for.</p>
