<ul><li>After being announced earlier this year, the Ayaneo Pocket DMG and Pocket Micro are now available for pre-order. </li><li>Both of these gaming handhelds are running Android, with the DMG powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 and the Micro uses the Helio G99.</li><li>Early Bird pricing for the Pocket Micro starts at $189, while the DMG starts at $339.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The world of gaming handhelds goes far beyond the likes of the Steam Deck and recently released ROG Ally X. Over the past year alone, we&apos;ve seen a rise in handhelds powered by Android, such as the AYN Odin 2 and Ayaneo Pocket S. However, Ayaneo is coming strong with two handhelds that are sure to invoke some nostalgia.</p><p>As you might have surmised, the Ayaneo Pocket DMG is a vertical <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handheld</a>, offering a reminiscent design of the original Game Boy. It features a 3.92-inch OLED display, with a 1240 x 1080 resolution and is capable of reaching up to 500 nits of brightness. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the DMG is that it&apos;s powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/snapdragon-g-series-chips">Snapdragon G3x Gen 2</a>. This is the same chip that&apos;s found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-pre-orders">Ayaneo Pocket S</a>, marking just the second device to make use of this SoC. There are also four different configurations to choose from, starting with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and maxing out with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Oh, and there&apos;s a microSD card slot if you need even more space for games.</p><p>Although the design harkens back to the Game Boy, this isn&apos;t the same handheld you grew up with. In addition to the D-Pad and ABXY buttons, the Pocket DMG is also equipped with a Hall Sensing joystick, resting within a "Dual-Mode Touchpad" area. This should make it easy to navigate throughout the interface, but it can also be mapped to act as an additional thumbstick. </p>

<p>You can check out the full spec sheet below, but the Pocket DMG is packed to the gills with features and options that you wouldn&apos;t expect. This includes things like Active Air Cooling, "Coastline" shoulder buttons, and a 6,000mAh battery.</p>

<p>If the idea of a vertical handheld isn&apos;t your cup of tea, then you might want to check out the Ayaneo Pocket Micro. This one was designed with the Game Boy Micro in mind, which was first released back in 2005. </p>

<p>With the Pocket Micro, we have a 3.5-inch IPS display, complete with a 960 x 640 resolution. That might not seem like a big deal, but between the resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio, this pocketable handheld offers 4x scaling for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-boy-game-boy-advance-emulators-android">Game Boy Advance emulation</a>. </p><p>Under the hood, Ayaneo opted to go with MediaTek&apos;s Helio G99 chip, the same SoC found in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-series-launch">Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Tab A9</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-camon-20-pro-and-camon-20-premier-review#section-tecno-camon-20-pro-and-camon-20-premier-performance-and-battery">Tecno Camon 20 Pro</a>. This is paired with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB of expandable storage. As for battery life, Ayaneo squeezed a 2,600mAh cell into the Pocket Micro, claiming it offers more than six hours of gameplay on a single charge.</p>

<p>One thing you don&apos;t have to worry about with the Pocket Micro are bezels. It follows in the footsteps of the Pocket S, offering an immersive experience without worrying about distracting bezels getting in the way. </p><p>In terms of controls, the D-Pad and ABXY buttons are slightly inset, providing another call back to the original Micro. However, Ayaneo&apos;s handheld brings thumbsticks on either side, in addition to the four bumpers found on the top. </p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MifAwun5c6xKKhTKXZ7ie8" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-200.jpeg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket Micro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MifAwun5c6xKKhTKXZ7ie8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ayaneo)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CkTK325Gmua7TLGHhzFxPA" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-201.jpeg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket Micro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CkTK325Gmua7TLGHhzFxPA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ayaneo)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2sZqMKiL5Rpx6WN9spLk37" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-163.jpeg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket Micro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2sZqMKiL5Rpx6WN9spLk37.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ayaneo)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Lastly, if you&apos;re worried about durability with the Pocket Micro, you can rest easy. Ayaneo relies on the "same CNC aluminum alloy frame" that the company began using with the Pocket S. Plus, there&apos;s an anodized finish providing a "matte texture for a luxurious tactile experience."</p><p>Now for the big questions — how much will these cost and when will they be available? Starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-dmg-snapdragon-g3x-gen-2-vertical-handheld#/">Pocket DMG</a>, we hope you&apos;re ready to empty your wallets. The splits in pricing below are for the Early Bird price and what the device will retail for. </p>
<ul><li>8GB+128GB: $339 / $449</li><li>12GB+256GB: $419 / $529</li><li>16GB+512GB: $499 / $609</li><li>16GB+1TB: $589 / $699</li></ul>
<p>The only catch here is that the 16GB/1TB model is only available with the "Retro Color limited edition" Pocket DMG. Any of the other configurations are only available in either Moon White or Arctic Black.</p>

<p>Things are a bit more simple with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-micro-tribute-to-classic-pocket-handhelds#/">Ayaneo Pocket Micro</a>, as there are only two configurations. The 6GB/128GB model will set you back $189 if you pre-order through Indiegogo and will retail for $219. Meanwhile, the 8GB/256GB version can be had for $219 during the Early Bird period or $249. However, there is a Retro Gray limited edition with an 8GB/256GB configuration, coming in with an Early Bird price of $249 while retailing normally for $279.</p><p>Unfortunately, although it&apos;s great that you can get your order in now, be prepared to wait a bit. Ayaneo estimates the Pocket Micro will ship in the "middle of September," while the Pocket DMG won&apos;t arrive until the "end of October."</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;ve crossed into financial earnings territory, and Samsung&apos;s latest report seems positive, thanks to the Galaxy S24 and AI.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s Q2 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-results-for-second-quarter-of-2024?utm_source=mainkv&utm_medium=internal">earnings report</a> is shattering expert expectations as the brand puts up 74.07 KRW in consolidated revenue. Additionally, it posted 10.44 trillion KRW in operating profits. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/samsung-q2-2024-earnings-strong-ai-demand-lifts-profits.html">CNBC</a> states Samsung&apos;s Q2 rose by 23% compared to the same time last year. What&apos;s more, statistics show that the company&apos;s operating profits rose by 1,458%.</p><p>Another highlight was the company&apos;s MX (mobile) and Network businesses, which posted 27.38 trillion KRW in consolidated revenue and 2.23 trillion KRW in operating profits. During the earnings call, Samsung said, "smartphone demand decreased sequentially in the seasonally weak quarter, particularly in the premium segment."</p><p>Despite a "sequential decline," the company reported that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series achieved a "double-digit" growth in shipments and revenue compared to the S23.</p><p>AI is another aspect of Samsung&apos;s revenue that it expects to continue to carry into the second half of 2024. The company also expects new products and "innovative" features to help its revenue bounce back. Such new devices are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Fold 6</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a>, as Samsung states demands in those areas should rise going into Q3.</p><p>For memory, Samsung states its DS Division continued to improve, posting 28.56 trillion KRW in consolidated revenue and 6.45 trillion KRW in operating profits. The report cites a "strong demand" for HBM, DRAM, and SSDs. More importantly, Samsung confirmed the existence of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25s-exynos-chipset-could-outpace-the-snapdragon-8-gen-4-in-efficiency">Exynos 2500,</a> saying it will ensure a "stable supply" for upcoming flagship models.</p>

<p>This is the second time Samsung has reported a positive quarter as Q1 saw a (sigh of relief) shift as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-q1-2024-earnings-report">memory business returned to form</a>. The launch of the Galaxy S24 series in January also contributed to the company&apos;s positive Q1 alongside its suite of Galaxy AI features.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s Head of Mobile, TM Roh, discussed the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discusses-the-ai-phone-future">newfound focus on AI</a>, stating that its R&D will be the main one in charge. Moreover, consumers could be on the cusp of new hardware changes for Samsung as it looks to accommodate on-device AI features.</p><p>Moving into Q3, Samsung&apos;s positive outlook is likely attributed to its July 10 launch of the latest foldable phones and wearables. It remains to be seen how well these devices perform, considering the Flip 6 and Fold 6 haven&apos;t received the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-lower-pre-order-numbers">same warm early reception</a> as last year&apos;s. In South Korea, Samsung reportedly achieved 910,000 pre-order units for its foldable devices, a bit short of its record-shattering number in 2023.</p><p>Though the number dropped, the Flip 6 was said to make up 60% of those pre-orders.</p>

<ul><li>Meta earned $39 billion in revenue this quarter, a 22% YoY increase and its second-biggest quarter ever.</li><li>3.27 billion people now use Meta apps daily, while Threads has grown to 200 million users.</li><li>Meta CEO emphasized the continued focus on investing billions in AI and Reality Labs to keep up with competitors.</li><li>Reality Labs R&D now totals $50 billion since Meta began tracking this data in earnings reports.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta maintained its strong growth in 2024, growing its total revenue by $7 billion compared to 2023 and its viewed ads by 10%. CEO Mark Zuckerberg boasted about the growth of products like Meta AI, Whatsapp, Threads, and Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses while glossing over Reality Labs&apos; operating losses.</p><p>On Wednesday, Meta reported its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investor.fb.com/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Meta-06-30-2024-Exhibit-99-1_Final.pdf" target="_blank">Q2 2024 earnings</a>. The company grew its total users to 3.27 billion, or 200 million more than last year. Zuckerberg highlighted that its X rival, Threads, now has 200 million users, while the internationally popular Whatsapp now has 100 million monthly U.S. users. </p><p>He also claimed that "against public perception," Facebook has become much more popular with "younger users," with CFO Susan Li claiming that this generation loves using Facebook Marketplace in particular.</p><p>Zuckerberg bragged multiple times that Meta AI is on track to become "the most used AI assistant by the end of the year" while "improving quickly both in intelligence and features." He claims that it has answered billions of queries since launch, many coming from the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses</a>. Interestingly, India is the "largest market for AI queries."</p><p>Financial analysts on the call expressed skepticism that Meta could profit from its AI investments, especially its open-source <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Llama 3 AI</a>. Zuckerberg and Li emphasized that they&apos;re focusing on expanding their reach for now before "monetizing [AI] over time" and that AI has helped Meta better target ads to users.</p>

<p>Meta only briefly touched upon Reality Labs, the R&D department dedicated to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">mysterious AR glasses</a>. Zuckerberg claimed that Quest 3 sales are "exceeding our expectations," but that didn&apos;t stop RL from hitting $4.5 billion in quarterly losses despite $353 million in Quest sales.</p><p>Li attributed the higher losses to a "20% increase due to headcount." In June, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181420/meta-wearables-reality-labs-layoffs">The Verge</a> reported that Meta would lay off Reality Labs employees while branching off the division into a second Wearables group. In theory, these changes could reduce RL losses going forward.</p><p>Still, Meta&apos;s total Reality Labs losses have reached a total of $50 billion since the company began reporting these numbers in Q4 2020. While future VR products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a> could mitigate some losses, it&apos;s clear that this number will only grow. Li repeated the same warning from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-earnings-q1-2024">past earnings calls</a> on Wednesday: "We continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts."</p><p>During the call, Zuckerberg hinted at major announcements at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-connect-2024-dates-announced-quest-3s-expected" target="_blank">Meta Connect 2024</a> on September 25. We expect Meta to unveil its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ar-glasses-tease-feb">(intentionally) leaked AR glasses</a> at the event, but industry reports suggest they will be a proof of concept, not a consumer-ready product.</p>

Samsung, which just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-results-for-second-quarter-of-2024">announced its quarterly earnings</a>, noted how smartphone growth overall was down, but sales of its Galaxy S24 series had increased by double digits compared to sales of the Galaxy S23 series.</p><p>Additionally, Amon says the performance of its Oryon CPUs has already "exceeded" the expectations of the company and its partners, comparing it to the boost seen in the new patch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/best-copilot-pc">Copilot Plus PCs</a>.</p><p>"You&apos;re going to see us doing that within our mobile roadmap, but on the premium tier," Amon said during the earnings call. "I&apos;m actually very excited given the upcoming launch of our next Snapdragon that has our custom CPU, and you&apos;re going to see the same shift in performance that we have done in the PC ecosystem, restoring the performance back to the Windows ecosystem.</p><p>You&apos;re going to see doing something similar in phone, and AI is going to be a big part of this story."</p>
<p>During the earnings call, Amon also noted that Qualcomm is excited about the trajectory of where AI is going and its relationship with partners. He referenced a long-term agreement with Honor, which recently launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-200-pro-review">Honor 200 Pro</a>, and an agreement with Samsung "largely consistent to what you have seen with the launch of the GS24," meaning we can likely expect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25s-exynos-chipset-could-outpace-the-snapdragon-8-gen-4-in-efficiency">new Exynos chips</a> to steal some of Qualcomm&apos;s share.</p><p>Amon also highlighted sales of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review" target="_blank">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>, which have exceeded Qualcomm&apos;s expectations, and underscore the momentum of AI models like Llama and XR devices and applications.</p><p>The Snapdragon Summit will kick off on October 24. At this event, we will learn more about the next Snapdragon chip and likely the first phones to adopt it.</p>

<ul><li>A report claims to have spilled the crucial details of Google's minimal performance upgrades for the Pixel 9 through the Tensor G4 SoC.</li><li>The chip has reportedly changed its core structure to help the chip cool off while also including minimal speed increases and the same GPU as the G3.</li><li>The Tensor G4 has been rumored to feature slight upgrades over the G3 for a while and recent rumors suggest the only big change will be its Exynos 5400 modem.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The supposed nitty-gritty surrounding Google&apos;s upcoming Tensor chip has surfaced and it&apos;s nothing short of disappointing.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-tensor-g4-small-upgrade-3466398/">Android Authority</a> credit an unnamed Google insider for information surrounding the Tensor G4 in the Pixel 9 series. According to this source, the Tensor G4 features cores that clock in "slightly higher" than the Tensor G3 alongside a reconfigured architecture. It reportedly follows a 4+3+1 scheme with the Cortex-A520 (1.9GHz), Cortex-A720 (2.6GHz), and Cortex-X4 (3.1GHz).</p><p>There&apos;s speculation that Google decided to swap the core setup to help the chip run cooler. Pixels have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro-battery-drain-and-network-issues">had a bad history</a> of overheating problems as it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-6-battery-overheating-issues">happened continuously</a> across multiple iterations.</p><p>The report adds that has also kept the same GPU as the Tensor G3: the Mali-G715. However, it&apos;s rumored to clock in slightly higher at 940MHz instead of 890MHz.</p><p>The Tensor G4 is rumored (once again) to feature a new modem from Samsung&apos;s kitchen called the Exynos 5400. We&apos;ve long since heard whispers about satellite connectivity support on the Pixel 9 and this modem would be its catalyst. This piece of hardware will allegedly improve power consumption by "up to 50%" than the Pixel 8.</p><p>Additional rumors state Google might not take advantage of this new modem across the entire Pixel 9 series. Speculation states the company is testing a device with the Tensor G4 and the previous Exynos 5300 modem. In theory, this could be a Pixel 9a, though we&apos;re likely a long way off from knowing for certain.</p><p>Other smaller technical aspects of the Pixel 9, like its AV1 encoder, ML accelerator, Digital Security Processor, and Titan M2 Security chip are rumored to remain unchanged.</p>

<p>The latest report doubles down on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-might-not-surprise">rumors we heard last year</a> that suggested the Tensor G4 would only offer "slight" performance upgrades. The Tensor G4 was reportedly known as "Zuma Pro" internally, which is a play off the G3&apos;s "Zuma" codename. More importantly, the chip was supposedly designed to run off a new processor called "Redondo."</p><p>However, sources claimed that Google ran into problems between its American and Indian teams working on it, thus scrapping the project entirely.</p><p>The Tensor G4 also appeared during an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-tensor-g4-benchmark-test-scores-details">AnTuTu benchmark test</a>, which completely spoiled its specifications. While the scores seemed high, they were only moderately better than the Pixel 8.</p><p>With what&apos;s been rumored, perhaps the major Pixel performance upgrade we&apos;re waiting on will arrive with the Tensor G5. Google is expected to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g5-chip-testing-preparations">drop Samsung for TSMC</a> as it prepares the next chip for the Pixel 10 series. Though the rumors keep us wondering, we&apos;ll know for sure on August 13 as Google readies its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">next hardware event</a>.</p>

<p>Google’s experience was all about the Play Store, which has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-curation-update-july-2024">undergoing some interesting changes</a>. There was a fairly long line and a huge Ferris wheel outside the convention center. The experience was to promote the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kabam.marvelbattle&hl=en_US&pli=1">Marvel Contest of Champions </a>game, which is available now on the Play Store. While waiting in line, attendees could play the game at stations set up with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>s, choosing a character to fight and hopefully win against multiple characters on a quest map.<br>
<br>
After that, you wait in line a bit longer to take photos with cardboard cutouts of some Marvel characters before hopping onto the Ferris wheel. With the hot San Diego sun beaming over me, I was, fortunately, able to enter the much faster VIP line with a Hero Pass, available to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-points-is-handing-out-pixel-devices-and-more-prizes">Play Points</a> users with Silver status or higher.</p>

<p>I admit this was my first time on a Ferris wheel, so I was quite nervous. However, it wasn’t particularly big, and it still gave me some good views of the convention. It didn’t take me long to get comfortable (although I’m sure I would still get nervous on a bigger Ferris wheel). While riding the wheel, the emcee would call out the names of characters that matched the individual gondolas, indicating which riders would win special prizes after the ride was over.</p><p>Stepping off the Ferris wheel, I was handed a cool pin and directed to the exit on the right. To the left, however, was the area where you could pick up prizes if your gondola was chosen. Among the prizes are sunglasses, a water bottle, a bag, and a hat. I didn’t get a prize, but hey, maybe next time.</p>

<p>Samsung’s Comic-Con experience wasn’t as exciting, but it sure was flashy and also focused on a mobile game with the opportunity to win prizes. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zynga.gotm&hl=en_US">Game of Thrones: Legends</a> is a puzzle RPG that lets you fight characters by matching jewels and using special character attacks. If you’re into puzzle games and like Game of Thrones, this might be for you.</p><p>The space was appropriately decorated like a scene out of “Game of Thrones,” including a chair where you could sit and have your photo taken. Samsung had tables where you could sit and play the game using various devices, including foldable phones like what I assume was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p>

<p>After playing the game a bit and waiting in line, I filled out a form asking about Android phones, Galaxy devices, and the latest Galaxy AI features. Samsung seemed to be gauging interest in its new phones and features, with one final question inquiring about price (the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and Z Fold 6 had their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-price-is-too-damn-high">prices increased by $100</a>).</p><p>After signing up on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Galaxy tablet</a>, I tried my hand at a claw machine where I could win Funko Pop figurines. I also did not get a prize, but an emcee was also picking people in line to answer questions about Samsung devices (“What are the latest Samsung devices called?”), offering more chances to win prizes.</p>
<hr>
<p>Google definitely had the flashier setup, given that it had a whole Ferris wheel set up in front of the San Diego Convention Center that even lit up at night. Yet, the experience wasn’t too focused on promoting Google products like Pixel devices or features—it was about the game and Play Points.</p><p>This was an interesting contrast to Samsung’s experience, which was a bit out of the way from the main Comic-Con area. And while Samsung’s experience was technically about Game of Thrones, the questionnaire and setup were heavily focused on boosting awareness of Samsung’s devices and features, which makes sense given the company just launched a slew of new devices.</p><p>Nonetheless, it was interesting to see both companies with a presence at Comic-Con, and I’m excited to see what they do at next year’s event.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced that it has started expanding its wildfire boundary alerts across 15 additional European and African countries.</li><li>These alerts will appear through Search and Maps as Google leverages AI models and satellites to map out the size and condition of a fire.</li><li>Google rolled these wildfire alerts across the U.S. in 2020 following a pilot run in California.</li></ul>

<p>Wildfires are a dangerous and serious aspect of nature, so Google is helping users in more places get a heads-up before it&apos;s too late.</p><p>As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-wildfire-boundary-maps-europe-africa/">Keyword post</a>, these AI-based alerts are arriving in 15 countries across Europe and Africa. Google states users in the following countries are eligible: Andorra, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Kenya, Monaco, Montenegro, Portugal, Rwanda, Slovenia, Spain, Türkiye.</p><p>Rolling out "this summer," users in the previously mentioned countries can expect to find wildfire information in Maps and Google Search.</p><p>Google sees <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sites.research.google/wildfires/">these wildfire alerts</a> as a way to help native and non-native (tourists) understand the situation around them. The push alerts piggyback off your device&apos;s settings, meaning your preferred language is how they will be displayed. Moreover, those using Google Maps will find the wildfire alert boundaries laid over the terrain around you so you remain informed.</p><p>If there are fires in your path, Maps will display a red banner stating "route may be affected by Severe fire."</p>

<p>The company&apos;s AI software consumes data from multiple sources, like satellite imagery, to provide "accurate" wildfire information. Google then depends on "fire scars," which signal whether or not authorities have gotten a fire under control. Additional AI models are to assist in determining the existence of fires for reliability.</p><p>During July&apos;s hectic streak of occurrences, Google&apos;s wildfire alerts helped citizens in other areas across Europe and Africa. The company adds that nearly 1.4 million users were alerted to the situation.</p><p>Users may remember when Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps-can-now-show-you-wildfire-boundaries">first rolled out these wildfire alerts</a> in the U.S. after piloting the feature in California. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&apos;s (NOAA) GOES satellites and data captured in the Google Earth engine were notable helpers in assisting users navigate turbulent times.</p><p>Google then brought in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-air-quality-index">air quality layer in Google Maps</a> to further its work in wildfire information. Users were given a colorful layer over any given area alongside a bar, indicating the air&apos;s condition.</p>

Most of the best ones are priced between $8 to $15 and you always get at least two units in the box.</p><p>For the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>&apos;s folding internal display, you need to make sure you get a durable, scratch-proof TPU film that&apos;s flexible. As for the external display, you can choose to go for a tempered glass pick or stick with a TPU screen guard. The choice is yours, so decide wisely. Keep in mind that plastic films aren&apos;t as protective against big impacts but they offer better touch response and heal from minor scratches over time.</p>

<h2 id="foldable-screens-need-more-protection-as-they-apos-re-more-fragile-2">Foldable screens need more protection as they&apos;re more fragile</h2>
<p>The lack of a dust-resistant IP rating on the Razr+ 2024 means that the display is really vulnerable to sand and tiny solid particles. This means you&apos;ll want to invest in one of the best Motorola Razr Plus 2024 screen protectors, particularly one that&apos;s got oleophobic properties to repel dust and dirt.</p><p>Orzero&apos;s 3 Pack Screen Protector for Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is the best option for your Motorola foldable. This three-pack gives you a trio of high-grade TPU films that are flexible, oleophobic, hydrophobic, and scratch-proof. The tough response is fabulous and the screen guards heal from tiny scratches over time. The price is under $10, which is amazingly cheap, but you&apos;ll have to get a screen protector for the Motorola Razr Plus 2024&apos;s external display separately.</p><p>If it&apos;s an all-in-one package you&apos;re looking for, both ArmorSuit and Suttkue have you covered. ArmorSuit&apos;s four-pack is cheaper, but you only get two TPU films for each of the phone&apos;s displays. On the other hand, the Suttkue multipack gives you six protective units in the box. This consists of two tempered glass camera lens protectors, two soft flexible TPU films, and two glass screen protectors. If it wasn&apos;t already implied, the flexible films are for the inner screen whereas the glass protectors are for the external display.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve reinforced your shiny Motorola Razr Plus 2024&apos;s displays with screen protectors, be sure to check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-plus-2024-cases">most spectacular cases for the foldable</a>.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring is a stylish ring that packs a ton of features in a slim and lightweight design. Ideally paired with a Samsung Galaxy phone and/or new Samsung Galaxy Watch, it is ultra-durable so you can wear it just about anywhere. With incredible battery life and an equally elegant charging case to extend that, it’s poised to give Oura a run for its money.</p></p>

Both are premium smart rings that function similarly to smartwatches and fitness trackers, except they are worn on your finger instead of your wrist.</p><p>They are sleek, filled with sensors to track all types of health and wellness metrics, and have their own unique benefits. Which of the two smart rings should you choose? We’re here to help.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-ring-vs-ringconn-smart-ring-the-fit-and-design-2">Samsung Galaxy Ring vs. RingConn Smart Ring: The fit and design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3937px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="4b5saqQ7cfSP9bZPWD9ysM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-hands-on-3.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4b5saqQ7cfSP9bZPWD9ysM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3937" height="2215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First, let’s examine fit and design. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> is ultra-slim at just 2.6mm in thickness as well as lightweight, weighing from 2.3 grams up to 3 grams, depending on the size. Speaking of which, it comes in nine size options from 5 to 13 to fit a variety of finger circumferences. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">his hands-on</a>, Android Central’s Derrek Lee says he was surprised by how thin and light the Galaxy Ring is, noting that even though the dimensions suggest it’s thicker than others, the concave design makes it seem thinner. “It feels more like a ring and less like a regular smart ring,” he notes.</p><p>It’s advisable to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-find-the-right-samsung-galaxy-ring-size">get the ring sizing kit to choose the right size</a>. Wear the size you think fits best for 24 hours on your index, middle, or ring finger. Since your finger tends to fluctuate in size throughout the day, especially for women, it’s crucial to ensure that you’re choosing one that isn’t too tight or too loose. Once you confirm the size, you can place your order.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-color-samsung-galaxy-ring-should-you-buy">Available in three scratch-resistant finishes</a> with a durable titanium frame, choose black, silver, or gold. It comes with a full cradle quick charge case that can keep it powered up for as long as two weeks. The ring itself lasts for a week per charge. The clear charging case is stylish with a nice lighting effect to confirm status.</p><p>The ring is extra durable in that it boasts both an IP68 rating as well as a 10ATM rating, which means you can safely swim with it, even in depths as deep as 100 meters. As with any water-resistant device, however, be mindful that this pertains to freshwater surfaces. You’ll want to heed caution in heavily chlorinated pools as well as saltwater.</p><p>On the underside of the watch are three sensors that come in contact with your skin. There’s an optical bio-signal sensor for measuring heart rate, an accelerometer for tracking activities like walking and running, and a skin temperature sensor. The ring pairs seamlessly with the Samsung Health app and does not require a subscription.</p><p>While you can use this smart ring with any Android phone, you’ll be able to leverage all the features when it’s paired with a Samsung Galaxy smartphone. With some of the latest Galaxy smartphones and Galaxy watches, you’ll get additional features, too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JLEY82zQrufU5e3wGQSZX6" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-review-13.jpg" alt="RingConn Smart Ring in the charging cradle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JLEY82zQrufU5e3wGQSZX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At 2.6mm thin as well, the RingConn Smart Ring comes in Moonlit Silver, Midnight Black, or Pale Gold, very similar colors. It boasts a unique “squircle” design that’s not quite a smooth circle. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-smart-ring-review">his review</a>, Lee says that while the ring doesn’t look as premium as others, it’s not too thick and stands out among a sea of others that all look identical to one another. The flat bottom also makes it easy to tell which side should be on the underside of your finger.</p><p>Sizing ranges from 6-14, so those with extra-thin fingers might find the Samsung Galaxy Ring’s smallest size most suitable. Conversely, those with extra-thick fingers might need to size up and opt for the largest size 14 of the RingConn model. As with the Samsung Galaxy Smart Ring, it’s advised to use the custom sizer to make sure you get the right fit. It’s slightly heavier than the Samsung Galaxy Ring at 3-5 grams, depending on the size.</p><p>Made of lightweight titanium that’s corrosion-resistant with a PVC coating, the RingConn Smart Ring is also IP68 rated, but it does not have an ATM rating for pressure. Nonetheless, you should still be able to safely enjoy casual swims and showers with this model.</p><p>The RingConn Smart Ring comes with a portable charging case as well and lasts for up to seven days per charge, too. The company says the case can offer up to 18 full recharges, which is a huge deal since you can keep it going presumably for weeks. On the underside of this smart ring are four PPG sensors, four temperature sensors, and a 3D accelerometer.</p><p>This smart ring does not require a subscription either, and it can pair seamlessly with all types of phones, including both Android and iOS. Thus, if you don’t own a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, you might prefer this one. it’s also compatible with Apple Health and Google Fit.</p>

<p>Once you have the right size and you’re sporting a new Samsung Galaxy Ring on your finger, what can it do? The smart ring has three sensors, as noted, that track metrics like heart rate, sleep, stress, skin temperature, and more. The sleep tracker offers additional features like snore detection, sleep stages, heart rate during sleep, movement, sleep latency, and respiratory rate. There’s also cycle tracking for ladies to track their menstrual health along with heart rate alerts and the option to run a live heart rate check.</p><p>Thanks to the inclusion of Galaxy AI, you’ll also get an Energy Score. This calculates physical readiness based on the previous night’s sleep, heart rate, and activities to let you know if you should take a rest day or go for it with an intense cardio session. Along with tracking a variety of workouts, it has auto workout detection for walking and running, as well as inactive alerts to remind you to get up and move.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring also provides wellness tips and personalized suggestions, learning more about you over time, and monitors health vitals 24/7. All health data is stored in Samsung Cloud and accessible through the companion Samsung Health app. </p><p>With a compatible Samsung Galaxy phone, you can use the ring to control it through a pinch gesture motion. This can trigger actions like snapping a photo or snoozing an alarm. Lee tried this with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and says the gestures work really well. With a compatible phone, you can also ping the ring with Find My Ring, perfect if you left it in the locker room at the gym or forgot where you put it down in the house. However, it only turns on the ring’s sensor light when you do this, so it might not be helpful in a bright room.</p><p>Samsung also says that when you wear the Galaxy Ring paired with one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">the best Galaxy smartwatches</a> like the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, you’ll get more accurate health analysis. This is because the two together improve precision, especially while sleeping. You can also purportedly wear the Galaxy Ring for longer when it’s paired with the Galaxy Watch, extending the battery life by up to 30 percent.</p>

<p>What about the RingConn Smart Ring? Its sensors work much the same way, tracking many of the same metrics, including heart rate, sleep and sleep stages, blood oxygen, stress, and skin temperature. It offers 24/7 health monitoring as well with a unique feature that lets you share health data with a family member or caregiver, great for the elderly or those with disabilities or who are keeping an eye on risk factors like heart attack or stroke. (Naturally, as with any smart ring, this isn’t a medical device).</p><p>You get detailed analysis as well as suggestions as the Ringconn Smart Ring tracks various metrics, with everything easily accessible in the RingConn app. You can also use the app to refine goals as you notice improvements or want to create more accessible goals. While Lee says the app might look busy to some, the Wellness Balance feature, currently in beta, is a neat view that combines all your data and plots it onto a graph. This makes it easy to see which areas need work and how you are progressing (or regressing).</p><p>One limitation is that The RingConn Smart Ring has limited exercise modes from which to choose, with the feature still in beta. It includes basic ones like running, walking, and cycling, but that’s it. Hopefully more are coming in the future; Lee says RingConn is “working to develop more diverse sports modes.” There are, however, neat badge rewards to help encourage you as you hit goals or even wear the ring for a specific duration of time. Lee says it’s a “fun way to turn wearing your smart ring into a game.” But for now, if you want to be able to track different sports, exercises, and activities and don’t already own a smartwatch to do that, the RingConn model won’t be a good choice.</p><p>There are no added bells and whistles with this smart ring, which is also reflected in its price, which is much more affordable than the Samsung Galaxy Ring. But the integration with Google Fit and Apple Health might make it the better option for those who own something other than a Samsung Galaxy smartphone. However, it’s worth noting that Lee did experience issues syncing and connecting the ring to the app on multiple occasions, which can be frustrating.</p>

<p>So, you’re ready to take the leap and dive into the smart ring space. Whether you’re using it on its own or complementing a smartwatch or fitness tracker you already wear, both the Samsung Galaxy Ring vs. RingConn Smart Ring are good options to consider.</p><p>Naturally, if you own a Samsung Galaxy phone, it’s a no-brainer to buy the Samsung Galaxy Ring. You’ll enjoy a truly holistic experience with everything tracked in the Samsung Health app. If you also own a compatible Samsung Galaxy Watch, you’ll really appreciate adding this model to the ecosystem to get the most accurate results possible.</p><p>If you own another branded Android phone or even an iPhone, I’d recommend going with the RingConn Smart Ring instead. Like Apple, Samsung has a fairly closed ecosystem with its products. While you can technically use the Samsung Galaxy Ring with another branded Android device, it doesn’t make much sense when you’re paying for some features you won’t be able to leverage.</p><p>With that said, if you partake in a lot of water-based activities or just spend a lot of time outdoors, you might appreciate the extra durability the Samsung Galaxy Ring affords. The 10ATM rating is higher than you’ll find in most premium smartwatches, much less smart rings. Plus, the focus on additional sleep data could be crucial to those who are focused on improving sleep, especially if you suffer from sleep apnea or want to measure your snoring.</p><p>But the RingConn Smart Ring offers enticing features, too, like the 500mAh charging case that can keep the Ring powered up for weeks. Pop it in your purse and recharge while having brunch or commuting home from work. The health-sharing option will be appreciated by those who want to keep an eye on loved ones as well.</p><p>A small but potentially important detail: those on either extreme side of sizing might find that Samsung’s smallest size fits better or conversely, Ringconn’s largest size accommodates them. This could be a deciding factor for you once you get the respective sizing kits and try them on.</p><p>Final decision? If you have a Samsung Galaxy phone and/or Galaxy watch, go with the Samsung Galaxy Ring. If you own any other Android phone or an iPhone, the RingConn Smart Ring is a better option.</p>
