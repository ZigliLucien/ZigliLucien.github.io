<p>Over the past couple of years, I've been completely enamored by trying to turn anything I can into a retro gaming machine. I was hoping to find a good deal on something like Walmart's Onn. 4K Streaming Media Player, but no dice. Then, I saw Jerry's article that talks about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/build-your-own-nas-on-black-friday-cyber-monday-and-save-hundreds">building your own NAS with a Raspberry Pi</a>, and it gave me the "AHA" moment I needed.</p><p>Now that the Raspberry Pi 5 has been out for a little over a year, we don't have to deal with inventory shortages. This makes for the perfect brain of a retro gaming station, and one that you can even take with you when visiting family for the holidays.</p><p>On top of that, there are quite a few deals on different Raspberry Pi 5 kits, such as the Turbo Cooled Edition from Vilros, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Vilros-Raspberry-5-8GB-Starter-Kit/dp/B0CTT6X2ZJ/"><strong>which happens to be</strong> <strong>20% off</strong></a>.  This kit includes the 8GB Raspberry Pi 5, and almost everything else that you'll need to get up and running.</p>

<p>Although the Vilros Starter Kit includes a case, it doesn't really do much to invoke the "retro nostalgia" that I'm looking for. Geeekpi is here to do exactly that but with an added bonus. See, you could get away with just loading everything up onto the microSD card, but once you start playing more demanding games, there's a potential for some bottlenecking.</p>

Not only does it look like an NES, but it even includes an expansion board so you can add an NVMe SSD to your Pi 5. Plus, it makes all of the ports easily accessible in the event that you need to plug in some peripherals. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/GeeekPi-Raspberry-Active-Cooler-Game5Pi/dp/B0DKHKD7MT/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4e5e3b34-0cc8-4569-8990-d15030056a5f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="GeeekPi Game5Pi Case with N08 Board: $24.99" data-dimension48="GeeekPi Game5Pi Case with N08 Board: $24.99" data-dimension25="$">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>With the Geeekpi Game5Pi Case, not only can you make the Pi look like an NES, but it also includes an M.2 NVMe SSD Peripheral Board and a cooler. NVMe SSDs are pretty cheap as it is, and there are still some last-minute deals, such as<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0CN9CD9JF"> saving $15 on a 1TB M.2 2230 drive</a>. However, the real benefit is the increased read/write speeds compared to when you were to stick to the included microSD card.</p><p>The only thing missing now is a way to actually play those games. When it comes to controllers with retro vibes, few can match up to the lineup that 8BitDo can provide. I was hoping to see either Bluetooth versions of the SN30 Pro or Pro 2 on sale, but couldn't find a deal on either one. Not all hope is lost, as the SN30 Pro Wired Controller is on sale for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/8bitdo-sn30-pro-usb-gamepad-gray/6475680.p">a few bucks off over at Best Buy</a>.</p>

<p>It also helps that the Geeekpi case includes front-facing USB-A ports, otherwise, it might be a bit more of a nuisance to go the wired route. But hey, you could always get a couple of these and huddle around the TV with your family just like we used to do when we were kids!</p><p>And that's pretty much it! Once everything arrives, just head over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://retropie.org.uk/">RetroPie</a> website, so you can enjoy a retro-themed operating system. Then, load up the microSD card or NVMe with your library of retro games, and be on your merry way!</p>

<ul><li>The latest Firefox update introduces a longtime iPadOS feature that will make Android foldables and tablets just as good for web browsing as iPads.</li><li>Firefox for Android version 133 will now load desktop sites by default on big-screened Android devices.</li><li>The change might make Firefox more appealing than Chrome, which only defaults to desktop webpages on "premium" Android tablets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Firefox for Android is gaining a highly-requested feature that will make the experience of web browsing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Android foldables</a> and tablets better. The latest version of Firefox for Android, version 133, loads webpages in desktop mode by default on all large devices, including foldables and tablets. Mozilla announced the change in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/android/133.0/releasenotes/" target="_blank">release notes</a> for Firefox for Android v133, as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/02/firefox-android-desktop-websites-tablets-foldables/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>"Desktop mode browsing is now enabled by default for large devices," the release notes explain. "This can be controlled via a preference under Settings in 'Site settings' previously named 'Site permissions.'"</p><p>The change is significant because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/firefox-announces-extension-support-for-android">Firefox</a> becomes the first major Android browser to load desktop sites by default on all big-screened Android devices. This matches functionality Apple has made available on iPadOS for years; iPads go a step further, presenting themselves as macOS clients to web providers. Firefox's widespread, and default, support for large Android devices will make it a top option for people who want the best browsing experience on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/are-foldable-phones-actually-better-than-tablets">tablets and folding phones</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BPAY9T9qMoxUh4BjGcnUMk" name="split-screen-apps-on-pixel-9-pro-fold.jpg" alt="Split-screen multitasking on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BPAY9T9qMoxUh4BjGcnUMk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Not even Chrome supports this Firefox feature on foldables. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Chrome supports desktop pages by default on "premium" Android tablets, limiting the experience. It also doesn't support default desktop sites for folding phones, even on the best ones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>While the behavior change for desktop sites on large Android devices is certainly the highlight of Firefox for Android v133, there's one other change worth noting. Clipped content in Private Browsing mode will now be treated as "sensitive content," and on Android 13 or higher devices, Firefox will mask clipboard notifications for privacy.</p><p>Importantly, Firefox doesn't appear to be limiting the default preferences for desktop sites to high-end devices, like Chrome has done since 2023. That means you should be able to start using desktop mode in Firefox without activating it manually on your Android foldables and tablets starting now, after you update to Firefox for Android v133.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini could be taking a cue from Google Search in a future update, adding the "I'm feeling lucky" button.</li><li>Tapping the "I'm feeling lucky" button in Gemini will generate a random prompt to show off the AI chatbot's skills.</li><li>This new option will be part of the suggestions carousel in the Gemini app, which was removed in October.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The suggestions carousel for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> is poised to make a comeback, bringing a longtime Google Search feature with it, if a recent APK teardown is any indication. The team at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-im-feeling-lucky-3504715/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> discovered the reversal in <strong>version 15.48.33.sa.arm64 beta</strong> of the Google app. In addition to suggestions making a return, the APK teardown revealed a new option for Gemini: <strong>I'm feeling lucky</strong>.</p><p>For the uninitiated, "I'm feeling lucky" is a way to use Google Search that is intended to randomize your experience. You can type in a prompt, and instead of pressing <strong>Search</strong>, clicking "I'm feeling lucky" will automatically open the webpage that would've been at the top of the search results for your query. It's a bit of a gamble, since the top result isn't always the best one. That's why, as the name suggests, it requires a bit of luck.</p><p>Another way to use "I'm feeling lucky" is to click the button before entering a Google Search query. After doing that, you'll get a completely random prompt, usually directed to a niche Google Search feature. For example, a common "I'm feeling lucky" redirect is to Google Doodles, which is the home for artistic renditions of the Google logo.</p><p>The version of "I'm feeling lucky" set to make an appearance in Gemini is more like the latter. It'll come up with a completely random Gemini prompt to run, and users will learn more about what Gemini can do in the process. You can see what that looks like in the example screenshots from Android Authority below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1374px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.80%;"><img id="XK2jFkZCu7hQxUHo5gXKr7" name="Gemini-Feeling-Lucky" alt="A screenshot of the new "I'm feeling lucky" prompt in Gemini." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XK2jFkZCu7hQxUHo5gXKr7.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1374" height="1014" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the above example, Gemini's "I'm feeling lucky" prompt highlighted a Gemini Extension with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tasks-best-gmail-feature">Google Tasks</a>. The sample request involved asking Gemini to set a reminder, and the AI chatbot did so using Tasks integration. At the end, Gemini suggested going live with voice, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">pushing users to try Gemini Live</a>. It all appears to part of an effort to help users understand the type of tasks the assistant can help with, all while having a bit of fun.</p><p>While the suggestions carousel — which included sample prompts for Gemini — was removed in October, it's back in the Google app beta with "I'm feeling lucky" at the forefront. This option is at the front of the carousal, all the time. Even though the rest of the carousel's options shuffle around, "I'm feeling lucky" is persistent.</p><p>This feature was spotted as part of an APK teardown, so it's not certain that Google will bring back either the suggestions carousel or "I'm feeling lucky," or both. However, it could be a neat way to show off Gemini's potential while making a clever callback to an iconic Google Search feature.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You've ever found yourself in need of a second monitor — either while traveling or otherwise — or just need a monitor that's easy to bring anywhere. It even has a kickstand!</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't like IPS displays. I'm not sure why else you wouldn't want this monitor.</p><p>I particularly love the included case that doubles as a stand. Like I said before, it makes the thing look like a tablet — which tells you how portable it is — so it's easy to slap in a travel bag and not look like a weirdo who carries a monitor around with them.</p><p>Most tablets, smartphones, laptops, Chromebooks, and even some consoles support USB-C display out, so it's likely whatever you're looking to plug the monitor into will just work. Don't try it with a Nintendo Switch, though, because that needs to be plugged into the dock to output to a monitor or TV.</p>

You even get a few surprising features out of the deal, such as spatial audio support (that actually works) and some ultra-fast charging capabilities. The Beats Solo 4 are all about balance and value, and in those regards, they&apos;re an absolute triumph.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors state Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite "Gen 2" could see a "significant" price hike in 2025.</li><li>A report claims this is due to several "internal and external" factors that are a major catalyst behind this supposed price increase for OEMs and suppliers.</li><li>Samsung's Galaxy S25 series was previously rumored to be in line for a price increase due to Qualcomm's beefed-up Oryon core 8 Elite.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New (supposed) information is coming to light about next year's successor to the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>User <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1863433682222284858">Jukanlosreve</a> on X spotted a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kipost.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=324103">KiPost</a> (Korean, pay-walled) that claims Qualcomm's next flagship SoC could demand more from OEMs (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/qualcomm-wants-android-device-makers-pay-even-more-next-flagship-chip/">Android Police</a>). The major highlight of this report is the possibility that Qualcomm could increase the price of the 2025 flagship chip by a "significant" amount.</p><p>The chip has been dubbed the Snapdragon 8 Elite "Gen 2," with the report alleging that "various internal and external factors" are the situation's primary catalyst.</p><p>It remains to be seen how this affects the end-user (consumers); however, the publication claimed "component suppliers have been notified." It seems like OEMs and suppliers will feel this price hike first as the post states such suppliers will "raise base prices" or enter "intense" negotiations.</p><p>Those at Android Police spotted a rumor from Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/P2FgMulRq">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS), who offered insight into the 2nd-gen's potential changes. According to their post, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite "Gen 2" may be based on TSMC's N3P process. This is reportedly an enhanced version of its 3nm process, per the publication.</p><p>DCS alleges the chip could see a ~20% "performance improvement" and feature "built-in single-frame-level power consumption reduction technology."</p><p>We're likely almost a year out from another flagship Qualcomm debut, but the idea of a price hike <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-rumored-price-hike-sour">echoes what we've heard</a> about the Galaxy S25 series. Rumors in September said Samsung's next flagship series could see a ~20% price increase due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. The purchasing cost for the chip was reportedly around $190. It's no hiding the fact that Qualcomm boosted its 2024 chip with the Oryon CPU cores.</p><p>The report from KiPost adds that Samsung could get hit pretty hard by this SoC price increase, similar to what we've heard about its upcoming phone trio.</p><p>The SoC delivers a 44% efficiency boost and a 45% performance increase for flagship models. The graphics processing capabilities have also gone up, but the cost for doing it again might cost <em>even more</em>.</p><p>Nothing is for sure right now, so we'll have to keep calm about what this <em>could </em>mean for consumers. It's also unclear if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tsmc-us-investigation-breakdown">what's been going on with TSMC</a> is affecting Qualcomm's 2025 outlook already. What we can turn to now are recent rumors about Qualcomm's next toned-down flagship chip: the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8s-elite-power-changes-rumored">Snapdragon 8s Elite</a>." Tipsters claim the chip sits somewhere between the SD 8 Gen 2 and the SD 8 Gen 3. It also seems that it could debut in Q1 2025.</p>

Unfortunately, it seems to be available solely through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ringconn.com/products/ringconn-gen-2">RingConn's own site</a>, with a tiny $15-off coupon for Cyber Monday ($285 total).</p><p>Of the other great smart ring options we've tested, my personal favorite (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>) is only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ULTRAHUMAN-AIR-Smart-Tracker-Fitness-Titanium/dp/B0D9B7Q6DJ"><strong>15% off ($296)</strong></a>, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> is full-priced ($399) with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-before-you-buy-size-11-titanium-black/6588160.p?skuId=6588160"><strong>$50 gift card</strong></a>. As much as I'd like to recommend Ultrahuman, it's hard to turn down saving  an extra $137 for most of the same health data.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Amazfit Helio Ring</a> is only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Subscription-Charging-Titanium-Water-Resistance/dp/B0D5LCCLWS"><strong>$149 (25% off)</strong></a>, beating RingConn's price slightly, but we're not quite as impressed with that smart ring. It's actually the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-ring-hr-accuracy-test">best smart ring for HR accuracy</a>, but its short battery life and limited sizes make it harder to recommend. Still, it's worth considering if you have the right ring size!</p><p>With all that context, it's clear that the RingConn Smart Ring is a real bargain at $159, shipping in three colors (Midnight Black, Moonlight Silver, Pale Gold) and seven sizes from 8–14. It's unfortunately not available in smaller sizes, so those with smaller hands may have to look at alternate brands like Ultrahuman or Oura.</p><p>Grab this Cyber Monday smart ring deal while it's still available! And Gollum/ Smeagol, if you're reading this, maybe try wearing this <em>new</em> precious instead of hunting those evil hobbitses into Mordor!</p>

<hr>
<p>Google was spotted working on a new AI-backed feature Chrome that could bring some peace of mind when shopping.</p><p>The feature was noticed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Leopeva64/status/1862472230849917178">Leopeva64</a> on X, who states Google Chrome on desktop could pick up AI-sourced "Store Reviews" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-store-review-feature-3504394/">Android Authority</a>). According to the tipster, this feature is reportedly preparing to show users a complete "summary" of reviews grabbed from popular websites like "Trust Pilot, ScamAdvisor, and more."</p><p>They were able to surface the feature's basic structure in the deep dive. It was discovered that Google may pop "Store Reviews" into the "View Site Information" button on desktop. Currently, clicking this expands on your site permissions and settings. However, "Store Reviews" may find themselves featured at the bottom of this small menu.</p><p>Clicking on that will supposedly open a quick blurb of the review alongside Google's usual explainer that it's powered by AI.</p><p>The tipster states that clicking on it now — since it's early in development — doesn't offer an AI-generated review. However, it seems that the quick summary will appear in this short menu. Moreover, the post states Google is also working on a button that produces a "side panel" in Chrome. This panel will supposedly host "all of the reviews" for a given website.</p><p>So, for users who want to really dive in to what other's are saying, that might be your best bet. Since things still need figuring out, we'll likely have to wait a while before this hits Chrome.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google is preparing another AI-powered feature for Chrome called “Store reviews,” this feature will show you a “summary of reviews from independent websites like Trust Pilot, ScamAdvisor, and more,” this summary will be displayed in the page info bubble:https://t.co/yDCBBbfzg4 pic.twitter.com/pMOXymaNum<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1862472230849917178">November 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Google started down a path to AI-ify Chrome earlier this year when it highlighted the launch of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-bringing-ai-to-chrome-but-in-the-right-way">experimental features</a>. Among the features was the ability to "Create with AI' to make customized themes in Chrome. Another feature was the ability to leverage AI to group your tabs, which users could tell the browser to place "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-update-brings-better-organization-of-tabs">similar tabs</a>" together. That feature has since rolled out on desktop and Android, giving users more ways to stay organized.</p><p>Other AI features include "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-222-12pm-et-google-chrome-update-brings-help-me-write-and-generative-ai-to-any-website">Help me write</a>" within Chrome. Users can utilize this feature in any text box when using the browser through Google Workspace. The feature utilizes the context of the page you're on to help you create a piece of text alongside your added description.</p><p>The company is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-project-jarvis-ai-agent-report">reportedly working to bolster</a> Chrome's AI even further with a new agent. A report claimed that Google is creating an AI agent called "Jarvis" that can enable automatic tasks inside Chrome. Jarvis allegedly works by taking screenshots of what you're doing so it can "interpret" the next best course of action and get it done for you.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus' CEO Pete Lau officially confirmed that the company will launch the OnePlus 13 globally in January 2025 in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1734446167443374088" target="_blank">blog post</a> today, Dec. 2. While Lau didn't share a more specific release date, this confirms that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> is headed to more markets soon. The latest flagship from OnePlus, sticking to tradition, launched early in China in October.</p><p>While the OnePlus 12 launched on Feb. 6 of this year in the US and global markets, it stands to reason that the newer model might debut much sooner than that. For reference, the OnePlus 12 released in China on Dec. 5, 2023. The company moved up its China release for the OnePlus 13, and the global launch is expected to follow suit. OnePlus could reveal the OnePlus 13 to the world sometime in early-to-mid January, almost syncing up with the expected launch timeline for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung's Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XSzAZDXTpRYXADiJvSPikh" name="OnePlus-13-launch-teaser.jpg" alt="OnePlus 13 launch tease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XSzAZDXTpRYXADiJvSPikh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the phone already launched in China, we know what the OnePlus 13 will bring when it debuts next month. You'll get Qualcomm's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite"><u>Snapdragon 8 Elite</u></a> platform, up to 24GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of storage. Additionally, the phone will ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15 (based on Android 15)</a>, with a slew of new AI features.</p><p>Aside from the brief mention in OnePlus' blog post commencing the 11th anniversary of the brand, OnePlus also shared the news in a promotional email, shown via a screenshot below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.56%;"><img id="jdkSbGrhG75P9yaqFuQBD6" name="OnePlus-13-Coming Soon" alt="An email promo from OnePlus about the OnePlus 13." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jdkSbGrhG75P9yaqFuQBD6.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1072" height="1614" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is something left to mystery, though. While there have been subtle confirmations and major leaks regarding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-rendering-additional-specs-leak">OnePlus 13R</a>, we don't know whether this midrange phone will launch alongside the flagship OnePlus 13. If it launches in China this month, there's a good chance we could see it debut sometime in January 2025 worldwide. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-upcoming-global-launch-rumors">OnePlus Watch 3</a> is another upcoming OnePlus product to watch out for.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Cyber Monday deals have landed, and once again, it&apos;s Mint Mobile who has impressed me the most. In addition to record-smashing discounts on Pixel phones and 50% off one of the best unlimited plans in the United States, the T-Mobile-owned (and Ryan Reynolds-approved) MVNO carrier is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mintmobile.com/phone-plans/3-month-plans/"><strong>giving away a FREE month of wireless</strong></a> when you sign up for three months of the 5GB plan. </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>Mint Mobile's Cyber Monday sale is LIVE — see the full list of deals</strong></a></li></ul>
<p>That means that for one upfront payment of $30, you&apos;ll get unlimited talk, text, and 5GB of data on T-Mobile&apos;s vast 5G network for three full months, not to mention Wi-Fi calling, free calls to Mexico and Canada, and a free mobile hotspot. The offer is merely the latest in a long line of seemingly illogical Mint Mobile deals to drop around this year&apos;s Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale events, but I&apos;m certainly not complaining.</p>

<p>Curious about Mint Mobile? Join the carrier today on the 5GB plan and you'll get one month of your first three months for completely free. That knocks the price of the plan down to only $30 for three months! Not too shabby for one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carriers</a> in the business. </p>

<p>If you're okay committing to a full year of wireless in one fell swoop, forget everything I just said and check out this Cyber Monday deal that carves a whopping $500 off the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> AND 50% off one year of the top-rated Unlimited plan when you purchase the two items together at Mint.</p>
<p>That means you could get one of the best phones released this year alongside a full 12 months of Unlimited wireless for a single payment of $479 (or $20/month with affirm). There's a reason why I keep calling this the best Pixel deal of the year. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e521f192-353c-4739-8bc1-0a8122fa2858" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want great wireless coverage and great phone support without the hassle or complicated contracts of a Big Three carrier; you&apos;re Ryan Reynolds.</p><p><strong>❌Skip Mint Mobile if: </strong>you don&apos;t like the idea of buying phone service in bulk; you&apos;re happy with your current wireless plan.</p><p>To put it bluntly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a> works by selling T-Mobile-powered data to users in bulk. The plans are simply named after how much data you&apos;ll receive: 5GB, 15GB, 20GB, or Unlimited, and you pay for your service in 3, 6, 12-month increments of time. Once your data allotment runs out for the month, Mint doesn&apos;t cut you off, your speeds just slow down. </p><p>Still, if you&apos;re a particularly heavy data user, Mint Mobile may not be the right carrier for you. After all, even the Unlimited plan slows after 40GB. For other folks, Mint&apos;s buy-in-bulk system may not be as convenient as the modular plan systems offered by other MVNOs. But if you simply want an affordable T-Mobile-powered wireless service that doesn&apos;t skimp on premium features, Mint Mobile&apos;s Cyber Monday sale is ready to hook you up with long-term coverage for dirt cheap.  </p>
