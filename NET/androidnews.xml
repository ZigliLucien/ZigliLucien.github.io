<ul><li>Ayaneo has finally shared more details regarding its next Android gaming handheld. </li><li>The Pocket S is powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, featuring up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. </li><li>There are two versions available, with the Pocket S 1080P Edition and 1440P Advance Edition.</li><li>Ayaneo's Indiegogo campaign is underway, with "Early Bird" prices starting at either $399 or $439.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Before the calendar flipped into 2024, Qualcomm and Ayaneo surprised us all with the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-reveal-teaser">Pocket S</a>. After a few teasers here and there, but nothing substantial being shared, that&apos;s all changed. Ayaneo has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ayaneo.com/article/828">officially shared</a> the full spec sheet, along with pricing.</p><p>Nothing has changed in that the Pocket S will still be powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2. However, it turns out that there Ayaneo is planning to launch two versions, the 1080P Edition and 1440P Advance Edition. The only difference between the two will be the screen resolution, but everything else remains the same.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="khd8uAnLAYQKaxjAr8smTh" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-breakdown.jpeg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket S highlighted specs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/khd8uAnLAYQKaxjAr8smTh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ayaneo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you might suspect, the 1080P Edition features a 6-inch "Borderless" IPS display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. The Advance Edition includes the same screen size but with an increased resolution of 2560 x 1440 for a higher pixel density and clearer picture. Surprisingly, there was no mention made of whether either model will offer refresh rates above 60Hz. </p>

<p>Paired with the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, Ayaneo is offering either 12GB or 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of expandable storage. If you opt for the 512GB or 1TB model, the Pocket S utilizes UFS 4.0, while the 128GB version relies on the older UFS 3.1 standard. </p>

<p>What all this means in terms of performance is kind of subjective. According to Ayaneo, the G3x Gen 2 offers 30% more CPU performance, while "GPU performance is doubled" compared to the G3x Gen 1. Ayaneo also claims that this chip will allow the Pocket S to "achieve a maximum continuous performance output of 15W."</p><p>Moving onto the design, it&apos;s about what you might expect, basically offering an Android-powered Nintendo Switch without removable controllers. The Pocket S has a few extra features that might surprise you, as it includes Hall Sensing Joysticks and Linear Hall Triggers. These are preferred amongst <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handheld</a> owners, as they are magnetic and reduce the likelihood of dealing with stick drift.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FLYBgxvcTJzSgqWFncizni" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-white-product-render.jpeg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket S product lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FLYBgxvcTJzSgqWFncizni.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ayaneo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s pretty obvious that Ayaneo is going for elegance with the Pocket S, a far cry from the "retro" theme that was offered with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocked-air-android-handheld-gaming">Pocket AIR</a>. Instead of relying on a plastic shell on the front and back, the Pocket S is made from a "CNC aluminum alloy mid-frame" along with 2.5D glass on the front panel.  </p><p>Ergonomics might be a concern for some, and Ayaneo has also thought of that. The company includes a "protective shell ... incorporating ergonomic grips." And when your gaming session is done, there&apos;s a Magnetic Detachable Flip Cover that keeps the screen looking nice. </p>

<p>Now for the big question — price. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-s-snapdragon-g3x-gen2-new-android-handheld#/">Indiegogo campaign</a> is already underway, with IGG Early Bird pricing starting at either $399 for the 1080P Edition or $439 for the 1440P Advance Edition. This is for the base configuration, which includes 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. And if you want the "best of the best," you&apos;re looking at either $559 or $589, respectively.</p><p>Once the Indiegogo campaign comes to a conclusion, the retail price jumps up quite a bit for both models. With the same base configuration, the Pocket S 1080P Edition will set you back $559, while the 1440P Advance Edition comes in at $589. At the time of this writing, Ayaneo has already blown past its Indiegogo goal, and you can still get your hands on those Early Bird models. </p>

<p>Lastly, we will have to wait just a little bit longer before the Pocket S makes its way to the masses. According to Ayaneo, the 1440P Advance Edition will begin shipping sometime in the "middle of May." Meanwhile, the 1080P Edition arrives at the "end of June." </p>

<ul><li>Google's upcoming "Cubes" feature was spotted early on the Play Store and its highlight card spills what users can expect on its full arrival.</li><li>The card suggests Cubes will be the "one place" for users to interact with shows, shopping apps, food, music, and more.</li><li>The background of the card showcases its potential UI alongside "continue watching" and "continue playing" so users can get back into their activities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seemed to accidentally show off its upcoming "Cubes" feature on the Play Store, giving us a good idea of what to expect.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/25/google-play-store-cubes/">9to5Google</a>, heading into the Apps tab of the Play Store held an interesting animated card with a "continue watching" banner. Its early appearance is furthered by a paw icon, which Google typically uses to represent features in testing, and it has shown up on at least one of our devices.</p><p>The card is described as "a shortcut to what matters," alluding to a place users could enter to "watch, shop, and more in one place."</p><p>Curiously, tapping the card sends users to a page dedicated to the coming Cubes feature. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/editorial?id=mc_apps_cube_launch_fcp_updated">it&apos;s completely blank</a>. It&apos;s speculated that the page could hold Google&apos;s official reveal and details about Cubes whenever the feature rolls out.</p><p>The card cycled through examples of where users could "watch" and "shop" in Cubes. The former highlighted streaming services like Hulu, Max, and Amazon Prime, while the latter showcased shopping sites and restaurants like McDonald&apos;s.</p><p>You can see the card at the top of the screenshots below:</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:259px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:231.66%;"><img id="88jYxyMAn82NvkNeTz7aij" name="google-play-store-cubes-early-appearance.jpg" alt="A snapshot of Google's "Cubes" card making an early appearance on the Play Store." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/88jYxyMAn82NvkNeTz7aij.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="259" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:259px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:231.66%;"><img id="VD4sJNotUMo8mrjqg4LFB3" name="google-play-store-cubes-early-appearance-shoppinng-teaser.jpg" alt="The "Cubes" card on the Play Store showing food and shopping examples." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VD4sJNotUMo8mrjqg4LFB3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="259" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Further examination of the card&apos;s background revealed what the Cubes UI will likely look like upon launch. Users may find a row of options along the top, such as "Watch, Listen, Read, Games, and Shop." Imaging suggests "Listen" will throw users into podcast recommendations and even some info pulled from Spotify&apos;s "New Music Friday."</p><p>"Continue watching" and "continue playing" sections were spotted in their respective tabs, which should help users get back into what they were doing previously.</p><p>Aside from the slip-up, it&apos;s unclear when Google plans to debut Cubes officially on the Play Store.</p><p>One thing this early preview of Cubes seems to suggest is that it may not remove users from the Play Store as originally theorized. Cubes was first spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-cubes-app-play-store-code">last November</a>, and it seemed like a new app provided by the Play Store rather than an experience within the app store. While it looks like users may be able to decide which apps cooperate with Cubes for content recommendations, Google might also include a selection of "pre-selected" ones just as an introduction.</p><p>That early preview also seemingly teased the possibility of a "Social" and a more specific "Food" tab. For now, it&apos;s not clear when Cubes will officially launch, but its appearance suggests it may not be long.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube TV is offering a new deal for new users who bundle it with the NFL Sunday Ticker.</li><li>Users can save $170 on the Sunday Ticket and see their monthly bill drop by $15 for the first three months.</li><li>The NFL Sunday Ticket rewarded subscribers with unlimited simultaneous streams while at home in 2023 and introduced a monthly payment option for "most states."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube TV is kickstarting a new deal (until May 16) for those interested in grabbing an NFL Sunday Ticket subscription before the 2024 season begins.</p><p>The streaming service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/YouTubeTV/status/1783556636671414605">announced</a> its "lowest price of the year" via the YouTube TV account on X. In celebration of the NFL Draft, the company states new users can bundle the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tv.youtube.com/learn/nflsundayticket/?utm_campaign=ytnflst_social_nflst_amplification_q1_2024&utm_source=social&utm_medium=twitter&utm_content=cta">NFL Sunday Ticket</a> <em>with </em>YouTube TV to save up to $215 until May 16.</p><p>Bundling the NFL Sunday Ticket will save new users $170. After purchasing, YouTube states users&apos; monthly payments will be reduced by $15. The monthly reduction will last for the first three months.</p><p>This means users will pay around $57 for three months before YouTube TV kicks it back up to its standard $72 per month.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our best offer of the year! Save $215 when you bundle @NFL Sunday Ticket and @YouTubeTV https://t.co/Aan8KBV5XX<a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1783556636671414605">April 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The YouTube team took to X to answer some user questions regarding how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1783581748841808344">last year&apos;s subscribers could get in</a> on the deal. The post states NFL Sunday Ticket holders from 2023, who also enabled auto-renew, must cancel the auto-renewed purchase. After, users must re-purchase the subscription to take part in the deal before the May 16 cut-off.</p><p>YouTube&apos;s deal card reiterates that the Sunday Ticket is what gives users access to over 160 out-of-market games "per season." The YouTube TV side is how football lovers can get locally televised games every Sunday. Moreover, viewers can watch every Sunday and Monday night game, the 2024 preseason, playoffs, and Super Bowl.</p><p>Before 2023&apos;s kickoff, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-unlimited-nfl-streaming">YouTube highlighted</a> the addition of unlimited simultaneous streams for NFL Sunday Ticket holders. The ability to do so pertained to those watching games from home. However, those on the go gained two additional streams to tack onto their Sunday content.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth remembering that, due to user feedback, YouTube TV subscribers can set up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-teases-nfl-sunday-ticket-features">monthly payment plan</a> for the NFL subscription. This allows folks to pay at their own cadence and hop out if the price becomes overbearing. Unfortunately, the company rolled out support for monthly payments in "most states," which left a few others out of the useful option.</p>

<hr>
<p>There&apos;s a chance Samsung could pack another key health monitoring feature into the Galaxy Watch 7 later this year.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2024&no=308917">PulseNews</a> (Korean), Samsung&apos;s vice president and head of digital healthcare, Hon Pak, met with board members to discuss the future of its wearable health capabilities (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-7-may-finally-bring-blood-sugar-monitoring/">SamMobile</a>). It was reported that Pak mentioned ambitions toward plugging diabetes and blood sugar monitoring into Samsung Health.</p><p>It was also discussed that arrhythmia and hypertension could be involved.</p><p>Rumors now state Samsung could look to apply such health monitoring capabilities for blood sugar, diabetes, and more into the Galaxy Watch 7. Additionally, the publication states the Korean OEM could tout the device as an "electronic device" instead of a "medical device." SamMobile notes this could be due to a multitude of regulatory factors.</p><p>Elsewhere, Pak wants to focus more on implementing Samsung&apos;s AI technology into its Health scope, although he did not state in what ways AI could improve a user&apos;s experience with Samsung Health or wearables moving forward.</p>

<p>Current rumors seemingly go against things we&apos;ve heard previously, which suggested blood sugar monitoring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-explores-non-invasive-glucose-monitor">wouldn&apos;t arrive for a few years</a>. Hon Pak spoke about the feature earlier this year in January, stating Samsung was interested in bringing "non-invasive" glucose monitoring to its Galaxy Watch lineup. Such a method would remove the necessity of users puncturing themselves.</p><p>Pak originally stated that there was hope that the feature would arrive in the next five years. While this (obviously) puts glucose monitoring far from the Galaxy Watch 7, the latest rumors suggest it&apos;s back on the table.</p><p>For now, take this rumor with a pinch of salt until Samsung says officially.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-bluetooth-certification">specifications for the upcoming</a> Galaxy Watch 7 leaked earlier this month. Appearing for its Bluetooth SIG certification, the watch may feature Bluetooth 5.3 support like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">its predecessor</a>. Consumers might have three models to choose from for the Galaxy Watch 7 alongside the possibility of an on-device storage boost to around 32GB.</p><p>Rumors purport Samsung could hold its Unpacked event even earlier this year on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">July 10 in Pairs, France</a>. We&apos;ll likely see the brand unravel the Watch 7 series there alongside other devices.</p>

<ul><li>New promotional images of the Pixel 8a leak ahead of Google I/O event.</li><li>It confirms the device’s Tensor G3 chipset, IP67 rating, and other notable AI features.</li><li>The Pixel 8a is also confirmed to come with a seven-year security update promise, just like the Pixel 8 series.</li><li>In addition to images, a promo video has also been leaked.</li></ul>

<p>The Pixel 8a launch is likely just around the corner as we approach Google I/O 2024, and a new leak spills the beans on what we can expect from the device.</p><p>The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-8a-renders-leak-features">Android Headlines</a>, which shares additional new renders of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> in all colors — the Obsidian, Porcelain, Mint, and Bay — along with the accompanying cases and some promotional images of the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range Android phone</a> from Google. </p>

<p>Some of the popular Pixel’s signature AI features can be seen on the upcoming Pixel 8a, including “Best Take,” which combines similar photos into one. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a>, which can extract sounds from videos, is also coming to the upcoming handset. Other features include Night Sight, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a>, and more.</p><p>Per the promotional images, the other notable things to expect from the Pixel 8a include the incorporation of Google Tensor G3 and fast charging support up to 30W.</p>

<p>Additionally, the phone will include an IP67 rating, the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, meaning it should be relatively safe from slips, spills, and dust. Like the Pixel 8 series, the Pixel 8a also appears to have seven years of security updates, per the promotional images, which is quite impressive for a mid-range phone.</p><p>To corroborate the images, reliable leaker @Onleaks has also provided a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/google-pixel-8a-promo-video-exclusive/">promotional video</a> of the Pixel 8a that showcases the aforementioned features as well as the phone&apos;s design.</p>
<p>Lastly, while we expect the device to be unveiled at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O 2024</a>, Android Headlines hints at the sale to take place on May 16, citing the date showcased on the home screen of the Pixel 8a on the shared marketing material.</p><p>The latest promotional material leak follows the live <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-live-images-show-mint-and-bay-colors">hands-on video</a> from early this week, showcasing the Pixel 8a in striking Blue and Mint hues.</p>

This has been my first experience with such a device — as I decided against the Humane AI Pin and have yet to grab the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review" target="_blank">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> — and I have a few thoughts on my first day with it.</p><p>That&apos;s not to say that I haven&apos;t dabbled with AI as I continue to tinker with a combination of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-one-year-later">ChatGPT</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>, and Perplexity. But the Rabbit R1 intrigued me for a few reasons, namely the much lower price compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/humanes-ai-pin-will-work-with-google-photos-and-contacts">AI Pin</a>, along with the idea of having a smart device without relying on apps.</p>
<h2 id="the-rabbit-r1-is-incredibly-sleek-2">The Rabbit R1 is incredibly sleek</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CZinrVGKGjbA9DrGS3SV9M" name="close-up-rabbit-r1-logo.jpg" alt="Close-up on the Rabbit R1 logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CZinrVGKGjbA9DrGS3SV9M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By now, you&apos;ve probably seen at least an unboxing or two, but I have to point out how sleek and elegant it really is. It&apos;s about as minimal as it gets. Seriously, all you&apos;ll find inside the cardboard box is the R1 being held in place by a transparent carrying case. Rabbit doesn&apos;t even include a charging cable, although that probably won&apos;t be much of an issue for many.</p><p>Okay, with the R1 out of the box, I have to admit that despite the plastic build, it&apos;s an extremely elegant design. Outside of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, the only other device to invoke a sense of appreciation was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a>, which Teenage Engineering also had a hand in designing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Emsedp6BXudknccS482YEN" name="rabbit-r1-nothing-phone-2-2.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 next to Nothing Phone 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Emsedp6BXudknccS482YEN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the outside of the clear case is a QR code that you&apos;ll need to scan to get the R1 set up. Unlike some other R1 owners I know, I didn&apos;t have any issues creating a Rabbit account and attaching it to my R1. After connecting it to my home Wi-Fi network, there was a day-one update, and it immediately started to download.</p><p>In the meantime, I perused the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hole.rabbit.tech/journal/details">rabbithole</a>," a web portal for connecting the likes of Spotify, Uber, DoorDash, and Midjourney to the R1. It&apos;s also home for your "journal," where your various interactions will appear. This is actually a pretty cool concept, although I do wish there was an accompanying app.</p>
<h2 id="putting-the-r1-to-the-test-2">Putting the R1 to the test</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PyFrrdb6Rjkajnucyd5BCR" name="rabbit-r1-miyoo-mini-plus-game-boy-advance-sp.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 next to Miyoo Mini Plus and Game Boy Advance SP" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PyFrrdb6Rjkajnucyd5BCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Enough of all of the mundane stuff. Now for the "fun" stuff. Although I watched the initial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22wlLy7hKP4">announcement keynote</a>, I haven&apos;t paid much attention to the R1 otherwise. I didn&apos;t even watch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDTXzrEMEQQ">Live Unboxing</a> from a special event in NYC, meaning I&apos;ve gone into this thing somewhat blind.</p><p>After the update was finished, the first thing I did was ask the R1 a few basic questions.</p>
<ul><li>Who won the Orioles game yesterday?</li><li>When is the next Capitals game?</li><li>What's the weather going to be tomorrow?</li></ul>
<p>A few moments later, the R1 responded, answering the first two questions correctly, complete with the score of the Orioles game and the time of the Capitals game. When asked about the weather, I was surprised to see the screen light up with an hourly forecast. I expected a three or five-day overview, but I was okay with the hourly breakdown as it was another excuse to make use of the scroll wheel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="M6zxwkWkqnruE2zyF5GpVC" name="weather-forecast-rabbit-r1.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 weather forecast" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M6zxwkWkqnruE2zyF5GpVC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Those are menial questions that I could&apos;ve asked Siri or Gemini about, so we can say that the R1 succeeds in the mundane. But this thing has a camera and its "Vision" mode can essentially act as a standalone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-google-lens-google-photos">Google Lens</a> device.</p><p>I double-clicked the side button, pointed it at the back my iPhone 15 Pro Max, and asked "What model iPhone is this?" I chuckled to myself as the R1 told me that it&apos;s "an iPhone 13 Pro based on the camera layout and design of the device shown in the image."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The R1 mistaking the iPhone 15 Pro Max for an iPhone 13 Pro is genuinely hilarious. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>From there, I wanted to see if I could actually use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.midjourney.com/explore">Midjourney</a> integration. Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to get the R1 to actually take advantage of this feature. Instead, I&apos;ve been met with messages such as "Apologies, there was an error generating an image. It may be due to maintenance or login issues." I&apos;ve seen that others have been able to use Midjourney on the R1, so I&apos;m not really sure what&apos;s going on here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="vx3szA693pWtxFHKPmofqP" name="rabbit-r1-vision.jpg" alt="Vision mode on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vx3szA693pWtxFHKPmofqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the bright side, I have been able to take advantage of another integration, using the Rabbit R1 as a Spotify controller. First, I just asked it to play some John Mayer, and within a few moments, it started playing "Gravity" from Mayer&apos;s "Continuum" album.</p><p>It shouldn&apos;t come as too much of a surprise, but the speakers aren&apos;t exactly going to fill the room. However, since the R1 includes Bluetooth, I decided to pair a set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> with it so I could walk around listening to music. It works pretty well, as long as you don&apos;t want to adjust the volume or skip tracks from the R1.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LDBWp434mSBxy9WEvhDzqd" name="rabbit-r1-settings.jpg" alt="Settings menu on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LDBWp434mSBxy9WEvhDzqd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s because you can only change the volume on the R1 itself from the Settings menu. I assumed that just using the scroll wheel would work, but I found that nothing happened. I couldn&apos;t even adjust the volume from my earbuds while the music was playing. Hopefully, this is just an oversight and something that Rabbit solves.</p><p>In terms of just pairing your earbuds to the R1, the process is pretty easy. Shake the R1 a couple of times in your hand to open the Settings panel, scroll down and open the Bluetooth menu, enable Bluetooth, and then select your earbuds from the list. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="n5ohzTSPgZ7LQfdqiKBrSD" name="rabbit-r1-midjourney-fail.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 Midjourney fail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n5ohzTSPgZ7LQfdqiKBrSD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Part of me keeps asking myself why I bothered to spend money on such a device when the smartphone in my pocket can already do everything this does and more. Part of it has to do with the idea of the Rabbit R1 being part of a new product category. While being on the "ground floor" has its benefits, it&apos;s clear that the R1 isn&apos;t quite as polished as it was initially shown to be.</p><p>For instance, I asked the R1 to set a timer for me to get my son&apos;s bottle off of the warmer. The R1 told me it couldn&apos;t do that. I then asked the R1 to remind me to take the trash out. It told me that it couldn&apos;t do that either. So, while it&apos;s cool that you can order DoorDash or use it as a cloud-based MP3 player, I kind of hoped that the "basics" would have been covered.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You can't even set a timer with the Rabbit R1, which is just mind-boggling.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s the battery life, and man oh man, is it abysmal. Supposedly, there&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/jessechenglyu/status/1783623002258649236" target="_blank">already an update planned</a> that will "make further improvements." But, even with a 95% charge out of the box, I had to recharge the R1 twice on the first day. Then, I went to bed, leaving the R1 on my desk in another room with about 75% battery, came back the next morning, and it was completely out of juice. Mind you, that&apos;s just with it being connected to Wi-Fi, as I&apos;ve yet to put a spare SIM card in it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZNohd6QNepvAqkFPZZb5YE" name="setting-a-timer-rabbit-r1.jpg" alt="Trying to set a timer on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZNohd6QNepvAqkFPZZb5YE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ll save my thoughts on product launches and updates for another day, but I&apos;m <em>really, really</em> hoping that Rabbit can stay on top of software updates to expand its usefulness. I have a vague idea of where the R1 will fit into my daily lifestyle, but it&apos;s just not there yet.</p><p>Speaking of which, the company already has a slew of features it plans to add, as I noticed in a tweet from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/HyanRaines/status/1782935825489023078/photo/1" target="_blank">Ryan Haines of Android Authority</a>. The list includes obvious features such as alarms, calendars, and contacts, but there&apos;s much more on the roadmap. I just have to keep my fingers crossed that Rabbit follows through and doesn&apos;t just abandon the R1 in favor of whatever it wants to build next.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Meta made waves this week when it announced Meta Horizon OS, a rebranding of the Meta Quest operating system. This new OS will work similarly to Android or Windows, allowing companies like Lenovo, ASUS ROG, and even Xbox to develop their own headsets without worrying about the operating system layer.</p><p>In a way, this means Meta&apos;s first-party headsets, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>, will become far more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">similar to a Google Pixel</a>. Meta has its own hardware and, like Google, will also maintain the operating system behind it while simultaneously supporting other companies using that same OS. It&apos;s a lot more complicated than ever, and that&apos;s making a few VR developers nervous.</p><p>Max Weisel, founder of development house Normal VR and creator of the eSports game Nock, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/maxweisel/status/1782450856706650479">compares the move to Android</a> phones that all have different hardware qualities and often never run the same operating system version. This makes it difficult to optimize for a specific piece of hardware and also means developers have to bug test the same things on more than one headset, adding time and stress to already difficult development cycles.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Being the "Android of VR" can sound very positive, but it also carries a lot of development baggage with the term.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But Road to VR&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/benz145/status/1782991511522557976">Ben Lang notes</a> that Meta Horizon OS isn&apos;t "truly open." That means people can&apos;t just make a VR headset in their basement, get Meta Horizon OS running on it, and mass produce it for sale. Meta has to approve headsets before they can run Meta Horizon OS, and the company is only allowing specific hardware configurations at this time.</p><p>That means every new headset that&apos;ll ship in the near future—whether that means the limited-edition Xbox VR headset, the Lenovo productivity-focused headset, or the Asus ROG ultimate VR gamer headset—will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 or XR2+ Gen 2 processor.</p><p>That substantially limits potential hardware problems since most headsets will run similar internals. The biggest differences will likely revolve around headset design and display resolution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="Z5NPewFG5e8mJjaD9SejuK" name="meta-horizon-os-official-concept-gaming.jpg" alt="An official concept image of a potential Meta Horizon OS VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z5NPewFG5e8mJjaD9SejuK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="780" height="439" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only exception is the ASUS ROG headset, which is rumored to potentially ship with a haptic feedback vest or some kind of other experience-enhancing accessories. On the bright side, though, accessories like the bHaptics vest are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/3454125161357542/">already officially supported</a> in the current Meta Horizon OS that runs on Meta Quest headsets.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Most headsets will remain fairly similar in specs, but the Asus ROG headset could ship with additonal peripherals that need support.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Still, we don&apos;t know how Meta will handle updates and other features on non-Meta-built headsets. The company is still relatively early in the planning stages and isn&apos;t ready to reveal all of its secrets and, unfortunately for us, this is one of the current mysteries.</p><p>Ironically, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/oculus-founder-palmer-luckey-horizon-os-quest-reaction/">Road to VR</a> points out, bringing a more open operating system to market was the original plan all along, even if Meta put the option on the back burner for nearly a decade.</p>

<p>Former Oculus CTO John Carmack also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/1782826465207165288">voiced his concern</a> over the move. "This initiative will be a drag on software development at Meta. Unquestionably." Carmack has been a critic of Meta&apos;s operating system development for years.</p><p>In December 2022 when he left his position at Meta, he said  "we have a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort. There is no way to sugar coat this, I think our organization is operating at half the effectiveness that would make me happy."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>We don't know how Meta will handle updates and other features on non-Meta-built headsets, and that could potentially spell trouble for developers.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This was almost entirely directed at the software side of things, which Carmack was most focused on and concerned about. In essence, he noted that the Quest OS was a mess and needed a total overhaul to fully take advantage of the hardware it powered.</p><p>It&apos;s not immediately clear if Meta has done this, but the company is launching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-ui-overhaul-tease">a UI overhaul</a> later this year, likely coinciding with the potential release of the first Meta Horizon OS-powered headsets.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/RenjiBijoy/status/1783248105300705757">Renji Bijoy</a>, founder of Immersed and creator of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/immersed-visor-with-visor-plus-announcement">upcoming Visor headset</a>, is more skeptical than negative about the move, saying that "3rd-party Horizon OS headsets may really struggle to sell a meaningful number of headsets compared to Meta&apos;s all-purpose headsets that are MUCH less expensive."</p><p>The idea is that Meta sells its headsets at cost, and examples like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-2-deal-amazon-big-spring-sale">recent price drop of the Quest 2</a> prove that Meta is willing to price its headsets incredibly low to sell volumes of them. In other words, that won&apos;t work well for 3rd parties unless they can focus on one particular niche very well.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>More platforms ultimately means more players, helping fund further development.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While several prominent folks have criticized this move, Resolution Games&apos; CEO, Tommy Palm, is much more positive about it. Resolution Games makes some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>, including Angry Birds VR, Demeo, and Racket Club, and it is even behind Game Room on the Apple Vision Pro, so it knows a thing or two about multiplatform VR development.</p><p>Palm tells me his company currently employs around 100 people, which is large for a dedicated VR developer. As such, it likely will have the resources to handle any additional quality assurance testing that might be required from additional VR headsets in the market.</p><p>"More platforms means more competition and more marketing, but it&apos;s going to end up bringing in more players" says Palm. More widescale development "has been tricky up to this point because the audience hasn&apos;t been big enough to support the type of games you see on console or [non-VR] PC."</p><p>This move could solve that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RVRWYFojhq5TAzEtmaMZv5" name="meta-quest-3-augments-official-lifestyle-02.jpg" alt="Official lifestyle imagery of the Augments feature coming to Meta Quest 3 headsets in Fall 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RVRWYFojhq5TAzEtmaMZv5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I asked if Resolution Games finds Steam VR development more difficult because of the number of headsets and different hardware configurations, he simply replied, "I wouldn&apos;t say so."</p><p>"There&apos;s a little bit of edge cases and outliers on hardware that isn&apos;t that common that we haven&apos;t tested on, and we&apos;ll see a comment and then we we have to dig it up somewhere and look at it. But it&apos;s rare."</p><p>In other words, while the company does run across situations where some hardware configurations cause issues, many are niche pieces of hardware, and most of them seem relatively easy to fix, based on the conversation. Because of the way Meta appears to be structuring its platform, it&apos;s unlikely these situations will repeat themselves during Meta Horizon OS development.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="5jqo8RXtFaYPjRMP8oKWha" name="Meta-Horizon-OS.jpg" alt=""Made with Meta Horizon OS" printed on a box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5jqo8RXtFaYPjRMP8oKWha.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="780" height="439" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Development is friendlier today than ever, according to veteran developers, but competition is also more fierce.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Palm went on to praise the tools available today compared to when he started professionally programming video games 25 years ago.</p><p>"The tools today, like Unity and Unreal, takes a lot of the super hard work away. I&apos;m saying that as somebody who worked 25 years with game development so I remember the pains of having to do all these different platforms. Most of the, you know, younger indies don&apos;t even think about that because that&apos;s a that&apos;s a thing of the past."</p><p>If Meta is able to successfully create a set of tools that developers can use to create bespoke applications for its ecosystem—not too dissimilar to iOS development—it may very well be able to get beyond the stigma that multiplatform development carries. But until then, it seems that many people may remain skeptical.</p>

<ul><li>Multiple sources have confirmed the next Galaxy Unpacked event date with SamMobile.</li><li>With July 10 on the cards, the event will likely occur in Paris.</li><li>It seems it's meant to coincide somewhat with the Paris Summer Olympics of 2024, of which Samsung is one of the main sponsors.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While there&apos;s a lot of anticipation for Samsung&apos;s next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, which have been rumored to launch earlier than the previous models, new information reveals the possible launch date of the next Galaxy Unpacked event.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-next-galaxy-unpacked-2024-event-date-exclusive/">SamMobile</a>, the Galaxy Unpacked event will be held on July 10, 2024. It will likely be held in Paris, the publication states, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter. It falls alongside the 2024 Summer Olympics, which begin later that month in the same country, and it is believed that Samsung will be the most significant sponsor for the games.</p>
<p>This new date for Galaxy Unpacked is a bit earlier than the 2023 summer event, which occurred in late July. Lately, it seems to be a trend to move up phone launches, which we&apos;ve seen not just with Samsung&apos;s foldables but also with the S series phones, and this year appears to follow the same. The event official invites will likely be sent out to the invitees sometime in late May, notes SamMobile.</p><p>Next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Z Flip 6</a>, we expect to see more details of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, the company&apos;s first compact fitness tracker, which had its first glimpse early this year during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> launch.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Z Flip 6 have already been spotted, thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-renders-leak">leaked renders</a>, which surfaced a while ago. They gave us a clear picture of what to expect, revealing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-renders-leak">familiar design</a> to their predecessors. Both foldables will likely ship with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy, just like their non-foldable flagship counterparts.</p><p>As SamMobile further notes, the event will likely introduce the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> series smartwatches and at least one pair of new wireless earbuds.

<p>A new dark mode feature is coming to Android 15 that allows users to force more apps into swapping out those white backgrounds for darker ones. But, while this will work nicely for some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, phones like the Google Pixel don&apos;t actually use <em>true black</em> backgrounds when in dark mode, and this new option doesn&apos;t appear to fix that.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-make-all-apps-dark-3437447/">Android Authority</a> details that the new feature will be available in the accessibility section of system settings, making it easier to find and use than the old developer mode switch.</p><p>The new force dark mode switch is also said to work on more apps since it doesn&apos;t follow the previous way of letting developers opt out of the mode. That means more apps that don&apos;t have an option for a dark mode should work with the new system switch.</p>

<p>The problem with the new feature is that it doesn&apos;t solve the <em>actual</em> accessibility problem with OLED displays on many Android smartphones. Phones that use gray backgrounds in place of true black ones, like the Google Pixel line, are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/dark-mode-is-a-lie">worse for your eyes</a> as shown by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/ssl-miller-etal-2023-LRT-pae-se%20visibility-tlm%20parameters.pdf">several studies</a> over the past year. This brings into question why Google would put this mode under accessibility settings rather than display settings since it doesn&apos;t seem to solve an accessibility issue.</p><p>Thankfully, not all phones follow Google&apos;s Pixel line in this regard. Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus, and Motorola phones with OLED displays generally have true black backgrounds when dark mode is enabled, making them better choices for dark mode lovers.</p><p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-even-dimmer-setting-spotted">new brightness control features</a> in Android 15 seem likely to cause further problems for folks who are sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> methods. Android Central has reached out to Google about both new features but representatives did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information on either feature.</p>
