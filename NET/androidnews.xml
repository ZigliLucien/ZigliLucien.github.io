<p>For the past year, the Garmin Forerunner 965 has been my go-to running watch; I&apos;ll wear a second watch for reviews, but no other option has supplanted it. This month, the Forerunner 165 came <em>very</em> close despite costing $350 less. </p><p>Technically, I&apos;m using the Forerunner 165 Music ($300 less), but I don&apos;t actually use the music storage. What matters is that this relatively cheap Garmin watch has the tools, UI, and accuracy I&apos;d expect from a more expensive model like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a>.</p><p>Even though the Forerunner 165 has plenty of noticeable compromises to hit that lower price point, I can live with 90% of them — and I love how much lighter the 165 is than the 965. </p><p>But there&apos;s <em>one</em> missing Garmin Forerunner 165 feature from the Forerunner 265 or 965 that&apos;s really hard to pass up, no matter what kind of runner you are. And it&apos;s frustrating because it&apos;s something Garmin <em>could </em>easily offer with the 165&apos;s current technology.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3829px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GmiSSQLrUp8BsY7VzKJhWc" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-in-hand.jpeg" alt="Glance views of race predictor and Recovery time on the Garmin Forerunner 165" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmiSSQLrUp8BsY7VzKJhWc.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3829" height="2154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Forerunner 165 may not be as cheap as the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-55-review">Forerunner 55</a> it replaced, but I think most runners won&apos;t mind the price creep in exchange for all the new perks it offers, like the more-readable AMOLED touch display, improved Elevate v4 heart rate sensor, and multi-GNSS tracking.</p><p>My recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">Forerunner 165 fitness test</a> proved that the watch delivers accurate results for steps, heart rate, GPS, and elevation gain compared to other cheap trackers, in ways the more pedestrian Forerunner 55 couldn&apos;t. </p><p>It gave me confidence that I don&apos;t necessarily <em>need</em> the more expensive Forerunners&apos; dual-band GPS, because the Forerunner 165&apos;s all-systems GNSS mode does quite well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gzEYL8n2Zzj2NCE2bAEUvE" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-polar-h10-coros-pace-3-and-fitbit-charge-6-on-table.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 165, COROS PACE 3, Fitbit Charge 6, and Polar H10 sitting together on a table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gzEYL8n2Zzj2NCE2bAEUvE.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In my test, it beat out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a>, my other favorite cheap running watch with dual-band tracking, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a>, our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">favorite fitness tracker</a>. While COROS&apos; watch lasts twice as long with its MIP display, runners who need more than the Forerunner 165&apos;s 11 days or 19 GPS hours probably won&apos;t buy a $250 watch. Instead, they&apos;ll prefer not having to strain their eyes to read notifications.</p><p>Like the PACE 3, though, the Forerunner 165 is satisfyingly light and skinny. At 39g/ 1.38oz, it&apos;s noticeably more comfortable than the 53g/1.87oz Forerunner 965. I get used to the 965 during runs, but I can&apos;t ignore its presence on my wrist like I can with the Forerunner 165 — especially during sleep tracking.</p><p>So long as the Forerunner 165 gives me my post-run Training Effect data and daily suggested workouts, I can stay on track with what I&apos;ve already been doing with my Forerunner 965. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VyMineqSQhEfMskFAxKiRD" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-training-readiness.jpeg" alt="Training Readiness on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VyMineqSQhEfMskFAxKiRD.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To make the $600 Forerunner 965 or $450 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a> more tempting, Garmin restricts a bunch of data from the Forerunner 165. Thankfully, I&apos;d call most of Garmin&apos;s metrics desirable but not "essential."</p><p>I can&apos;t deny that the Forerunner 965 helps me track my progress as a runner. I can see my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max graph</a> over the past four weeks, plus scores on how my fitness translates into Endurance and Hill strength over time. But I also think these appeal to me out of data-driven vanity, a way to validate that my training is working.</p><p>If you really need confirmation, the Forerunner 165 shows your current VO2 Max and a 4-week graph of your predicted race times; if the projections go lower, you know Garmin thinks you&apos;re getting faster. Otherwise, so long as you&apos;re keeping pace with what Garmin Coach or your daily suggested workouts tell you, you can typically count on improving over time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="f6nbjyuQEJJj4hkhPnZpfe" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-map.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 965 showing a topographic map of a nearby park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f6nbjyuQEJJj4hkhPnZpfe.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Every other useful Garmin metric — Training Status, Training Readiness, real-time stamina, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-performance-condition-needs-revamp">performance condition</a> — is mostly useful for beginner or intermediate runners who don&apos;t know enough to trust their own instincts. They quantify your body&apos;s aches, your wheezing lungs, or that spring in your step. </p><p>So long as I have Garmin&apos;s daily suggested workouts as a benchmark for whether to train harder or pull back that day, that&apos;s typically all I need to reinforce whether I&apos;m overreaching, peaking, or slacking off. Everything else comes from experience.</p><p>Out of all the nice-to-have features the Forerunner 965 offers, pre-downloaded topographical maps are the hardest to lose, as a nice backup if you go hiking in unfamiliar territory. But if I&apos;m honest with myself, I don&apos;t go hiking all that much and use Alltrails when I do so I can cope with the loss.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-is-blocking-the-forerunner-165-from-offering-its-most-useful-metric-2">Garmin is blocking the Forerunner 165 from offering its most useful metric</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zcoLThCRbUTjxDT9EmiqbH" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-acute-load-score.jpeg" alt="A 7-day acute load graphic on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zcoLThCRbUTjxDT9EmiqbH.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Beyond all Garmin&apos;s optional perks, there&apos;s one data tool the Forerunner 165 lacks that I can&apos;t do without as a runner: Training Load. And I&apos;m pretty darn sure it <em>could</em> deliver that data... if Garmin lets it.</p><p>Without getting overly technical, Training Load measures how hard your body worked out on a given day based on your heart rate and oxygen consumption. You want to hit a certain Training Load every week and then slowly increase your load number every week, either by running more or running faster.</p><p>Your Load is split into three heart rate zone categories: Low aerobic, high aerobic, and anaerobic. Higher heart rates give you more training load in shorter intervals, but high-load runs also take longer to recover from. A low aerobic run is easier and causes less "load" on your body but slowly helps you improve your fitness over time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="j8niAjAXrqY9BU5vaAJMsK" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-load-focus.jpeg" alt="Training load focus on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j8niAjAXrqY9BU5vaAJMsK.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It all sounds very data-driven, but it&apos;s basically all about balance. Garmin helps me remember if I&apos;ve done enough sprints, intervals, or slow jogs recently, without having to study my past workouts. And more generally, it tells me if I&apos;m keeping pace with past versions of myself or if I&apos;m over- or undertraining. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1179px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.79%;"><img id="nbN9hoo5JyViRbh4ozkqP6" name="Garmin-Connect-load-data.jpeg" alt="A screenshot of the Garmin Connect app showing the user's training load data over the past four weeks." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nbN9hoo5JyViRbh4ozkqP6.jpeg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="1179" height="2556" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Training Load isn&apos;t available on the Forerunner 165...or is it? Because buried in Garmin Connect app submenus, I found my Training Load data, up to the current date! And I&apos;ve only used the Forerunner 165 in the past week.</p><p>According to a Garmin rep, though, this Acute Load data is only available because I already have a Forerunner 965 associated with my account. "If you only had a 165 in your account, you would not see the load features at all," she explained. In other words, it&apos;s an arbitrary paywall rather than an actual 165 CPU limitation.</p><p>I also suspect that the Forerunner 165 could show my Training Load <em>Focus</em> for aerobic or anaerobic runs, if Garmin wanted. Why? Because just like the Forerunner 965, the Forerunner 165 takes "the user&apos;s training history" and "intensity" into account when suggesting a daily workout, according to my Garmin rep.</p><p>That includes "if there is a shortage in one area (e.g., base to build up base endurance, threshold to increase high aerobic training)," she continued.</p><p>So, with the Forerunner 165, you can look at the daily workout suggestions and guess what Garmin thinks about your current training load focus behind the scenes. You just won&apos;t have any way of checking the raw data for yourself.</p>
<hr>
<p>My full Garmin Forerunner 165 review will come out soon, but I already think it&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> available. If I didn&apos;t already have both it and the Forerunner 965 in hand, I think I would happily accept the compromises of the cheaper model to save more than half off the price.</p><p>I just wish Garmin hadn&apos;t decided to make Training Load a feature you have to pay an extra $200 to get — or $100 more with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-255-review">Forerunner 255</a> — because to me, it&apos;s pretty darn essential.</p>

It makes sense because technology advances. But last week, it hit me right in the face, and I was honestly surprised.</p>

<p>In a very niche situation and in a very weird way, my laziness showed me just how great the camera on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a> is.</p><p>I like aquariums; they keep me out of trouble. Mostly. Anyhoo, I was trying to sell some small pieces of coral online, and someone sent me a quick message about one particular piece. They asked me for a photo of it so they could see what they were thinking of buying.</p>
<p>Taking pictures of coral is really hard, even for a "professional" camera because of the lights used to make them grow. Corals need light of a certain wavelength and they can grow much like a plant, converting that light into energy. Our eyes don&apos;t see much of the light corals need, but it sure can mess with a camera.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2870px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="pKkPS3pnTvDH2sGAMxgbNL" name="coral-bad.jpg" alt="Photo of coral ruined by weird lighting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pKkPS3pnTvDH2sGAMxgbNL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2870" height="1614" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A photo of coral taken with my Galaxy Z Flip 5. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That science fiction-looking photo came from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, and it&apos;s not useful because it looks nothing like what your eyes would see. Much (most) of the time, if you point your phone at an aquarium while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.iquaticsonline.co.uk/what-is-actinic-lighting/">actinic lights</a> are on, you get something similar. We can&apos;t see it, but a camera sensor gets overwhelmed by the huge amount of UV light pouring into the lens.</p><p>You offset it with UV lens filters, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KS3FYH5">this kit made for smartphones</a>. The science behind it is that the filters cut out light measuring 15k and 20k Kelvin (think super blue light that washes out everything else) while leaving the rest of the light data alone. The result is a photo that looks very much like what our eyes see without interference from all the UV.</p>
<p>Being too lazy to go and look for my little phone filter kit, I just pointed the Pixel 7 Pro at the aquarium and snapped a photo. To my surprise, I got this using Google&apos;s auto-settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2354px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bUdhz3ikRvsdCirrdwW5if" name="coral-good.jpg" alt="Pixel 7 coral photo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bUdhz3ikRvsdCirrdwW5if.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2354" height="1324" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A photo of coral taken with the Pixel 7 Pro. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s still a strange photo, but it looks very much like what my eyes see. And it wouldn&apos;t have been possible just a few years back. Even cooler, it can also do the same thing with video.</p><p>I can take bunches of photos of my fish tank with the Pixel 7 Pro, but not all of them are useful. I can also get a useful photo from other phones once in a while, too. I&apos;ve played with it enough to confidently say that if you&apos;re taking a picture without any "white" light, Google has figured out some way to make it work through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-computational-photography">computational photography</a>.</p>
<p>While improved lenses play a part, the real magic lies in using software to "make" a picture. Smartphones leverage powerful processors and sophisticated software to enhance image quality beyond what the sensor can capture alone. Techniques like HDR (High Dynamic Range) combine multiple exposures for balanced lighting, while noise reduction algorithms eliminate graininess in low-light photos.</p><p>The result, in my case, isn&apos;t a great photo — it&apos;s grainy, there&apos;s a lot of noise, and you&apos;ll see strange artifacts where I need to clean the glass. But it&apos;s a good representation of what you see, takes the glow away from the background, and it&apos;s pretty consistent. </p>
<p>I have no idea what software magic is being used to turn light our eyes can&apos;t see into an accurate representation of what is real because, in this case, "real" changes so much. Adding some white lighting makes it easier to take a picture but slightly changes the colors you see because nothing is glowing like a black-light poster.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2208px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="PRNWgKP8HrQ4dN4ruLShjL" name="coral-white.jpg" alt="White light photo from Pixel 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PRNWgKP8HrQ4dN4ruLShjL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2208" height="1241" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A white light photo of coral taken with the Pixel 7 Pro. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I do know is that my year-old phone takes photos of a difficult subject as well or better than my expensive "real" camera that doesn&apos;t use voodoo logic and AI in place of a good, fast lens. I wish I had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8</a> here to test because I know it did a lot better than expected while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review">taking photos at a public aquarium</a>.</p><p>Phone cameras have moved past the "good enough" metric and are now a real professional tool. It&apos;s something I would have never thought could happen just a few years ago, but I&apos;m ready to put my bigger, heavier camera on the shelf.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>As VR continues to grow in popularity, we&apos;re getting more games that try to replicate popular traditional games with the immersion and multiplayer experience that only VR can offer. Contractors Showdown is my latest VR gaming obsession as it channels two of the best battle royale titles on the market: Call of Duty Warzone, and PUBG.</p><p>Visually, the game evokes the look of PUBG in all the right ways. The map is absolutely massive, yet it doesn&apos;t feel like the developers had to cut down on model detail or make the map sparse just to fit on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>. Even with this massive map, it supports 60 players at a time — that&apos;s three times the number supported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/population-one-winter-2023-update">Population: One</a>, the system&apos;s most popular battle royale game.</p><p>If you told me this scale of battle royale game would be on a standalone VR headset just a year or two ago, I&apos;m not sure I would have believed you.</p><p>Even the basic gameplay loop feels straight out of a PUBG match. You&apos;ll begin each round on a military dropship flying high over the island. As the bay doors open, you can choose to jump out at any time and pull your parachute to glide to your preferred starting point.</p><p>Weapons and support items are littered in clusters around the map, most commonly found in buildings or crates. Weapons all look and feel incredibly realistic, including unique reloading mechanics that feel good but are not overly complicated. It&apos;s a happy medium between the purposefully simple reloading mechanics in Population: One and some of the truly realistic — and often annoying — reloading mechanics in some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Quest games</a>.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>If you told me this scale of battle royale game would be on a standalone VR headset just a year or two ago, I'm not sure I would have believed you.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The livestream above will give you a great idea of what to expect from the game, but I recommend starting at timestamp <strong>12:20</strong> to see how a round plays out from the beginning.</p><p>As the streamer makes his way to the edge of the plane and eventually jumps out, you&apos;ll get a feel and appreciation for just how <strong>massive</strong> this island is.</p><p>In many ways, this game brings the more realistic multiplayer shooter experience I had hoped to enjoy with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ghosts-of-tabor-meta-quest-store-release">Ghosts of Tabor</a>. While that game is a masterclass in VR design, it requires more time and patience than I&apos;m willing to give.</p>

<p>Contractors Showdown fits right in between that game and Population: One, offering the opportunity to play with 60 players but not feel like you&apos;ve got no chance if you don&apos;t have dozens of hours to pour into the game every week.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The mechanics fit somewhere between realistic and accessible, while the perks and rewards system encourages players to keep coming back.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>There are a few clunky parts right now, but I imagine those will continue to get ironed out as the game nears completion. On-body inventory is a bit confusing at first, but it only took me a few rounds to figure it out.</p><p>Likewise, the game&apos;s semi-complicated wearable computer system is a bit daunting at first but provides unique and interesting ways to offer perks and powers like air raids or drones during matches. Plus, the perk and upgrade system adds rewards for players who continue to come back, encouraging regular play sessions.</p><p>If you want to try it for yourself, the free open beta is running through March 17 (so there&apos;s not much time left at the time of writing). Sign up for it at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.contractorsvr.com/contractorsshowdown">Contractors Showdown website</a>.</p><p>We still don&apos;t know the final release date but I imagine it&apos;ll be landing in the next month or two based on my playtime with the game over the past few weeks. I&apos;m so happy to see more quality games like this land on the Meta Quest and can&apos;t wait to see what the final game plays like!</p>

<ul><li>Android 15 aims to save storage space by archiving unused apps while preserving user data.</li><li>App archiving is a new feature expected to debut in Android 15's stable release, enabling users to free up device space without deleting apps entirely.</li><li>Archiving an app removes everything except the icon and code, simplifying restoration via Google Play.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The next version of Android is set to save storage space by moving unused apps aside while keeping your data safe, and now we&apos;re getting a sneak peek at how Android 15 might handle app archiving.</p><p>Last month, Android sleuth Mishaal Rahman gave us a heads-up about a new feature in the works: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-makes-auto-archiving-apps-available-to-everyone">app archiving</a>. This handy addition, likely coming to the stable release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, lets you reclaim space on your device without fully deleting apps.</p><p>Instead, when you archive an app, the operating system will strip away everything except for the app&apos;s icon and code. This allows you to easily restore the app via Google Play by simply tapping the icon, ensuring a seamless transition if you decide to install it again.</p><p>Rahman, writing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-app-archiving-demo-3425621/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, has now given us a detailed look at how the process will function. It appears that you&apos;ll be able to choose whether to archive apps manually as needed or have your phone automatically handle it. The whole system operates based on what Google refers to as archived APKs.</p><p>Rahman tried out app archiving with the Uber app on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. Before archiving Uber, Mishaal notes, the app occupied 387MB of storage on his phone. Once archived, that space shrank to around 18MB—a significant reduction.</p>

<p>Yet, upon restoring the app, it&apos;s revealed that none of the app&apos;s data has been wiped out, and you don&apos;t need to log in again.</p><p>If you&apos;ve got a speedy internet connection, reinstalling an archived app should breeze through in just a few seconds. And once it&apos;s back, everything should be exactly as you left it when you archived it.</p><p>Currently, the feature is said to be a Google Play feature, but upon launch, it&apos;s anticipated to operate at the OS level. This implies that we can look forward to its debut as a feature of Android 15.</p>

<ul><li>A new wave of rumors suggests Samsung could deliver a third Galaxy Watch 7 later this year during Unpacked.</li><li>The second rumor doubles down on past speculation, which stated the Galaxy Watch 7 could utilize the 3nm process-based Exynos W940.</li><li>The Galaxy Watch 7 series was previously rumored to have an "Ultra" model in the works, which could arrive in addition to or in replacement of its Pro model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new rumor claims Samsung could release a third variant for its Galaxy Watch 7 later in 2024.</p><p>According to X leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/kro_roe/status/1768266399821262981">Kro_Roe</a>, the Korean OEM is allegedly planning on launching a Galaxy Watch 7 Classic, Watch 7 Pro, and an unnamed third addition (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/15/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-chip-three-variants-rumors/">9to5Google</a>). The tipster states the extra variant will be a "new one" in the machine-translated post, though nothing further was purported.</p><p>Another rumor states Samsung could provide a meaningful power boost to the Watch 7 series with a chipset upgrade.</p><p>Rumors stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/TheGalox_/status/1768414829004378195">TheGalox</a> on X, which states the Watch 7 could utilize Samsung&apos;s new Exynos W940 chip. They add the chip may offer a 50% boost in power efficiency alongside a potential 30% increase in speed.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exynos W940, the processor powering the Galaxy Watch7 series, will apparently be 50% more efficient and 30% faster than the previous model pic.twitter.com/XUFAe0c8ZA<a href="https://twitter.com/TheGalox_/status/1768414829004378195">March 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>As far as the rumored third variant goes, it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-micro-led-rumor">rumored back in October</a> that Samsung could be developing a Watch 7 "Ultra." An Ultra model was speculated to arrive in addition to or in replacement of a Watch 7 Pro.</p><p>It was also stated that such a device could feature a MicroLED display. That display would provide a richer color experience, including better contrast, brightness, and energy efficiency compared to other LED products.</p><p>Meanwhile, this rumored Exynos W940 chip from Samsung was rumored last October, as well, suggesting it would be built on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-rumored-to-receive-3nm-exynos-chip">a 3nm process</a> instead of a 5nm. In addition to where the W940 could improve, it was previously stated the new chip could reduce its area by 35%. Consumers could be in for a slightly slimmer Galaxy Watch 7 if the rumors are true.</p><p>We&apos;re likely only a few months out from an official Watch 7 series reveal as Samsung&apos;s summer Unpacked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">could take place</a> on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out a server-side update for Messages that revamps its camera's viewfinder UI.</li><li>The new UI simplifies things, offering options for zoom strength and convenient access for users to swap between snapping photos or shooting a video.</li><li>Messages' new UI loses out on additional camera settings and its old grid overlay as a result.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out a new custom camera UI for Messages today (Mar. 15) that offers a streamlined, convenient approach for users.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/14/google-messages-new-camera/">9to5Google</a>, Messages&apos; new camera UI will reportedly replace your Android phone&apos;s default viewfinder. The new UI is also built off "Compose" and lets users pinch to zoom in or tap the three default zoom strengths above the shutter button.</p><p>Google is finally letting users switch between snapping photos and recording videos. Messages&apos; new UI features those options at the bottom, which should give users peace of mind, as they won&apos;t need to <em>launch </em>Messages&apos; camera in one mode or the other.</p>

<p>While the app&apos;s new viewfinder offers a bit of convenience, Google has seemingly removed an array of camera tools. The app&apos;s cog wheel, which expanded on your camera settings, is no longer present in this UI redesign. For some devices, tapping on this cogwheel lets you tinker with your camera flash, set a timer, or even alter your camera&apos;s aspect ratio.</p><p>For other devices, tapping the icon would open the system&apos;s default settings for its camera. Additionally, the redesigned viewfinder drops the grid overlay.</p><p>The publication speculates that this revamped UI could allow Google to pop in more features down the road. For now, Google Messages&apos; new camera UI is rolling out today (Mar. 15) as a server-side update. We haven&apos;t seen it appear just yet, meaning it&apos;s still making its rounds.</p><p>Google&apos;s latest camera rework in its messaging app comes two days after the company rolled out new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-messages-gets-new-emoji-reaction-effects">emoji reaction effects</a>. The effects are available for SMS and RCS chats and allow users to experience new animations when reacting to texts. The "dynamic twist" users will find only support a selection of 10 emojis. It&apos;s unclear if Google will add more to that list.</p>

<ul><li>Code inside Google's Drive app on Android shows that it's working on bringing a new "category" system to users.</li><li>Users will be able to customize and display their important categories on Drive's "home" tab for easy discovery.</li><li>The code also showed users that they could select which categories a stored Drive file or document should contain in its three-dot menu.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It appears that Google is working on bringing a new category system to Drive that should make it easier for users to find what they&apos;re looking for.</p><p>The feature was discovered by AssembleDeBug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/Google-Drive-File-Categories.html">TheSpAndroid</a>), and the post states that "Categories" will appear on the Drive app&apos;s home tab (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-drive-organization-files-storage/">Android Police</a>). Users may soon find their categories as rounded icons in a row at the top of the app&apos;s welcoming page. Moreover, a three-dot menu is said to let users "Manage Categories" for customization purposes.</p><p>In the app&apos;s code, tapping this option will let users decide which categories should appear quickly at the top. </p><p>Another finding shows that users can decide which "category" their documents and files should fall under. The app&apos;s code shows that tapping the three-dot menu on a document will soon include a second "Manage categories" option. From there, users should be able to select all categories that apply to their files.</p><p>There were twelve categories spotted in the Drive app&apos;s Android code:</p>
<ul><li>Auto</li><li>Banking</li><li>Expenses</li><li>Home</li><li>IDS</li><li>Insurance</li><li>Medical</li><li>Pets</li><li>School</li><li>Taxes</li><li>Travel</li><li>Work</li></ul>

<p>While the discovery was made in the Android app&apos;s code, AssembleDeBug states the feature will arrive on the web and iOS devices.
