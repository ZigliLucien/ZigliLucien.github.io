<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A new Google Calendar update adds a full-screen task view, making it easier to manage and prioritize tasks.</li><li>The new Tasks icon in Calendar’s top bar lets you access your task list directly and mark tasks as done.</li><li>This update is rolling out to Google Workspace users, subscribers, and personal Google account holders, but only on Android for now.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/8-best-google-calendar-tips-hacks-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Calendar</a> update introduces a full-screen view for managing tasks, making it easier to prioritize and check off your to-dos.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/11/release-notes-11-22-2024.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Calendar app on Android now includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-calendar-tasks-full-screen-view">web version's task management features</a>, offering a full-screen view of all your tasks. This update helps you easily prioritize and track tasks, no matter when they’re due.</p><p>This means a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tasks">Google Tasks</a> icon now sits in the top bar of the Calendar app, between your profile icon and the Today button. Tapping it takes you to the standalone app’s home screen, where you can view undated tasks and lists, and mark them as done.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:470px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:207.66%;"><img id="bZz7emPUzhtjXB3iqbSa3V" name="Google-Calendar-full-Google-Tasks-integration" alt="full Google Tasks integration with Calendar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bZz7emPUzhtjXB3iqbSa3V.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="470" height="976" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Prior to this update, you could manage your to-dos in Tasks through Calendar, but the app had a big flaw on mobile: it didn’t let you see all your upcoming tasks in one view. Plus, it only showed tasks with due dates, leaving the rest hidden.</p><p>Now that Google Calendar has task and list views, the standalone Tasks app isn’t as needed. But it’s still handy for those who like the Tasks widget, giving quick access to lists and easy task creation right from the home screen.</p><p>While this deeper integration might add fuel to speculation that Google plans to shut down Tasks in the future, there’s no hint that it's going to be the case soon.</p><p>That said, Google isn’t exactly shy about ditching apps and products it’s lost interest in, so we can’t completely rule out that possibility.</p><p>After all, Tasks has been around for a while but still feels pretty basic. You can’t create smart lists, use tags, or add collaborators. Its only real perk is its seamless integration with Calendar, but that’s where it ends.</p><p>Google Calendar’s task integration is being made available to Google Workspace customers, Google Workspace Individual subscribers, and personal Google account owners. Right now, it’s only available on Android, with no immediate plans for an iOS release.</p>

<p>Samsung needs a win with the upcoming Galaxy S25 series. The company is facing major issues and delays with its One UI 7 update, based on Android 15. It's also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">apologizing for failing to innovate</a>. While we don't know exactly what the Samsung Galaxy S25 will look like, we do know a whole lot based on leaks and rumors ahead of the phone's expected mid-January launch.</p><p>With a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a bigger display, slight design tweaks, and a software overhaul, the Galaxy S25 could indeed be a massive victory. The question is, will the upgrades be tempting enough to make people still rocking a Samsung Galaxy S23 want to upgrade? That's what we'll help you start to figure out in this early comparison.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s23-design-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Galaxy S23: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3699px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="DzgsjUdUBJbMPWDkgoyaKP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S23-review-rear-outdoors.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S23 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DzgsjUdUBJbMPWDkgoyaKP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3699" height="2081" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you've been keeping a close eye on new Samsung phones recently, you probably have a good idea of where the Samsung Galaxy S25's design is headed. With the Galaxy Z Fold 6, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>, the company moved to a flat and more rectangular design language. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">Based on the latest renders</a>, we expect the Galaxy S25 to follow a similar pattern. It'll likely be a boxy phone with matte aluminum rails and a new lens covering around the rear camera system, closely resembling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>The exact dimensions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> are up in the air, but rumors suggest the phone could have a chassis measuring 146.94 x 70.46 x 7.25mm. That would be slightly smaller than the current Galaxy S24 and the older Galaxy S23. The phone's weight could be around the 168-gram mark. As far as durability is concerned, an IP68 water and dust-resistance rating and Gorilla Glass coverings are near locks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-side-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="Another alleged angled rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest change to the Galaxy S25 could be the display size. The older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-i-just-cant">Samsung Galaxy S23</a> features a 6.1-inch AMOLED display, but the Galaxy S25 could receive a bump to a 6.3-inch panel. That would follow industry trends, which are consistently shifting to favor larger displays. For example, Apple made the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max</a> larger this year.</p><p>Although the Galaxy S23 will have a smaller screen, it'll likely keep up with the newer model in terms of display specs. We expect both phones to have a 120Hz AMOLED panel with variable refresh rates and high brightness capabilities.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dKDSMyFkuHBoPJcHRZAFY8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S23-review-display-outdoors-1.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S23 outdoors next to a pillar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dKDSMyFkuHBoPJcHRZAFY8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of colors, the latest leaks reveal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-color-options-tipped">the Galaxy S25 should come in at least four colors</a>: Moon Night Blue, Silver Shadow, Sparkling Blue, and Sparkling Green. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S23 came in many more colors: Cobalt Violet, Amber Yellow, Onyx Black, Marble Grey (Samsung exclusive Jade Green, Sapphire Blue, Sandstone Orange). In all likelihood, Samsung still has a few online exclusives up its sleeve for the Galaxy S25 series.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s23-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Galaxy S23: Hardware and specs</h2>
<p>Those looking for a major camera upgrade on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series may end up once again disappointed. Top rumors indicate that the Galaxy S25 will have the same camera hardware as the Galaxy S24, which, unfortunately, would also be the same as the Galaxy S23. However, there are also leaks that predict Samsung could make a major camera hardware switch to Sony sensors, but this is something that leakers can't agree on yet.</p><p>If the Galaxy S25 indeed sticks with the same camera hardware, both phones in this comparison would feature a 50MP main shooter, a 12MP ultrawide lens, and a 10MP telephoto lens supporting 3x optical zoom. There could be some quality improvements, even with the same hardware, based on improved image-signal processing and computational photography features.</p>

<p>The exact memory and storage configurations are unknown, as are the connectivity options. However, we're looking for the Galaxy S25 to get 5G support, Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 5.3, which would make it competitive with recent flagship releases.</p>

<p>The key things to watch on the Samsung Galaxy S25 are the phone's performance and software. It's tabbed to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip, which you can think of as a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 successor. It's called 'Elite' because it now uses the same custom Oryon cores that power Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite laptop chips. In other words, the Snapdragon 8 Elite will be the most performant chip ever in a Galaxy phone.</p><p>However, we don't know what effect that will have on thermals, performance, or battery life. Some rumors suggest the Galaxy S25 will get a 5,000mAh battery to help make the phone longer-lasting. Additionally, reports indicate that the Snapdragon 8 Elite is an expensive chip, and its inclusion could drive the price upward.</p><p>On the flip side, the Galaxy S23 still sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy processor. It's going to be two years old when the Galaxy S25 debuts, but it's still plenty capable. It'll eventually get the jump to One UI 7 and currently supports a wide variety of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features. Plus, there are still a few years of software upgrades left.</p><p>One UI 7 is expected to launch on the Galaxy S25, but it's a bit of a wild card. There have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-pushed-back-again">extensive delays to One UI 7's development and release</a>, partly because it's an ambitious update. If Samsung pulls it off, it'll be a key reason why the Galaxy S25 sets itself apart. However, if its struggles continue, the phone could be a buggy mess at launch.</p>

<p>As we look toward the Samsung Galaxy S25's expected mid-January launch, it's time to start thinking about whether Galaxy S23 owners should upgrade. Buying the Galaxy S25 two years after purchasing the Galaxy S23 could be a tough sell. That's especially true if the design is lackluster and the cameras are unchanged. But the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a bigger screen, and new software features might be tempting.</p>

<p>As the person who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">reviewed the Galaxy Watch 6</a>, I was tapped to write this guide on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Galaxy Watch FE vs. Watch 6</a>, which lays out in excruciating detail all of the downgrades Samsung gave the Watch FE to make it cheap: It has the same last-gen Exynos W920 as the 2021 Galaxy Watch 4, only 1.5GB of RAM, a smaller and thicker-bordered display, an older Bluetooth standard, no skin temperature sensor, and a smaller 247mAh capacity.</p><p>The jump from 1.2- to 1.3-inch display — or 1.5 if you buy the 44mm Watch 6 for $159 — 1,000 to 2,000 nits of brightness, 53mAh extra battery capacity, 1.18GHz to 1.4GHz clock speed, and 0.5GB more RAM may not sound like much on paper, but they really add up in terms of better visibility, longer stretches between charges, and shorter lag waiting for apps to open.</p><p>If the lowest price possible is your concern, then rest assured that the Galaxy Watch FE is a <em>good</em> watch; it tops our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">best cheap Android watches</a> for a reason. But what made it a good compromise was that other Galaxy Watches cost $100 more; thanks to Black Friday, that's no longer true! And its older CPU ensures it may not keep up with new Wear OS updates as ably as the Watch 6.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 6 doesn't need that "cheap" label to be relevant; it's still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> available today, specifically our pick for the "best last-generation smartwatch" today. Although the Galaxy Watch 7 is <em>also</em> discounted for Black Friday — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQKDML"><strong>currently $97 off</strong></a> — the Watch 6 will save you an extra $63 and won't feel as much like a downgrade as the Watch FE.</p>

The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/versions/5-1" target="_blank">released</a> the first developer preview of Wear OS 5.1 last week, and it's now available for testing in an Android Studio virtual device. Although it's still early, Google already revealed two key Wear OS 5.1 features: watch speaker audio playback and a credential manager.</p><p>The build number for the initial Wear OS 5.1 preview release is <strong>AP4A.241205.004.F1</strong>, and there are a few known issues. Google recommends developers start testing their Wear OS apps with the latest version to adjust to behavior changes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. Notably, some Android 15 behavior changes won't be arriving on Wear OS 5.1, like Private Spaces and predictive back animations. The known bugs are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The emulator doesn't always allow the user to add an account during the setup flow following a device reset.</li><li>When tapping on a notification, the app that sent the notification doesn't open until the user scrolls the screen.</li><li>Wear Health Services sometimes fails to start an exercise.</li></ul>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Confirmed: Wear OS 5.1 is the next version of Wear OS, and it's based on Android 15 just as I previously reported. https://t.co/t0pgSRpCW6 pic.twitter.com/lXLkbyxti6<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1861064684826251701">November 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The update currently includes two "notable features," as described by Google. The first is watch speaker playback, which will allow users to listen to audio sources through a smartwatch's inbuilt speaker. This could be a convenient way to listen to music or podcasts, albeit at low volume and subpar quality. To use your watch speaker as an audio output option, both the device's hardware and the specified app must support it in Wear OS 5.1.</p>

<p>The other notable feature is support for the Credential Manager API. This is already available on Android, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/upgrading-to-a-new-phone-android-can-now-keep-your-apps-signed-in-after-restoring-from-a-backup">enables features like auto-sign-in after restoring from a backup</a>. On Wear OS 5.1, the new credential manager will handle passwords, passkeys, and Sign in with Google. It'll also allow this information to be synced across Wear OS 5.1 and Android 15 devices.</p><p>Depending on the release date of Wear OS 5.1, this update could signal the platform catching up with Android. Typically, Wear OS updates have been based on preceding Android versions. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. The naming of Wear OS 5.1 could indicate that Google is trying to sync up Wear OS and Android. Or, it could simply mean that this year's Wear OS update is a minor one and not worthy of a full numbered version. After all, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Developer Preview 1</a> is here, so it's not that surprising that we're seeing a new version of Wear OS made available for testing as well.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's next higher mid-range phone to sport same design as the predecessor.</li><li>The Galaxy A56 will again sport three rear cameras, flat display, Key Island, and probably a new pink shade.</li><li>The Galaxy device is also tipped to sport 45W fast charging and with a Exynos 1580 chip underneath.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung might be more than a couple of months away from launching the Galaxy A56 for the masses. However, that doesn’t stop leaks of renders showcasing the device in full.</p><p>OnLeaks and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-a56">Android Headlines</a> have shared the first high-quality renders of the Galaxy A56, the company’s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range smartphones</a> for 2025. It should be launched sometime in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good Morning #FutureSquad!

<p>The shared CAD-based renders again reveal a familiar design as its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-galaxy-a55-and-a35">Galaxy A55</a>, featuring flat edges and rounded corners. It will have a flat punch-hole display and three rear cameras stacked vertically on the back. A slight difference; however, is that the A55’s rear cameras were placed individually, whereas the placement on the Galaxy A56 appears to be stacked in a single camera module.</p><p>The publication also implies Samsung should be borrowing the “Key Island” design elements introduced in Galaxy A55 alongside the budget Galaxy A15 and Galaxy 25 phones from last year, where the power button and volume rockers are a bit raised on the right pane of the device to spot them easily.</p>

<p>While the expected specifications are still unclear, Android Headlines highlights that the device might feature 45W fast charging similar to the flagship Galaxy phones despite the Galaxy A56 being a mid-range phone. According to a recent Chinese certification, the device is also expected to be powered by the Exynos 1580 SoC, which was announced in October.</p><p>If the launch of the predecessor models is any indication, the Galaxy A56 should be released in March 2025 in markets starting with Europe and likely priced under €500.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Samsung’s other Galaxy A series device, dubbed Galaxy A26, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a26-renders-surface-online-revealing-its-design">spotted in the renders</a>—also shared by OnLeaks last week—giving us a good look at the design and some of the expected specifications of the sub-$300 Galaxy phone.</p>

<p><em><strong>Jeremy asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I just noticed that Google seems to have duplicate copies of my whole photo library, which, I'm guessing, is a waste of space.  There's a whole directory in My Drive that seems to be a duplicate of old family photos I scanned years ago, sorted by year and, I guess, not really needed.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>What's going on here? Does this count against my Google storage limit? Most importantly, can I delete all this?</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Jeremy! You've stumbled across a secret Google feature that gives you a look at what sets Google apart when it comes to online services: the unintended, multilayered problem.</p><p>On a serious note, this happens (or <em>happened</em>, as we'll see later) to some folks who used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-google-photos">Google Photos</a> in its early days but didn't affect others. The short answer to your questions: you're seeing duplicates because Google Photos stores its files in a hidden folder in your shared Google storage. Yes, it counts against your storage the same way any files you purposefully uploaded to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a>, and you can delete the folder(s) from Google Drive after you verify you have copies in the Google Photos app. For a discussion of the mess, read on!</p>
<p>Not everyone sees these old duplicate files. At some point, Google changed how Photos stores its data, but it still is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos-uploads-will-soon-count-towards-your-google-drive-storage">part of your overall storage space provided by Google</a>. Before this, you could see your Google Photos storage in Drive if you knew where and how to look for it, but it was intended to be hidden.</p><p>During the transition, some people had folders duplicated while the way they were stored changed. I've heard this has to do with specific metadata, how the files were added to Photos, or what device was used to upload them. These theories could be correct, or they could be 100% wrong; regardless, it happened, and when it happened, the folders became visible like any other folder in Drive.</p>

<p>These folders are no longer associated with Google Photos and that means they are duplicated elsewhere in a way you can't (easily) find them. It also means they are taking up space.</p><p>You have a limited amount of space associated with your Google account. You <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">can pay to have more if you need it</a>, or you can manage your stored and saved files so you don't reach the limit.</p><p>These duplicate folders can be safely deleted once you've double-checked to make sure the photos are also stored in the Google Photos app. <strong>Do not delete them until you have checked. </strong>Never trust anything without verifying it for yourself.</p>
<p>One thing you might want to look at before you delete anything is the quality of the photo being stored, <em>especially</em> if you used to have an original<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2024-early-discounts-and-how-to-prepare"> Pixel</a> or a Pixel 2.</p><p>It used to be that if you had a Pixel phone, your photos were stored at full quality without any cost to your shared storage allotment. Other photos had their quality reduced; it was still high-quality and is likely good enough for anything other than trying to have physical prints made, but there is a difference.</p><p>There is a chance that these "duplicate" photos would be full quality and the photos in Google Photos are not. This situation happened to me when I got hit with the weird duplication bug/mess/Googleism. A bunch of photos I took with the first Pixel phone were stored in full resolution and quality in my Google Drive but the "copies" in Google Photos were not.</p><p>It's up to you to decide if you want or need these larger-sized files (I didn't), but if you don't know and don't check, you can't decide.</p>
<p>One last thing to note — this happened to a <em>lot</em> of people, and it's probably worth checking if you are one of them and don't know it. Just open your Google Drive and look through all the stuff that's stored there. If you see folders full of pictures, this is probably why.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google TV already offers a bunch of free content on its platform, including The Roku Channel. However, it will become much easier to discover and use The Roku Channel on Google TV thanks to deeper integration between the two services, Roku <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roku.com/blog/trc-googletv" target="_blank">announced</a> today. This will bolster Google TV's free content and make it easier to find and watch the tens of thousands of movies and TV shows made available as part of The Roku Channel.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/roku">Roku</a> first added The Roku Channel to Google TV last year, in limited form. There wasn't support for Google TV's search or discoverability functions at the time. That's beginning to change, as Roku says a more integrated experience will be available "in the coming weeks." For starters, Google TV users will be able to search for content from The Roku Channel using the native search function in Android TV.</p><p>Additionally, 500 live TV channels from Roku will join the live tab on Google TV.  The platform already offers nearly 1,000 free or ad-supported live TV channels, and the new ones from The Roku Channel will provide even more options, including channels with news, sports, cooking, DIY, music, and other types of programming.</p>

<p>A big part of Google TV is the platform's recommendations.

Soon, free Roku movies and TV shows will appear in the <strong>Featured on The Roku Channel</strong>, <strong>Continue watching</strong>, and <strong>Free live TV</strong> on the Google TV home screen.</p><p>Roku says that the free content available via The Roku Channel includes select live MLB games, ABC News broadcasts, and over 80,000 movies and TV shows.</p><p>Whether you have a brand-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a> or an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-vs-chromecast-with-google-tv-4k">older Chromecast</a>, your Google TV device will get The Roku Channel integration. It'll also be available on any third-party device with Google TV built-in.

<ul><li>Rumors on X state the OnePlus Watch 3 will "launch soon" in global markets outside of China.</li><li>The tipster lists the watch's upcoming launch alongside the global debut of the OnePlus 13 and 13R, though it's unclear if they will all roll out together.</li><li>Early Watch 3 rumors suggest it could arrive with a 500mAh battery, LTE, and eSIM support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus rolled out its 2024 smartwatch early this year; however, a new set of rumors claims it's looking to double dip.</p><p>According to a post on X by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1860932345097867411">Yogesh Brar</a>, OnePlus is gearing up to launch its next flagship smartwatch with some friends (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-3-global-launch-13-13r-3502836/">Android Authority</a>). Brar states in their post that the OnePlus Watch 3 will "launch soon in global markets." Unfortunately, they don't state how soon consumers can expect this device, especially considering we're a week out from December.</p><p>The X post states the Watch 3 is a part of the Chinese OEM's "upcoming product schedule," and alludes to some additional devices.</p><p>Brar lists the next watch alongside the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R series phones.</p><p>The publication notes that the OnePlus 13R didn't join the top-of-the-line model during its launch at the end of October. This development is curious, to say the least, as we're unsure how OnePlus will go about releasing these three devices in global markets since one hasn't appeared on home soil (China).</p><p>A perfect scenario would see them all dropped at once globally, but the odds of that could be lower than we want.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OnePlus 13 OnePlus 13ROnePlus Watch 3These are the upcoming products scheduled to launch soon in Global markets.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1860932345097867411">November 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Whispers about a OnePlus Watch 3 started earlier this summer when it appeared for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-oneplus-watch-certification-specs-rendering">its TENAA certification</a>. Leaked specs suggest the watch will sport LTE and eSIM support alongside a strong 500mAh battery like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">its predecessor</a>. Additionally, it seems the watch could feature 10W wired charging.</p><p>Considering how recently the Watch 2 debuted, those earlier rumors felt closer to a variant rather than a jump in the series.</p><p>On the other hand, the "launching soon" rumor sort of makes sense when you consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-goes-official-in-china">one-month launch difference</a> for the OnePlus 13. The phone debuted in China on October 31, which was a month and some change earlier than the OnePlus 12's December 5 launch last year. A global launch for that device is expected sooner since it's already out in its home China market.</p><p>With that, perhaps we're looking at a December rollout for the OnePlus 13 overseas — but that's just speculation. For context, the OnePlus 12R rolled out in January 2024, a month after the top-tier model. In any case, these devices might slowly trickle out in a similar cadence to OnePlus' past.</p><p>As always, we'll have to wait and see.</p>

I know that sounds like something a deal writer <em>would </em>say, but I&apos;m being serious here. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones </a>of 2024 are getting major discounts through the MVNO carrier, and Mint is pairing the savings with some deeply discounted wireless when you transfer your existing phone number. For instance, you could get the Google Pixel 9 AND a full year of the Unlimited plan for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>a single payment of $479 (or $20 per month using affirm)</strong></a>. Alternately, you can grab the Samsung Galaxy S24 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-s24/5418243/"><strong>simply have your phone bill covered for a year</strong></a>.</p><p>Sure, they aren&apos;t straight discounts, but if you&apos;re looking to switch wireless carriers, just imagine: you could make a single payment right now and not have to think about your phone bill again until December 2025. Plus, you&apos;ll get an incredible 2024 device out of the deal. Yeah, it&apos;s that good. </p><p>Keep reading for all of the best deals from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>Mint Mobile&apos;s Black Friday sale</strong></a>, but don&apos;t wait too long to make your move — Mint has been known to run out of stock during events like this.

<p>The problem is that the 9 Pro Fold is also pretty expensive. Mint Mobile is helping a bit by carving $350 off the phone when you pair the purchase with 12 months of discounted wireless and transfer your phone number. </p>

<ul><li>Google is now inserting its own links to Google Search result cards into third-party webpages.</li><li>The feature, called Page Annotations, is now live in the Google app for iOS.</li><li>Web publishers can opt-out of Page Annotations, but the request can take up to 30 days to take effect.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is adding another tool to its web browser that could pull users away from independent sites and toward Google Search results. The company recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/websearch/thread/308719098/page-annotation-in-google-app-browser-for-ios?hl=en"> announced </a>the introduction of Page Annotations to the Google app for iOS, which is a multifunctional app hosting Google Search, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, and functioning as a miniature web browser. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-ios-app-page-annotation-38451.html">Search Engine Roundtable </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/25/google-ios-app-link-annotations-search/">9to5Google</a>, Page Annotations insert links to Google Search results in plain text on third-party websites.</p><p>"Words, topics, products, places, celebrity names, and other entities that are mentioned in a page might be highlighted as clickable annotations in the Google App browser for iOS," the company explains in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/control-what-you-share#page-insights" target="_blank">support document</a>. "By clicking the annotation, the user will be navigated to the search page with the results for this annotation."</p><p>Google does give web publishers the ability to opt-out of Page Annotations. They can do so via a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1h9I0TbN-H_1e85CqXYb1ng7rQfg2ijfODc1sBxPBd08/viewform?edit_requested=true" target="_blank">Google Form</a>. However, some site owners may be frustrated by how long it can take for their opt-out request to be processed.</p><p>"Site owners can choose to opt out of this annotation feature by submitting the opt-out form," Google explains. "The Page Annotation feature triggered on your site will be disabled within 30 days after submitting the opt-out form. You only need to do this once."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jAbTLUkofY6oM9xkicnETD" name="iphone-16-pro-max-20.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jAbTLUkofY6oM9xkicnETD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Page Annotations appear differently than regular in-text links, potentially signaling to the user that you're clicking a Google Search link rather than a redirect link from a third-party website. However, it's still possible that Page Annotations pull users away from the site they're browsing.</p><p>More likely, though, is that Page Annotations will simply be a new way for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google">Google app</a> users to quickly find out more information about a person, place, or thing. The Google Search results cards that appear as Page Annotations are designed in a way that makes it easy to return to the site you were previously browsing. It's also worth noting that iOS has a native <strong>Look Up</strong> feature that basically allows users to do the exact same thing, except it works system-wide on any highlighted text.</p><p>When you consider this context, it's unlikely that Page Annotations will materially change how iPhone users browse the web. If publishers are concerned, they do still have the ability to opt-out. While not explicitly listed as a test, it's fair to wonder whether Page Annotations might make their way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">Chrome</a> or Android if they are successful in the Google app for iOS.</p>
