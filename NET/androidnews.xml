<p>While most E Ink displays tend to focus on doing one thing, the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C Pro does it all. Successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-tab-ultra-c-review">Tab Ultra C</a>, the Tab Ultra C Pro displays 4,096 colors on its 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 display, which is unusual for most E Ink tablets. Comics can be viewed in full color and you can even draw, highlight, or jot down notes in different shades thanks to the accompanying stylus. The Tab Ultra C Pro&apos;s touch function for the stylus is powered by Wacom, the company that makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-drawing-tablets" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-drawing-tablets">best drawing tablets</a>. It imitates the true blue traditional feel of writing on paper with a pen.</p>

<p>Onyx Boox really took things to the next level by adding more gear under the Tab Ultra C Pro&apos;s hood. This stunningly slim tablet runs Android 12 out of the box so you can actually install and use apps from the Google Play Store. It has 6GB of RAM, 128GB of onboard storage, a microSD slot, a 16MP camera, stereo speakers, a mic, a USB Type-C port that supports fast charging, and a set of speakers. Amazingly, the 4,600mAh battery can last for a week or two with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in full use. The Boox Tab Ultra C Pro is the complete package; it is almost a full-blown <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you want the complete package, you&apos;ll have to pay for it since this tablet isn&apos;t exactly cheap in comparison to "normal" tablets. It also lacks water and dust resistance, which is a bummer, and E Ink displays are famously dim in the sun. We believe you can live with these shortcomings as the combination of features in the Tab Ultra C Pro is just too good. As opposed to the Kindle Scribe, it provides more value and has so much more to offer.</p>

<p>For many years, Amazon has dominated the e-reader market with its Kindle line of reading tablets, and for good reason: Kindle e-readers are excellent devices and their displays have LED backlighting. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-kids-11th-gen-review">Kindle Paperwhite</a> is the absolute <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">best Amazon Kindle e-reader</a>, which makes it the best E Ink tablet for reading.</p>
<p>The 2021 iteration of the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite has IPX8 waterproof certification so you don&apos;t have to worry about getting it wet. You also get five adjustable LED backlights in the Kindle Paperwhite so it&apos;s fairly bright in sunlight. Its 6-inch 300ppi E Ink screen is a delight to look at and replicates paper very nicely. Audible integration makes it the perfect companion for lazy beach days when you want to sunbathe with your eyes closed. You can connect a pair of Bluetooth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> and listen to audiobooks in peace.</p>
<p>Amazon introduced a bunch of different colors for the Kindle Paperwhite so you have a lot of variety. There&apos;s 8GB or 16GB of internal storage, which is enough to store thousands of e-books. The battery life is excellent and you get a USB-C charging port. Amazon sweetened the deal by setting a low price but you&apos;ll need to spend a little extra cash for the ad-free version. If you&apos;re an avid reader, you won&apos;t be disappointed by the Kindle Paperwhite. Some file formats aren&apos;t supported, though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazons-kindle-e-readers-will-finally-support-the-most-popular-ebook-format">Amazon did introduce EPUB</a> compatibility to compensate.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re searching for a more writing-focused E Ink tablet, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/remarkable-2-review" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/remarkable-2-review">ReMarkable 2</a> is your best bet. Built from the ground up for this purpose, the ReMarkable 2 offers a premium writing experience. It has a 10.3-inch e-paper display that cannot display colors beyond black and white. It has Wi-Fi, USB Type-C charging, 8GB storage, a 3,000 mAh battery, and a cool magnetic accessory dock where you can store your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-android-phones-and-tablets">stylus</a>. Notes and other documents can be saved over the cloud, although the companion apps are a little buggy.</p>
<p>The software caters to handwritten notes and processing them for multiple purposes. You can take notes directly on PDF files or use OCR to scan your notes taken by hand. To jot down digital notes, you need to use the compatible stylus. It comes with the Marker Plus that has an eraser on the opposite end, so it functions just like a standard pencil. It&apos;s extremely fun to use.</p>
<p>The downside of getting the E Ink digital notebook from ReMarkable is that you&apos;ll have to break the bank to get one with all its accessories. Mercifully, the price of the ReMarkable 2 writing tablet has decreased quite a lot since its launch, but there&apos;s still the matter of finding one. And there&apos;s another hard pill to swallow as well. Because you can&apos;t access the Play Store on the ReMarkable 2, it&apos;s no good for any other task beyond jotting down notes.</p>
<p>If you&apos;re looking for the ultimate handwriting experience on an e-ink tablet, these pains are worth undertaking though.</p>

<p>The ReMarkable 2 tablet is great for writing, but it is also ridiculously expensive. On top of that, the stylus isn&apos;t even included in its base price. If you want better value, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-note-air-3-review">Onyx Boox Note Air 3</a> is a better buy overall. Onyx Boox tablets beat Amazon, Kobo, and every other competitor easily because they all have the Google Play Store and run Android 12.</p>
<p>The Onyx Boox Note Air 3 has a 10.3-inch black and white E Ink HD Carta 1200 display that has excellent contrast and a lovely crispness to it. It comes with a battery-free stylus that registers 4,096 degrees of pressure and you get native optical character recognition (OCR). This is such a vital feature for any tablet, whether it&apos;s an e-ink device or a full-blown traditional Android or iOS tablet. Unbelievably, the Kindle Scribe doesn&apos;t come with OCR which makes the Onyx Boox Note Air 3 the obvious answer when comparing the two devices.</p>
<p>Apart from the stylus and excellent e-paper screen, the Note Air 3 has all the advantages of e-ink tablets and e-readers as well as a few extras. You get weeks of battery life from its 3,700mAh cell, a USB-C port with OTG support, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, support for tons of file formats, speakers, and even a microphone!</p>
<p>When looking for a writing tablet with an e-paper display, the Onyx Boox Note Air 3 is easily the winning contender. This is saying something, considering the Note Air 3&apos;s foes include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-vs-remarkable-2">Amazon Kindle Scribe and the ReMarkable 2</a>. If you don&apos;t mind the price tag and lack of water resistance, this is the e-ink tablet to get for writing.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">Amazon Kindle Scribe</a> isn&apos;t the best value tablet on this list, nor does it offer the most amazing features and specs. It does, however, have that legendary Kindle build and insane battery life backing it. This thing lasts for several weeks on a single charge, which is exactly what you&apos;d expect from any decent Kindle.</p><p>For Kindle users, the Amazon Kindle Scribe is the perfect e-paper tablet. It doesn&apos;t have the Google Play Store and it doesn&apos;t support a lot of e-book formats. But the Kindle Store has an excellent collection of e-books and Audible brings you audiobooks in a portable form factor.</p><p>Now that Amazon has brought EPUB compatibility to Kindle devices, the Kindle Scribe is a lot more likable. You can easily send files to the e-reader slash tablet using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-send-articles-files-or-web-pages-to-your-amazon-kindle-device">Send to Kindle feature</a> and there&apos;s Bluetooth pairing for audiobooks.</p><p>The compatible Kindle Pen works well, there are no lags, and it feels really good to use. You can get a lot better e-paper tablets for the same price, but those who prefer Amazon&apos;s Kindle ecosystem will be very happy.</p>

<p>E Ink tablet lovers out there on a budget can still get one for a nifty price. The entry-level <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-2022-review">Amazon Kindle (2022)</a> is a budget e-reader sporting a 6-inch 300ppi e-paper display. It doesn&apos;t have many fancy features like a waterproof rating or Sudoku, but it can support a healthy number of file formats and looks brilliant.</p>
<p>It isn&apos;t that bright in sunlight but the adjustable front light is handy for late-night reading. The basic Amazon Kindle has some more no-nonsense specs like 16GB of storage, an insanely good battery life, Wi-Fi, and audiobook support. If you don&apos;t want to use the Kindle app, you can transfer files to the Amazon Kindle (2022) e-reader from your PC.</p>
<p>In comparison to almost every other e-paper device out there, the Amazon Kindle is the winner hands down when it comes to the price. The base model Kindle performs a tad bit slower and it doesn&apos;t have waterproofing, but it is still the best E Ink tablet for reading on a tight budget.</p>

The past two years, in particular, have been monumental for the Pixel A-series, significantly improving the specs and design to closely match that of the more expensive mainline Pixel series.</p><p>But there&apos;s always room for improvement and differentiation, especially as Google continues to hike the price of the phones in some regions. Few rumors for the Pixel 9a currently exist—and there are no leaks at this time—although it&apos;s also possible that Google may ditch the A-series completely. However, we can still speculate on Google&apos;s 2025 mid-range phone by looking at the past to get a clearer view of the future.</p>

<p>Last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1652928398099087360">one analyst noted</a> that the Pixel 8a wouldn&apos;t exist, but that clearly didn&apos;t pan out. So far, we have rumors that the Pixel 9a exists and will feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-display-rumor">a bigger display</a> than the Pixel 8a, but a few trends with the Pixel family seem to be telling a bigger picture.</p><p>This year, it&apos;s said that Google will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">releasing three models</a> of the Pixel 9: the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Additionally, Google is allegedly renaming its second-generation folding phone to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-successor-name-change-rumors">Pixel 9 Fold</a>, meaning it&apos;ll launch four Pixel 9 phones by the end of 2024.</p><p>This would be the largest number of Pixel phone models that Google has launched at once, and it makes us wonder if Google is slowly shifting its strategy of releasing a cheaper A-series phone half a year after the mainline Pixel release.</p><p>Additionally, Google has been slowly increasing the price of the Pixel A-series over the past few years, making it more closely priced to the cheapest mainline Pixel phone than ever.</p><p>If Google is releasing one cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> from the get-go and the price of the A-series continues to rise, why would there be a need for an A-series at all?</p>

<p>Historically, the Pixel A-series uses a similar design to the main series with a few tweaks. In the Pixel 8a&apos;s case, the corners are a slightly wider curve than the Pixel 8 series, making even more of a squircle.</p><p>That means a potential Pixel 9a should look very similar to the Pixel 9, which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-renders-leak">been leaked several times</a> and looks an awful lot like an iPhone. That includes completely flat side rails, a completely flat back, and a completely flat display. Google flattened the display on the Pixel 8 but the Pixel 9 is supposed to finish up the flattening of the series.</p>

<p>More than likely, if Google releases a Pixel 9a, it&apos;ll look a lot like the Pixel 9 leaked renders pictured above. That should also include a matte back, as Google swapped the shiny plastic back with a higher-quality matte one on the Pixel 8a, making it feel more premium.</p><p>YouTube concept artist <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgcq5Cgk_kQ">Technozo Concept has a video</a> of leaked Pixel 9 CAD designs that showcase the phone&apos;s potential design in stunning detail along with a choice of potential new colors.

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9a-cameras"><span>Google Pixel 9a: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XJrBJTbAnK5LULvLJybsBG" name="google-pixel-8a-official-lifestyle-obsidian-01.jpg" alt="A person holding an Obsidian Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XJrBJTbAnK5LULvLJybsBG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel A-series began with the Pixel 3a and Google used the same camera modules from that phone through the Pixel 6a. The Pixel 7a featured the first camera sensor upgrade in the series&apos; history, and the Pixel 8a uses the same camera modules as that phone.</p><p>That being said, there&apos;s little reason to expect Google to upgrade the cameras on a potential Pixel 9a because it needs to cut costs somewhere to keep the phone&apos;s price reasonable. Given that the Pixel A-series already has the best cameras of any budget-minded phone, there&apos;s little incentive for Google to change things up.</p><p>If a rumor or leak appears showing the opposite, we&apos;ll absolutely be updating this section.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="btCmENqGsNFecNCeenr4Z3" name="Google-pixel-7a-gaming-vector.jpg" alt="Playing the game Vector on a Google Pixel 7a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/btCmENqGsNFecNCeenr4Z3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a should use the same Google Tensor G4 processor as the Pixel 9 is rumored to use. While this is an assumption, of course, it would logically follow that Google would use the same processor in all phones with the Pixel 9 moniker as it has historically shared the same processor across the Pixel line in any given generation since the Pixel 6a.</p><p>That means the Pixel 9a would use the same processor as the inevitably more expensive Pixel 9 Fold and Pixel 9 Pro XL, despite the huge gap in price that&apos;s likely to occur.</p><p>Tensor G4 is rumored to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-samsung-upgraded-tensor-g4-process">only a minor upgrade</a> over the Tensor G3 that&apos;s in the Pixel 8a. Google is not expected to deliver a massive upgrade to its Tensor line <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g5-chip-testing-preparations">until Tensor G5</a>, currently slated for the 2025 release of the Pixel 10 series.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Pixel 9a would likely chip with the Tensor G4 processor, rumored to be only a minor upgrade over the Tensor G3 inside the Pixel 8a.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While Tensor G4 may not deliver big performance upgrades over Tensor G3 if rumors are to be believed, it&apos;s possible that Google could use the newer Samsung SF4P manufacturing process as a way to make the chipset more efficient.</p><p>Samsung has been the manufacturer of Google Tensor processors since the beginning and used this new manufacturing process in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400</a> to increase efficiency and battery life, plus help keep its processors cool enough to match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> in many areas.</p><p>There&apos;s no expectation that Tensor G4 will be quite this powerful but any improvement is always welcome.</p><p>There are no other rumors or leaks about Pixel 9a specs at this time. It&apos;s highly unlikely that we&apos;ll see many major upgrades for Pixel 9a components since Google just upgraded most of the requested items — like the display refresh rate — in the Pixel 8a.</p>

<p>As with any new phone, there are a few things we&apos;d love to see Google improve on the Pixel 9a over existing phones like the Pixel 8a.</p>
<p><strong>A lower-priced option</strong></p><p>The Pixel 6a, 7a, and 8a are all great phones that offer <em>a lot</em> of value, but a $450-500 phone is still financially out of reach for a lot of people. In fact, the Galaxy A-series makes up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-smartphone-sales-q4-2021">the bulk of the sales</a> for Samsung. Google&apos;s Pixel market share <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-market-share-grows-in-us-despite-a-decline-in-phone-sales-overall">continues to grow</a>, and there&apos;s little doubt the Pixel A-series has a big part in this.</p><p>How much more could it grow, then, if Google offered a <em>truly</em> budget-priced model? We&apos;re talking something under $300 that could still offer the Pixel experience, even if it had to cut back on some of the more premium features of the Pixel series — like the <strong>latest</strong> Google Tensor processors or upgraded camera modules.</p>
<p><strong>Further improved Tensor</strong></p><p>We don&apos;t have too much hope for this one given that the Tensor G4 is rumored to only be a minor upgrade over the Tensor G3, but we certainly can wish! But even if Google can&apos;t do much to supercharge the current Tensor architecture without causing problems, having a chip like the Tensor G4 inside a mid-range phone like the Google Pixel 9a is already incredible as it is.</p>
<p><strong>A real dark mode</strong></p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/dark-mode-is-a-lie">Dark mode is a lie</a> on more phones than I&apos;d like. Unfortunately for Pixel owners, the Pixel is one of the worst offenders of this sin. I&apos;d love to see Google give users a proper "lights out" dark mode where the background is completely black instead of this dark grey nonsense Google has been using for years.</p><p>It&apos;ll both be better for battery life and help with the next request!</p>
<p><strong>Flicker-reduction option</strong></p><p>As the nits delivered by displays continue to grow higher and higher each year, more companies are using OLED displays that don&apos;t dim in a traditional way. Instead, they use Pulse Width Modulation (or PWM), and people like me are, unfortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-display-flickering">very sensitive</a> to this kind of display flickering.</p><p>While we have some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">tips and tricks for PWM-sensitive</a> folks, the best solution is for manufacturers to offer a flicker-reduction option. Companies like Motorola and OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">offer anti-flicker solutions</a> on their phones, and we know Google can do it if they really wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>Faster charging</strong></p><p>Google has largely been using the same 18W charging speed for its phones since the inception of the Pixel line. While it upgraded the Pixel 7 and Pixel 8 to 30W, the Pixel 8a still only supports 18W charging.</p><p>Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, which costs the same $499 as the Pixel 8a, offer 100W wired charging at the expense of removing wireless charging. Considering how truly slow (and probably useless) 7.5W wireless charging is, I&apos;d be happy to see wireless charging go away if it meant we could get faster wired charging.</p>

This is the latest smartwatch in Mobvoi&apos;s lineup, and at first glance, looks practically identical to its predecessor. </p><p>The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> arrived last year and quickly became one of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a>. This is in large part due to the 90 hours of battery life in Smart Mode, and being capable of lasting for up to 45 days in Essential Mode. Well, Mobvoi has done it again, in kind of a literal sense, as the Pro 5 Enduro offers the same battery life claims. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DJCt7AKaBD92ovXNQNG8XU" name="ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-16.jpg" alt="Weight lifting while wearing TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DJCt7AKaBD92ovXNQNG8XU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mobvoi)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, you would be hard-pressed to notice much of a difference unless you held the two side-by-side. From a design perspective, the only major changes come in the form of the new Sapphire Crystal Glass that sits atop the 1.43-inch AMOLED + ULP Display. This is an upgrade from the Corning Gorilla Glass found on the previous model and puts Mobvoi on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a>. </p><p>The other design change that Mobvoi points out is that the rotating crown has been "entirely redesigned." The crown is ever-so-slightly larger, which makes it easier to scroll through menus and cards. Speaking of larger, the Side Button has also been changed, now matching the finish of the casing, as opposed to the previously used ridged design.</p>

<p>With these changes, the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro is now slightly heavier, as it weighs 44.8g, compared to the Pro 5&apos;s 44.3g. That, paired with the 24mm band, will likely leave many potential buyers out to dry, as it&apos;s simply too large for some. </p>

<p>Many of the other differentiating features of the Pro 5 Enduro are software-related. Namely, you can now use the Ultra-low-power Display to keep track of your workouts while using third-party apps. Mobvoi specifically calls out the likes of Nike Run Club and Strava, allowing you to view various metrics during workouts without actually turning on the OLED display.</p><p>Mobvoi is also introducing "snoring detection" with the Pro 5 Enduro. This is said to offer "valuable insights to enhance users&apos; overall sleep quality and well-being." Unfortunately, there is a "catch," as there&apos;s a "VIP sleep subscription" found within the Mobvoi app. On the bright side, Mobvoi is including a "12-month free VIP sleep subscription" with every Pro 5 Enduro purchase.</p>

<p>Despite Mobvoi recently announcing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-4-beta-recruitment-opens">Wear OS 4 beta</a> for the Pro 5, it seems that even the Pro 5 Enduro owners will have to get in line for the update. Out of the box, the Pro 5 Enduro ships with Wear OS 3.5, which is rather disappointing given that we&apos;re hopeful to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">Wear OS 5 at Google I/O 2024</a>. This only puts Mobvoi further behind in a space that&apos;s only gotten smaller now that Fossil has exited the smartwatch market.</p><p>The price is the final potential barrier of entry for the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro. It retails for $349 and is available from either Mobvoi or Amazon starting today. This is the same retail price as the TicWatch Pro 5. However, you can currently save almost $90. While we were hoping for more than one color, it wasn&apos;t meant to be, as the Pro 5 Enduro is only currently available in the "Obsidian" finish. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I&apos;m seeing a lot of folks repeating the same thing about the Rabbit R1, saying it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rabbits-aosp-based-launcher-runs-on-android-phones-so-it-literally-could-have-been-an-app">just an app</a> and you can install it on your Android phone. All of those people are wrong, but it&apos;s not really their fault.</p><p>You can indeed sideload a semi-working version of what the device does on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, but enthusiasts have been able to do similar things since the beginning of the Android explosion. HTC&apos;s Sense UI ran on a <em>lot</em> of Motorola Droids.</p>
<p>This makes it feel like the software is just an app. However, saying it leaves out some things to think about. I think there are a lot of similarities between what the company is doing and the phone in your hands right now. Calling it an app is missing the point.</p>
<h2 id="services-and-features-are-what-sells-phones-2">Services and features are what sells phones</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YcMNVPGPdvh6VTJEcfRgGW" name="imessage-green-bubble.jpeg" alt="An iMessage chat showing blue and green bubbles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YcMNVPGPdvh6VTJEcfRgGW.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> is a hardware-based gateway to the company&apos;s software services. It ties other services like Spotify and Uber together so you can use them through a single interface by talking to the device or tapping a few buttons.</p><p>It&apos;s centered around a custom launcher that runs atop the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">Android Open Source Project</a>. That shouldn&apos;t surprise you because Android powers plenty of devices besides phones; things like car and airplane infotainment systems, network appliances, toys, and even industrial machinery can be found using Android for the "smart stuff."</p>
<p>It&apos;s not difficult to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources">sideload</a> this onto your phone and get a taste of what the company is trying to do. You won&apos;t get everything working, and things that worked one day may stop working the next as Rabbit tries to put Pandora back in her box.</p><p>This is because the company uses the R1&apos;s hardware to authenticate that you&apos;re an authorized user. This means the company can place barriers on any or all of the device&apos;s software features so they only work if you&apos;re actually using the R1. </p>
<p>This is nothing new, and almost every phone manufacturer does the same. If you want to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-camera-v9-2-update">Pixel camera software features</a>, you need to buy a Pixel. If you want to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">Samsung&apos;s One UI</a>, you buy a Galaxy phone. If you want to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-the-real-reason-imessage-isnt-available-android">iMessage</a>, you buy an iPhone. We see software that could potentially run on many devices being exclusive to one brand all the time because it&apos;s being used to make people want to buy them.</p><p>You can sideload some of these features to another phone, but not everything works as expected. It&apos;s easy to install the Pixel camera app onto another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">phone with a great camera</a>, but it&apos;s not the same. The software is looking for specific hardware because it was written that way. Rabbit&apos;s software is doing the same thing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="B9kkdUCwH7ZFJRViskGDqc" name="rabbit-r1-spotify.jpg" alt="Spotify playing on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B9kkdUCwH7ZFJRViskGDqc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m not defending Rabbit or the R1. I&apos;ve never used it, nor do I want to use it, and I think the idea of a device that duplicates things your phone can already do is really dumb. Other people think it&apos;s great, and I&apos;m not trying to change their minds. Buy the things you like. I&apos;d totally buy a high-end music player built inside the same body as the R1, but many people would think that is silly.</p><p>I&apos;m just trying to explain that what Rabbit is doing isn&apos;t really that different from what Samsung or Apple is doing. That&apos;s the problem with trying to explain tech "stuff" — no matter how hard you try or how many words you write, some people aren&apos;t going to understand what you&apos;re trying to say.</p>
<p>I think that&apos;s what happened here. Yes, you can install the software on your phone. No, not everything works because it&apos;s not just the app doing the work.</p><p>If you really want a dedicated AI device to do what the R1 does, you&apos;d be better off buying one and hoping the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/edzitron/status/1787516008049287440">stays around long enough to support it</a>.</p>

But just behind that ranks the immense value presented by Google&apos;s own smartphones, which often debut at lower prices than the competition yet offer more updates in the long run.</p><p>The Google Pixel 8a was just announced, and it&apos;s the crown jewel of value for the company, delivering what looks to be the best Pixel A-series experience yet. The hardware appears to be nearly identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a>, yet the Pixel 8a is $200 cheaper. It certainly makes me wonder why anyone would bother buying the more expensive Pixel 8 at this point.</p><p>But is the Pixel 8a the right phone for you? Let&apos;s start by taking a look at the specs compared to last year&apos;s Pixel 7a to see if it makes sense for you to order a Pixel 8a today.</p>

<p>Based on specs alone, the Pixel 8a is a fairly menial upgrade over the Pixel 7a. You get the Tensor G3, a processor that&apos;s a year newer and runs quite a bit cooler than the Tensor G2 in the Pixel 7a. If you have a Pixel 7a, it doesn&apos;t make any sense to upgrade to a Pixel 8a, though. There&apos;s just not enough change to warrant the cost.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Based on specs alone, the Pixel 8a is a fairly menial upgrade over the Pixel 7a.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Google also upgraded the display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1,400 nits of brightness, although we&apos;re not yet sure if they improved the PWM rate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">as Samsung did</a> with some of its 2024 phones. Comparatively, the Pixel 7a has a 90Hz display capable of 1,000 nits of brightness and has a 360Hz PWM rate at all brightness levels.</p><p>Despite increasing the battery by a little over 100mAh, Google managed to decrease the weight by just over 5 grams. This minor battery size increase, coupled with the slightly more efficient Tensor G3, gives us hope that the battery life might see some improvements.</p><p>Google also swapped out the nasty shiny back of the Pixel 7a with a "matte composite back" and aluminum frame on the Pixel 8a. That shiny fingerprint magnet back on the 7a was easily the most annoying part of the phone&apos;s design, so it&apos;s great to see that directly addressed this year.</p>

<p>However, the most exciting upgrade might just be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">inclusion of Gemini Nano</a>. This makes the Pixel 8a the only phone under $500 to come with Gemini Nano, a big shift from last Fall when Google reserved its upgraded AI assistant and shipped it only with its most expensive phone, the Pixel 8 Pro.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Pixel 8a has all the AI features Google advertises as important for its most expensive Pixel phones.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>That means the Pixel 8a has all the AI features Google advertises as important for its most expensive Pixel phones, including Best Take, Magic Editor, Audio Magic Eraser, Real Tone in video, Guided Frame on both the front and rear cameras, Circle to Search, Call Assist, and more.</p><p>Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-one-vpn-will-be-sunset-later-this-year">by the end of this year</a>, owning a Pixel phone will be the <strong>only</strong> way to get the free VPN by Google One feature. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn">best VPN services for Android</a> all offer better features than Google&apos;s VPN, but you have to pay extra for those services, obviously.</p><p>Considering that most phones in this price range don&apos;t have <em>any</em> of these features adds even more value to the Pixel 8a. Plus, all of these upgrades come without raising the price of the base model — as long as you&apos;re in the U.S. at least.</p>

<p>However, some regions, like Canada, are seeing a price increase with this year&apos;s Pixel 8a release. Considering that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-pixel-7a-deals">Pixel 7a deals</a> will often get you that phone for $350 or less, it would be much harder to recommend the 8a in these regions.</p><p>Last year, Google raised the price of its Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro by $100 to offset the company offering seven years of support in addition to a bevy of other improvements, including better hardware build quality.</p><p>While it&apos;s not unreasonable for Google to raise prices for better products, last year&apos;s Pixel 7a already received a price increase in <em>all</em> regions, not just a select few. Being selected as a region to receive increased prices certainly doesn&apos;t feel very nice.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Pixel phones have had a lot of problems over the past few years, but the Pixel A-series has skirted around most of them.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>And there&apos;s really no ignoring the myriad of problems Google has had with Pixel phones and updates over the years. Google&apos;s Tensor line of processors are incredible for many reasons but they have a tendency to run hotter than processors from Qualcomm or MediaTek.</p><p>Just search Google for Pixel overheating, and you&apos;ll find a slew of articles <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/14oyovy/pixel_7_overheating/">and forum posts</a> over the years talking about this issue. Tensor G3 runs cooler, but the processor didn&apos;t improve performance much compared to the Tensor G2 in order to keep it from running hot regularly.</p><p>Google also seems to have a QA problem with some of its updates. Back in October, Pixel 6 owners ran into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-6-storage-bug-android-14">a crucial storage bug</a> that made it nearly impossible to use the phone until a fix was issued. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-internal-storage-access-bug-january-play-system">A nearly identical bug</a> reared its ugly head earlier this year and affected nearly all Pixels, not just the Pixel 6, leaving some users with a useless phone until a patch was issued <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-details-pixel-storage-bug-temporary-fix">over a week later</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.45%;"><img id="Pyzv53fjAQb2Z7gf7Rr39e" name="google-pixel-8a-official-hero.jpg" alt="All Google Pixel 8a colorways arranged around the name of the phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pyzv53fjAQb2Z7gf7Rr39e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1320" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Plus, we&apos;ve seen updates cause <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro-battery-drain-and-network-issues">awful battery drain issues</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-second-april-patch-cell-service-rollout">cellular connectivity issues</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-6-battery-overheating-issues">overheating issues</a>, just to point out a few problems that have amassed over the years.</p><p>The silver lining? Almost none of these issues seem to have affected the Pixel A-series of phones. In the past, that&apos;s because Google changed some key hardware components between a mainline Pixel phone like the Pixel 7 and the budget-minded A-series of that generation — in this example, the Pixel 7a.</p><p>According to our sources, however, Google has apparently used the Pixel 8&apos;s hardware as a base for this phone, meaning it could be susceptible to any update mistakes that might cause problems for the mainline Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro.</p><p>But while these things hold a bit of a cloud over the launch, I still feel more confident than buying a Pixel 8a than a mainline series Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro, mainly because the A-series has long skirted the issues mainline Pixels have faced. Plus, there&apos;s just something satisfying in knowing that you got features once reserved for more expensive phones at a fraction of the price.</p>

You can expect charging speeds up to 7.5W with a fast wireless charger.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="wireless-charging-is-supported-but-it-apos-s-not-fast-2">Wireless charging is supported, but it&apos;s not fast</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a> needs to cut some corners somewhere to be cheaper than the base Pixel 8, and one of those places is with wireless charging. In comparison, Google includes fast wireless charging on its Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro phones, while the Pixel 8a sticks to a fairly slow 7.5W Qi speed. With a large 4492mAh, you shouldn’t expect to top up your battery in a hurry using wireless charging, but it should be great for topping up at work or in bed.</p><p>If you’re in a hurry, you can get up to 18W charging using a cable USB-C charger. Google only includes the cable, so you’ll need to pick up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">Qi-compatible charger</a> to get that full speed, however. While you can use an older 5W wireless charger, you’ll need the right charging pad to get the full 7.5W. </p><p>Don’t forget you’ll also need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">USB-C charger</a> for your wireless pad that supports these higher speeds, so if you’re trying to make your aging 5W travel adapter last, you’re giving up some speed. Having a high-speed USB-C charger is also a help if you’re in a hurry.</p><p>If wireless charging speed is really important to you, the upgrade to the Pixel 8 could be worth the money. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> supports faster 18W wireless charging, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> supports up to 23W. Even the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-review">Pixel 7</a> supports 20W wireless charging, so you’ve got a few options if you really need the extra speed.</p><p>The Pixel 8a is shaping up to be an incredible value with the Tensor G3 SoC with 8GB of RAM and an excellent display, but the charging speeds aren’t going to impress anyone. Luckily, Google is expecting over 24 hours of battery life for average users, so most people shouldn’t need to worry about finding a charger before the end of the day.</p><p>If you’re a heavy user and don’t want to risk running out of battery, you can grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">high-capacity power bank</a>, some of which even work with wireless charging. Overall, the Pixel 8a’s wireless charging capabilities are far from impressive but are decent considering the budget price.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a>, like Google’s previous budget options, offers most of the performance of the flagship phone with a few cutbacks. One of the cutbacks is charging speed which offers the same speeds as the outgoing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>. Despite this, for a budget-oriented phone, the Pixel 8a charges decently fast.</p><p>Using the included USB-C cable and a PD 3.0-compatible charger, such as one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">best USB-C chargers</a>, you can charge the Pixel 8a at up to 18W. Even so, in our Pixel 7a review, we noted that it would take well over an hour to fully charge the phone and that phone has a slightly smaller battery than the 8a.</p><p>The phone also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-google-pixel-8a-support-wireless-charging">supports wireless charging</a> at up to 7.5W if you’ve got the right <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">Qi-compatible charger</a>. The wireless charging on this phone won’t be quick and is really only sufficient for keeping your battery topped up during the day or charging the battery overnight while you sleep. Otherwise, you may find yourself waiting hours to see 100% at the top of the phone.</p><p>If you think you’ll need some more juice before you get home for the night, it’s a good idea to pick up one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">best power banks</a> to make sure you’ve always got some battery capacity at the ready. You’ll also want to pick up a fast USB-C charger to make sure you get the full 18W charging speed since Google doesn’t include one in the box.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-vs-pixel-7a">Comparing the Pixel 8a to the Pixel 7a</a>, there have been some nice tech updates, but charging isn’t one of them. It would have been nice to see Google offer faster charging speeds on this mid-range device, especially considering many Samsung Galaxy A-series and OnePlus phones support much faster charging. Even the cheap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-review">Galaxy A15 5G</a> supports 25W wired charging.</p><p>As for the other Pixels you can pick up, the older Pixel 7 and 7 Pro phones aren’t that much faster at 20W and 23W respectively. If you can afford the upgrade, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> supports 27W charging while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> supports up to 30W wired charging. If you’re a heavy user and think you’ll need to top up your phone midday, choosing a more expensive Pixel could be worth it for you.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a>, the latest budget entry in the Google Pixel line, joins the Google Pixel 8 and Google Pixel 8 Pro. Like its bigger siblings, it promises seven years of OS and security updates as well as Feature Drops. This means the phone will be “current” until 2031. </p><p>Loaded with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, it offers the same OS as the other two phones in the line that launched last year. Like the others, Feature Drops are included, and this assurance means you will be able to load and enjoy new features on the phone for the same length of time. Google launches Feature Drops consistently, several times per year, so the phone will always provide a fresh, new experience. </p><p>The Google Pixel 8a, which will likely rank among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">the best cheap Android phones</a>, is about as powerful as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, although not so much the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> with its 12GB of RAM. Still, it’s a decent phone that users will want to keep for years. With that said, if you do decide to upgrade, the option to resell or trade-in the device, or even hand it down to a friend or family member, helps extend the investment and add value. With so many years of support, the phone will retain more of its value than a device that only supports a few years of OS and/or security updates, for example, and is considered outdated by the time you’re ready to upgrade. </p><p>You could purchase the Google Pixel 8a, for example, use it for a few years, then hand it over to a family member. Upgrade to something more powerful if you decide you need something else or if you have saved up for a higher-end phone. Parents will especially love the lengthy support since you can confidently invest in this phone for one child and hand it down to the next when they come of age without worrying that it won’t be supported by the latest OS or, more importantly, security updates. </p><p>It should be noted that Google offers a shorter software promise with its older, recent Pixel phones and devices, which only span three OS upgrades and five years of updates, making this is an important selling point for the Pixel 8a. Keep the phone protected in a great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-cases">Pixel 8a case</a>, add a screen protector, and this phone will not only look but also operate like new for many years to come.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google has streamlined the process of setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) for Workspace users.</li><li>Users can now set up two-step verification without needing to provide a phone number.</li><li>Even if 2FA is disabled in your Google account settings, your previously enrolled second steps and backup codes will now be preserved, rather than being deleted.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is making it easier to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for Workspace users, so admins can more easily encourage members to turn on 2FA.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/05/updates-for-configuring-two-step-verification-for-your-google-account.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Google announced that you can now set up two-step verification without a phone number. Instead, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-two-factor-authentication-google-account">secure your account with either the Google Authenticator app</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/adding-security-key-your-google-account-good-idea-and-heres-how-do-it">physical security key</a>. Both options offer an extra layer of protection and make it much harder for hackers to gain access, even if they steal your password.</p><p>Before, you had to give out your phone number to set up two-step verification. Nowadays, many people hesitate to share their phone numbers because of privacy concerns. Let&apos;s face it, relying solely on SMS codes isn&apos;t the most secure approach.</p><p>While SMS verification for 2FA is better than nothing, it&apos;s not foolproof. Google itself warns in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839#zippy=%2Cuse-a-verification-code-from-a-text-message-or-call" target="_blank">support document</a> that codes sent via text messages can be vulnerable to hacks targeting phone numbers.</p><p>The latest update allows you to skip the less secure SMS method and remove it entirely from your security setup. By letting you ditch the phone number altogether, you&apos;re opting for more secure methods like an authenticator app or security key.</p><p>Furthermore, users who use hardware security keys now have two options on the "Passkeys and security keys" page. They can either register a FIDO1 credential on their security key or create a passkey.</p><p>If you have a managed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> account, you might still need to log in with your password, depending on your administrators&apos; setup.</p><p>Another update is that your "enrolled second steps" will now remain intact. Previously, if you turned off two-step verification in your Google account settings, all second-step methods and saved backup codes would be deleted. Now, these will be saved even if you disable 2FA.</p><p>However, if an admin turns off 2FA for a member, all related security measures will still be removed, maintaining a thorough security system as before.</p><p>Google has begun rolling out the update to both Workspace customers and personal account users.</p>

The tech is still in its infancy, but there are legitimate use cases where AI makes a difference — transcribing notes, generating summaries, image editing, and so on.</p><p>It&apos;s no surprise, then, that Qualcomm is getting in on the action. The chip manufacturer unveiled the AI Hub back at Mobile World Congress, and it is a platform of AI models that can easily be deployed by developers on devices running Qualcomm hardware, including Snapdragon 8-powered phones and various IoT devices.</p><p>With AI Hub, Qualcomm is making it easier for developers to utilize AI models into their existing services with a minimum of effort. The idea is to provide access to on-device AI utilities on portable devices, and as such the models that Qualcomm is integrating into AI Hub target use cases like image recognition and editing, generating images from text prompts, automatic speech recognition, and so on.</p>

<p>To get a better understanding of what the brand is trying to achieve, I talked to Sahil Arora, Qualcomm India&apos;s Senior Business Development Manager, on the sidelines of the Qualcomm India Developer Conference. We started out with the basics: how does AI Hub benefit developers?</p><p>"We are taking on a lot of workload that&apos;s usually handled by application developers, and this makes it easier for them to get going with AI. So if a developer wants to use any particular AI model, we already have it available in the AI Hub, and these models are pre-optimized and pre-tuned; they just need to use a sample application to get started. In just five codes of line, they can get started with an AI model," said Arora. "We are basically helping developers to focus on coming up with new and innovative use cases instead of putting efforts into integrating tools and AI models into their workflow."</p><p>What&apos;s interesting about the way Qualcomm is positioning AI Hub is that if a developer wants to run their own models, they can do so easily. "If a developer has already worked on a particular AI model and wants to use it on a device, they can just publish it to the AI Hub and integrate it seamlessly," noted Arora. AI Hub models target Snapdragon 8 series devices — including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> — and Qualcomm&apos;s IoT platforms, and the chip vendor is set to launch these models on its Snapdragon X series in the coming months.</p>

<p>AI Hub launched with 75 AI models, and it now has 95 models available to choose from, including the likes of Stable Diffusion, Whisper, ControlNet, and Baichuan 7B. While it&apos;s great that these tools are easily accessible, I wanted to know how they&apos;ll affect end users. "With these utilities, developers can easily offer extensive personalization and customization options — such as expanding an existing picture&apos;s backdrop, AI translation, or creating AI-assisted backgrounds — without having to turn to the cloud." said Arora.</p><p>A big part of AI Hub&apos;s allure is that the included models are primarily run on-device; Qualcomm showcased use cases like image object eraser on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">OPPO Find X7 Ultra</a>, AI-assisted image expansion with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, and AI-powered video editing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a>. Arora noted that Qualcomm sees itself as a "technology enabler," and that it delivers the tools that allows its partners to come up with unique use cases. "AI Hub isn&apos;t a customer-facing feature, but it has the ability to impact a lot of consumers."</p><p>The best part about AI Hub is that Qualcomm isn&apos;t charging a license to use the included AI models; they&apos;re free to use by all developers. By focusing on generative AI use cases on mobile devices, Qualcomm is looking to offer another layer of differentiation with its Snapdragon chipsets, and with the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> touted to deliver sizeable gains in this area, it will be interesting to see what next-gen phones have to offer.</p>
