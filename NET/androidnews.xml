                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Following an interview with Google's Dave Burke, it seems that a previous demonstration of ChromeOS on Android was nothing more than a demo.</li><li>It appears as though the company was interested in seeing if the capability for Android to run ChromeOS through its AVF could work — and it can.</li><li>A previous demo was reportedly shown to corporate partners in private using a Pixel 8's display output capabilities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is dashing any hope of ChromeOS arriving on Android as an interview with a notable member suggests it was just a test.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-on-android-proof-of-concept-3443722/">(Android Authority</a>), an interview with Google&apos;s Dave Burke, vice president of engineering for Android detailed what&apos;s happening with ChromeOS and Android. Burke said that the company&apos;s "tech demo" of the Ferrochrome project was aimed to see its virtualization technology in action.</p><p>Burke added that the software could only get off the ground thanks to the AVF (android virtualization framework) introduced in Android 13. This framework delivered a safe environment for "highly" sensitive code.</p><p>What Google was playtesting was the secure computing side of Android. As Burke stated, most of it is reportedly done through TrustZone, which isn&apos;t "as safe as virtual machines." While TrustZone typically works off ARM CPUs, the virtual machines are a "cleaner, safer way to run compartmentalized secure code."</p><p>The tech demo was done through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, a software that Google has updated with a new AVF to run its graphical operating systems through a virtual machine. This capability comes with GPU acceleration, as well. However, the test was just a proof of concept to see if such capabilities <em>could </em>exist.</p><p>Google&apos;s Sameer Samat chimed in, stating that things often "start like this" at the company. Unfortunately, it seems anyone&apos;s hopes of ChromeOS on Android are squandered as Google has no plans of continuing — at least, for now.</p>

<p>It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-let-you-run-chromeos-on-android-one-day">previously rumored</a> that Google was in the process of creating its own Samsung DeX-like computing environment through ChromeOS. During a private event, users saw a Pixel 8 running the Chromium OS variant known as "Ferrochrome." The demo showcased the latest Pixel flagship utilizing its display output functionality through the OS.</p><p>There wasn&apos;t much else shown during the event aside from the device&apos;s (and the software&apos;s) capability to run the computing software.</p>

<ul><li>During its Android Health segment, Google highlighted a couple of updates for Health Connect for developers and user data.</li><li>The company is preparing to roll out background reads, which will let a developer's app take in a user's data to remain up-to-date when held in the background.</li><li>History reads lets users grant access to another app so it can take in their "historical" Health Connect data, which includes information well beyond 30 days prior.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We&apos;re still busy unpacking all that Google had in store for I/O 2024, and this next bit stems from its "Android Health" segment.</p><p>The company is highlighting another string of updates that are primed for its Android health sector for users in a Developers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/05/the-latest-updates-from-android-health-io-2024.html">blog post</a>. Google&apos;s Health Connect is preparing to pick up support for background and history reads. Regarding the former, the post states that the developer-focused feature will give their app the ability to read Health Connect data when in the background.</p><p>Google states that this will enable a developer&apos;s app to keep a user&apos;s information up-to-date without manual input from the user.</p><p>History reads enters as a feature that gives a developer&apos;s app some context so it&apos;s not starting from zero. Google states users will have the option to grant an app access to their historical data in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a>. This is said to stretch beyond just the past 30 days.</p><p>While users may find both features useful, Google adds that developers must declare the permissions for them to appear. Users can accept or decline these permissions as Google ensures they control the data they share. If users no longer want to allow background or history reads, the options can be found in Health Connect&apos;s settings.</p><p>Google plans to roll out both new features for user data "later this year."</p>

Although the S8 Ultra is a last-generation device, this is a good way to get a more affordable Samsung tablet than the pricey S9 Ultra.</p><p>When you buy the discounted S8 Ultra from Best Buy, you can also get bonus gifts of a free one-month membership of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, three months of Google One and YouTube Premium, and Norton 360 Internet Security protection for three devices.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra</a> is certainly one of the more expensive tablets out there, even despite being Samsung's last-generation premium offering. However, with 36% off the normal purchase price, buyers could stand to get a pretty great deal on this capable device.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tablets/galaxy-tab-s8/buy">Samsung - $1,099.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-14-6-128gb-wi-fi-with-s-pen-graphite/6494238.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="258668e6-81a0-4af3-b462-228112d6d21b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099.99" data-dimension48="$1,099.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want a high-performing tablet at a slightly lower price; you&apos;re looking for a tablet with a large screen that&apos;s still slim and lightweight; having a tablet that can run some games is a priority for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for the latest-generation tablet available and wouldn&apos;t mind paying more for the S9 Ultra;  you need a tablet with a 3.5mm jack.</p><p>Despite its age, the Samsung Galaxy S8 Ultra is a remarkably strong tablet, offering 8GB of RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, along with a massive 11,200mAh battery. All of these make it able to handle most gaming applications, and the 14.6-inch Super AMOLED is great for everything from video streaming to working in the office (or maybe both at the same time).</p><p>While many of Samsung&apos;s devices land in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a>, most are from the company&apos;s newest generation. But if you don&apos;t mind going with the older generation and you go with this deal, you&apos;ll get a tablet that&apos;s almost as good as the S9 Ultra—without the $1,199.99 price tag.</p>

You sit at the table as you might any other desk or conference room table and talk to the person (or people) on the other end, but the trick is that Starline isn’t just a flat screen. It’s a Lightwave projection that displays a 3D projection of the person on the other end, a realism I simply wasn’t prepared for.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-project-starline-hp-partnership/">HP recently recognized</a> Starline’s impressive nature and possibilities in this world of remote work and cross-continental business opportunities, but Starline represents more than just the future of connecting offices for better remote meetings. It goes hand-in-hand with other projects Google showed off at Google I/O 2024, like Project Astra, a new AI routine built on Gemini that can see the real world and talk to you about it as if it were another person looking at the same things.</p><p>We’ve seen Meta launch this kind of technology already on its excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, but Google’s tech takes this a step further by not only making things even more conversational but also by adding memory to the experience. No, I don’t mean RAM or storage. I mean, the AI can remember what it has seen and recall facts and details as if it were a living being.</p>
<h2 id="the-intersection-of-ai-and-xr-2">The intersection of AI and XR</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oYWDsk5xBW4xwuPcfYAHfD" name="Google-IO-2024-AR-glasses.jpeg" alt="A screenshot from the Google I/O presentation showing a Google engineer wearing AR glasses with a camera and Gemini AI capabilities." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oYWDsk5xBW4xwuPcfYAHfD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">You get a brief glimpse of the Google engineer wearing the AR glasses prototype in the Astra demo </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To say Google is working on a lot of different projects right now is an understatement. The company talked about what felt like an endless supply of Gemini-related AI projects during its Google I/O 2024 keynote, but one project was purposefully glossed over to make sure we were paying attention.</p><p>We’re still not sure if this is the pair of Google AR glasses that were previously thought to be canceled, but Google certainly demoed a pair of AR glasses with multimodal Astra AI built in.</p><p>While I didn’t get to demo the glasses myself, I did get to check out Project Astra in person using a single camera and a large touchscreen TV.</p><p>The demo consisted of four different sections: storytelling, alliteration, Pictionary, and free form. During the storytelling portion, we were able to place stuffed animals within the line of sight of the camera, and the AI would then come up with a story about each animal on the fly. The stories were surprisingly convincing and, if nothing, would make a fantastic children’s book.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tt5thLRTkHf4b6iYE536EJ" name="google-project-astra-storytelling.jpg" alt="Demoing Google Project Astra's vision capabilities at Google I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tt5thLRTkHf4b6iYE536EJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alliteration builds upon the storytelling by confining the AI to only use the same letter or sound at the beginning of adjacent or closely connected words for its stories. In Pictionary, you use the touch screen to draw something, and the AI has to guess what it is. This was another particularly impressive one, as there seemed to be no real limitation between what you could draw and what the AI might guess.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Project Astra is not only able to identify what it sees on a camera but can also remember them for an indefinite period of time.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While all three of these modes were impressive and interesting in and of themselves, the free-form mode allows you to do anything with the AI, including recreating the other three modes by giving it a simple voice command. Free form mode is what particularly interested me because of its ability to not only correctly identify what Astra sees through the camera but also the AI’s ability to remember what it saw and recall the information quickly in a later conversation.</p><p>During the keynote, the most impressive example of Astra’s use was asking where the narrator’s glasses were in the room. Astra remembered the previous location of objects, even when those objects weren’t interacted with. In the case of the video, the person demoing the tech never interacted with the glasses until she asked Astra where they were last seen.</p><p>It’s this kind of technology that I can see making a real and meaningful difference in the lives of people who not only need vision assistance - Google’s Guided Frame on Pixel phones and Meta’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">multimodal AI on Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> already do this to some extent - but it will create very real quality of life improvements in the lives of its wearers in subtle ways.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Spatial memory is something once reserved for living things and it creates an entirely new paradigm in AI learning.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Being able to find your glasses or car keys by just asking an AI built into a pair of smart glasses is game-changing, and it will create an almost symbiotic relationship between the person, the AI, and the AI itself.</p><p>Aside from battery life limitations, though, there are storage limitations. Remembering where objects are, and all the spatial data associated with that virtual memory takes up a lot of drive space. Google reps told me there’s theoretically no limitation on how long Astra can remember spaces and things, but the company will scale memory limitations depending on the product using them.</p><p>The demo I used had a memory of only one minute, so by the time I moved on to the next scenario, it had already forgotten what we had previously taught it.</p>

<p>I recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">interviewed Meta’s head of AR development</a>, Caitlin Kalinowski, to discuss Meta’s upcoming AR glasses and how they’ll improve the experience versus current AR products. While she didn’t directly say that the glasses were using light-field displays, the description of how Meta&apos;s AR glasses overlay virtual objects on the real world sounded at least somewhat similar to what I experienced from Project Starline at Google I/O 2024.</p><p>Starline delivers an incredibly impressive, lifelike 3D projection of the person on the other end that moves and looks like that person is sitting across the table from you. I gave my presenter a high-five "through" the display during the demo, and my hand tingled in a way that said my brain was expecting a physical hand to hit mine. It was convincing from every angle, something that&apos;s possible thanks to Starline&apos;s use of six high-resolution cameras placed at various angles around the display&apos;s frame.</p><p>If Meta or Google can compress this experience into a pair of glasses, we&apos;ll have something truly reality-altering in a way we haven&apos;t seen before from technology.</p>

<p>As with anything AR or VR-related, it&apos;s impossible to capture imagery of what Project Starline felt like using traditional cameras and displays. You can see a picture — or even a moving image like you see above — of someone sitting at a Starline booth and recognize that they&apos;re talking to another person, but you don&apos;t <em>truly</em> understand what it feels like until you experience it in person with your own eyes.</p><p>If you&apos;ve ever used a Nintendo 3DS, you&apos;ll have at least a passing idea of what this feels like. The display is wholly convincing and, unlike the 3DS, is high resolution enough so that you&apos;re not counting pixels or even worried about the tech behind the experience at all.</p>

<p>Google representatives told me that while the technology behind Starline is still secretive, more will be revealed soon. For now, I was only told that Starline&apos;s light-field technology was "a new way to compute" that didn&apos;t involve traditional GPUs, rasterizers, or other similar methods of virtually rendering a scene.</p><p>Rather, the light-field tech you see in front of you is a clever amalgam of footage from the six cameras onboard, all stitched together in real-time and moving according to your <strong>personal perspective</strong> in front of it. Again, this is a bit like the revision of the 3DS with the front-facing camera that allowed you to shift your perspective a bit, just all grown up and running on supercharged hardware.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kwkbZr7YpEWoEJNZFPnriL" name="Ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai.jpg" alt="Multimodal AI on the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwkbZr7YpEWoEJNZFPnriL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1536" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Maybe more impressively is the technology&apos;s ability to create a 3D avatar complete with real-time backgrounds. Forget those terrible cutouts you see on a Zoom call; these were moving, authentic-looking backgrounds that seamlessly blended the person into them, even creating real-time shadows and other effects to make it even more convincing.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Imagine being able to see and share experiences with a volumetric display, letting you actually feel like something is right in front of you even if it's thousands of miles away (or not even real at all).</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>For me, this kind of thing is a dream come true for the work-from-home lifestyle. If this technology were to be implemented on a pair of AR glasses like the ones Google or Meta are building, it would be easy to work from <em>anywhere</em> without losing that "professionalism" that some people feel only comes from working in an office. It would also make sharing things with distant relatives and friends a substantially more rewarding and memorable experience for everyone.</p><p>This, paired with a remember-all AI like Astra, would certainly help meld the physical and digital worlds like never before. While companies like Meta have often waxed poetic about ideas like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/metaverse">the Metaverse</a> in the past, I saw the genuine article — the future of augmented reality — coming to life at Google I/O this year.</p><p>It&apos;s amazing to dream up science fiction ideas that seem at least remotely possible, but it&apos;s another to see them come to life before your eyes. And that, for me, was what made Google I/O 2024 a truly memorable year.</p>

<p>One of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300">best Android phones under $300</a>, the Moto G 5G (2023) boasts a vibrant and smooth 120Hz 6.5-inch display, a large 5,000mAh battery, and a Snapdragon processor that should handle most daily tasks with ease. You even get a headphone jack and expandable storage, two useful features that aren't very common nowadays. Grab the affordable phone with an eligible data plan at Tello and you'll get a straight $50 off. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://tello.com/promo/budget-friendly-phones" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="12b07a6f-5b35-4e62-bb2a-7eae07c2440d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249" data-dimension48="$249">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>The super-affordable Galaxy A14 features a surprisingly decent 50MP camera with a huge 5,000mAh battery, NFC support, and some extensive software support from Samsung.

<p>Tello is a T-Mobile-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carrier</a> that&apos;s known for offering custom-built data plans that give you exactly what you need (and nothing else) for as little as $5 per month.

The Value and Smart plan come with unlimited talk and text plus 5GB and 10GB of data, respectively. The Unlimited plan probably offers the best bang for the buck here, though, with 35GB of high-speed monthly data from T-Mobile before speeds start to slow. </p><p>This offer from Tello Mobile may not be for everyone, but if you want great T-Mobile coverage and a reliable, no-frills smartphone, it&apos;s a solid way to save some cash. </p>

This six-month fellowship program will help Google create a "sense of belonging" online for creators and influencers with disabilities.</p><p>The GRID program will cover "key skills" for digital creators, industry leader-provided lessons, and a direct line to Google&apos;s product teams. Google is also giving new creators/influencers who are getting into GRID a chance to work with pre-established creators with disabilities in a mentorship capacity.</p><p>Across the country, the program is said to include fifteen fellowships.</p><p>Among those Google partners with for GRID is the USABA (U.S. Association of Blind Athletes). Through this, the company states it will provide Pixel phones, leveraging <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi Wireless</a>, and other company-made tools to those who are blind or with low vision. This pertains to those enrolled in the USABA Sport Ambassador program.</p>

<p>Google highlights the expansion of support for product accessibility by announcing the opening of a discovery center in Zurich, Switzerland.  The company hopes to bring more attention to how it implements accessibility features into its products through this center. Zurich is the third and joins the likes of the London Discovery Center and Dublin.</p><p>Supporting companies and programs investing in computer science education leads Google to reveal its $5 million fund toward those places. The post states that the fund will deliver grants to programs utilizing Google&apos;s Blocky open-source library to create teaching material. Blocky features accessibility tools like keyboard navigation plugins alongside other "themes" to help the visually impaired, such as color blindness or low vision. These programs are said to support the education of students with disabilities who are interested in coding and computer science.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today is Global Accessibility Awareness Day, and Google is announcing a few new features that aim to make its products and services more accessible to all. There are eight in total, and these new accessibility features come on the heels of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-io-2024">Google I/O 2024</a>, the company&apos;s annual developer conference. At that event, Google shared that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Gemini AI will be used to improve TalkBack on Android</a>. Now, we know more about how Google is going to improve the accessibility of some of its other services, like Google Maps and Lookout. </p><p>The first is something called "Find mode," and it is a new functionality added to Lookout. For those unfamiliar, Lookout is an Android feature that helps people with low vision or blindness use their phone&apos;s camera to learn more about the world around them. Starting today in beta, Find mode will make it possible for users to search for specific objects or places via Lookout. Users can pick one of seven categories of places, like restrooms, and be informed of their direction and distance to the place. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5443px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UTDRqSpkHrVFHYvdNucjkR" name="Find-Mode-Beta-Lookout.jpg" alt="Find Mode in Lookout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTDRqSpkHrVFHYvdNucjkR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5443" height="3061" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is also adding a new option to Look to Speak, a feature that lets users trigger pre-written phrases to be spoken aloud with their eyes. Now, there&apos;s an alternative to text, as you can select emojis to communicate. The company says it&apos;s intended to make Look to Speak more accessible to people across languages, literacy challenges, and cognitive differences. </p><p>Project Gameface, an experimental software that lets users control their cursors with head motions and facial expressions, is rolling out to Android this week in another move. </p><p>Some of the bigger changes come to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a>, which will become more accessible for people with low vision or blindness. For starters, Lens in Google Maps now has a screen reader, so the app can tell you the name and details of locations around you. It&apos;s rolling out this month to both iOS and Android users of the Google Maps app. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hFR48buiix3bdGhANJNSJ6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-4-google-maps-02.jpg" alt="Viewing Google Maps on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4's smaller cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFR48buiix3bdGhANJNSJ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Maps also has more information about the accessibility of business and places you might want to visit. The company says it has info for 50 million places, and users can view accessibility details in the About tab for a place, like whether it has an accessible ramp or restroom. For theaters and showrooms, there is now an Auracast support option that can be displayed to show compatibility with Bluetooth hearing aids.</p><p>There are a few more accessibility features coming to Android, too. Project Relate allows users to create a custom speech recognition model that will help people with non-standard speech be better understood. Sound Notifications will inform you that an important household sound is happening, like a fire alarm, through push notifications, flashing lights, and vibrations. </p><p>These changes are all rolling out now or soon, and they should help make Android and other Google services more accessible. For Global Accessibility Awareness Day, other tech companies are also debuting new accessibility features, like Apple&apos;s Eye Tracking for iPhone and iPad. </p>

Ultimately, I would just go back to using foobar2000 or MediaMonkey and manually play back whatever album I want to listen to. Over the years, I used a variety of media players and organizers, but most of them ended up either being buggy or too convoluted that I often spent most of the time tinkering with the settings instead of listening to music.</p>

<p>So when I heard about Roon, I figured it might just be the solution I was looking for. I was skeptical of the service initially; it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://account.roon.app/en/create">costs $15 a month</a>, $129 annually, or you can get a lifetime license by shelling out $829 — I thought that was an absurd amount of cash for what is basically a glorified music player.</p><p>Roon isn&apos;t a music streaming service; it is instead designed to work with the music you already have, so if you don&apos;t have a sizeable offline music collection, you won&apos;t get much use out of the software. As a high-level overview, Roon is a music management service that organizes your media library, and it easily lets you stream content to connected devices, including Cast-enabled products.</p><p>As the pricing suggests, the service is clearly aimed at enthusiasts, and it has a lot of prerequisites. You need to set it up on a NAS server, and an SSD is mandatory — it isn&apos;t designed to be run on mechanical HDDs. You don&apos;t need to store your music library on an SSD; that can still be on a regular HDD, but Roon&apos;s database needs to be installed on an SSD. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5oT8ANp3vRSkXBPtuSjrqA" name="moondrop-miad01-5.jpg" alt="Moondrop MIAD01 next to Venus headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5oT8ANp3vRSkXBPtuSjrqA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After you configure the software and point it to your music library, it does the rest: cataloging your music library, sorting albums and bands into categories, adding metadata, classifying music into genres, and so much more. What I like about Roon is the detailed information you get on each artist; it&apos;s how I found out that Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk made an orchestral score called Mythologies (which is brilliant).</p><p>Another nifty trick is that Roon doesn&apos;t change any of the file metadata itself — it just creates an overlay based on the albums in your library, and that again is markedly different to how other media players work. But the best part about the service is that it removes a lot of the friction involved in maintaining a music library, and that alone justifies the asking price.</p><p>There are plenty of other niceties: if you use Tidal, Qobuz, or KKBox, you can link these services via Roon, and it creates a seamless blend of online and local streaming that just makes a lot of sense. Roon uses a custom signal path to deliver bit-perfect audio, and the sound engine has a ton of useful additions, including a DSP engine, EQ, presets, and unique filters.</p>

<p>I use Roon with my Windows machine that&apos;s connected to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">Fiio K19 DAC</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">Audeze&apos;s MM-500 headset</a>, and it is a terrific combination. The service is great at discovering new music, but what I like best is that it makes playing music across various devices extremely easy; I have a lot of eclectic audio gear that&apos;s connected via Chromecast Audio and WiiM streamers, and Roon lets me select the device I want to cast to in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Roon Arc is a relatively recent addition that enables these features on the go, unlocking the ability to stream your local music library over the internet. What makes a greater difference in my use case is Roon Ready; this feature allows Roon to be integrated into network streamers and digital audio players, and I use it extensively with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m11s-review">Fiio M11S</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-r7-review">R7</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, the ease of use combined with the interface and detailed notes make Roon stand out from other media players. There is a high barrier to entry, but having used the service for just over 15 months, I can&apos;t see myself switching to anything else.</p>

Announced at Google I/O 2024, the update will focus on three key areas: Battery life improvements, new watch faces, and a horde of new fitness features. </p><p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a> added functionality like easier watch transfers, new apps, and a new Watch Face Format, Wear OS 5 seems to focus more on optimization, making your current Android watch last longer and plugging the gaps where the last OS fell short. </p><p>We&apos;ll explain every Wear OS 5 feature Google has revealed thus far, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> we expect to update to Wear OS 5, and everything else you need to know. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-wear-os-5-new-features"><span>Wear OS 5: New features</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:965px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.40%;"><img id="Ni8H2Z3G6qXkaiddZmdCaZ" name="Wear-OS-5-google-io-2024-screen-scaling.jpeg" alt="Different Wear OS 5 screens showing the words "From the world round, hello Google I/O '24!"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ni8H2Z3G6qXkaiddZmdCaZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="965" height="689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Wear OS 5's Jetpack Compose tool for developers </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces">Wear OS 5 announcement</a> described a long list of upcoming features. We may discover more feature updates when it launches, but this news gave us plenty to start with. </p><p>For starters, Wear OS 5 will have "performance improvements," such that "running a marathon consumes up to 20% less power." This may or may not be due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Hybrid Wear OS interface</a> relegating health sampling to the co-processor, or else other behind-the-scenes changes. </p><p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/watch-face-format-for-future-wear-os-releases">Watch Face Format</a> introduced in Wear OS 4 will also add new "Flavors." Users choosing a watch face will also be able to pick between different colors and complications for each watch face, including some new complications like "Goal progress" that show your percentage completion towards a goal like 10,000 steps. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YvBWR53dEmxCTSjK6KNGxf" name="wear-os-5-watch-face-flavors.jpeg" alt="New Wear OS 5 watch face Flavors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YvBWR53dEmxCTSjK6KNGxf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1488" height="837" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google will make this new XML WFF the default option for Wear OS 5, restricting uploads of other formats like AndroidX starting in early 2025. Your old watch faces will still work and receive updates, but won&apos;t get access to new complications. </p><p>Wear OS developers will find other backend changes that will hopefully make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-apps">Wear OS apps</a> more user-friendly and dynamic. In particular, Google says these apps will "ensure your app works optimally across the range of device sizes and font scales." Now that you can find Android watch displays anywhere from 1 to 1.5 inches, devs need to make their apps look good across the board. </p>

<p>On the fitness side, the Wear OS background system for tracking data (Android Health) is getting new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-interview-how-fix-running-form">running form measurements</a>: Ground Contact Time, Stride Length, Vertical Oscillation, and Vertical Ratio. Fitness apps will have the option to share data like this to and from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> in the background for the first time, as well as pull data from your entire workout history — not just the last month.</p><p>Wear OS 5 watches will support "debounced goals," which is a fancy way of saying athletes can set a workout goal like "keep my heart rate between 130–160bpm for 30 minutes" and have the watch warn them after a short delay if they fall out of range. At the moment, Wear OS 4 watches buzz your watch the moment you&apos;re out of range, leading to false positives and annoyed runners. </p>

<p>Samsung has yet to reveal many concrete facts about One UI 6 Watch. A Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wear-os-5-software-testing-spotted">Wear OS 5 test build</a> was spotted in early May, but we don&apos;t know any specifics except that it&apos;ll be based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and arrive alongside the Galaxy Watch 7 this summer. </p><p>We do know Samsung, like Google, will focus on fitness updates. This January, Samsung revealed its "My Vitality Score" update arriving to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> this summer. It&apos;ll combine your sleep, activity, heart rate, and HRV data to determine your energy level and readiness to work out. </p><p>Plus, Samsung will generate "Booster cards" that "provide insight into the &apos;why&apos; behind your health readings,"</p><p>This data doesn&apos;t <em>only</em> apply to Wear OS 5 since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> will create this data too, and you can see it all on your smartphone. But we assume One UI 6 Watch will make your Vitality Score or Booster Cards visible on the watch as Tiles or watch face complications.</p>

<p>Google promises that Wear OS 5 will launch "later this year," meaning sometime in 2024. It has yet to promise a specific release date. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/versions/5" target="_blank"><strong>Wear OS 5 developer preview</strong></a> went live on May 15. </p><p>Samsung typically launches its One UI Watch spinoff of Wear OS in the summer alongside the latest Galaxy Watch. Wear OS 3 and 4 arrived in August 2021 and 2023, respectively, though only on Samsung watches. We suspect Wear OS 5 will roll out alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> in <strong>August 2024</strong>.</p><p>However, the "stock" version of Wear OS 5 won&apos;t arrive until <strong>October 2024</strong>, when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> launches. </p><p>Last-gen models will likely receive the update soon after the newer models; last year, the first Pixel Watch received Wear OS 4 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-4-update">five days after</a> the Pixel Watch 2 launch, while the Galaxy Watch 5 got it a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-receives-one-ui-5-watch-wear-os-4">couple of weeks</a> after the Watch 6. </p><p>Outside of Google and Samsung, the other Wear OS brands don&apos;t have a public update schedule. Some companies take months, if not years, before updating their watches to new versions. Mobvoi, for example, is still working on jumping its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">Ticwatch Pro 5</a> series to Wear OS 4, so Wear OS 5 could be a ways off for some, if it arrives at all.</p>

<p>These are the current Wear OS watches confirmed to receive the update, plus our best guess of the release month:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 4</strong> (August)</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 5</strong> (August)</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 6</strong> (August)</li><li><strong>Google Pixel Watch</strong> (October)</li><li><strong>Google Pixel Watch 2</strong> (October)</li><li><strong>OnePlus Watch 2</strong> (Unknown)</li></ul>
<p>In addition, the upcoming Galaxy Watch 7 and Pixel Watch 3 should launch with Wear OS 5.</p><p>Samsung watches will get four major Wear OS updates, so the Galaxy Watch 4 should get one more update in 2025 after Wear OS 5. Google promises three years of OS updates, so Wear OS 5 could be the Pixel Watch 1&apos;s last feature update.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 2 has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-how-many-updates">two guaranteed OS updates</a>; we can hope for a speedy Wear OS 5 update this fall, but have no precedent to compare against. </p><p>As for watches currently running Wear OS 3.5 like the Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-announced">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>, we believe they&apos;ll receive Wear OS 4 but have no guarantees about Wear OS 5. </p>
