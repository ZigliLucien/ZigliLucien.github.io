                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I wrote an initial Google Pixel Watch 3 review following its September 10 launch. Based on two weeks of testing time for myself and two colleagues with their own Pixel Watch 3s, I called it "Stronger than ever" and rated it highly.</p><p>In the ensuing weeks, fellow editors Derrek Lee and Nick Sutrich didn't <em>need</em> to keep wearing the Pixel Watch 3; they had plenty of other watches from Samsung, Garmin, and others to wear instead. Derrek dealt with some glitches that I'll address in the software section, and both found it lacking for their gym workouts.</p><p>So, I think it says a lot that they're both still happily wearing the Pixel Watch 3 as their daily watch despite having so many other options. And while a couple of other Android Central staffers prefer Samsung or Amazfit, the Pixel Watch 3 is the most popular option.</p><p>This doesn't surprise me! Despite another six or more weeks of time with the Pixel Watch 3 45mm, my opinion hasn't changed. Its enlarged, brighter display makes it much more wearable than the tiny, thick-bordered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> ever was. It's fun and stylish, comfortably fast, longer-lasting than Google's spec sheet implies, and packed with new running software that I appreciate. It's not perfect, but it's improved in the areas it needed to.</p><p>Did Google do enough to dethrone the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watch</a> of the year? Samsung still has the edge in a few areas, but Google will keep its loyal followers because it didn't stand pat this year.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 launched on September 10. The Pixel Watch 3 41mm costs $349 / £349 / €399 / CA$479 / AU$579, or $449 / £449 / €499 / CA$599 / AU$749 with LTE support.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 45mm costs $399 / £399 / €449 / CA$549 / AU$669, or $499 / £499 / €549 / CA$669 / AU$839. Generally speaking, rivals like Apple or Samsung will charge $30 for a larger display or $50 for LTE support, making Google's upcharges a bit pricier.</p><p>Google sells the Pixel Watch 3 in 32 countries or territories, compared to 21 countries for the Pixel Watch 2; you can see the supported list at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/12652073?hl=en">Google Support</a>. Of this list, some countries can only buy the Wi-Fi version, including India.</p><p>With the Pixel Watch 3 4G/LTE version, you get two years of complimentary data, but only up to 500MB before data speeds are capped at 256KB/s until the 1GB max. You'll need to add the Watch 3 to your carrier to enable standalone voice calling and unlimited music streaming. Google Fi lets you do so for free, while most other carriers will charge a monthly fee before you can add your phone number to it. That same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/12652073?hl=en">Google Support link</a> shows a list of compatible carriers.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="suHaQRJGEKiVRo2T8mBHfn" name="google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-45mm-fitbit-quick-start-2.jpg" alt="Fitbit Quick Start workouts on Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/suHaQRJGEKiVRo2T8mBHfn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Wear OS 5 adapts each app or tile layout based on which Pixel Watch 3 size you choose </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 comes in 41mm and 45mm sizes with 1.27- and 1.43-inch AMOLED displays, respectively. A 0.16-inch gap may not seem significant, but it does boost the resolution from 384x384 to 456x456, and Google designed Wear OS 5 to reflow content to take advantage of extra space. You can see in the photo above how the 45mm Pixel Watch 3 (left) fits more icons than the 41mm (right), and that applies across apps and menus.</p><p>Most of the Android Central staff prefers the 45mm size. Andrew Myrick called the 41mm "too dainty" in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3 hands-on</a>, while Derrek Lee called the 45mm "a massive improvement" because of how much more data it can fit on screen. However, Nick Sutrich specifically asked for the 41mm because he grew accustomed to a smaller size, and he feels the 1.27-inch model has more than enough space without paying extra.</p><p>In my case, I still believe the Pixel Watch 3 45mm is worth the $50 surcharge. That extra space feels significant, and the 6g gap between both sizes is so small that I barely noticed any difference when trying on both models.</p><p>With the larger default band, it weighs 69g/2.43oz, slightly heavier than a Galaxy Watch 7 but still lighter than other brands that use a steel bezel. Its rounded edge doesn't just look chic; it also has a comfort benefit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RtPaYtVQpJvqrTMengjTnQ" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-haptic-crown" alt="Close-up of the Google Pixel Watch 3 crown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RtPaYtVQpJvqrTMengjTnQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google brought back the haptic crown for the Pixel Watch 3. Not everyone likes crowns, but I'd argue most people would choose a crown over the Galaxy Watch 7's compromise of a digital bezel.</p><p>Google didn't announce any changes to the crown with this generation. Derrek and Nick both think it <em>was</em> slightly changed and have different opinions on its quality. Derrek said the crown haptics "are not as...satisfying, like they've been downgraded," while Nick praised the crown as being subtly better than the Watch 2's.</p><p>As the tiebreaker, I find that it scrolls smoothly and has a satisfying haptic feel as you scroll through apps and menus. But your opinion may vary from mine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="zaAk7gqKLE5HJtAN84akhh" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Index-Bold-watch-face" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting on a rock with the Index Bold watch face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zaAk7gqKLE5HJtAN84akhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whichever size you choose, the Pixel Watch 3 display is the star of the show. It doubles the brightness (1,000 to 2,000 nits) and refresh rate (30Hz to 60Hz) while shrinking the Pixel Watch 2's thick-bordered display by 16% so that it now reaches the edge where the display begins to curve.</p><p>Google always hid the border with how Wear OS used black space around text, but I still found the Pixel Watch 2 display made it look a bit too cheap for my liking. Google fixed that here, and the Watch 3 is more attractive for it.</p><p>Though I've grown accustomed to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>'s vivid 3,000-nit brightness, the Pixel Watch 3 is bright enough to match Apple and Samsung's mainline watches and is perfectly readable in direct sunlight (if slightly duller).</p><p>Screen transitions are smoother, but it doesn't always stay at 60Hz; Google says it can also dip as low as 1Hz for certain functions like AOD, which is one factor for why the Watch 3 lasts longer than the Watch 2 (see the next section).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="to9FczSGrrjWUQjNfCZHAm" name="google-pixel-watch-3-metal-link-band-close-up-1.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 with Metal Link Band Close-up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/to9FczSGrrjWUQjNfCZHAm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The unavoidable downside to Google's edge-to-edge design is its lack of ruggedness. You won't find MIL-STD-810H protection like the Galaxy Watch 7 has; without a metal side to take the brunt, falling or bumping into a wall is riskier. I also wish the Pixel Watch 3 had used sapphire glass instead of Gorilla Glass 5, which is at least good enough to prevent basic scratches. I recommend buying a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-screen-protectors">screen protector</a> anyway.</p><p>Google also didn't focus on repairability when designing the Pixel Watch 3. If it has any issues under warranty, Google will send you a new one. It responded to the controversy by saying it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-repairability-leniency-pixel-watch-report">"thinking about" making future Pixel Watch designs repairable</a> to prevent e-waste, but that won't apply until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> or later.</p><p>Still, this is all worst-case scenario stuff. I've yet to damage any smartwatch over years of a casually active lifestyle. The Pixel Watch 3 won't be rugged enough for serious outdoorsmen or construction workers, but everyone else should be fine. I think more people will prefer the Pixel Watch 3's looks to the Galaxy Watch 7's.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tvsrXiPbmkKdKzh8of4WQh" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-proprietary-band-adapter" alt="The proprietary band connector on the Google Pixel Watch 3 and its default Active strap" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tvsrXiPbmkKdKzh8of4WQh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The default Active band is made of comfortable fluoroelastomer. The snap-and-tuck design can tug at arm hair a bit, but once it's secured, there's no worry about wobbling during workouts like you sometimes get with lug watches. The material wicks sweat and feels nice for all-day wear.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 uses a proprietary band connector; your old Pixel Watch 2 bands will carry over if you buy the Pixel Watch 3 41mm but you'll need new straps for the 45mm. You insert bands into the connector and then slide them into place; with practice, you can do it quickly, but in most cases it takes me a minute or two of fruitless shoving before it gets in there.</p><p>Our senior accessories editor, Namerah Saud Fatmi, wrote that first-party Google bands are expensive, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/third-pixel-watch-still-doesnt-have-good-third-party-bands" target="_blank">third-party Pixel Watch band selection is lackluster</a>. Spigen and Caseology have a few options, but because of a lack of demand, their selection is much smaller than their Apple and Galaxy Watch collections. She did create a guide on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-bands">best Pixel Watch 3 bands</a>, but the selection is pretty small.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6KK5ZakhZd9zw3z8K2nKML" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-charging.jpeg" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3, charging close to 100%" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6KK5ZakhZd9zw3z8K2nKML.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In its official product tech specs, Google says the Pixel Watch 3 lasts "Up to 24 hours with always-on display" or "Up to 36 hours with Battery Saver mode," with 300mAh or 425mAh capacity for the 41mm and 45mm models, respectively.</p><p>After months of testing, it's clear Google is selling itself short. I consistently get up to 48 hours with AOD active, including one or two GPS-tracked workouts, regular notifications, and two nights of sleep tracking with all sensors active — though sometimes it doesn't quite hit two days.</p><p>Derrek, who also has the 45mm watch, says he's "actually pleased with battery life. It lasts longer than I expected it would, although still shorter than I would like." And Nick, who uses the 41mm watch, says it lasts longer than his Pixel Watch 2 did, though not as long as ours. I suspect this is thanks in part to the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces">Wear OS 5 efficiency updates</a>, particularly the new XML watch face format and the new Hybrid Interface using less energy for tracking health and workout data.</p><p>Of course, I agree with Derrek that the Pixel Watch 3 could last longer. Other Wear OS watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> (500mAh) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a> (628mAh) last about 72–100 hours, though they weigh more and fall short in other areas.</p><p>Charging speed got a slight revamp compared to the Pixel Watch 2. The smaller size takes 15 minutes less to hit 100%, while the 45mm takes five minutes longer but is quicker to hit 50%. One post-launch update I <em>really</em> appreciate is Google now sends your phone a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-fully-charged-notifications-are-finally-rolling-out-widely">fully-charged notification</a> when it hits 100%, so you don't have to worry about draining your battery capacity over time with overcharging.</p>

<p>If you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-vs-pixel-watch-2">Pixel Watch 3 vs. Watch 2</a>, you'll find the hardware isn't all that different. It uses the same 4nm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a> SoC from 2022 with four cores clocked at 1.7GHz, plus a Cortex M33 co-processor for background tasks. Both watches have 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, 306mAh capacity (for the smaller version), 5ATM water resistance, and nearly all of the same health sensors.</p><p>Does this really matter? On the one hand, the Pixel Watch 3 is a speedy device, rarely showing any lag during normal app tasks. On the other, I'm watching Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-wear-os-5-problems-force-pause">struggle to update older Pixel Watches to Wear OS 5</a>, and I wonder if this years-old chip has the legs to last three years with consistent support. But that's a future concern; for now, I'm happy with the Pixel Watch 3's performance.</p><p>Google did make some subtle quality-of-life upgrades this generation: Bluetooth 5.3 instead of 5.0, WiFi 5GHz in addition to 2.4GHz, and new Ultra Wideband support. The Watch 3 uses less battery and has a stronger connection when communicating with your phone; it downloads apps much faster than before; and with UWB, you'll unlock some niche tools like unlocking your Pixel phone or certain cars.</p>

<p>Google's big health sensor upgrades came last generation. It stole <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a> sensors like the multi-path optical HR sensor with irregular heart rhythm warnings, electrical skin conductance (cEDA) for continuous body response, and skin temperature.</p><p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 brings all of these insights back, but nothing new except for behind-the-scenes algorithmic changes to heart rate data to make it the "most accurate heart rate for running" in its lineup. We'll analyze that claim in the next section.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T7ZTTjGYfLJqgLNv4Cjk88" name="fitbit-premium-sleep-tracking.jpg" alt="Fitbit app showing a sleep score summary, HRV, breathing rate, blood oxygen, skin temperature, and other data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T7ZTTjGYfLJqgLNv4Cjk88.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even though I remain frustrated that Google has essentially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">killed Fitbit as a hardware brand</a>, I'll admit that it was smart of Google to steal Fitbit's sensors and software for its lineup, because it leaves every other brand struggling to close the gap for health insights. Google didn't <em>need</em> to give the Watch 3 new health sensors (yet).</p><p>With my usual disclaimer that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">I hate wearing a smartwatch at night</a>, I've managed to wear the Pixel Watch 3 enough to get a sense of its sleep-tracking accuracy. Its sleep stages and awake periods match my actual sleep patterns, and its health metrics like breathing rate, HRV, SpO2, and skin temperature focus more on averages and variation than on trying to shame or stress you out with "abnormal" data compared to other people.</p><p>The body response and stress management data seems much more responsive to actual stress and agitation than most watches relying solely on HRV. And while I have no signs of AFib issues, I like that it automatically and passively tests for irregular rhythm and high/low HR data, without restricting the results like Samsung does with its Galaxy-only Health Monitor app.</p><p>The same applies to the Loss of Pulse feature, which will auto-dial emergency services in response to cardiac arrest; while other brands have fall detection, this is a welcome bit of reassurance for elderly buyers.</p>

<p>Google claims the Pixel Watch 3 has the "most accurate heart rate for running" compared to past Pixel Watches. Unfortunately, Google didn't add dual-band GPS to it, as Samsung did with the Galaxy Watch 7. Some GPS-only watches are more accurate than others, but with Google emphasizing its new Fitbit running tools, I had to put both metrics to the test.</p><p>During my initial review window, I took the Pixel Watch 3 out for one normal 10K run, one track workout, and two rucks (aka hiking with weights). Here's what I learned, starting with heart rate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.80%;"><img id="jeakeSWkwfQEv3s3gdm68L" name="pixel-watch-3-10k-run-heart-rate-test.jpeg" alt="A heart rate chart showing results from the Pixel Watch 3 and a COROS Heart Rate Monitor connected to the Garmin Forerunner 965." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jeakeSWkwfQEv3s3gdm68L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1680" height="887" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For a normal run, the Google Pixel Watch 3 does pretty well for a wrist-based optical HR sensor. It stayed within 1 beat per minute (bpm) of my COROS arm band at most points. Most wrist-based sensors struggle with light artifacts and have difficulty with sudden HR changes, but Google's algorithm has it step-for-step. Still, its 158 bpm average was one short of both COROS and my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Polar Vantage V3</a>, which became a trend.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.77%;"><img id="mmDTDkBzUCwYu5t4ZDczVL" name="pixel-watch-3-10m-hike-heart-rate-test.jpeg" alt="A heart rate chart showing results from the Pixel Watch 3 and a COROS Heart Rate Monitor connected to the Garmin Forerunner 965." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mmDTDkBzUCwYu5t4ZDczVL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1680" height="853" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Across my 10-mile ruck with plenty of hills and valleys, it showed similar responsiveness, immediately catching my heart rate changes. At the same time, the final bpm average was three short of COROS (134 vs. 131); a few days prior, I did a 6-mile ruck, and there was a similar HR average gap between COROS and Google (135 vs. 132).</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 continues tracking HR when you pause, whereas other brands tend to freeze the reading until you restart. That's why the Pixel Watch 3 workout is slightly longer in the charts above: I didn't realize I was still "working out." That may be one contributing factor to the lower HR average.</p><p>Finally, my track workout was a bit of a mixed bag. For each hard lap, Google stayed on track up to about 180 bpm, only to lag behind the COROS band by about 3–5 bpm for 30-second stretches before it started to catch up. For what it's worth, most mainstream watches I've tested struggle with anaerobic tracking, including the Galaxy Watch Ultra, so this isn't a specific Pixel Watch 3 problem.</p>

<p>Google's GPS-only accuracy was a bit of a mess, which I feared but expected. You can see in the screenshots above how Google (orange) throws my position all over the place, especially in the wild first example. Most commonly, it's parallel to Garmin's dual-band GPS but significantly off to the side, which leads to losing or gaining distance artificially on turns. After a 10K, it lost about eight-hundredths of a mile, which is pretty standard for a GPS-only watch.</p><p>For hiking, the wobbly tracking led to massive overestimates of how far I'd hiked. The line itself wasn't <em>that</em> far off, but on my route, a stray line suggested I was climbing off-trail up hills or down steep cliffs. Where Garmin matched my AllTrails route, the Pixel Watch 3 added an extra 0.25mi and 0.4mi to my 6-mile and 10-mile hikes, respectively.</p>

<p>Since the initial review, I've taken the Pixel Watch 3 out for a few more running tests, and not much has changed. One run surprised me because the Pixel Watch 3 and Garmin Forerunner 965 were within 50 yards of one another after a 10K run; when I analyzed the GPS maps, however, it's clear that Google lucked into that result based on all the meandering lines whenever it lost the signal. And the HR average was (once again) 1bpm short of COROS' total.</p><p>Overall, I'd give the Pixel Watch 3 a B for heart rate accuracy — good enough for general calorie and training load data, but not for serious athletes — and a C average for GPS data. It's a shame, because the new Fitbit running software is a fantastic pivot (if not quite "A" worthy).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JFEinvHnr69Bpsq56CYyM8" name="fitbit-premium-create-running-workout.jpg" alt="Fitbit app screenshots showing how to create a run workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JFEinvHnr69Bpsq56CYyM8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Creating running workouts is very easy once you get the hang of it, with criteria like distance or calories burned. My personal favorite is the Time Trial workout where you set a distance and time to finish it, which adds a sense of urgency. You <em>can</em> make workouts on the watch in a pinch, but adding targets like pace or heart rate zone — or deleting intervals — is far easier in the mobile Fitbit app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="i5sqswBcpi6rvm8iUKs6b8" name="fitbit-premium-run-analysis.jpg" alt="Fitbit post-run analysis showing heart rate zones, running form analysis, GPS map, and other data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i5sqswBcpi6rvm8iUKs6b8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fitbit provides a decent amount of post-run data, including running form analysis, heart rate zones, and elevation gain. It <em>doesn't</em> have some popular tools like running power, aerobic/anaerobic training effect, or sweat loss, but it's more than enough for casual runners.</p><p>I'm also a fan of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Fitbit Cardio Load</a> system, which puts more emphasis on weekly and monthly progress than trying to hit Active Zone Minutes every day (especially when you're burned out from a hard workout). It's particularly cool how it'll track your training load from any task where your heart rate is elevated or you get steps, not just tracked workouts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PSsjoRfekDspxxm3YQmHn8" name="fitbit-premium-cardio-load-and-daily-readiness.jpg" alt="Fitbit app screenshots showing the user's daily readiness and cardio load scores." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PSsjoRfekDspxxm3YQmHn8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparing its training load against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">other brands' training load</a>, Fitbit puts more stock on a workout's length than its intensity. I only got a 37 cardio load for six hard laps at the track at a 170 bpm average, then 30 for my 30-minute walk home; Garmin gave me over 200 for the track workout, but maybe a 10 for the walk. For my ten-mile hike with 2,300 feet climbed and 20lb. on my back, Google tracked a 230 cardio load when Garmin gave me a paltry 110.</p><p>In other words, I'd say that Cardio Load, despite its name, is actually a better indicator of my <em>muscular</em> soreness than Garmin, while Garmin puts more stock on peak/anaerobic effort and scoffs at low-intensity workouts. You can decide which works better for you!</p><p>Fitbit's other big innovation is "Target Load," suggesting how much Cardio Load you should get on a given day based on your daily readiness and past workouts. After a week of sleeping, Fitbit began to show my Daily Readiness, and it seemed fairly accurate to how I was actually feeling in terms of tiredness and soreness.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZzLFs2pE7rcQ8wS9GA9FDh" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-heart-rate" alt="The heart rate tile on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZzLFs2pE7rcQ8wS9GA9FDh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, the Pixel Watch 3 makes a decently strong showing on the fitness front, but I have some fairly predictable requests for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>: It needs to have dual-band GPS, extra LEDs to add better HR hardware on top of the excellent algorithm, and an evolving fitness focus beyond running.</p><p>Specifically, since Wear OS 5 added offline maps for casual navigation, the next step is for Wear OS 6 to allow people to make and share GPX courses via Google Maps that you can download to your watch; it would intrude directly on Garmin's territory with hikers, giving them maps and trailheads in areas with no or poor signal that would leave you lost or burning battery to orient yourself.</p><p>Cycling is another obvious area where Apple and Samsung have already focused efforts on their watches. And I know Nick and Derrek don't like how basic many non-running workouts are. Other watches like Garmin and Amazfit will track your gym reps automatically or manually, either moving to the next set based on your movements or pressing a button. Google just tracks things like calories and time, leaving plenty of room for growth.</p>

<p>Google added some intriguing new software tools to the Pixel Watch 3. Covering each would be an article in itself, so I'll simply summarize the list and then highlight my favorites.</p><p><strong>New Pixel Watch 3 software features: </strong>Morning Brief, Google TV remote controls, Nest Camera controls, Google Home tile, offline Google Maps, Call Assist holds, Ultra Wideband watch unlock, Pixel Recorder tile, Submersion detection, Loss of Pulse, Auto Bedtime mode.</p><p>Of these, several require other Google or smart home devices, like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-review">Nest Doorbell</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">Chromecast with Google TV</a>. In particular, the UWB unlock feature only works with the Pixel 7/8/9 Pro models, the Pixel Recorder app saves on the watch but can only upload recordings to Pixels, and the Hold for Me feature is Pixel-exclusive, too.</p><p>Our Pixel Watch 2 reviewer specifically praised the fact that "Google didn't hold back certain features if you have a non-Pixel phone," so he might find this shift disappointing. Even though I use a Samsung phone and couldn't test some of these tools, I didn't necessarily mind because I liked what I <em>could</em> test or see.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SJjsSKMQGc6UuycG4WeaB7" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-nest-cam-live-feed.jpeg" alt="Nest Doorbell live feed on the Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SJjsSKMQGc6UuycG4WeaB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't have a Nest Cam, but Nick Sutrich tested the feature for me, finding it almost as responsive as checking the livestreams on his phone (Bluetooth adds a slight delay). He loves the ease of checking who's there at any time in case his phone isn't on hand.</p><p>Morning Brief is very similar to the Garmin Morning Report I'm used to. It starts out pretty simple with sleep insights, weather, exercise progress, and warnings about out-of-range health metrics. With enough sleep tracking, you'll start to see daily readiness, target load, and a recommended workout. It's all quite useful and well summarized, and I only wish you could <em>recheck</em> your brief later — but it vanishes once you're done.</p><p>I don't have much of a smart home, but I do find I'm more apt to play with my smart lights now that I can access them quickly in the Google Home tile instead of pulling out my phone. As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv" target="_blank">Google TV</a>, it's less convenient than simply using your remote control but it does come in handy in case you lose it.</p>

<p>While <em>I've</em> had no trouble with Pixel Watch 3 software, my colleague Derrek had his Watch 3 crash during a transfer to a new phone, and he had to go through a complicated factory reset to get it to work again. He also complained that his Fitbit workout data doesn't always sync properly and won't show up in the app, and while the problem hasn't happened as often recently, he's still seeing complaints about it on Reddit.</p><p>More generally, I do find it worrying that Google had to roll back its Wear OS 5 update on older Pixel Watches. That may not affect the Watch 3 directly, but I wonder if Google will take a long time to update it to Wear OS 6 or 7 down the road, maybe due to the older chipset. The next Pixel Watch will probably have a more pronounced NPU for AI functions, and it's possible the Pixel Watch 3 will be left behind for on-wrist Gemini tricks.</p><p>For now, though, the Pixel Watch 3 is a very strong Wear OS option; not counting Samsung's One UI Watch, Google's UI always feels more polished and straightforward to use than third-party brands' skins.</p>

<p>The immediate, obvious Pixel Watch 3 competitor is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. We have a full <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Pixel Watch 3 vs. Galaxy Watch 7 guide</a> that exhaustively covers every difference, but here are the main points:</p>
<ul><li>The Galaxy Watch 7 displays are slightly bigger and have sapphire glass, plus the same brightness and refresh rate.</li><li>Samsung relies on its touch bezel instead of a dedicated crown, which works well enough but isn't quite as precise.</li><li>Samsung has a newer 3nm Exynos chip that's clocked lower but has five cores instead of four; performance is pretty comparable, honestly, but Samsung has a slight efficiency edge, so you'll get more hours out of it.</li><li>The Galaxy Watch 7 has dual-band GPS tracking for better accuracy.</li><li>Both run Wear OS 5, but Samsung offers four years of updates instead of three.</li></ul>
<p>Of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> to consider, we'll point you to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> if you're especially concerned about battery life. It's rated to last three or four days per charge and will get a couple of Wear OS updates, though fewer than Google offers. The software isn't quite as polished as Google's, especially for health and fitness, but it's more efficient; it's more classically stylish, as well as much heavier.</p><p>If you're considering the Pixel Watch 3 for its health or running features, you could always consider the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a>, which has the same health sensors and will get the same cardio load tracking. It's not nearly as smart of a watch, but it lasts six days instead of one-ish and does have a couple of Google apps. Otherwise, runners can look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Garmin Forerunner 265</a>, another fitness watch with weeks of battery life that lacks sophisticated apps but has in-depth training load and suggested workouts without needing a subscription.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Google Pixel Watch 3 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You like your Pixel Watch 1/2 but really want a better or larger display.</li><li>You have a Pixel phone and want the best smartwatch integration for features like call screening.</li><li>You're an athlete excited by the combination of health tracking, workout building, and cardio load.</li><li>You're a Wear OS person who cares more about style than durability.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy the Google Pixel Watch 3 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a smartwatch that consistently lasts more than a couple of days.</li><li>You need dual-band GPS for more dependable results.</li><li>You can hold out a year for the Pixel Watch 4's upgrades</li></ul>
<p>The first Pixel Watch took years to arrive, and it showed with its dated CPU and limited feature set. It fixed a ton with the Pixel Watch 2 by adding a Snapdragon chip and a ton of Fitbit sensors, but the display still felt like the Achilles heel.</p><p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 is Google's strongest wearable entry yet. It's certainly not perfect, and the company still has a way to go in key areas. I personally have a hard time getting past the simple fact that they didn't add dual-band GPS for a watch with so much emphasis on running software. But none of its flaws are deal-breakers.</p><p>While the Galaxy Watch 7 has an objective edge over the Pixel Watch 3 in a few ways, no one can deny that Google's design just <em>looks better</em>. Style matters for a smartwatch, and I could see plenty of Android fans picking the Pixel Watch 3 for that reason alone.</p>

It comes with six months of Fitbit Premium, but most of its best new tools like Daily Readiness, Cardio Load, Target Load, and custom workouts don't require a subscription. It launches with Wear OS 5 and should receive Wear OS 8 in 2027. Google is racing to catch up with Samsung for wearables, and the Pixel Watch 3 proves that it's closing the gap.</p></p>

Of course, there are plenty of other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/dont-wait-for-black-friday-best-buy-just-launched-a-huge-sale-on-motorola-phones">early Black Friday Motorola deals</a> to consider, but if you had your eye on the Edge (2024), this is a great opportunity.</p>

This Motorola phone is a pretty basic offering from the company, though it also features a good-looking overall design with an anti-slip vegan leather back and a vivid AMOLED display.

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>battery life is a top priority for your phone needs; you've liked other Motorola phones with Hello UI; you need a phone with 256GB of storage.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you need a phone with super-powerful performance; you'd rather spend a little more money on a better set of cameras; you prefer a phone with several years of software updates.</p><p>This year's Motorola Edge effort was nothing too groundbreaking, but it's got a few things that people like. For one, the 6.6-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate is great, and it's also fairly easy on the eyes compared to some competitors around this price.</p><p>This phone comes with 256GB of storage, 68W charging speeds, and over a day of battery life. Still, for each upside, there are also a couple of downsides that may or may not matter to you.</p><p>The Edge only comes with two years of software updates, unlike many competitors, which offer four or more. Additionally, performance is lacking, as backed by the 2.4GHz Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor, and the cameras are simply nothing to write home about.</p><p>All in all, the 2024 Motorola Edge is a decent effort for the cost, especially if you like the premium-feeling design and vegan leather backing. Those in need of a peak-level performance phone, however, will likely not be satisfied with the Motorola Edge—or most other phones at this price level.</p><p>You can also find several of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phones</a> across a range of prices, if you'd rather go in a different direction.</p>

<hr>
<p>Polar is launching a new sporty smartwatch that builds on its stylish craft with the robustness you'd expect from a fitness partner.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polar.com/blog/introducing-polar-vantage-m3/">a press release</a>, Polar debuted the Vantage M3 smartwatch, a sporty alternate following the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Vantage V3</a>. The M3 features a 1.28-inch AMOLED display to replace Polar's old MIP screen. The company states this upgraded touchscreen should provide users with a more vibrant screen that retains its clarity in outdoor conditions. Users can also enable the M3's AOD (always-on display mode) for workout stats at a glance.</p><p>Gorilla Glass protects the M3's display for an added layer of protection against nicks and scratches.</p><p>The post reiterates the 2023 launch of the Polar Elixir biosensor, which is featured on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-grit-x2-pro-launch">the Grit X2 Pro</a>. The company states consumers interested in this "next-gen" sensor fusion platform can experience it on its sporty M3. The back of the device is where the magic happens as the M3 catalogs your heart rate with its 4th-gen OHR sensor. SpO2 levels are made readily available alongside skin temperature readings.</p><p>Additionally, Polar states users have an on-wrist ECG by placing a finger on the M3's button.

<hr>
<p>The world of e-readers expands as Boox debuts a trio of new ePaper devices for book lovers.</p><p>Today (Oct 23), the company published a press release highlighting three e-readers, beginning with the 2024 Palma 2. Boox states the pocket-sized Palma 2 is a device for a "mindful lifestyle." Users will find the same 6.13-inch  300 PPI E Ink Carta 1200 as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">its predecessor</a> from 2023.</p><p>The Palma 2 features Boox Super Refresh technology, which makes for a quicker device. Additionally, the company implemented an octa-core CPU to help users easily manage "multiple tasks." The latest phone-sized reader delivers Android 13 out of the box. It even comes pre-installed with the Google Play Store, meaning users can grab some of their favorite apps.</p><p>Boox states the Palma 2 offers several tools to help make reading more memorable for study and reflection. The device comes with NeoReader, a native Boox reading app that lets users highlight text, annotate, and translate. Boox adds users will also find the Boox AI assistant to help create a list or explain what a book sentence could mean.</p><p>Another highlight of the Palma 2 is the addition of a fingerprint reader. Boox states the fingerprint scanner is woven into the power button for an extra layer of security.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="r6RE2FLqNMZa5Afv6A663f" name="boox-palma-2-white-solo-photo" alt="The Boox Palma 2 in white." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6RE2FLqNMZa5Afv6A663f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Boox)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The "smart button" on the side of the Palma 2 lets users assign different functions to it as a shortcut. Boox states the button works in three ways: short press, long press, and double tap. Users can assign its screenshot feature or surface its AI by assigning them to one of the three functions for easy use. "Flexible widgets" and gestures make navigating the Palma 2 seamless when on the go.</p><p>Whether you're downloading a few apps or storing books, the Palma 2 delivers 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. Moreover, users can toss in a microSD card for more room.</p><p>Like the 2023 edition, the Palma 2 contains a "durable" 3,950mAh battery with a USB-C charging port. The small phone-like device can repel "unexpected spills and splashes."</p><p>Consumers will find Boox Palma 2 in white and black. The device is available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/products/palma2">for pre-order</a> today (Oct 23) for $279. Boox adds that there are a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/products/palma2#:~:text=Elegance%20Encased%2C%20Built%20for%20Versatility">flip-fold cases</a> for aesthetic and protective purposes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bVvjtaA2eWvoWXF56RQXtm" name="boox-note-air4-c-solo-example" alt="The Boox Note Air4 C." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bVvjtaA2eWvoWXF56RQXtm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Boox)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Following the Palma 2 is the company's Note Air4 C. According to the post, the Note Air4 C delivers an "improved" 10.3-inch color ePaper display over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/products/noteair3?srsltid=AfmBOooVwZImKxk_INRIGmQDMFKkzfy4xhKKBPQwDWu_aW2aqLkMgIrq">the Note Air3 C</a>. Boox states it's worked to enhance the tablet's Kaleido 3 color e-ink screen so it can deliver "brighter" backgrounds, contrast for eye comfort, and encourage an "engaging visual experience."  The Note Air4 C's display features a faster refresh rate and response time when tapping or writing.</p><p>The Note Air4 C's design remains close to its predecessor. Boox highlights the tablet's 5.8mm profile and light 420g weight.</p><p>With creativity at its core, the Note Air4 C lets artists pick between templates, brushes, layers, and AI-backed "Smart Scribe" tools. Boox added a new "Shape" tool for those looking to clean up their artwork, which may pair well with its lasso tool for moving design elements. Elsewhere, users can make notes on their artwork and quickly "link" them all with the new link tool.</p><p>The Note Air4 C's Android 13 OS and the octa-core CPU help with most of the heavy lifting. Boox states it has improved the CPU performance of the tablet by ~50% and its implementation of BSR technology aids its display's refresh rate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b8LiQJsjEUmh4BRWKRp9G6" name="boox-palma-2-note-air4-c-note-max-example" alt="An example of the Boox Palma 2, Note Air4 C, and the upcoming Note Max." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8LiQJsjEUmh4BRWKRp9G6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Boox)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Note Air4 C is also a good reading buddy as Boox states users will find preset appearance choices to "improve readability." Like the Palma 2, the Note Air4 C makes tools like highlighting, creating annotations, and more freely available when reading documents, newspapers, and books. Moreover, users can switch between light or dark modes when reading. Multitasking tools, such as split-screen, let users place a document on the left to read while scribbling notes on the right.</p><p>The post says the tablet's 6GB of RAM helps keep its multitasking smooth and responsive. Moreover, users will have 64GB of storage to store everything they need. The Note Air4 C provides a 3,700mAh battery.</p><p>Users can pre-order the Boox Note Air4 C for $499 on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/products/noteair4c">main website</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DHGDV8F8">Amazon</a>.</p><p>Lastly, Boox rounds out its announcement with a teaser for its A4 paper-sized Note Max. The device features a 13.3-inch, " ultra-crisp" Carta 1300 e-ink display. Boox states it crafted a sleek, "chic-style" shell for this larger device. What's more, the addition of a free-form front light helps with readability and focus.</p><p>The Note Max will arrive with a 2.4GHz octa-core CPU, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. Boox has not said when consumers can expect the Note Max to become available. More information will likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/products/notemax">come in the future</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>At the annual Qualcomm Snapdragon Summit, the company announced it would be supporting the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for eight years. That's great to see, but it doesn't mean what you're probably thinking it means.</p><p>It has to do with what type of support a chip maker needs to offer and what part a phone maker plays in how long your phone is kept up to date. The two things don't align the way we think.</p>
<p>When it comes to Android version updates, three parties need to work together to provide one for the phone in your hand. Google, of course, needs to take all the new code and changes to existing code, assemble it into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">specific target for building Android</a>, and test it. It's a lot of work, and a lot of other companies contribute — Android is not written by Google alone.</p><p>Once Google has something resembling a new version, phone makers start working with it. They will take the code and see how to integrate their changes without breaking anything, then assemble all of that into something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dreary-one-ui-7-beta-forum-update">they can test</a>.</p><p>Finally, the companies that make microprocessors, like Qualcomm and the Snapdragon chip, might need to support a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-z-what-kernel">Linux kernel</a> or low-level operating system changes. We also see plenty of patches and bug fixes from these companies, and if you ever look into what's inside a monthly Android security patch, you'll see companies like Qualcomm doing a lot of the work.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1463px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BYePTqNEqrQAXwCL7wFnE8" name="samsung galaxy s24 plus review hero image 1.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S24 Plus on a corner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BYePTqNEqrQAXwCL7wFnE8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1463" height="823" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a critical part of the chain because only Qualcomm can make changes to its Snapdragon chip. Google or Samsung might know what to do and even how to do it, but Qualcomm is the only company that can legally do the work because it owns the intellectual property being worked on. Snapdragon chips are not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-open-source-android-z">open source</a>, just like MediaTek, Apple, or even Google chips aren't. Those companies own that idea and the execution of it and don't share.</p><p>If the next version of Android or the next security update requires changes to the way the chip operates and Qualcomm doesn't want to do them, phones running unsupported chips won't be updated. Sometimes Google can work around it (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-nexus-7-2013-review">Nexus 7 </a>was a good example of Qualcomm not wanting to make necessary changes) but to work properly requires the chip maker's involvement.</p>
<p>None of this means that a phone maker <em>has</em> to do anything. You bought your phone with an expectation of the features it has today running as advertised. A case can be made that a company like Samsung has to deliver on that promise and fix anything that doesn't work properly, but anything new or updated is extra. That's why phone makers are quick to tell you about promises to update a phone for a certain amount of time: it's a feature that you're paying for.</p><p>Samsung doesn't have to promise seven years of support for its Galaxy S phones; it does it because it's a selling point. In a perfect world, once that promise is made, it has to be honored, but almost every phone maker has broken a promise or two along the way.</p><p>Here's where this all starts to sound more like public relations than a technical promise: every chip Qualcomm has ever made could be updated today if someone was willing to pay for it. If Google, LG, and Qualcomm wanted to, they could update the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-nexus-4-review" target="_blank">Nexus 4</a> to the point where the chip couldn't keep up. It would still build and flash to your phone without errors; it would just run really slowly and terribly.</p>

<p>I'm not privy to how much a company like Qualcomm charges for longer support life on one of its products, but I know that it's a negotiable part of the contract a phone maker enters when they buy millions of them. Qualcomm tells Samsung (for example) that the chip is supported for, let's say, four years. Samsung says it needs six years. Money changes hands, and six years of support is now included. This isn't free because supporting a chip costs money, and Qualcomm didn't get where it is today by giving things away. This is a big part of the reason the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidia-shield-tv-october-2024-update">NVIDIA Shield</a> has a legendary support lifetime. Nvidia is in charge of <em>everything</em>.</p><p>What I'm saying is that a phone maker could support your phone for eight years today if it wanted to. It could have supported the phone you bought five years ago for eight years. A phone maker has to juggle what's best for itself and what it can offer to us without losing money.</p><p>Eight years of support from Qualcomm is great and could lower the cost enough so that phone manufacturers start offering eight years of support on the phones, too. If it's feasible without adding too much to the phone's retail price, we just might see it. If nothing else, this level of support should mean that phones can see longer support when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-security-bulletin">security updates</a> and bug fixes, and that would be just as good!</p>

But the trend-setters continue to be the ones at the top; the ones that set benchmarks for how we interpret just how good such a feature could be.</p><p>The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds fit that mold, even if they first came to market in 2023. If dampening background noise is a big deal for you, these are worth serious consideration as the best in the business.</p>

<p>Bose <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-headphones-earbuds-launch">launched</a> the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds in September 2023 and they should be easy to find in retail or online. It&apos;s unlikely Bose will release a succeeding pair to these until more time has passed, so expect these to be the company&apos;s flagship earbuds for a while yet. They start out at $299, but look for the odd discount when it happens, rare as it may be. They&apos;re available in Black or White Smoke.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-what-s-good"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds: What's good</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XbngowG9aYbGAoEhg4yueL" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-wearing.jpg" alt="Side view wearing the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XbngowG9aYbGAoEhg4yueL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From a design standpoint, the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-ii-review">QuietComfort Earbuds II</a> clearly influence what this pair looks like. They won&apos;t be the smallest you&apos;ll find but improved comfort and stability mean they&apos;re not likely to fall out, either. I&apos;m pleasantly surprised at how well they hold up while riding my bike, and Bose helps by finding the best fit for your ears when going through the test in the Bose Music app.</p><p>A tighter seal is crucial to getting the best noise-cancelation and sound quality, so it may take a little trial and error to figure out what&apos;s best for you. Mind you, these have the same 9.3mm drivers as the QuietComfort Earbuds II, though in going through the app&apos;s hearing test, Bose&apos;s CustomTune software adjusts the sound and noise-canceling to work best with your ear canals.</p><p>You don&apos;t have to go through the hearing test but you also can&apos;t opt out of CustomTune. It works either way doing its best to tune things, and another reason for that is to manage spatial audio, or Immersive Audio, as Bose calls it. Much of the rest of the internal components otherwise change from before.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="PjHjacg2hAFD9zwoftDXJL" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-screenshots-1.jpg" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds screenshots that help personalize fit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PjHjacg2hAFD9zwoftDXJL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, Bose gives some attention to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res audio</a> codecs, making the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds feel more like the premium buds they&apos;re supposed to be. They support Snapdragon Sound, which includes aptX Adaptive to play hi-res tracks from sources offering them. That, plus Bluetooth 5.3, enable lower-latency playback as well, making these easier to trust when watching a show or movie.</p><p>AptX Adaptive isn&apos;t quite as good as aptX Lossless but you won&apos;t notice anyway unless you always prefer to listen to tunes at the highest bit rates. Despite that, I&apos;ll give Bose credit for a solid default sound signature. Fully expecting to have to go to the EQ in the Bose Music app and redo it all, I only made minor tweaks before I was satisfied. Not that Bose gives you too many options. A 3-band EQ isn&apos;t good enough for expensive earbuds, and the existing presets largely swing things toward bass or treble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="JvHbFRZkqRKLh5EtqpiQvK" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-screenshots-2.jpg" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds screenshots that help personalize sound." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JvHbFRZkqRKLh5EtqpiQvK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, if you&apos;re looking for bass, you&apos;ll find it here. There&apos;s enough of a rumble off the bat but cranking it up with Bass Boost in the EQ really turns it up. Truly, though, these earbuds are at their best when you level things, especially because the mids bring out more detail.</p><p>I also like the spatial effect of Immersive Audio for live recordings. Listening to concert albums or even high-quality stuff from YouTube brings out the crowd noise and atmosphere.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="K6w7FKSMjEbJKwpE6tfcdN" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-close-up.jpg" alt="Close-up view of Bose QuietComfort Ultra left earbud." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6w7FKSMjEbJKwpE6tfcdN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Without a doubt, the signature feature is the ANC. The QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds cancel out noise with the kind of regularity and reliability few others can handle. Wearing them on multiple flights, commutes, and bike rides, I&apos;m impressed at how well they dampen most noise in varying conditions. It&apos;s a mark of excellent noise-canceling earbuds that you don&apos;t have to raise the volume much at all to hear your content clearly. That was the case with these just about every time.</p><p>Sure, the odd fire truck siren or construction site jackhammer seep in, but they never feel like they&apos;ll break through entirely. By muffling them to a large degree, I didn&apos;t have to adjust anything along the way.</p><p>When I did want to hear my surroundings — a must while riding a bike in a big city — I could easily switch to Aware mode by holding down the left earbud. There&apos;s plenty of detailed clarity, which is great, except my one bone of contention is how the onboard mics filter in voices. I had to take off an earbud more than once to clarify something someone said. Maybe I&apos;m losing my hearing but I haven&apos;t experienced that with a couple of other comparable earbuds or headphones, so there&apos;s room for improvement there.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hGvRnWMMYENL8gxgsyN8LN" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-in-hand.jpg" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds loose in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hGvRnWMMYENL8gxgsyN8LN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Touch controls are sometimes hit or miss on earbuds. Not so much on these. They&apos;re responsive and accurate just about every time. Tap once to play/pause, twice to skip a track, and three times to repeat one. Swiping up or down controls volume, which the earbuds can sometimes mistake as pausing playback, but that&apos;s the only real issue you might encounter controlling the QC Ultra Earbuds.</p><p>Tap-and-hold cycles between ANC and Aware, though you can choose a different option, like waking your voice assistant or switching between paired Bluetooth devices. Initially, Bose didn&apos;t give the QC Ultra Earbuds multipoint connectivity — the ability to stay connected to two devices simultaneously — but adding that feature in a subsequent firmware update covered a key omission.</p><p>Bose didn&apos;t really boost battery life here, so you get the same 6-hour estimate (with ANC on) that the previous QC Earbuds II have. Since noise cancelation is so effective, you don&apos;t have to raise the volume as much, which actually does the most to preserve battery each time. The case gives you three extra charges. Just keep a USB-C cable handy when it&apos;s time to recharge the whole package because there&apos;s no wireless charging here.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-what-s-not-good"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds: What's not good</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="smFZweZqnNy4ERGNLQ8h6M" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-open-hand.jpg" alt="Open case showing the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/smFZweZqnNy4ERGNLQ8h6M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can pay an extra $49 to get a wireless charging cover and enable that feature but that feels cheap for earbuds of this caliber. Don&apos;t force people to make that choice when competitors already include it without the markup.</p><p>I&apos;m also surprised the QC Ultra Earbuds aren&apos;t better for phone calls. In spite of outstanding noise-cancelation and audio quality, call quality doesn&apos;t seem to match overall audio quality. People I spoke with weren&apos;t impressed, suggesting other earbuds I&apos;ve tested made my voice sound clearer. That&apos;s regardless of whether it was a quiet room or a bustling street. To me, it kind of feels like an extension of the Aware mode&apos;s muddier performance with voices.</p><p>IPX4 protection is also pretty barebones for earbuds, in my view, so I can&apos;t recommend these for regular workouts given what they cost. I was fine wearing them for bike rides and made sure to clean them afterward, especially since there&apos;s no dust resistance. Light runs or workouts should be fine — as well as a splash of rain — but I doubt these will last a regular, sweaty routine.</p>

<p>Bose and Sony have been jabbing each other back and forth for years over who has the best combination of comfort, sound quality, and noise-cancelation. No surprise you&apos;ll find them both at the top of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds for Android</a>. It&apos;s usually the last one of those features that really puts them so close together, which is why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">Sony WF-1000XM5</a> are such a compelling alternative. It&apos;s a toss up on whether they block out more noise, but they&apos;re also a very different design and offer more personalized features than the QC Ultra Earbuds.</p><p>While they may not match Bose or Sony for world-class noise-cancelation, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-gen-2-review">Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2</a> earbuds are superb and offer some conveniences those others don&apos;t have. Phone calls sound great, and LE Audio means you can use the case as a way to bridge wireless audio from sources only offering a headphone jack (think of an airplane&apos;s entertainment system).</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want good sound with outstanding ANC.</li>
  <li>You want spatial audio.</li>
  <li>You want a design with stems.</li>
  <li>You travel a lot.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want wireless charging.</li>
  <li>You want a more customizable EQ.</li>
  <li>You want the best phone call quality.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Wireless earbuds are so ubiquitous today that you can choose a pair that&apos;s really good at key features you want. For the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, they&apos;d have to be the combination of ANC and sound quality. Especially the noise cancelation because that&apos;s where these shine brightest against all others. You won&apos;t be disappointed in how they drown out what&apos;s happening around you.</p><p>They&apos;re a pricey proposition considering what&apos;s missing here, which is why you have to weigh what you want to prioritize most above everything else. There&apos;s room for improvement but there&apos;s no doubt Bose took a step forward with these buds.</p>

<ul><li>Google Keep already has handwriting mode for users to draw notes; an advanced version appears in the works.</li><li>The latest APK findings of the Google Keep app reveal a new handwritten notes feature, amongst other nifty improvements.</li><li>They include new backgrounds in handwriting notes mode, so you can soon see some color.</li><li>The image support in the Google Keep app should also include new tools.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Keep will likely add new productivity tools in the coming updates, as the latest findings of the notes app indicate new features, particularly for handwritten notes.</p><p>As noted by the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-keep-notetaking-tools-3492984/">Android Authority</a> and with their APK Insights of the latest Google Keep app bearing version <strong>5.24.422.02.90</strong>, we should see a new handwritten notes feature. The notes app already offers a handwriting mode alongside plain text, checkbox list, and image-based notes. </p><p>However, the latest handwritten notes feature looks like it is aimed at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> with a stylus, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, for example. It even works for users who use their fingers to draw in the aforementioned modes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="mZUCHT2cnSXA5mhrwJQed3" name="google-keep-new-handwritten-notes-feature.jpg" alt="New handwritten notes feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mZUCHT2cnSXA5mhrwJQed3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication further notes that the new handwritten notes will be separate from the drawing notes feature that the Google Keep app currently features. The one visible change to differentiate between two handwritten notes is the older handwriting note will have its title at the bottom, whereas the new one is believed to be shown at the top. </p><p>The latter also gains the ability to be shared as PDF files—a feature already available in other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-note-taking-apps-android">note-taking apps</a> like Samsung Notes, for instance. The previous handwriting notes were only shared as image files, not PDFs, which appears to be a neat addition. </p><p>Furthermore, the new handwritten notes also mention a new "Text to sketch" feature, which will likely incorporate AI-based sketches in future updates of the Google Keep app. </p><p>Besides, the latest feature isn&apos;t just limited to Android phones for now; it has also been spotted on the web client file Keep — which is, however, uneditable at the moment and visible only as PDF, notes Android Authority.</p>

<p>Aside from the new handwritten notes, the app findings also indicate some nifty new features coming to the notes app. The handwriting mode previously had illustrations like lines and dots to choose from for the background for handwritten notes. Now, users will be able to add some color to it, as shown in the demo video. </p><p>Notes incorporating images can be moved around, resized, and cropped according to requirements. These new capabilities were seen working on the Google Keep app&apos;s tablet interface.</p><p>These findings promise valuable features for the Google Keep app, which is constantly getting neat new features like the most requested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-to-gain-window-resize-feature-soon">window resize feature</a>. The app also gained <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-gains-multi-account-using-support-in-split-mode-on-foldables">a new capability recently</a> that allows people to use multiple accounts when put in split mode for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>The future of Snapdragon chips is now up in the air after Arm decided to revoke Qualcomm’s license. These chips power some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">leading Android phones</a> on the market, and the ongoing clash between the two companies leaves their production in question.</p><p>Arm has given Qualcomm a 60-day notice to end their architectural license, cutting off Qualcomm's access to Arm’s chip design IP, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-23/arm-to-cancel-qualcomm-chip-design-license-in-escalation-of-feud" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> reports. This marks a major escalation in their ongoing feud, which started in 2022 after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-buying-nuvia-bigger-deal-than-you-think">Qualcomm bought Nuvia</a> without renewing the licensing deal.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qualcomm denied Arm’s claim that it needs to end the licensing agreement. Speaking to Bloomberg, a Qualcomm representative accused Arm of trying to interfere with the legal process, calling the termination baseless. Qualcomm remains confident in its legal standing and believes its rights under the deal will be upheld.</p><p>However, if the dispute isn’t settled after the 60-day notice, Qualcomm might have to stop selling its products or face serious legal consequences, including hefty damage claims.</p><p>Arm and Qualcomm have been in a legal fight since 2022, with Qualcomm having since filed a countersuit. The dispute revolves around Qualcomm’s acquisition of Nuvia, which led to the creation of Oryon CPUs. These custom CPUs are set to roll out in mobile chips, following their first release in Windows laptops. Unlike Arm’s Cortex cores, Oryon CPUs are Qualcomm’s own unique design.</p><p>When Qualcomm acquired Nuvia, Arm argued that Nuvia’s intellectual property, developed under an Arm license, couldn’t be transferred to Qualcomm without permission or a new agreement. Arm even demanded that the designs be scrapped altogether.</p><p>Qualcomm, on the other hand, argues that its current licensing agreement already covers Nuvia’s operations, the chip-design startup it bought.</p><p>The dispute could impact SoCs with Oryon CPUs, like the Snapdragon X Elite (already in various PCs) and the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. However, earlier models, such as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, are expected to be unaffected.</p><p>Up to now, Qualcomm and Arm have been negotiating the use of Arm's processor architecture for designs like the Snapdragon X Elite, which powers Microsoft’s Copilot+ PCs and other Windows laptops running on Arm.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/report-arm-is-sensationally-canceling-qualcomms-chip-license-oct-2024" target="_blank">Windows Central</a> points out that traditional x86 processors are losing traction due to energy concerns, pushing Microsoft to develop Windows for Arm devices. The Surface Pro 11 highlights this effort, but the current dispute could threaten the entire program.</p><p>While Copilot+ PCs are still emerging, the licensing conflict might significantly affect the global smartphone market, as Qualcomm chips are commonly found in Android phones.</p>

After nearly a decade of semi-custom designs, Qualcomm is once again leveraging a fully custom architecture, and that is immensely exciting. </p><p>As you can imagine, Qualcomm is touting heady gains across the board with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and with a node shift to 3nm, the chipset may just be one of the best we&apos;ve gotten in recent years. Here&apos;s everything you need to know about the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and how it compares to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> and MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9400. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg" name="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-8-Elite-clock-speeds-memory" alt="A graphic showing the Snapdragon 8 Elite's 2 power cores (4.32GHz) and six performance cores (3.53GHz), plus the SoC's cache (24MB L2) and memory (5.3GHz LPDDR5x)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, Qualcomm is changing how it uses cores in the Snapdragon 8 Elite, with the platform featuring eight performance cores as standard. You don&apos;t get the usual efficiency cores that do a bulk of the mundane tasks, with Qualcomm emulating MediaTek in this regard. If you want to know more about why Qualcomm ditched efficiency cores with this generation, my colleague Michael Hicks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-snapdragon-8-elite-doesnt-need-efficiency-cores-to-last-longer">talked to Qualcomm engineers</a> about why it&apos;s a big deal.</p><p>Let&apos;s take a look at how the Snapdragon 8 Elite compares to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9400:</p>

<p>Qualcomm significantly boosted the clocks of its cores, with the main cores now going up to 4.32GHz — nearly 1GHz more than that of the 8 Gen 3. This is because of the node shift to 3nm; Qualcomm is finally using TSMC&apos;s 3nm node, and that allows the manufacturer to deliver increased frequencies while still maintaining stable thermals. </p><p>Qualcomm is also touting heady gains on the gaming side of things, along with a new neural engine, and AI-assisted tweaks to its imaging platform. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-heading-back-to-custom-designs-with-oryon-cpu"><span>Heading back to custom designs with Oryon CPU</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Infographic" alt="The final Qualcomm infographic for the Snapdragon 8 Elite showing its overall performance gains compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Qualcomm has been switching up the core configuration of its chipsets, and the Snapdragon 8 Elite comes with the biggest shift in this regard in nearly a decade. Because of the use of second-gen Oryon cores, Qualcomm is able to deliver incredible gains, with the brand touting a massive 45% gain in performance over the 8 Gen 3 in single-core and multi-core workloads.</p><p>What&apos;s also interesting is that the 8 Elite is 44% more efficient while performing the same workloads as the 8 Gen 3, and that&apos;s more than a generational increase. Qualcomm used semi-custom design in recent years, where it would basically license Arm cores and add a few custom features, while retaining Kryo branding.</p><p>However, with the Oryon cores, Qualcomm is using Arm&apos;s architectural license; it takes the instruction set from Arm and then builds the core from the ground up, allowing it much better flexibility. The return to custom cores gives the Snapdragon 8 Elite a sizeable advantage, and close the gap to Apple&apos;s silicon.</p><p>In fact, this is similar to Apple&apos;s approach with its A series chipsets, and although Qualcomm used to do the same in the past, we haven&apos;t seen fully custom cores from the chip vendor following the Snapdragon 805. Qualcomm is once again able to deliver custom designs thanks to its acquisition of Nuvia back in 2021.</p><p>What does the switch to the custom architecture entail? Well, Qualcomm is touting incredible gains in performance over the 8 Gen 3, and that should make a difference in real-world use. Qualcomm is just using two core clusters this time, and that allows the brand to tailor tasks with better efficiency — we got four clusters last year.</p><p>Another factor to consider is the 4.32GHz frequency on the main cores; this is considerably more than previous years, and while the cores only go up to the maximum frequency in very short bursts, it should still make a difference.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-taking-gaming-to-new-heights-with-adreno-gpu"><span>Taking gaming to new heights with Adreno GPU</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2542px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:128.17%;"><img id="MKMTxRHWBnBpTNK43vhYYh" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Inside-View" alt="A photo of a phone's internal parts, with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo sitting in the middle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MKMTxRHWBnBpTNK43vhYYh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2542" height="3258" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the gaming side of things, the Snapdragon 8 Elite switches up the naming convention once again, with Qualcomm just going with Adreno branding without any model numbers. Again, we get heady figures, with Qualcomm touting a 40% increase in performance. What is much more interesting is that the GPU is 40% more efficient at the same tasks as the 8 Gen 3.</p><p>The GPU also includes increased video memory, and there&apos;s a 35% uptick in ray tracing along with the ability to use Unreal Engine 5’s Nanite engine. All of these features are undoubtedly great, but what I&apos;m interested in knowing is how phones with the platform handle sustained gaming; this has been an issue on the 8 Gen 3, and while there was no shortage of power, it led to overheating and thermal constraints.</p><p>It remains to be seen if those issues have been mitigated with this generation, and if we actually get usable titles that have ray tracing enabled.</p>

<p>You can&apos;t go two minutes in the tech industry without a mention of AI, and Qualcomm is rolling out several upgrades in this area as well. The Hexagon NPU has a 45% increase in AI performance, along with 45% better efficiency per watt. It integrates multimodal AI engines, including Gemini Nano.</p><p>While I don&apos;t see the point of mobile AI just yet, what is interesting is how Qualcomm is leveraging machine learning into its imaging platform. The Spectra AI ISP now includes limitless real-time semantic segmentation, and that should deliver better portrait shots. You get to see these benefits in videos as well, and that&apos;s just great.</p>

<ul><li>The floating bottom bar in Google Chat now has a pill shape instead of a circular design, along with a bit of extra width.</li><li>The color scheme has been upgraded with Dynamic Color, enhancing contrast and overall look in Google Chat.</li><li>Plus, the last icon switched from the @ symbol to three dots.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After introducing a floating bottom navigation bar to Google Chat around a year ago, Google is now sprucing it up to match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Material You</a> vibe.</p><p>The floating bottom bar, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-new-navigation-bar">debuted about a year ago as part of a bigger Google redesign</a>, just got a fresh new look. Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/21/google-chat-floating-bottom-bar-material-you/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this refresh makes everything feel more cohesive and visually appealing in the app.</p><p>Prior to this update, the floating bottom bar had a circular shape that helped you spot the active feed. It featured four icons and a button to start a new message. Now, it’s been reshaped into a pill-like design and widened a bit.</p><p>While this change might take up a little more screen space, this refresh gives it a style that jives better with how other Google apps work.</p><p>The fresh design <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-ai-gemini-summaries-update">debuted along with Gemini summaries</a>, which are now popping up in Google Chat's Home view. Just long-press a thread on your phone, and Gemini summaries will help you get up to speed on any missed conversations. The AI assistant will provide three bullet points summarizing the key points.</p><p>For those using Google Chat on desktop, a 'Summarize' button shows up when you hover over a conversation thread. Clicking it works like the long-press on mobile, giving you a quick summary of the chat.</p><p>Another upgrade is the new color scheme. The background of the floating bottom bar now uses Dynamic Color, letting it blend in nicely with your device's color palette.</p><p>This change boosts its contrast with the rest of the Chat interface, making everything look nicer together. Also, the last icon has swapped out the @ symbol for three dots. All these tweaks come together to create a more stylish and unified user interface in the app.</p><p>Right now, though, the floating bottom bar design is unique to Google Chat, but at least the recent updates have made it look good enough to hang out with the other Google apps.</p>
