<p>Everyone needs some type of task management system. The days of just putting sticky notes everywhere are long gone, but thankfully, there are plenty of apps to pick and choose from to make sure you don't forget the milk. There are also new and extremely useful tools for those who need more than just a list and want to focus more on "project management" instead of individual tasks.</p>

<p>Todoist is already one of the most popular task management applications available on all platforms. The Chrome Web App allows you to manage all of your tasks, from wherever you are, while still giving you access to collaborate. Then, after you've knocked out some of your more important tasks, you can pick up your phone to peruse the remaining tasks for the day and everything stays synced.</p>

<p>Having a focus timer can help make sure that you get your tasks completed on time while keeping you, well, focused. This method of self-improvement is known as the Pomodoro method and it "forces" you to work for 25 minutes and then step away for five minutes.</p>

<p>Google has been slowly pushing updates to have its online applications available as PWAs.

<p>ChromeOS is an interesting adventure for everyone, and unless you dive into every nook and cranny, there are still tools that you didn&apos;t know you needed. We&apos;ve found some of the most useful options which range from showing basic system information to annotating those screenshots you keep sending your buddies.</p>

<p>When it comes to finding the right information about your Chromebook, ChromeOS doesn't exactly make it easy. Cog presents you with a slew of information, ranging from your Chrome Version, CPU, CPU usage, storage usage, and much more. This is a simple app that gives you more information about your hardware than the Chromebook itself does.</p>

<p>At some point in time, you'll likely have to take a screenshot. While ChromeOS has this built-in, other apps offer more features. The awesome Screenshot App is just one example of this, as you can not only quickly capture the screen, but can annotate it even quicker. You're also provided with an eraser and blur tool to get rid of private information.</p>

<p>ChromeOS offers so much versatility now, especially with recent updates and the ability to use the built-in touch screen on certain Chromebooks. That makes photo creation and editing much easier to use, and there are plenty of options to pick from if you need to do some touch-ups, or are editing a library of pictures from start to finish.</p>

<p>For a long time, Chromebooks weren't viewed as being great for creators. That's now changing, and you don't even need to deal with Linux apps to edit videos. LumaFusion is a popular video editing app that debuted on the iPad and is now available on Android phones, tablets, and Chromebooks. It's about as fully-featured as we're going to get for the time being. </p>

<p>For the majority of people, the built-in Google Photos app will be more than sufficient for photo editing.

It also removes any need to transfer files from your phone to your Chromebook, provided that your Photos library is synced.</p>

<p>Nobody likes to just sit in front of a TV waiting for some new story to make its way across the tube.

<p>Not everyone is a writer, but the art of pen and paper is slipping further and further out of grasp for many. That&apos;s why word editors, markdown editors, and other word-processing apps are so popular. All of them have something different to offer, and in some cases, you can use one in your browser, without downloading anything, and have your documents synced in the cloud to pick up at a different time or different computer.</p>

Regardless of which format you prefer (music or video), there&apos;s an app for you to either download from the Chrome Web Store or install from your favorite streaming service.

<p>Social media leads the world today and it would be a difficult task to find someone who doesn&apos;t use it in some capacity. Some of these apps used to be available in the Web Store but were transitioned to becoming a PWA in favor of being lightweight and fast. Nonetheless, you&apos;ll be able to keep up with your favorite social media platform with the following apps.</p>

<p>Twitter's PWA app offers a much faster experience when browsing through your Twitter timeline.

<p>In 2022, Google closed the doors on its old Web App Store, which looked very outdated and didn&apos;t match the aesthetic of Google&apos;s other services. In late 2023, the new Chrome Web Store was introduced, sporting a Material You redesign, while also making it much easier to browse and discover new extensions or themes. </p><p>There are already a plethora of new Progressive Web Apps for you to take advantage of, without worrying about taking up too much storage space. Plus, there are some cases where you can use a PWA on your Android smartphone so you get the same experience across all of your devices.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-chrome-app-or-progressive-web-app"><span>Chrome App or Progressive Web App?</span></h2>
<p>For years, Google has been giving everyone "warnings" that Chrome Apps, downloaded from the Chrome Web Store, would be going away. The move is to bring Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) into the forefront, as they are quicker, more versatile, and easier to update.</p><p>Google has continued to move back the timeline for the deprecation of Chrome Apps on ChromeOS, before settling on an EOL time frame of 2022. Starting in March of 2020, Google stopped accepting new Chrome apps, with education and enterprise users having a longer extension, ending in December of 2020.</p><p>Between Chrome Extensions and Progressive Web Apps, there is little need for Chrome Web Apps to truly "exist" past a further point. As the days go on, many of your most-used apps and services have lightweight and easy-to-use web apps already.</p>
<p><strong>How do you install a Progressive Web App?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you understand the difference between a Chrome app and a Progressive Web App, let&apos;s get started on installing those PWA&apos;s. There are a couple of different ways to install a PWA on your Chromebook, as Google has made it easier than ever.</p>
<p>The first method is the easiest, as there is a new icon that can be found in the URL bar itself on the PWA's landing page. Here are the steps that you need to take:</p>
<p>1. Navigate to a <strong>website that offers a PWA</strong>, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://music.youtube.com/">YouTube Music</a>.</p><p>2. From within the URL omnibar, there will be a new "+" icon on the right-hand side. Tap <strong>on this icon</strong>.</p>

<p>3. After pressing the icon, click <strong>Install </strong>to confirm the installation of the PWA.</p>

<p>4. Once installed, the new PWA will automatically open.</p>
<p>In some cases, you will be on the correct website to install a PWA, but do not see the "+" icon to add it to your Chromebook. For those instances, you will need to follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Navigate to <strong>a website that offers a PWA</strong>, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/">Twitter Lite</a>.</p><p>2. On the right-hand side of the Chrome window, click the <strong>three-dot overflow button</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Rumors swirl about OpenAI potentially developing a ChatGPT-based search engine to take on Google.</p><p>Evidence of a possible ChatGPT Search stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ai_for_success/status/1784394503962431708">Ashutosh Shrivastav</a>a on X, who posted a photo of OpenAI&apos;s SSL certificate logs (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.seroundtable.com/openai-to-launch-search-engine-37319.html">Search Engine Roundtable</a>). The logs show that the company has a new "search.chatgpt.com" domain listed.</p><p>So, this alone seems to suggest that OpenAI is currently developing a search engine that would piggyback off the capabilities of its ChatGPT software.</p><p>The user on X added that OpenAI&apos;s CEO Sam Altman recently discussed AI and search in a podcast.</p><p>Another user on X, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/apples_jimmy/status/1785436609095328067">Apples_Jimmy</a>, added to the initial discovery by speculating we could be on the cusp of OpenAI&apos;s search reveal. It&apos;s currently purported that the company could unveil ChatGPT&apos;s Search engine on May 9.</p>

<p>Google has continued to focus strongly on AI in Search, especially since welcoming Liz Reid as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-liz-reid-appointed-head-of-search">the service&apos;s new lead</a>. Reid expressed a strong interest in funneling even more "SGE" and AI overviews into Search. The latter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overviews-test-expansion">recently rolled out</a> for the general public shortly after her new position took place in March.</p><p>Aside from these brief glimpses at OpenAI&apos;s <em>potential </em>development of a ChatGPT-based search engine, its features are still unknown.</p><p>However, the company is on a trend of encroaching on Google&apos;s space, such as with on-device AI assistance. It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-code-suggests-default-assistant-android">spotted back in January</a> that OpenAI was working on a way to add its AI bot into Android so users could make its version the default over Assistant (or, rather, Gemini). Since then, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-for-android-gains-new-widget">Android ChatGPT widget</a> has been spotted, giving users easy access to its services.</p><p>The widget shows options for easy messaging with the bot, the ability to submit photos to it for information, and voice capabilities. It&apos;s not unlikely that a ChatGPT-based search engine would have these features, but more concrete ones during <em>actual </em>queries remain to be seen.</p>

<p>While Sony is gearing up to launch its next set of Xperia handsets in the next few weeks, multiple leaks reveal the Xperia 1 VI and Xperia 10 VI devices in full, following the expected specifications.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/05/exclusive-sony-xperia-1-vi-xperia-10-vi-70-images.html">Android Headlines</a> managed to grab the official renders of the Xperia 1 VI—the flagship Sony phone next to the more affordable Xperia 10 VI smartphones—ahead of the launch. Per the renders, the Xperia 1 VI is seen in black-and-white colors, which sort of look dark gray and beige. The official color names still need to be determined, as noted in the publication.</p>

<p>On the other hand, multiple Sony Xperia 10 VI—the mid-range handset&apos;s color variants—were also seen in the recent leak, including porcelain and light mint color variants. </p><p>Meanwhile, tipster Evan Blass shared similar marketing images of the 10 VI, highlighting the mid-range device&apos;s features. They include the device&apos;s stereo speaker setup, the wide angle and zoom capabilities in cameras, and the placement of the good old 3.5mm headphone jack. </p>

<p>Interestingly, neither the Xperia 1 VI nor Xperia 10 VI have a punch-hole setup for the selfie camera—instead, sizable bezels at the top tuck away the selfie shooter. As for the rear cameras on the flagship Xperia 1 VI, the renders indicate a ZEISS-powered triple rear camera system.</p><p>Another publication, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mspoweruser.com/exclusive-sony-xperia-1-vi-leaked-improved-telephoto-snapdragon-8-gen-3-and-more/">MSPowerUser</a>, has come up with interesting camera details of the upcoming Xperia 1 VI alongside some renders of it. The triple camera system, as mentioned, will include an ultra-wide angle 16mm lens aided by a wide angle 24mm lens with 2x optical zoom and another telephoto lens featuring an 85-170mm lens with up to 7x zoom. </p><p>The 24mm lens is believed to be Sony&apos;s "Exmor T for mobile" CMOS image sensor that has the latest image processing, which further supports macro photography as well.</p>

<p>Sony will likely release a simple, user-friendly camera app for the Xperia to replace its popular Photography Pro, Videography Pro, and Cinema Pro camera apps. Likewise, a new video creator app will be available for the Xperia 1 VI to simplify video production by utilizing photos and videos from the device&apos;s gallery.</p><p>According to the publication, sports photography will also likely improve with new human pose estimation technology that improves pinpoint focus for the Xperia 1 VI&apos;s camera system.</p>
<p>Other highlights of the upcoming Sony Xperia 1 VI include a dynamic and clearer sound experience than the predecessor model, support for Hi-Res Audio, Hi-Res Audio wireless, and more. </p><p>An upgraded OLED display, which is believed to be 1.5x brighter than the previous iteration, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-v-launch">Xperia 1V</a>, with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and up to 120Hz refresh rate, will be seen on the upcoming flagship. </p><p>MSPowerUser further notes that the display is also likely to equip sunlight vision mode for better viewing outdoors, and there is also BRAVIA HDR remaster technology to enhance the visual experience. </p><p>The Xperia 1 VI is said to feature a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset and a 5000mAh battery capacity with support for wireless and reverse wireless charging.</p><p>We&apos;ll have to wait until Sony&apos;s launch event on May 17 to see what these devices have in store for us.</p>

<ul><li>Google has upgraded its Pixel Tablet's multitasking functionality when using "Alt+tab" on a physical keyboard.</li><li>The function now produces a row of currently open apps at the top of the tablet's UI for easy switching.</li><li>The timing of Google's latest improvement could be related to rumors suggesting a Pixel Tablet relaunch is on the horizon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems that Google has implemented a better way for users to multitask on the Pixel Tablet when using a physical keyboard.</p><p>The discovery of an improved "Alt+tab" function on the tablet was picked up by Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-14-alt-tab-shortcut-3439404/">Android Authority</a>. Rahman adds that Google has overhauled Alt+tab with a new UI in Android 14 QPR2. When the shortcut is used, a new horizontal row of apps is produced at the top of the tablet&apos;s display.</p><p>Functionality operates similar to how it does on a Windows PC. Holding "Alt" and tapping "Tab" will produce the row and highlight a recently opened app. Continuously pressing "Tab" will cycle users through the available windows (apps).</p><p>Rahman states that the currently selected app is highlighted with a gray border. Additionally, users reaching the end of their available apps using Alt+tab will find a "show more apps" option. It&apos;s said to show how many apps extra apps users could have for an area of quick discovery.</p><p>Testing shows that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet&apos;s</a> improved Alt+tab bar can only hold six apps at a time.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that Android 13&apos;s way of utilizing Alt+tab was not so intuitive or functional. Instead of a convenient row of the most recently used/open apps at the top, the shortcut would produce the "recent screen."</p>

<p>The timing of Google&apos;s improved multitasking support for the Pixel Tablet in Android 14 comes at a point when rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-relaunch-accessories-rumored">suggest a product relaunch</a>. It&apos;s been speculated that Google is gearing up to relaunch the Pixel Tablet without the charging speaker dock a few days before its I/O event. More importantly, this supposed relaunch could finally deliver those long-awaited Pixel Tablet accessories we&apos;ve been waiting on.</p><p>There&apos;s a chance that consumers could find a Google-made stylus and keyboard for the device. However, rumors say the accessories will not be bundled, potentially costing folks €100 (roughly $107) each.</p><p>In other news, Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-21-out-now">Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1</a> in April. The patch was designed to address a host of tester problems, such as hiccups, crashes, and charging problems.</p><p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">I/O 2024 event</a> is slated for May 14. Though, rumors suggest its original Tablet relaunch could take occur before it on May 10.</p>

<hr>
<p>The May update for ChromeOS devices is starting to arrive, bringing with it some quality-of-life updates to help refine its systems.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/272516132">the changelog</a>, the ChromeOS M124 update introduces a faster split-screen setup for Chromebooks. Google states the new method will display an "overview" of your currently open windows on the opposite side of your screen. Users can lock one window into position and then pick another from the available selection in the overview.</p><p>Users will also have the option to pick something new from their row of apps at the bottom of the UI.</p><p>Fast Pair for HID has become available through update 124 for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>. The post states users can now easily connect a Fast Pair-supported mouse to their laptop with a single click once prompted. The company&apos;s accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/2587653?sjid=17669946416950375472-NA#:~:text=Use%20Fast%20Pair%20on%20your%20Chromebook">support article</a> states that users can hop into <strong>Settings > Bluetooth > "Scan for devices" </strong>to find their mouse. Once discovered, your Chromebook will produce a window to connect.</p><p>Google adds that a new Quality of Service (QoS) feature has arrived by way of better WiFi prioritization. Particularly for "congested" networks, update 124 will help Chromebooks better manage video conferences and gaming sessions. Users are said to experience smoother videos and less buffering.</p><p>However, Google warns that the feature is not available for "managed users."</p><p>The ChromeOS M124 patch notes end by stating users have received an expanded selection of mouse pointer sizes. These can be found within <strong>Settings > Accessibility > Cursor and touchpad</strong>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/02/chromeos-124-rolling-out/">9to5Google</a> picked up another change involving the ChromeOS update redesigning the settings menu. The publication noticed Google has shifted its Chromebook settings closer to Android tablets, outfitted with its Material You design theme. Clicking a specific set of options provides a clean page to view them instead of having everything blended together.</p><p>Google states the M124 update for Chromebooks is rolling out "progressively" over the next few days.</p><p>In early April we were treated to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-chromeos-m123-april-update">ChromeOS M123 update</a>, which brought a set of much-needed customization options. Chromebook owners were given full control over their keyboards with a custom shortcut option and similar functions for mice. Chromebooks gained Tether Hotspot and additional languages for text-to-speech.</p>

Many of them are just out to Nickle-and-Dime you to death with microtransactions, and the worst types of free-to-play games can have toxic communities that are filled with rude players that make for a bad experience.</p><p>But the best free Meta Quest games for headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> are all made to help players find the right types of players and have a great time. Plus, these games are <strong>full-fledged</strong> games, not some watered-down versions of popular titles that you&apos;ll quickly get sick of. In fact, all of these games are regularly updated with fresh content and ways to have fun with friends each and every week.</p><p>Ready to get started? These are the best free Meta Quest 2 and 3 games.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-gorilla-tag"><span>Gorilla Tag</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t3Lsxq7dAO8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Undoubtedly, the premiere free Meta Quest game is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gorilla-tag-quest-game-of-the-week">Gorilla Tag</a>, the viral sensation that launched a few years back and has exploded since then. Thousands of gamers hop on Gorilla Tag daily, and for good reason. As you might expect from a game featuring "Monke&apos;s," Gorilla Tag is a highly social experience.</p><p>At its core, Gorilla Tag is a simple game of virtual tag where you&apos;ll fling your gorilla character around a wide variety of levels in an attempt to catch other players. Three additional game modes will spice things up a bit, but don&apos;t be surprised if you just find yourself hanging out with new friends and making up your own games in a world that uses a unique PlayStation 1-style visual aesthetic.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-population-one"><span>Population: One</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k7INK9V1zjQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>You can think of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/population-one-channels-fortnite-with-free-to-play-switch-graphical-upgrades">Population: One</a> as the "Fortnite of VR." The battle royale went free-to-play in Spring 2023 and has seen a significant uptick in player population since. Just like Fortnite, the only thing you&apos;ll be paying for are the character and weapon skins, and the team at BigBox VR is constantly cranking out new and interesting choices to peruse.</p><p>Battle Royale fans can play the original map or the "evolving map" in squads of three players with rulesets that change regularly. The team has been putting together seasonal content to keep things fresh, and the built-in map editor means deathmatch rounds might take place on a Mario Kart track, a classic Unreal map, or even the N64-styled halls of Goldeneye 007.</p><p>But this isn&apos;t just any old battle royale. Population: One was designed bespoke for VR, so the controls and movement are totally unque to the medium. You can climb anything and soar anywhere by holding out your arms like a pair of wings. It&apos;s a surreal experience that just gets better with time!</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-gods-of-gravity"><span>Gods of Gravity</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1TmbDI9209A" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-best-new-quest-2-game-of-2023-wont-even-cost-you-a-dime">Gods of Gravity</a> takes the god game genre into an entirely new dimension, giving players full control over fleets of interstellar ships. Massive space battles await players who can strategically plan their galactic takeover, building ships and claiming worlds to gain more resources. There&apos;s nothing quite like grabbing your ships and flinging them into the next solar system to understand the power of immersive VR!</p><p>Each of the game&apos;s playable god classes has its own set of positives and negatives, as well as a special power that can be activated. The game&apos;s easy social atmosphere makes it effortless to play with friends, and regular tournaments reward serious players who enjoy diving deep into the strategy required to win big. But don&apos;t worry, even casual players can have a great time with co-op modes or single-player training sessions.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-zenith-nexus"><span>Zenith Nexus</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9_hU8iAp64" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/zenith-the-last-city-vr-mmo">Zenith: Nexus</a> is the free-to-play relaunch of the original VR MMO. Nexus splits the game into two, leaving the MMO Zenith: The Last City as a "paid DLC" and opening up a completely free-to-play pseudo-sequel in the form of Infinite Realms.</p><p>Infinite Realms is a free-to-play action-adventure RPG that makes it easy to play alongside friends or other players to battle mobs, race in parkour challenges, and complete what the developer describes as "quick session-based runs." There&apos;s even a social lobby where players can shoot hoops, cook recipes, or just hangout and chat.</p><p>Plus, once you&apos;re ready to head out into the full MMO experience, you can just download The Last City DLC and jump in that with any friend who owns it.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-rec-room"><span>Rec Room</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mcX-SQ2IS7M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Rec Room is the family-friendly social experience where anyone can play together without fear of harassment or foul language. Rec Room&apos;s main games include basketball, laser tag, a host of adventures with themes like pirates, space aliens, and more. Plus, player-created rooms are a blast for everyone to play and significantly change up the gameplay in important ways, similar to how Roblox and other social player-created games work.</p><p>Better yet, players don&apos;t have to have experience with programming or PC-based tools to make their own worlds, unlike a lot of other large social games. The in-game tools are powerful, yet easy to use, and you can invite your friends to play in your creations when you&apos;re finished.</p><p>Rec Room also has excellent parental controls that make you feel good about letting your kids play in VR. Given the large number of kids playing VR games, it&apos;s important that parents are able to provide their kids with safe environments.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-horizon-worlds"><span>Horizon Worlds</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sd7du11ZPZo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Horizon Worlds is the social experience built-in to Meta Quest headsets. It&apos;s super easy to find worlds to play in, and the game uses the Quest&apos;s built-in friends list, making it easy to connect with friends and hang out. Horizon Worlds started off pretty roughly but recent updates have significantly upgraded the experience, adding great free-to-play experiences like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/super-rumble-horizon-worlds-titanborne/">Super Rumble</a>, the hit FPS experience.</p><p>Plus, Meta partners with big names like NBA to bring live sports viewing, concerts, and other live events in Horizon Worlds for players to experience together. There&apos;s even an entire TV series called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/event/610069461312317/">The Faceless Lady</a> presented by Eli Roth and Crypt TV to change up the atmosphere from bright and friendly to dark and spooky.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vrchat"><span>VRChat</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWLPw4RE9Ig" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>You&apos;d have to be living under a rock to never have heard of VRChat. At the least, you&apos;ve probably seen a video recorded in VRChat, a purely social game where people can use any avatar they want. Whether that&apos;s your favorite (definitely not copyright) character model, an anime catgirl, a cute animal, or anything in-between, you can fully express yourself in the world of VRChat.</p><p>Of course, full expression comes with players who regularly harass others, but finding the right groups or VR worlds will keep those bad experiences at bay. Worlds can be anything from a social hangout space, a night rave club, or even full-fledged games like a recreation of Among Us.</p><p>The Meta Quest version of the game is more limited than the PC version, though, so you won&apos;t be able to experience every world on the standalone system. That&apos;s the main reason this isn&apos;t ranked higher on our list.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-gun-raiders"><span>Gun Raiders</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QwnZu2ppiiw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>If you&apos;re old enough to remember the Tribes series of multiplayer shooters from the late 90s and early 2000s, you&apos;ll feel right at home in this free-to-play multiplayer shooter. Gun Raiders outfits each player with a jetpack and lets you do impressive aerial moves around sizable levels. Game modes range from simple deathmatch rounds to full-scale battle royale, assault, control, donut, and plenty of others.</p><p>As is the case with many free-to-play games, Gun Raiders updates regularly and players can choose to purchase skins separately or subscribe to the battle pass that runs the length of each season. With the battle pass, the more often you play, the more you&apos;ll unlock. It&apos;s a total blast and it&apos;s hard to believe this one is completely free!</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-big-ballers-vr"><span>Big Ballers VR</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tq89_E6hVmQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Big Ballers is regularly heralded as "the best VR sports game" by players across social media and in the thousands of reviews the game has garnered on the Meta Horizon Store. Whether you&apos;re playing 12-player basketball, baseball, American football, or just working out in the mixed reality mode, there&apos;s something for everyone here.</p><p>The developers have been keeping the game up-to-date with new content monthly, and players swear by its physics system and easy-to-learn mechanics. Big Ballers is a social game first, and the game&apos;s reputation system means you can be sure you&apos;re playing with respectful players who won&apos;t badmouth you or make you feel bad. It&apos;s a great time for everyone!</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-wooorld"><span>Wooorld</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dCTkp1synho" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>At first Woorld looks like it&apos;s just "Google Maps in VR." Thankfully, the game is a lot deeper than that, and it can be pure joy to explore the world with friends thanks to the game&apos;s clever use of 3D maps and Street View technology. Plan your next vacation with friends and family or jump into "Where in the Wooorld" to test your geography skills.</p><p>Where in the Wooorld is a lot like a VR scavenger hunt where players will be dropped into a Street View location in a random location and will have to use the visual clues around them to guess where in the world they are. Think of it a bit like the classic Carmen Sandiego games, except you&apos;re the detective this time.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-bait"><span>Bait!</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uuM_LL2DEzc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Fishing can be fun, but getting up at the crack of dawn and getting sunburned in a boat sure isn&apos;t. That&apos;s where Bait! comes in. Jump in eight different environments alongside friends and fish the day (or night) away. Compete in tournaments and catch more than 60 types of fish.</p><p>Up to four friends can fish together in the game&apos;s multiplayer sessions, and the game&apos;s social lobbies support up to 12 players at a time, making this a great chill social experience to dive into.</p>

<h2 id="free-doesn-apos-t-mean-cheap-2">Free doesn&apos;t mean cheap</h2>
<p>Some free experiences can leave a bad taste in your mouth, but these free Meta Quest games are anything but cheap or lame experiences. These are full-fledged games that give players the ability to enjoy time with others without spending an arm and a leg to get it.</p><p>Plus, it&apos;s just plain easier to get your friends to try something new when they don&apos;t have to spend a dime, right? Many of the games on this list are also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>, further proving that free-to-play doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s going to be bad.</p><p>Since all of these games are social experiences, it&apos;s important to ensure that your account is set up correctly, especially if it&apos;s a kids account.

You also get all of the exclusive software features that Pixel fans love, plus OS upgrades and security updates for years to come.

<ul><li>WhatsApp brings two new handy features to Communities.</li><li>While one can create events like Calendar apps, the other allows group admins to catch up quickly with organized replies. </li><li>The features will be rolled out Communities’ groups, and other groups are likely to follow soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp has announced some new features for its Communities that allow users to stay more organized on the messaging platform.<strong> <br>
<br>
</strong>First off, the messaging platform allows users to create calendar events. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/new-to-communities-events-and-replies-in-announcement-groups">accompanying blog post</a>, WhatsApp indicates that the second functionality has been launched specifically for Communities groups where users can respond to important updates posted by admins.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="uotRTWAZopvBzWNnVGs6ZD" name="whatsapp-communities-event.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Calendar events" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uotRTWAZopvBzWNnVGs6ZD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Events such as virtual meetings or birthdays can now be planned in groups within Communities. Any user in the group can create such events, and other participants can respond to them. The messaging platform also provides automatic notifications for those attending the event when the date approaches. </p><p>The ability to create events is currently available to groups in WhatsApp Communities, but the messaging app says this feature will be extended to other groups going forward. </p>
<p>In Announcement Groups from Communities, admins can now easily comprehend what the group members want through their organized replies and likewise catch up to what’s happening in the community. These replies “are grouped together and minimized” so that users can clearly see in what context they were posted in the group. Also, users aren’t annoyed with notifications of those replies as they are likely muted for everyone.</p><p>WhatsApp further announced that new features will be rolled out to Communities and groups in the coming months,<strong> </strong>which include more tools to help users stay organized on the messaging platform.<br>
<br></p>
<p>On the other hand, the app also recently tested a new setting in Communities that allows users to join groups only on an invite basis. </p><p>The Meta-owned messaging platform has constantly been testing such features to catch up with or stay ahead of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">rival messaging platforms</a>. More recently, the app was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-working-on-in-app-dialer">found testing</a> an in-app dialer that would allow users to place calls directly from the app for unknown numbers or businesses. It is a handy feature for users who don’t want to store those numbers in their address book because the interactions with them are likely once or twice.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Messages is getting rid of the "Nudge" reply reminder and birthday reminder features that many users found useful.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/01/google-messages-nudges/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> noticed that the latest beta of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> has removed the feature. We can confirm that it is no longer visible in beta version 20240430 of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging app</a>.</p><p>If you go to Settings > Suggestions, you won&apos;t see Nudges listed. But you&apos;ll still find Smart Reply, Suggested Actions, Magic Compose, and Suggested Stickers there.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:346px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.76%;"><img id="WkitAx2TDyKqCwFKRdiGTQ" name="Google-Messages-suggestions-feature.png" alt="Google Messages suggestions feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WkitAx2TDyKqCwFKRdiGTQ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="346" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In late 2021, Google Messages <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-messages-could-soon-gain-gmail-nudges-feature">quietly introduced the "Nudges" feature</a>, and it was actually quite handy. It would, well, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-message-reminders-in-google-messages">nudge you to respond to messages you might have overlooked</a> or to follow up on ongoing conversations. Plus, for those of you who aren&apos;t the best at remembering dates, it also offered helpful reminders for things like birthdays.</p><p>While you could add birthday reminders to your calendar, getting them right from an app you frequently use is a bit more handy. Also, constantly moving features around between apps can be off-putting.</p><p>Google hasn&apos;t clearly explained why they removed the feature, and it&apos;s still mentioned on Google Messages&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/11555591?hl=en" target="_blank">support page</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.android.com/google-messages/#:~:text=helpful%20reminders%20and%20nudges" target="_blank">Android landing page</a>. Google may have something better planned, but for now, its sudden removal is pretty puzzling.</p><p>The search giant will presumably address this at Google I/O later this month, where we might hear new features from Google, including something to replace "Nudges." With AI increasingly handling these kinds of tasks, there&apos;s a good chance we could see an AI-powered feature unveiled as a replacement.</p><p>It looks like this is happening with Gmail and other Google Workspace apps, where AI features are stepping in to boost productivity.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced last year that it would start adding badges to official government apps, and this change is rolling out now.</li><li>Over 3,000 state and federal apps from 12 countries now show a visual badge displaying that they are official government apps. </li><li>Since government apps often require users to provide identifying or banking information, this is a way for users to make sure they're sharing private data with the right app. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has tried to clean up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Play Store</a> of late, and part of that initiative now includes marking government apps with a visual badge to show that they are official. The move was quietly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/11/ensuring-high-quality-apps-on-google-play.html" target="_blank">announced</a> in November 2023, but it is just now rolling out to app listings on the Google Play Store. Thousands of official state and federal apps feature a government badge — which looks like a building — directly above the <strong>Install</strong> button. </p><p>Like some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-services">other badges on app listings</a>, you can tap the government badge to learn more about what it means. After doing so, the Play Store will bring up the following message: "Official government, Play verified this app is affiliated with a government entity." This new badge is placed between the app reviews average and the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) score.</p><p>Google says that it started testing the new program with "a small percentage of users" over the past few months. It&apos;s now widely rolling out with support for over 3,000 official state and federal apps in 12 countries. For now, only certain apps in Australia, Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Brazil, Indonesia, India, and Mexico can feature a government badge.</p><p>For example, official United States government apps like FEMA and IRS2Go have the official badge. Additionally, the official MyGovIndia app sports a badge. Some state apps like MyTN also feature a badge, just to name a few. </p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, the Google Play Store&apos;s developer policies already prevent apps from falsely presenting themselves as an official government app in a misleading way. When apps claim that they are affiliated with a government or agency, Google works with those agencies to confirm these changes are legitimate. </p><p>Still, these new badges help make it more clear that the app you are downloading and interacting with is actually the official one from a state or federal government. Considering that many of these apps ask for identifying information and more, it&apos;s easy to see why you wouldn&apos;t want to share that data with a nonofficial app. Google says it partnered with dozens of governments and developer partners to facilitate these app badges, and this Play Store program may expand in the future. </p>
