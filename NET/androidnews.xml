<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="when-is-black-friday-2">When is Black Friday?</h2>
<p>Black Friday is November 29th, the day after Thanksgiving in the United States. Although that&apos;s when sale events have gone live historically, Black Friday sales have been starting earlier and earlier every year, which means you can find excellent Black Friday deals throughout the entire month of November. </p>
<h2 id="which-retailer-has-the-best-garmin-deals-during-black-friday-2">Which retailer has the best Garmin deals during Black Friday?</h2>
<p>Retailers such as Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, and Garmin itself have all released their Black Friday deals on Garmin watches early, and there are few differences between them. If you&apos;re trying to settle on a particular retailer, look beyond the price tags to see if there are any additional perks in the fine print. Is Amazon Prime going to give you free shipping? Does the Garmin store offer an extended warranty? These are important details to check before choosing an offer. </p>

It's the developer of Android, but it's also the hardware manufacturer of a growing Android phone brand. In years past, being the developer of Android has given it an edge in making hardware and software for Google Pixel phones.</p><p>However, with Android 16, Google is shaking things up. The company is completely changing the Android development and release schedule in a way that'll benefit Google's partner OEMs — and by extension, Pixel competitors.</p><p>Google is such a large tech conglomerate that it naturally has a few competing interests. However, with the release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">Android 16 Developer Preview 1</a> this week, the company has rightfully and decisively put the Android platform above the Pixel brand. To compete with the iPhone, Google needs all of its Android partner OEMs at their best, shipping thorough and timely version updates each year.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xiQzkBM5cbAGgGccwEM6CB" name="iphone-16-pro-max-30.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max next to Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xiQzkBM5cbAGgGccwEM6CB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's something that even the best Android phone manufacturers have struggled with of late. Samsung can't seem to ship its Android 15-based One UI 7 update quickly, as it was delayed until next year. Smaller brands have horrible reputations for delivering fast and reliable Android updates, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-14-is-finally-coming-to-the-motorola-razr-and-razr-plus-and-it-only-took-a-year">like Motorola</a>, which brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a> a full year after it was released.</p><p>OnePlus is one of the few companies with a presence in North America, not named Google, that managed to roll out Android 15 to the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus Pad 2 in a timely manner.</p><p>Google appears to have recognized this issue with Android, and it's actively correcting it. Android 16 is set for release in the second quarter of 2025, and it'll reach platform stability in March. That's months ahead of schedule, and the extra time will give partner OEMs — like Samsung, OnePlus, Motorola, and others — the time they need to deliver Android version updates alongside the release of their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best phones</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-changing-about-the-android-yearly-release-schedule-2">What's changing about the Android yearly release schedule</h2>
<p>The first developer preview for Android 16 is here early, and that's not by accident. Google says that the move is "the start of Android having more frequent API releases as part of our effort to drive faster innovation in apps and devices" in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/11/first-developer-preview-android16.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing the launch. What exactly does that look like? For one, there will now be two SDK releases each year, with the major one arriving in Q2 2025.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1357px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:21.00%;"><img id="rHUVhYifwwHNUKQpmEHXUj" name="Android-Release-Timeline" alt="The new release timeline for Android." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rHUVhYifwwHNUKQpmEHXUj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1357" height="285" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The major SDK release will be the Android version update we're used to, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> in 2025. However, instead of reaching a final release in the third quarter, it'll come an entire quarter early. This is the update that'll include significant Android behavior changes, APIs, and new features.</p><p>Google says it's pushing the release up a quarter "to better align with the schedule of device launches across our ecosystem, so more devices can get the major release of Android sooner."</p><p>There's more — the company will now issue a <em>second</em> SDK release in the final quarter of 2025. This will be a "minor" SDK release, according to Google, that's bigger an a quarterly feature drop but smaller than an annual version update. The minor SDK release in Q4 2025 will come with new APIs and features but won't bring behavior changes.</p><p>This is intended to "ensure continuous quality" for the Android platform while not adding an extra burden for developers. That final SDK release will have feature updates, optimizations, bug fixes, and new developer APIs but won't include the behavioral changes that could cause compatibility issues for apps. "The Q2 major release [Android 16] will be the only release in 2025 to include planned behavior changes that could affect apps," Google emphasizes.</p><p>There are still quarterly Android updates, too. They'll now come in Q1 and Q3, splitting up the major and minor SDK releases with features only. Put them all together, and Google's changes to Android releases extend far beyond just shipping Android 16 a few months earlier. These are strategic changes that'll help the platform overall but will <em>really</em> help partner OEMs.</p>

<p>Right now, buying an Android phone is tricky, and the timing of software releases is the reason why. For example, Samsung launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a> in July, and the former is the most expensive phone it sells. However, it shipped with Android 14, it's still running Android 14, and it'll <em>keep</em> running Android 14 until at least the new year, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/delayed-one-ui-7-update-has-me-worried">Samsung is expected to release One UI 7</a>.</p><p>That's a problem. The best Android phones should be running the best Android version, but that's rarely the case. Even Google's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> launched without a new version Android for the first time ever.</p><p>Hopefully, it will soon be a problem of the past. By releasing developer previews, beta releases, and final versions of Android updates sooner, partner OEMs will get plenty of time to tune up their Android skins before device releases. "We're actively working with our device partners to bring the Q2 release [Android 16] to as many devices as possible," Google says.</p><p>Could that mean more devices, not just Pixel, launch with fresh Android updates? Or, might it mean that Android releases become less about being synced up with hardware releases and more about getting installed on as many devices as possible?</p><p>Those are questions we're still waiting for answers to. However, it's hard not to get excited about the future of Android. Google's announcements this week reaffirm a few key things. It's committed to working with partner OEMs to help them update their phones to the latest Android version as soon as possible. It's also going to keep the flow of Android updates continuous with security drops, quarterly updates, and a second major SDK release.</p><p>I'm hoping that Android's leaders — Samsung, Google, and others — use these changes to deliver consistent, high-quality, and rapid Android version releases, dispelling the notion that the platform isn't as reliable as Apple's.</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly working on a native backup/restore tool for its Messages app that leans on its cloud serves and your account.</li><li>Details from its code suggests users can choose to enable the backup/sync feature, sign in, and safely store their contents in case of a new device.</li><li>A backup/restore tool is something Meta's WhatsApp has had for a while; however, users can use that in tandem with Google Drive.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent wave of discoveries points toward Google's development of a critical tool to save your texts when switching to a new device.</p><p>Initially discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/19/google-messages-backup-restore/">9to5Google</a>, the company is reportedly creating the necessary systems behind a backup and restoration tool for the Messages app. This was noticed in v20241118_02_RC00 of the app's beta; however, AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-backup-restore-feature-how-works-3501363/">Android Authority</a>) was able to get a more detailed look at Google's progress.</p><p>The tipster was able to produce the introductory splash screen that will likely greet users once this rolls out. Google description states "backup is better with Messages. Restore your conversations, media, and more anytime in app."</p><p>Once it arrives (if all goes well), it seems users can find a new "Backup & Sync" option within the app's settings. Tapping this will throw you to a page consisting of a backup toggle, what account the sync is tied to, and more. If you're signed in and the feature is toggled on, Messages will begin backing up your app contents to its cloud servers.</p><p>Moreover, Google informs users that their contents are E2EE (end-to-end encrypted).</p><p>If a user has switched devices, Google's early in-app description states signing in will download and restore your conversations "automatically."</p>

<p>Of course, the choice to use this feature, should it debut, is up to the user. More importantly, both publications highlight the potential option for users to delete and re-do their Google Messages backup. The folks at 9to5 state that turning off the backup/sync option <em>after </em>backing up texts will see them "permanently deleted from your Google Account."</p><p>Most of the feature seems proper and ready for debut, but there's no indication as to when we might see this.</p><p>A backup/restore option for the Messages app is yet another way Google is playing catch-up. Meta's WhatsApp notably features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-backup-and-move-your-whatsapp-messages-and-media">a backup and restore tool</a> that users can leverage to save their precious conversations. It's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">best messaging apps</a> out there and this convenient feature only strengthens that. WhatsApp also lets users utilize Google Drive to safely store their content.

<hr>
<p>Rumors are surfacing once again about the potential for a new foldable form factor from OnePlus.</p><p>The latest rumors stem from known Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/P10F1p9Bt">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) who states OnePlus could produce a "Flip" of its own (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/20/oneplus-allegedly-prepares-flip-style-foldable-for-2025/">9to5Google</a>). The supposed specifications of this clamshell device are still unknown. Curiously, DCS claims OnePlus could launch this new foldable under its "Ace" series.</p><p>Additionally, the tipster states the Chinese OEM could see a "tentative"<em> </em>launch of this device in Q2 2025.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="r2wyyL8TDtc7ZUyULGwjWY" name="oppo-find-n3-flip-42.jpg" alt="OPPO Find N3 Flip" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r2wyyL8TDtc7ZUyULGwjWY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rumors of a potential "OnePlus Flip" are nothing new and the most recent one surfaced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-next-foldable-could-bring-the-heat-to-the-galaxy-z-flip-in-a-whole-new-way">earlier this year</a>, stating one was on the way. A leaker claimed OnePlus was "gearing up" to debut a clamshell foldable to take on Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. Similar to what users hope for in DCS' recent rumor thread on Weibo, the "OnePlus Flip" may debut with a telephoto lens and a macro camera.</p><p>Moreover, there was speculation that OPPO's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">Find N3 Flip</a> could influence the design and caliber of a OnePlus variant. That wouldn't be surprising as these two companies lean heavily on one another when designing phones.</p><p>However, one thing to consider is the leaker's recent suggestion that a OnePlus Flip <em>could </em>fall under its Ace series. Devices under that moniker are typically mid-range devices with slightly toned-down specs, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-ace-3-unveiled-in-china">the Ace 3</a> from January. This, of course, encourages a more cost-conscious appeal for the devices, which makes us think OnePlus could have Samsung and its (alleged) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-fe-s24-internal-chip-rumors">Galaxy Z Flip FE</a> in its sights.</p><p>OnePlus was also wrapped up in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-and-oneplus-are-crucial-to-foldable-market">a curious rumor</a> that claimed it, alongside OPPO, could exit the foldable game. Let's not forget that OnePlus didn't release a second-generation version of its Open foldable in 2024. The company reportedly delayed its launch with rumors claiming it will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-camera-charging-leaks">seek a Q1 2025 launch</a> for an "Open 2" with wireless charging capabilities.</p><p>Nothing is confirmed for sure, meaning we're going to have to wait and see what happens next year.</p>

<hr>
<p>OPPO is preparing to rollout some AI additions for its Android 15 software that should aid users in multiple ways.</p><p>The company detailed the upcoming AI features that leverage Google's systems in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oppo.com/en/newsroom/press/find-x8-series-coloros-15-google-gemini-ai/">press release</a>. OPPO's general manager, Nicole Zhang, stated a goal with its OS was to "create an easy-to-use, harmonious, powerful experience through intelligence and collaboration." With that, the Chinese OEM announced the upcoming arrival of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>.</p><p>The post reiterates that users can produce the feature by long-pressing the "home button or navigation bar." Users can quickly circle or highlight anything on their display to run a search through Google.</p><p>Elsewhere, the company states it's bringing in more AI features as ColorOS 15 will feature the dedicated Gemini app. OPPO mentions features like "help me write," AI planning assistance, and more. Additionally, OPPO's partnership with Google brings <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a> to its "smart devices."</p><p>OPPO is working on a few AI-backed features of its own, but they will reportedly leverage Google's software. According to the post, the upcoming OS upgrade will pick up OPPO Notes, Documents, and AI Recording Summary. These features are said to leverage "Gemini models" like 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash. It's likely these models will lend a hand for other on-device AI features, too.</p><p>OPPO states its ColorOS 15 software and Google's AI assistance will debut first on the Find X8 series.</p>

<p>We're on the cusp of OPPO's next flagship series as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppos-answer-to-the-galaxy-s25-is-launching-globally-on-november-21">Find X8 is set to debut</a> on November 21. The company confirmed as much earlier this month, stating an event in Bali will hold all the details. Alongside its launch with ColorOS 15 (Android 15), the Find X8 series will feature the MediaTek Dimensity 9400 SoC. The devices will seemingly sport a new, flatter design and larger batteries.</p><p>Additionally, the company confirmed that the Find X8 will arrive in a few global regions like the U.K. and India.</p><p>Google first dropped Gemini Live as an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">update for Pixels</a> in August. The AI lets users engage in a more "conversational" way when asking for ideas, tips, and assistance with tasks. Google states Gemini Live can understand "complex questions," meaning users won't have to break up their sentences. The feature was then rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">to all Android users</a> in October with increased language support.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Most of us are glad we have a smartphone. We enjoy the things we can do with one, depend on one for many of our day-to-day tasks, and carry one around with us all of the time. With the right phone, your life is better in a lot of ways.</p><p>Did you ever stop to think about why? Buying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the right phone</a> can be hard because there are so many to choose from, but once that's done we usually just start using it without a thought about the things that make a phone useful.</p>
<p>None of those things would be possible without people developing software that gets added on top of Android. You might not know, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">Android is really basic</a>; it's mostly just software that can boot up a phone, support the hardware inside of it, and provide a platform for other software to run. It's that other software that you love to use or depend on every day.</p><p>That's why I think the most important updates to come out of Google are the ones for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-in-android-studio-debut">"official" developer tools</a>. Improvements to the Android Studio development environment and the other tools developers need are why you want to use your phone.</p>

<p>I'm not an app developer. I have written a handful of apps for both Android and iOS to learn how the process works, but I've never even tried to write an app you would want to use. That experience did teach me a few things, though; the tools are more important than anything else Google can do to further Android as a platform.</p><p>A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/11/android-emulator-stability-performance-updates.html">update to the Android emulator</a> (software that "runs" Android so apps can be tested in a live setting) is a great example. Almost every developer depends on the emulator, and there are some issues with it. It would get sluggish or lock up after a while on even the strongest computer hardware. Google decided to focus on improving it, and the most recent update is great. It's still not perfect, but Google hasn't said it is done working on it.</p>

<p>Google hasn't always done a good job here. It's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-first-app#0" target="_blank">easy to become an Android app developer,</a> and if you're familiar with any sort of software development, you could have an app ready for the Play Store in a few hours. Throw all of that out the window when you're talking about a <strong>good</strong> app, though. In the beginning, terrible developer tools meant a million terrible apps in the Play Store for every good one. People don't want to write terrible apps, and thankfully, Google realized how important it was to support anyone — including you — who wants to make the next great Android app.</p><p>Writing an application that people will want to use is hard. First, you need to come up with the right idea, work through the issues that you know will arise as you get started, find ways to make your software work with thousands of different devices, and <em>then</em> write the good code that makes an app great. Without the right tools, most of this is going to be very difficult.</p>
<p>You're probably not an app developer, and improvements to these tools and new features in Android Studio probably don't seem very exciting to you. You only need to understand that these updates are important — sometimes more important than an update you'll get on your phone.</p><p>These are the things that make your phone, and Android as a whole, better.</p>

<p>A couple of leaked dummy models of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra give us a clearer look at what the new design might bring to the table.</p><p>As the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">Galaxy S25</a> series launch gets closer, leaks are spilling everywhere. Leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/jukanlosreve/status/1859187280264695898" target="_blank">Jukanlosreve</a>’s recent X post shows dummy unit images revealing some design tweaks, like rounded corners and concentric camera rings (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-dummy-leaks-2025-flagship-3501477/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p>

<p>We’re still waiting on official (or real-life) Galaxy S25 Ultra photos, but this new leak gives us a better glimpse so far. This comes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">just a couple of months after renders dropped</a>, teasing some design changes for the phone.</p><p>Breaking away from the sharp angles of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, the S25 Ultra seems to adopt softer curves. These tweaks could make it feel better in your hand.</p><p>More to the point, these dummy units suggest that the S25 Ultra is ditching the line's old design for a flatter frame and rounder corners, making it look more like the squarer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">Galaxy S24</a> base and Plus models.</p><p>Earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://online-solitaire.com/blog/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-as-aluminium-dummy-phone-2/" target="_blank">rumors</a> pegged the high-end device at 162.82 x 77.65 x 8.25mm. Taking a closer look, this new model is a bit taller, slimmer, and thinner than the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which comes in at 6.40 x 3.11 x 0.34 inches.</p><p>The leaked dummy images show the S25 Ultra in black and white. The rear camera setup is mostly the same, but now the individual cameras sport concentric rings, giving off a vibe similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the new leak doesn't dive into the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s camera specs, but it gives us a clear look at the design of the rear camera module.</p><p>In the past few weeks, a wave of leaks has given us plenty of details about the Galaxy S25 Ultra. We've seen how it stacks up in performance against the iPhone 16 Pro Max and got a look at how their bezel designs compare.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra, along with the S25 and S24 Plus, is rumored to arrive in January or February, so we can probably expect more leaks and rumors to surface before the official reveal.</p>

The app feels the same, with the main difference being what’s under the hood (a native Arm64 support).</p><p>The native Drive for Desktop on Arm offers solid features but skips the Outlook Meet plugin. This might be a bummer for Outlook power users who depend on it for scheduling and teamwork. There's no word yet on whether Google plans to add it in future updates.</p><p>Since the native Drive for Desktop on Arm is still in beta, Google recommends using it with non-essential data or keeping backups just in case.</p><p>Even with its limitations, the native Arm version of Drive for Desktop is a big step forward. It’s a smoother, more efficient way to access and manage your files on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cloud-storage-service">cloud storage service</a> compared to the web version.</p><p>The app is now the second Google app optimized for Windows on Arm, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-chrome-windows-arm-optimization-rollout">following Chrome</a>. While Google also says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-quick-share-upgraded-arm-windows-rollout">the Quick Share app works on Windows on Arm</a>, it’s important to note that it runs through emulation.</p><p>To use the native Drive for Desktop, you'll need a Windows 11 PC with an Arm processor and the Microsoft WebView2 runtime. The setup is straightforward—just download and install the app directly from Google.</p><p>With the launch of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X platform and the rise of powerful, energy-efficient laptops, app compatibility became a big issue. While most major apps have been optimized for this new architecture, Google Drive was a key holdout, leaving users to rely on emulation.</p><p>The recent beta release of the native Drive for Desktop app eases those concerns and possibly boosts the adoption of Arm64 devices.</p>

Most earbuds use regular audio drivers with a magnetic coil to generate sound, but the idea with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds-with-solid-state-audio-drivers-are-about-to-go-mainstream">silicon-based alternatives</a> is that they use a piezoelectric drive in conjunction with ultra-thin membranes to make sound, and that&apos;s just inherently cool.</p>

<p>The brand making these drivers is xMEMS, and it just rolled out its latest product: the Sycamore. While its earlier Cypress driver is used in several earbuds — including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/creative-aurvana-ace-2-review">Creative Aurvana Ace 2</a> — and is designed for in-ear options, the Sycamore is aimed at the open-ear category instead, and is coming to earbuds, XR glasses, and smartwatches.</p><p>The timing of the launch is interesting, because there has been a steady increase in open-ear products, with Nothing and Bose catering to this niche. With the Sycamore, xMEMS is leveraging its “sound from ultrasound” design, and with the module coming in at just 1.13mm and weighing 150mg, it is three times thinner than a regular driver and one-seventh the size.</p><p>Ahead of the launch, I had an email interaction with Mike Housholder, VP Marketing and Business Development at xMEMS Labs, to understand how the Sycamore is different to the Cypress. Housholder noted that the new driver "represents the maturation of our ultrasonic transducer technology," and that changes to the "design and efficiency of the MEMS architecture" has allowed it to go from an in-ear design to open-air.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rurtAr3WQXdJT5nVnPJTNe" name="xmems-2.jpg" alt="xMEMS Sycamore driver highlighted in renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rurtAr3WQXdJT5nVnPJTNe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: xMEMS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sound quality is a key metric in micro speakers, and I was interested in learning about how something as small as the Sycamore is able to produce anywhere close to the same level of sound as a regular dynamic driver. "One of the key characteristics of our ultrasonic, modulated air pulse generation technology is that it exhibits a 1st-order low frequency degradation to provide a robust low frequency response as compared to conventional dynamic drive speakers which typically exhibit a 2nd-order (more steep) low frequency degradation," said Housholder.</p><p>As such, the brand is touting a similar mid-bass performance as regular drivers, with as much as 11dB headroom in the sub-bass extension. The driver comes with IP58 ingress protection, making it a decent choice for use in active earbuds.</p><p>Another issue that&apos;s resolved with the Sycamore is designing the shell of the earbuds. With regular audio drivers, brands focus on the design and materials of the shell, but Housholder noted that as MEMS speakers are not as prone to back volume due to the "stiff and rigid silicon diaphragm," this isn&apos;t as big a consideration. That&apos;s a big deal for an audio manufacturer, and with the driver itself not taking up anywhere as much room, it should free up additional space for a larger battery or result in buds that are smaller.</p><p>So when will we get to see products with the new driver? Housholder noted that xMEMS will showcase prototypes at CES 2025, with mass production starting in Q4 2025 and initial consumer products debuting in 2026. Considering the number of design wins the brand managed with its earlier drivers, it shouldn&apos;t have many problems with the Sycamore, particularly given that it can be used with XR glasses and smartwatches in addition to earbuds.</p>

<ul><li>Instagram is testing a new feature that lets you reset content recommendations on the platform.</li><li>Users can start by hitting the reset button, which gives them a fresh start in watching reels and feeds and exploring tabs on Instagram.</li><li>The feature is primarily aimed at teens, as they are more prone to changing their passions and interests as they mature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you are hooked on content on Instagram, like its reels or interesting posts, that is because of the suggestions the social media platform provides by learning what you've liked or prefer to view the most. While there was no way to erase your recommendations before, Meta is now bringing a new button, which might likely provide a fresh start for your recommendations on Instagram.</p><p>Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/introducing-recommendations-reset-instagram">has announced</a> that Instagram is currently testing a new feature that allows users to reset recommendations, allowing them to clear the previous ones and start fresh. These recommendation-based content users generally see on Instagram's Explore, Reels, and Feed sections. Clearing them is seemingly easy with just a couple of taps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.17%;"><img id="ctJYYvoJKM9uX3Vvic8VPJ" name="instagram-reset-suggested-content" alt="Instagram Rest Suggested Content" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ctJYYvoJKM9uX3Vvic8VPJ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="523" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instagram notes in the announcement post that the emphasis of incorporating this new feature is primarily aimed at Teens. The platform wants to "give teens new ways to shape their Instagram experience" so that they can find their passions and interests as they evolve. Resetting occasionally might allow the app to learn those parameters and recommend new ones as they move forward.</p><p>Once people hit the new reset recommendations button, the app will start personalizing recommendations again to showcase relevant content based on their reactions and the accounts they often interact with.</p><p>During the resetting process, consumers are also allowed to check who they are following and can unfollow them right away if they are not interested in the respective accounts they're following.</p>
<p>After hitting reset, users can go to the explore tab again and look for content. If they like any new content, they can look for a three-dot menu and hit "Interested." Similarly, if the showcased content doesn't appease them, they can hit "Not Interested."</p><p>Instagram notes both these suggestions and further helps the social media app showcase preferred content in the future. If there are too many to deal with, the new reset button certainly comes in handy.</p><p>Although Instagram indicates that the new feature is currently in the testing phase, it will eventually roll out globally, which sounds promising.</p>
