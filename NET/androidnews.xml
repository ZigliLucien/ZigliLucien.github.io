<ul><li>The ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra is set to make its debut on February 6.</li><li>The phone will feature advanced 4K video capabilities, ensuring a sharp focus on the subject throughout filming.</li><li>Expected specs include the Snapdragon 8 Elite, a 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED display, up to 512GB storage, and 16GB of RAM.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>ASUS has officially announced the upcoming Zenfone 12 Ultra, a flagship that‚Äôs not following the compact phone trend.</p><p>The company revealed the news on X (formerly Twitter) that the Zenfone<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review"> 12 Ultra will launch on February 6. That‚Äôs a bit earlier than last year‚Äôs Zenfone</a> 11 Ultra, which came out in March, so it looks like ASUS is pushing up its release schedule.</p>

<p>ASUS' launch announcement comes with a sneak peek at its advanced videography features. A teaser image shows off a feature for 4K video, ensuring the subject stays sharp and clear no matter how the shot moves.</p><p>After ditching the compact design for the larger Zenfone 11 Ultra in 2024, ASUS seems set to stick with this strategy in 2025. There‚Äôs no sign of a smaller Zenfone 12 model, with all the buzz and official teasers pointing to the Zenfone 12 Ultra as the main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phone</a>.</p><p>Back in August 2024, reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/08/17/exclusive-asus-zenfone-12-ultra-surfaced-but-its-not-coming-right-away/" target="_blank">surfaced</a> that ASUS started working on the Zenfone 12 Ultra after it showed up in the IMEI database. There‚Äôs been talk that the Zenfone 12 Ultra might share some features with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ROG Phone 9</a> series, suggesting ASUS could be blending some of its top-tier tech across its flagship devices.</p><p>In November, a Bluetooth SIG listing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-bluetooth-sig/" target="_blank">revealed</a> a device with the same model number as the ROG Phone 9 series, sparking rumors that it could be the much-anticipated Zenfone 12 Ultra.</p><p>As for specs, the Zenfone 12 Ultra is expected to pack a punch with the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, a huge 5,800mAh battery, and a 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED display. It‚Äôll supposedly have IP68 dust and water resistance for durability, up to 512GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM.</p><p>ASUS also teased the role of AI in the Zenfone 12 Ultra, declaring on X, "Zenfone 12 Ultra unlocks the power of AI, so get ready to step into a new era of mobile photography excellence!"</p>

<hr>
<p>Multiple deadly wildfires in the Los Angeles area led <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a> and SpaceX to enable satellite texting for people impacted by the natural disaster in California. The feature uses Starlink satellites and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile-customers-direct-to-cell-beta-registration">was set to undergo beta testing by T-Mobile customers</a> early this year. That beta testing period is still on the way, but T-Mobile and SpaceX activated the service for Android users in Los Angeles to help customers stay connected.</p><p>‚ÄúT-Mobile and Starlink opened up T-Mobile Starlink Direct-to-Cellular service over impacted areas of Southern California to deliver wireless emergency alerts and SMS and enable 911 texting,‚Äù T-Mobile told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/t-mobile-and-spacex-turn-on-satellite-texting-for-los-angeles-fires/" target="_blank">CNET</a> on Thursday, Jan. 9 as firefighters struggled to contain the wildfires.</p><p>‚ÄúWhile SpaceX's direct-to-cell constellation has not been fully deployed, we are once again temporarily making this early test version available for those who need it most,‚Äù the wireless carrier continued.</p><p>Satellite connectivity enables T-Mobile customers with select Android phones to contact loved ones and emergency services when cellular networks are unavailable. T-Mobile told CNET that commercial power loss in the region caused cell networks in and around Los Angeles to go offline, but added that it had "restored roughly half of the sites that were impacted by commercial power loss."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/starlink-home-internet-review">Starlink</a> also announced the move in a post on X (formerly Twitter). ‚ÄúFor those in the Los Angeles area, the Starlink team and T-Mobile have enabled basic texting (SMS) through our Direct to Cell satellites,‚Äù the post explains. ‚ÄúYou can now text loved ones, text 911, and receive emergency alerts.‚Äù</p>

<p>New Year's resolutions have taken on a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure. Cold weather and returning to work sap your motivation. Then you hear excuses about Quitters Day ‚Äî how "most people" abandon their resolutions by the second Friday in January ‚Äî and settle back into your old routines because your resolutions were always doomed to fail. Convenient!</p><p>Apple referenced Quitters Day in its latest commercial, promising that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch</a> will give you "a little extra motivation" to "quit quitting." It's a nice idea, but as someone who's tested most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness smartwatches</a>, none of them can fundamentally change how you act by buzzing your wrist.</p><p>Watch alerts like hourly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">move reminders</a> or having to log meals in your health app quickly become a source of guilt and annoyance because you feel like you don't have the bandwidth or energy for them. It's far too easy to turn these features off or stop using them until the guilt of abandoning your 2025 goals ebbs away.</p><p>Smartwatches are only built to reinforce habits and hobbies that you already enjoy, not magically make you love exercise or counting calories.</p>

<p>Despite all that, I believe in using tech and New Year's resolutions to motivate myself. They work for me! I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/tech-and-apps-i-used-to-lose-30-pounds">lost 30 pounds last year</a>, ran more miles, hiked more steps than in 2023, and finished more personal projects ‚Äî all with a Google Doc of resolutions and a smartwatch to motivate me. Believe it or not, I had <em>fun</em> following my resolutions.</p><p>Keeping in mind that I don't know what <em>your</em> New Year's resolutions for 2025 might be, let me help you "quit quitting" by running through a resolutions template that I think anyone can easily follow and that you can start any time or month, not just January.</p>
<h2 id="set-monthly-goals-with-moving-goalposts-2">Set monthly goals with moving goalposts</h2>

<p>I'm no psychologist, but I think it's pretty obvious that people with the weight and pressure of a <em>year</em>'s expectations will quit when they can't keep up with ambitious goals. If you want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">walk 10,000 steps a day</a> to lose weight and then fail to do so a few days in a row, you won't bother restarting because you've already failed!</p><p>Now look at my personal walking and steps resolutions for 2025, above and below. Each month has a main gold-medal target ‚Äî I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-i-challenged-olympics-track-and-field-athletes-and-why-you-should-too">love the Olympics</a> ‚Äî with bronze and silver offramps for months where I fall short and a level above gold in case I'm feeling especially motivated that month.</p><p>Why organize my goals this way? Simple: Whether your goal is related to steps, calories, or whatever, you're going to have sick days, tough weeks at work, or even whole months where life's roadbumps derail or distract you. So, you need to plan for failure if you want to succeed.</p>

<p>Even if I'm off my target pace for a given month, I can still hit my lesser targets, so I have a reason to persist. If I have a bad month, I still have 11 other months to shoot for gold; why quit?</p><p>If you're trying to read more books or cook new recipes, it's less daunting to aim for two a month than 20 that year. Maybe you skip a few months or only hit your backup silver goal with one book/recipe that month. But it doesn't matter: you're still outpacing last year when you gave up entirely.</p><p>The same goes for vaguer goals like making an effort to see friends more often or trying to drink or vape less often. Use an artificial monthly goal (only drink X times in January, plan a board game night for February) until it feels more natural without handrails, and don't give up entirely just because you chickened out the first month.</p><p>Eventually, these monthly goals will build a foundation of habits, so you do these things without needing to track them.</p>
<h2 id="treat-your-resolutions-like-a-living-document-2">Treat your resolutions like a living document</h2>
<p>One reason to make your resolutions monthly instead of annual is that you can change your targets if you realize you made them too easy or difficult but still want to keep at it. Plus, you can add <em>new</em> goals at any time.</p><p>It's hard to think about a goal like "swim more at the local pool" or "go hiking more" when it's snowing and the trails are too muddy to climb. Some ideas don't apply ‚Äî or won't come to you ‚Äî until months from now.</p><p>My advice is to make more short-term resolutions, like an aspirational to-do list. If you want to try homebrewing beer or joining a local sports league, add it to your resolutions doc with a generous timeframe for when to start or sign up so it doesn't fade out of your mind like other past fancies.</p><p>Adding new resolutions that you can quickly achieve throughout the year ‚Äî and then moving on to something new ‚Äî is the best way to keep things fresh. Otherwise, you'll get bored tracking the same stats and goals month after month.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vDevfVsBWvJZUefw5yyrq8" name="San-Francisco-Bridge-Half-Marathon-Golden-Gate.jpeg" alt="Me standing in front of the Golden Gate Bridge during the San Francisco Bridge Half Marathon." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vDevfVsBWvJZUefw5yyrq8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Me, running the San Francisco Half Marathon </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>People don't like to think about difficult things, and most resolutions <em>are</em> difficult because they require changing how you lived your life in the past months or years.</p><p>I'm the kind of weirdo who loves running, so aiming to run more miles or beat my fastest half-marathon PR in 2025 is aspirational rather than painful to consider. You should associate your goals with positivity, not a chore or burden, or it's much harder to stick with it.</p><p>If you're invested in difficult resolutions like budgeting or cutting calories, make your overall New Year's resolutions more positive by throwing some fun gimmies onto your list, with no monthly timeline or difficulty curve.</p><p>Some of my resolutions are "beat 20 new video games in 2025" and "finish 12 new seasons of TV shows." It's no effort for me to finish these "resolutions," and I probably would have done so anyway! But that's the point.</p><p>My resolutions Google Doc is full of movies, shows, games, and books that I've been looking forward to. Checking them off my list lets me feel like taking care of my mental health is an accomplishment, and it feels more satisfying than sitting around watching YouTube or TikTok.</p><p>Plus, while I'm deciding which fun thing to do that night, I also scroll through my <em>harder</em> fitness or home improvement goals. Bribing myself with a fun resolution first makes it easier to plan out a difficult workout or project the following day.</p>

Hourly stand reminders, walking more steps, using calorie apps like MyFitnessPal, and other tech tools are accessible ways to get healthier.</p><p>In my case, I use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> to guide my runs and then check my monthly stats like mileage, steps, and race times in the app to transfer over to my resolutions doc. It doesn't have to be Garmin; if your smartwatch of choice doesn't organize stats monthly, export to Strava or another fitness app that does because it's too easy to lose track if you log every activity manually.</p><p>Some fitness apps (like Garmin and Strava) have monthly challenges, but I think those are cherry-on-top rewards for working hard, not real motivators. If you start slacking off and stop closing your daily rings or see your VO2 Max fall, it's too easy to refuse to open the app because you know you won't like seeing your results.</p><p>A Google Doc or another note app can always remain open more easily, and you can highlight the stats <em>you</em> care about instead of getting overwhelmed with irrelevant data.</p>

<hr>
<p>YouTube Music just gave the 'Top Songs' section on artist pages a welcome update. The redesign aims to make it easier for fans to dive into an artist's biggest hits.</p><p>Before the update, artist pages showcased a list of five curated Top Songs upfront. You could tap 'More' to see the full list or start playback right away, with tracks flowing smoothly through the 'Up Next' queue.</p><p>The latest change, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/10/youtube-music-top-songs-2/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, revamps the Top Songs section on artist pages with a scrollable carousel. Each page shows four tracks, and you can swipe through five pages to check out all 20 songs.</p><p>This new layout makes it super easy to check out the top hits of a newly discovered artist since it eliminates the need to tap in order to expand the Top Songs section. All you need to do is swipe through and explore their music effortlessly.</p><p>Nevertheless, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> keeps it simple with a handy 'Play All' button in the revamped interface, letting you instantly play all the songs in the carousel.</p>

<p>The carousel's design closely mirrors the 'Quick Picks' layout from the Home tab. This cohesive style also carries over to other sections like 'Long listens' and 'Trending.'</p><p>According to 9to5Google, the revamped Top Songs section is widely available on Android and iOS, but some users haven‚Äôt seen the new carousel or Play All button yet. Looks like YouTube Music is rolling it out in phases.</p><p>YouTube Music has been on a roll with updates lately. The latest tweak follows the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-monthly-audience-stat-test-detailed">introduction of a new "monthly audience" metric</a> on artist pages, giving fans a glimpse into an artist's reach and listener engagement. Late last year, the platform also added a much-requested feature: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-gains-a-crucial-feature-for-podcast-listening-and-sharing">shareable links</a>. Now, users can share specific timestamps in songs, podcasts, or other audio, making it easier to recommend the exact moment that hits just right, like the main YouTube app.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Oppo Find N5 is tipped to launch soon, rumored to feature a super slim design with a titanium frame.</li><li>Leaks suggest the Find N5 (and consequently the OnePlus Open 2) could be the thinnest foldable yet, possibly beating the Honor Magic V3, which currently holds that title.</li><li>Key features include a Hasselblad triple-camera system with periscope lens, Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, satellite communication, and a "nearly 6,000mAh" battery with wireless charging.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Fresh reports from China hint at the Oppo Find N5's upcoming launch, and it's tipped to flaunt a super slim design wrapped in a titanium frame.</p><p>Originally rumored for a 2024 release, the Find N5 (from which the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> is taking inspiration) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-open-2-might-launch-much-later-than-we-hoped">faced some unexpected delays</a>. There were even rumors it might get scrapped altogether. But recent leaks have put those worries to rest, showing that OnePlus and Oppo are still committed to making this book-style foldable a reality.</p><p>In a Weibo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5121184775012675" target="_blank">post</a>, leaker Digital Chat Station shared that the upcoming Oppo Find N5 will feature a titanium chassis. They also claim that it will be the thinnest foldable phone yet (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-Open-2-World-s-next-thinnest-foldable-smartphone-tipped-to-be-made-with-titanium.945100.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>).</p><p>If these claims hold true, the upcoming Oppo model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-thinner-design-rumors">could dethrone the Honor Magic V3 as the slimmest book-style foldable</a>. The Magic V3 currently measures 9.2mm folded and 4.35mm unfolded. This would set a new benchmark in the foldable market, though the leaker hasn't shared specific dimensions of the upcoming device.</p><p>While previous leaks have teased the OnePlus Open 2's look, they haven't confirmed the materials used. However, the idea of a titanium body seems plausible, given how popular this lightweight yet durable metal has become in premium phones.</p><p>Titanium‚Äôs strength and lightness make it a top pick for flagships like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and the upcoming S25 Ultra. So, if the OnePlus Open 2 uses titanium, it would fit right in with the latest design trends and further cement its status as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">premium foldable</a>.</p><p>In a separate Weibo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5888095979/P8MOkkQkw" target="_blank">post</a>, leaker Smart Pikachu shared a detailed look at the device‚Äôs key features. The design focuses on durability, with a triple-camera setup co-engineered with Hasselblad, including a periscope lens for better optics.</p><p>The tipster also claims that the phone will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and support satellite communication. It could also pack a "nearly 6,000mAh" battery with wireless charging support.</p><p>Smart Pikachu also hinted at a February 2025 launch for the Oppo Find N5. This timing gives OnePlus a solid chance to lead the foldable market. With the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 not expected until later in the year, the Open 2 could have a strong, uncontested run, helping it grab market share and build a loyal following before its biggest competitor arrives.</p>

Unlike their larger foldable counterparts that open to reveal a larger tablet-like display, these phones go for a more compact approach by shrinking down to half their size, often with a cover screen for basic controls over notifications and more.</p><p>There isn't much in the way of added functionality as you get with larger foldables, but flip phones go for the "less is more" approach, which I have become quite enamored with in recent years. In the absence of compact "mini" phones, flip phones offer a nice medium, in a sense offering the best of both worlds.</p><p>However, while the experience of using one is fun, flip phones are far from perfect, and in some ways, they are a half step down from a conventional smartphone. Companies like Samsung and Motorola have worked for years to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> up to speed with traditional smartphone models, and I think they're almost there.</p><p>So, what do I think a perfect flip phone look like, and could we achieve this?</p>

<h2 id="size-matters-2">Size matters</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vbzXkAgieD2nDxmoFAFZfC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-13.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 folded on a ledge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vbzXkAgieD2nDxmoFAFZfC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4149" height="2334" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Flip phones are often seen as a more compact version of a conventional smartphone, which is true in some aspects. After all, you're basically folding down a phone to half its size. However, that introduces a new problem: the phone becomes twice as thick when folded.</p><p>This isn't that big of a problem with larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> (unless you're Samsung) because there's enough area to spread out the batteries and other components so that folding the phone gives you roughly the same thickness as a traditional smartphone, with the device getting <em>thinner</em> when unfolded.</p><p>With flip phones, the opposite occurs, and the phone gets thicker because you have to somehow squeeze two batteries, two displays, a folding hinge mechanism, and all the other components into the same size as a regular phone. The result is a phone that's often thicker than a folded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and even a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> (which is saying something).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4221px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="YRQTJ9P6J9rk777bFSQAcR" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hinge.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRQTJ9P6J9rk777bFSQAcR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4221" height="2374" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The downside of this is that in my pocket, the phone doesn't take up as much surface area, which is nice, but it does protrude a lot more, which can look a little funny. More importantly, this thickness has prevented me from consistently using cases on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review" target="_blank">Razr Plus 2024</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> because they just add even more thickness to the phones. And while I love how the Razr feels without a case, I'd feel much better having one on than not, but not if it makes the phone unnecessarily bulky.</p><p>My hope is that, somehow, some way, companies are able to minimize the thickness of the phones, perhaps by using thinner and denser batteries or tweaking the hinge designs even further. Of course, this has to be done without trade-offs like reduced battery life or compromising the integrity of the device.</p><p>I don't expect this to be figured out in 2025, but I hope to see companies working toward this goal</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Xk33zq3Ca5579tvjuvpsre" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-16.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 display outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xk33zq3Ca5579tvjuvpsre.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've never been a fan of the tall 22:9 aspect ratio that flip phones have adopted. It's one thing when Sony started going with 21:9 aspect ratios on Xperia phones to achieve a more "cinematic" look, but there doesn't seem to be an aesthetic reason behind the tall screens on flip phones.</p><p>I find tall phones to be a bit of a nuisance for the simple reason that I tend to use my phone one-handed, and I know I'm not alone in this. It's one thing to have a display closing in on seven inches, but it's another thing to make it so that I have to completely shift the way I'm holding my phone in order to reach UI elements toward the top of the display.</p><p>Of course, we could start asking OEMs and developers to start changing their UI to better accommodate this, but that's an article for another time.</p><p>One flip phone that I think nailed this is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-razr-2022-launch">Motorola Razr 2022</a>, which features a more natural-feeling 20:9 aspect ratio. It's a bummer that the phone never made it to the States and that Motorola switched to the taller aspect ratio in subsequent models, but I hope companies can move away from this</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3984px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XwmSSrLrKvQfobwQaJ9hSN" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-cameras.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XwmSSrLrKvQfobwQaJ9hSN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3984" height="2241" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Flip phones aren't known for having the best cameras, especially when compared to more traditional flagship smartphones, and it's really a shame. After all, I'm spending the same amount of money or more for a foldable, so I should have camera quality that matches the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best Android camera phones</a>.</p><p>That's not to say it's all bad; in fact, flip phone cameras are getting better, as we've seen with the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Motorola Razr Plus 2024. It's not just a flip phone thing; companies like Google and Samsung tend to skimp out on camera sensors when it comes to foldable phones. It could be a size constraint thing or a cost issue, but either way, something's gotta change if we're gonna continue to shell out $1,000+ for a phone just to get lower-quality cameras.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3932px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="sxSwtaPe4AoDHdJBCD9iT8" name="OPPO-Find-N3-Flip-review-12.jpg" alt="OPPO Find N3 Flip tented from the side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sxSwtaPe4AoDHdJBCD9iT8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3932" height="2212" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not only that but flip phones are often constrained by the number of cameras they offer. Most tend to sport two rear cameras, and while a select few from companies like OPPO and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-pocket-2-launch">Huawei</a> have offered a third sensor, it's certainly not the norm. I would love to see more flip phones with a telephoto camera in addition to a wide and ultrawide.</p><p>Samsung has sort of worked out a happy medium with the Z Flip 6 by improving the digital zoom quality using AI. It's a decent effort to get past the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera, but a software solution can only go so far.</p><p>If you want a good camera system, you would actually save money by purchasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>, which has a third sensor and pretty great cameras. Even the cheapest "entry-level" flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> comes with a triple-camera system ‚Äî with a 3x telephoto camera ‚Äî and costs hundreds less, highlighting the discrepancy between traditional smartphones and flip phones.</p>
<h2 id="the-other-camera-problem-2">The other camera problem</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="66FMYDhBrM6ELGfymJGhCn" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-10.jpg" alt="Google Messages on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/66FMYDhBrM6ELGfymJGhCn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As much as I would like to see more cameras on flip phones, that introduces a new problem that OEMs have to figure out: where are these cameras going?</p><p>Because of the ever-expanding cover screens on flip phones, OEMs have to get creative when it comes to the placement of the camera modules. The cameras have to hold space on the same square cover panel as the external display, and they can't obstruct the cover screen experience too much. OEMs have tried different methods with varying levels of success, but they all seem to have downsides.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 has one of the largest external screens you'll find on a flip phone, but because it takes up the <em>entire</em> cover panel, the company opted for cutouts for the cameras and flash. It works mostly fine, but because the cameras tend to cover certain app elements, Motorola lets you shift the app upwards in a condensed view to access that part of the app. Again, it works fine when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">using apps on the Razr cover screen</a>, but it's an extra step when doing something like sending a message and trying to tap the <strong>Send</strong> button, often located on the bottom right side.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vpvT2fjNbbhfNrHPegS9E8" name="TECNO-Phantom-V-Flip-2-review-15.jpg" alt="TECNO Phantom V Flip 2 cover screen with YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vpvT2fjNbbhfNrHPegS9E8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Samsung went with an awkward cutout on the cover screen to avoid the cameras completely. The problem with this method is that the overall <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">app experience on the cover screen</a> feels uncomfortably scrunched up. Meanwhile, other companies like OPPO and TECNO moved their external displays or software experiences to one side of the cover panel to avoid the cameras, providing a fully vertical app view. While it seemingly makes more sense, just about every app element is minimized, which actually feels less convenient in actual use.</p><p>So, how can we have both a large cover screen and a multi-camera system on a flip phone without one obstructing the other? The only way I can imagine this might work is to adopt under-display cameras so they won't get in the way, providing an unrestricted cover screen experience. Unfortunately, that could result in degraded camera quality, which takes me back to my previous problem with flip phones.</p>
<h2 id="catching-up-where-it-matters-2">Catching up where it matters</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zQ76E72LUqCkBT9UtXVf3G" name="TECNO-Phantom-V-Flip-2-review-24.jpg" alt="TECNO Phantom V Flip 2 next to its 70W charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zQ76E72LUqCkBT9UtXVf3G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I've stated, flip phones have come a long way from where they started, and I've been happy to see companies like Samsung and Motorola improve year after year.</p><p>In addition to improved camera quality, flip phones have become much more durable and are not able to withstand drops better. They can also be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-waterproof">fully submerged in water</a>, and we've even started seeing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-waterproof">official dust resistance</a> ratings appear on phones, which should give consumers more peace of mind.</p><p>Battery life is one area that still lags, but that's slowly improving as well. In fact, companies have managed to catch up with and even exceed some traditional flagship smartphones. Samsung and Motorola fit 4,000mAh batteries into last year's models, bringing roughly all-day battery life to their phones. TECNO and Xiaomi took it to the next level with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">Phantom V Flip 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Mix Flip</a>, offering massive 4,720mah and 4,780mAh batteries, respectively.</p><p>Those two phones also feature 70W and 67W charging, much faster than the speeds on Samsung's top-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vzdGhqQuamcr8SWEimpYTJ" name="Android Central Best of 2024" alt="Xiaomi Mix Flip unfolded" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vzdGhqQuamcr8SWEimpYTJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Flip phones are also reaching lower prices, making it a great time to buy one if you've been on the fence. With phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia Flip 5G</a>, you can snag a foldable for as low as $500. That's about the same as you'd pay for some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> that don't flip, except now you get a much more interesting smartphone.</p><p>These are just some of the ways we've seen flip phones evolve over the years since their resurgence. With these changes and improvements, flip phones are becoming much more mainstream than their larger-screened foldable counterparts, and I can't wait to see how the form factor improve in 2025 and beyond.</p>
<h2 id="my-perfect-flip-phone-2">My perfect flip phone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aPWe8Qrh2AMDzZjTbs6aY6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-4.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPWe8Qrh2AMDzZjTbs6aY6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that I've outlined my current issues with flip phones and the ways the form factor has improved, it's got me thinking about what my perfect flip phone would look like in an ideal world where I could have my way when designing and building my own phone without restrictions.</p><p>Of course, no phone is perfect (although some of them come close), and my thoughts are likely to change throughout the year and in years to follow. For now, this is what I would like to see in a flip phone:</p><p>The device would feature a design similar to the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, complete with curved edges and an expansive cover screen. It would have a 6.7-inch display with a 20:9 aspect ratio and measure no more than 11mm when folded (roughly half that when unfolded).</p><p>The battery would have a capacity of no less than 4,000mAh, and the phone would charge at 67W with support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-s25-could-bring-qi2-revolution">Qi2</a> (with built-in magnets).</p><p>There would be three 50MP rear cameras hidden under the cover screen, including wide, ultrawide, and telephoto sensors, with camera quality matching something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. The front-facing camera would also be an under-display unit.</p><p>The UI? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, but with the ability to natively run apps out of the box without needing to rely on Good Lock.</p><p>Basically, I want a phone built by Motorola with Samsung's software and Google's (or OnePlus's) cameras. Much of this sounds a bit farfetched, although who knows what flip phones will look like in a few years, especially when Google and Apple decide to launch their own models. Until then, I'll be looking forward to whatever Motorola or Samsung bring us in 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Google dropped Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2.1 to fine-tune connectivity, customization, performance, and stability in the beta channel.</li><li>The update includes January 2025 security patches and fixes issues like app crashes, freezes, and random reboots.</li><li>It also fixes a weird bug where Emoji Workshop settings pop up when changing wallpapers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1hxn904/android_15_qpr2_beta_21_now_available/" target="_blank">pushed out</a> Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2.1 to Pixels mainly to fix some pesky bugs.</p><p>The latest update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-2-is-here-with-our-first-look-at-the-working-linux-terminal-app">builds on Android 15 and QPR2</a>, bringing tweaks to improve connectivity, customization, performance, and overall stability in the beta channel. For developers, it‚Äôs their chance to test apps against the new features and system changes, making sure everything runs smoothly for users.</p><p>This release is pretty light on changes compared to the big QPR2 Beta 2 list, but that‚Äôs what you‚Äôd expect from a point release like this.</p><p>This update, with the build number BP11.241121.013, packs in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/january-2025-security-patch-rolling-out-for-google-pixel-devices-heres-whats-fixed">January 2025 security patches</a> along with Pixel-specific tweaks. The main focus is to fix those annoying issues like apps crashing, system freezes, and random reboots that some beta users have been dealing with.</p><p>Here's what's fixed:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed several issues that sometimes caused a device to freeze, crash, or restart unexpectedly. (Issue #380500068, Issue #381894854, Issue #378856187, Issue #384447026, Issue #384885640, Issue #385056337, Issue #385126181)</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Emoji Workshop options opened when selecting wallpapers from other categories in system settings. (Issue #384629413)</li><li>Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability and connectivity.</li></ul>
<p>On top of that, this update fixes a weird bug where the Emoji Workshop settings would randomly pop up when choosing a new wallpaper.</p><p>This update also brings some solid improvements to system stability and network reliability.</p><p>Like previous Android 15 updates, this one works with the Pixel 6, 7, 8, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">9 series</a>, as well as the Pixel Fold, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, and Pixel Tablet. If you‚Äôve got one of these devices and want to try out the beta, just head to Google‚Äôs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta" target="_blank">registration page</a>. There, you can pick the device you want to use for testing out the beta updates.</p>

The two words to pay close attention to in that sentence are <em>possibly</em> and <em>Korea</em>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> Subscription Club is already a thing in Samsung's home country for its line of smart appliances. The service launched in December to a very positive consumer reaction, and subscription sales already accompany 30% of purchases at Samsung stores. People in South Korea love Samsung and its software and are willing to buy it.</p><p>People in the U.S. aren't as enthusiastic.</p>

<p>That's why you might have seen news about Samsung's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-phone-subscription-club-service-detailed">phone subscription</a>" in the news this week. Thanks to some rather questionable articles on the matter, people assumed that Samsung was introducing some sort of subscription pricing to use the phones we're about to see at Galaxy Unpacked.</p><p>To be very clear ‚Äî we're not. This is <strong>only</strong> for special AI services, even if it makes its way to the U.S. I hate that we call this a phone subscription because it's not; it's a software subscription that is no different than what Adobe or Norton offer for your PC. Phone stuff is weird sometimes.</p>
<p>Enough about what the AI Club is and that it might expand. Let's talk about the reaction. Why do people hate it when Samsung does the exact same thing that Apple and Google already are doing, for the same type of service?</p><p>If you use a new iPhone, you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">Apple Intelligence</a> features free until 2027, but to get the most from it you can connect it to a paid ChatGPT subscription that costs $20 a month.</p><p>If you use an Android phone in select countries, you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> for free. To get the most from Gemini, you can subscribe to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> plan that includes Gemini Advanced, which costs $20 a month.</p><p>Samsung has already said that all Galaxy AI features are free for phone and tablet users until at least the end of 2025. It <em>might</em> include an AI subscription tier in South Korea.</p><p>If it's OK for Apple and Google, it should be OK for Samsung.</p>

<p>Judging by the internet tech prosumer reaction, it's clearly not OK for Samsung to do it. That's because of the way we view Samsung in the West.</p><p>When you think of Samsung, you probably think of phones and the parts used to make phones. Samsung is well known as an electronics manufacturer and almost every phone has some Samsung parts inside of it. Even an iPhone.</p><p>Samsung is really good at this, too. There is no consumer outrage about the performance of a Samsung display on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16</a>. Samsung's memory and controllers are great and part of what makes your flagship phone so fast. The company's phones and tablets are no slouch either, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best you can buy</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to software, there isn't the same enthusiasm. The company seems to have finally built a great version of Android with recent versions of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI</a>, but most tech enthusiasts don't use Samsung's phone software very much or at all.</p><p>Samsung's apps are like the Stocks app on an iPhone and end up crammed in a junk folder if they can't be disabled. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/bixby">Bixby</a> (which isn't really that bad) is a laughing stock among Android enthusiasts, and what Samsung did to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsungs-tizen-powered-z1-rival-android-one-if-not-all-android">Tizen</a> should send some people straight to Dante's Inferno.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="vCKKSdoGMEBfAG7KTfHgtE" name="tizen-z1-1.jpg" alt="Tizen on a Samsung phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCKKSdoGMEBfAG7KTfHgtE.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div></figure>
<p>This is what U.S. tech enthusiasts think of Samsung's software. You don't have to look very hard to find people saying they wish they could buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> that runs Google's Pixel version of Android, and there are plenty of people trying to hack just that onto their expensive phones. Most consumers don't know any better or even care and just use what's there, but die-hard techies are the people who get vocal on the internet about everything.</p>
<p>I would never pay for an AI subscription, at least until it offers more than a different way to feed me information that's already available. When that happens, I don't care if Samsung, Apple, or Google offers it ‚Äî I'll buy whatever suits my needs best.</p><p>More than likely, we won't have to worry about this at all here in North America and this was just a handy excuse to complain about Samsung and AI in general.</p>

First, the specs of the devices leaked online, followed by the full renders with over 75 odd pictures of what we think is the actual Samsung S25 series.</p><p>The morning of Jan. 10 started off with pictures of official renders of the alleged Samsung Galaxy S25 series that were posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-design" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>. First up we see the S25 Ultra pictures that show rounded corners and an entirely flat display and sides for the phone. The back of the device is shown with its rumored four-camera array and lenses that could have black rims. The publication states the Galaxy S25 Ultra could see the following colors upon release: Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silver Blue, and Titanium White Silver.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus pictures reveal that they look a lot like their previous models, and each device features rounded corners, a triple camera array, and thin bezels. However, the only visible change is with the lenses, as those could grab the same black rings as the Ultra model. They are said to come in four colorways: Silver Shadow, Ice Blue, Navy, and Mint.</p>

<p>Along with the renders, the entire spec sheet of the models was also leaked by the same publication. The trio's entire spec sheet shows that the Ultra is rumored to grab a 6.9-inch screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. For its cameras, the device could see a 200MP primary lens, a 50MP ultra-wide-angle camera, a 50MP periscope telephoto camera, and a 10MP telephoto.</p><p>The S25 and S25 Plus could see a 6.2-inch Full HD Plus display and a 6.7-inch display, respectively. They will have a triple camera array featuring a 50MP primary camera, a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 10MP telephoto lens. Both handsets will also have a 12MP selfie shooter on the front.</p>

It finally upgraded the PWM dimming rate to match the iPhone, and Samsung's new anti-glare filter made it easier to see in the sunlight.</p><p>But problems were brewing under the surface and have slowly cropped up over the last year, leading us to wonder if Samsung will fix them in the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series.</p><p>From grainy displays to dull colors, Samsung has some work to do on the quality and configuration of the display itself. We've also seen Galaxy S24 Ultra models with permanent smudge marks on the screen, a sign that the oil-resistant layer is wearing off prematurely.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung continues to be one of the only remaining companies that don't offer eye-friendly dimming options for folks sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> and flickering LEDs. Here's everything Samsung needs to improve on the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display to retake the crown for the phone with the best display.</p>
<h2 id="grainy-displays-2">Grainy displays</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1796px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HaN6EnSjhANoWUyrqSgZPc" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-display-mura.jpg" alt="An extreme close up of the Galaxy S24 Ultra's panel at a brightness under 10%." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HaN6EnSjhANoWUyrqSgZPc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1796" height="1010" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Early on, users complained of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-grainy-mura-problem-reported">grainy displays</a>. While this is mostly noticeable at low brightness levels, some users have noted that they can see the grain even at regular or high brightness. This problem, technically known as "mura," is one we haven't seen so widely since the days of the Google Pixel 2 XL and it persists on Galaxy S24 Ultra displays today. You can see the uneven pattern in the image above which I captured using a microscope on my Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>The grainy issue is caused by manufacturing defects where adjacent pixels aren't as bright as each other, making it look spotty or grainy. Pixels on an OLED are all individually lit and part of the manufacturing and calibration process is ensuring that each pixel meets a specific uniformity level.</p><p>It's not clear if Samsung is skipping this step or if the M13 generation is just particularly prone to this graininess issue. What is clear, however, is that no other phone with an OLED screen suffers from this issue in such a major way. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammyfans.com/2024/11/18/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-fixes-grainy-display-without-m14-oled/">November rumor</a> says that Samsung fixed the problem in the Galaxy S25 Ultra by using M13+ panels, but we'll have to wait and see if that's the case.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-smudges-2">Permanent smudges</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WYyF49Mn6WpPDz9jXKmFEG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-smudgy-screen" alt="Smudges on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WYyF49Mn6WpPDz9jXKmFEG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everyone has had to wipe down their smartphone display from time to time to remove smudges and dirt, but some unfortunate Galaxy S24 Ultra users have found that the smudges on their screens <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-display-coating-premature-wear-out-3509276/">never go away</a>.</p><p>This is believed to be caused by a premature degradation of the oleophobic coating on the outside of the display. This coating is applied to glass to keep fingerprints and smudges at a minimum, as it's naturally resistant to water, oils, and other liquids.</p><p>The result is a display that looks permanently dirty, and only a replacement of the glass will fix the issue. Worse yet, an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s24-ultra-display-smudge-poll-results-3511629/">Android Authority poll</a> shows that potentially 50% or more of Galaxy S24 Ultra users are experiencing this problem. Our advice for Galaxy S24 Ultra owners without this problem is to get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-ultra-screen-protectors">good Galaxy S24 Ultra screen protector</a> on your phone immediately.</p><p>Samsung <em>needs</em> to fix this problem on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It's non-negotiable for a $1,200+ smartphone.</p>
<h2 id="better-dimming-options-2">Better dimming options</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="t9cRdEYEm2C7PAfierAyAU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-one-ui-7-multitasking-01" alt="The new multitasking UI in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t9cRdEYEm2C7PAfierAyAU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As more and more research piles up, it's clear that using PWM dimming on displays and LED bulbs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">is causing health problems</a>. Since I began writing about this problem nearly two years ago, I've been able to help lots of people get rid of the headaches they'd been experiencing daily by recommending smartphones and light bulbs that don't flicker.</p><p>Unfortunately, Samsung is one of the worst offenders of flickering displays. Those displays are only getting harsher and more painful every year since companies are obsessed with making them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">brighter and brighter</a>. The solution is extraordinarily simple, but Samsung so far has refused to talk about it or make any sort of accessibility changes for the betterment of its users' long-term health.</p><p>U.S. users, in particular, have almost no flicker-free options to choose from since Samsung, Google, and Apple all now equip every phone they make with flickering displays. Samsung has a real opportunity to get things right with the Galaxy S25 series and take the lead on eye health as the largest smartphone manufacturer in the world.</p><p>If companies like OnePlus, Nothing, Vivo, Xiaomi, Oppo, and many other brands can do it, Samsung can too.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-forget-the-fans-2">Don't forget the fans</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4gpMuHf4NvR79YBDgV2mkc" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-good-lock-module.jpg" alt="S24 Ultra showcasing Good Lock modules" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4gpMuHf4NvR79YBDgV2mkc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The last problem is the least egregious but one that probably irritated fans the most. At launch, the Galaxy S24 Ultra's display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-washed-out-display-is-intentional">was duller than previous Galaxy flagships</a>.</p><p>I praised the more realistic colors of the display in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra review</a>, and while Samsung did an excellent job of tweaking the colors to make them more realistic, the company seemingly forgot that some of its users love vibrant, highly saturated colors.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/first-major-galaxy-s24-patch">released a patch</a> about a month after the S24 Ultra's release addressing the issue and providing a vibrancy slider for folks that wanted bolder colors. Hopefully, the company won't forget this option when it launches the Galaxy S25 Ultra sometime soon.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The United States has added technology giant China-based Tencent to a list of companies designated as partners with the Chinese military, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Tencent is one of the ten biggest companies in the world, with ownership or investment in multiple game developers and publishers, and is the developer of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-wechat-and-why-trump-banning-it">WeChat</a>, one of the world's largest social media and messaging platforms.</p><p>Previously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tiktok-wechat-be-banned-us-app-stores-sunday-september-20">WeChat was specifically named to be banned</a> along with TikTok by the first Trump administration, but this was halted by a federal judge and officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/biden-undos-trumps-wechat-and-tiktok-bans">undone by the Biden administration. </a></p><p>Now, it appears the whole mess is happening again, albeit for a different reason this time.</p>
<p>In the past, concerns over WeChat centered around data collection and retention by China. This time, Tencent ‚Äî WeChat's parent company ‚Äî is under scrutiny because the U.S. thinks it has ties to the Chinese military. In statements to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337489/tencent-catl-us-defense-department-chinese-military-companies">The Verge</a> and Bloomberg, Tencent has denied these allegations and says it will work with the Department of Defense to be removed from this list.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="XLxKLTsUMCHMojknJA2bxG" name="tencent.jpg" alt="Tencent hallway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XLxKLTsUMCHMojknJA2bxG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="532" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Zhu Min / Zuma Press)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the meantime, being on the list doesn't block anyone from using Tencent's services or gaming titles. You can still play Valorant or League of Legends, and WeChat use in the States won't be interrupted in any way. It does, however, deal quite a blow to a company's reputation in the West, and Tencent's stock prices fell over seven percentage points with the news.</p>
<p>So what <em>does</em> this mean? WeChat is the brand most affected by anything that happens with Tencent because it is the company's biggest platform by far. With approximately 1 billion users in China alone, the platform dwarfs most other services of its type. It's worth noting that there are also over 4 million WeChat users in the U.S. who would be affected by any governmental action against Tencent.</p><p>Which could be coming. The Trump 2.0 administration will be as unpredictable as it was the first time whenever it comes to dealings with China. We could see this develop into a fill-on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-losing-access-android-updates-google-support-after-trump-trade-ban">Huawei-style banning</a> should the president decide to do it. We could also see it just go away if it's shown that Tencent really doesn't belong on this list. That is exactly what happened with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-latest-be-blacklisted-trump-administration">Xiaomi</a> when it was found to have been added in error in 2021.</p><p>Tencent was also in hot water with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/tencent-removes-two-directors-epic-games-and-relinquishes-its-right-unilaterally-appoint">Department of Justice</a>, which claims there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-plans-get-epic-games-antitrust-motion-dismissed">antitrust</a> violations with the way Tencent and Epic Games (Tencent owns 35% of Epic) were running their Board of Directors. This has no direct relationship with the addition to any DoD lists but is ammunition should further action be considered.</p><p>In short, if you use WeChat on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a> you don't have anything to worry about yet. Tomorrow, however, is another day.</p>

<ul><li>Shokz announced the OpenFit 2 wireless open-ear earbuds at CES 2025 on Tuesday.</li><li>The OpenFit 2 have 11 hours of battery per charge, dual low- and high-frequency drivers in each earbud, and IP55 water resistance.</li><li>The new earbuds are 1g heavier but have improved Bluetooth, tweaked earhooks, and a new physical button for controls.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Shokz announced the successor to my favorite wireless earbuds at CES 2025 on Tuesday, but it took me three days to see the news. Even though I'm out of the loop, I decided to cover the announcement late. I'm just that excited about it.</p><p>Ever since I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-review">Shokz OpenFit</a> wireless earbuds in late 2023, I've abandoned my old earbuds and worn them almost exclusively. Over a year of wearing them for training runs, hikes, and races, I've grown dependent upon their open-ear fit for keeping my situational awareness and letting my eardrums relax, while acknowledging some annoying flaws with them over time.</p><p>Now it looks like the Shokz OpenFit 2 will fix most (if not all) of my complaints with the first-gen earbuds.</p><p>Like the original OpenFit and the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openswim-pro-and-openfit-air-review">OpenFit Air</a>, the OpenFit 2 has a silicone earhook that lets the speaker sit directly over your ear, directing sound inside while leaving it open to hear your surroundings. It's a nice alternative to bone conduction headphones (like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openrun-pro-2-review">Shokz OpenRun Pro 2</a>) if you're not a fan of them.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Shokz OpenFit have a relatively average battery life, finicky touch controls that frequently lead to dropped phone calls, and softer sound compared to in-ear earbuds. They also sometimes refuse to charge and stay connected to your phone while in the charging case, or die if they sit too long without the case being charged.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5749px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xZeyKg6PGjGRtuw2JFpEcF" name="Shokz-openfit-2-lifestyle" alt="Render of the white Shokz OpenFit 2 wireless earbuds and open case, with the black, closed OpenFit 2 case sitting behind it, both in front of a faded brown background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xZeyKg6PGjGRtuw2JFpEcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5749" height="3234" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shokz)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm waiting to hear back from a Shokz rep if that notorious charging connector issue has been fixed, as the OpenFit 2 charging case has the same look and 48-hour capacity as the first generation. But on every other front, the OpenFit 2 should be a major improvement.</p><p>It jumps from 7 to 11 hours of streaming per charge, with a 270-day standby time in-case instead of 10 days. They've added a physical button with single-, double-, and triple-click shortcuts like pausing music or answering phone calls; now the touchpad only controls volume and your voice assistant, which is a relief.</p><p>Most importantly for audiophiles, it adds two drivers instead of one, targeting lows and highs, with a larger bass driver than before and "OpenBass 2.0" tech to "enhance dynamic low-frequency vibrations directly into your ear."</p><p>I personally felt the OpenFit had good-enough audio quality with the bass boost EQ setting, and cared more about the eardrum comfort and unimpeded awareness than perfect surround sound. The OpenFit 2 will provide a lovely little boost for first-gen fans, but probably won't satisfy those who prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout earbuds</a> with a proper seal and artificial transparency modes for richer sound, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-review">Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2</a>.</p><p>Other new upgrades include a redesigned flexible earhook that's supposed to "ensure a secure fit" with new, softer silicone than before, along with a jump from IP54 to IP55 water resistance (handling water jets instead of splashes) and new Bluetooth 5.4 support for triple the range away from your phone.</p><p>I intend to review the Shokz OpenFit 2 soon and see if they deliver on the company's promised improvements. But consider me quite optimistic, simply because the upgrades seem to directly address many first-gen users' complaints, including mine.</p>

This version costs the same but lasts longer, hits a louder and deeper sound, and can withstand more water and sweat.</p></p>

There&apos;s a reason we called Visible a "phenomenal value for heavy users" in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>. The Visible Plus plan usually costs $45 per month, but this deal knocks the price down to only $30 monthly for over two years.¬†</p><p>Of course, none of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carriers</a> are perfect. You won&apos;t get any multi-line discounts if you&apos;re signing up for the whole family, and you&apos;ll want to be in an area with great Verizon coverage to get the most out of the service. But if you&apos;re a heavy data user looking for international perks on a budget, this deal on Visible&apos;s Plus plan is hard to beat.¬†</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's rumored Galaxy S25 Slim arrives at Geekbench, revealing what to expect.</li><li>The device carries the SM-S937U model number and is likely powered by Snapdragon 8 Elite.</li><li>The S25 Slim was also seen featuring 12GB of RAM and running on Android 15.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Galaxy S25 series is coming this month, precisely in less than two weeks. While we expect the conventional trio at the launch, a new Galaxy S25 Slim has been long rumored to come alongside the other three handsets.</p><p>According to tipster Jukanlosreve on X, the Galaxy S25 Slim has now hit Geekbench and is believed to be the U.S. version. The benchmark shared by the tipster has revealed notable details about the upcoming rumored handset. The test appears to have been very recent, with the device bearing the <strong>SM-S937U</strong> model number.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">S25 Slim Geekbnech (US version)SD 8 Elite12GB RAM pic.twitter.com/X47mAIHSAn<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1877335025479463396">January 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Per the shared Geekbench screenshot, the rumored Galaxy S25 Slim, featuring 12GB of RAM, has scored 3005 single-core and 6945 multi-core scores. The device seems to be running the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>. It is also powered by a Qualcomm chipset, and the architecture indicates that it could be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> or an exclusive Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip.</p><p>While the Geekbench indicates that Samsung surely has another device up its sleeve, it is still unclear whether we will see the Galaxy S25 Slim at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">January 22 Unpacked</a> event launch. Earlier rumors indicated we wouldn't be witnessing the launch until Q2 2025.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1956px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="H2RNTeGcr4KSzZRDAGLdY8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-teaser" alt="Teaser for Galaxy Unpacked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H2RNTeGcr4KSzZRDAGLdY8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1956" height="1100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Unpacked teaser image, however, hints at four phones stacked together, which could mean we might have a glimpse of the rumored Slim phone or maybe not. Meanwhile, you can head over to our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 guide</a> on what to expect from the Galaxy Unpacked event.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Slim is anticipated to have a thin profile, and it isn't clear what sacrifices Samsung would make to achieve that compared to the flagship Galaxy S25 series trio. On the other hand, the Slim phone is expected to have a triple camera system, even with its slimmer form factor.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-slim-camera-specs-details-rumored">Earlier reports</a> indicated that it could carry a 200MP primary lens, like the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra, and even feature two 50MP ultra-wide and telephoto lenses. According to rumors, the S25 Slim might make use of Samsung's recently developed ALoP technology to incorporate powerful cameras even in a smaller package.</p>

<ul><li>A major leak might've left nothing to the imagination about the look of the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>The S25 Ultra is the primary culprit of the most drastic changes as the device supposedly sports rounded corners, flat edges/display, and more.</li><li>The Galaxy S25 series is confirmed to debut on January 22.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Following a host of other Galaxy S25 rumors, a recent leak might've taken the cover off the look of the new flagship series.</p><p>A major leak, which allegedly contains the "official" renders of the Galaxy S25 series were posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-design">Android Headlines</a> today (Jan 10). The leaked imagery leaves nothing to the imagination, beginning with the Galaxy S25 Ultra model. Renderings of this device were spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">last year in September</a> and what's proposed today aren't <em>that </em>different. The alleged renderings showcase a phone with rounded corners and an entirely flat display and sides.</p><p>A full-frontal look at the phone seemingly showcases relatively thin bezels around the device's entire display. A centered selfie camera is also seen, but that's pretty much expected by this point.</p><p>The leaked renders then show off the back of the device and its quadruple, vertical camera array. The lenses seemingly retain the silver rings around the circumference of the cameras. However, the renders give us yet another look at the black rings on the surface of the cameras, surrounding the lenses.</p><p>This is a change we've seen rumored before, which is in the same vein as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:601px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.83%;"><img id="bxPhxEr4S4yFuA3MharK3A" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-rumored-render-back-front" alt="An alleged look at the front and back of the Galaxy S25 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bxPhxEr4S4yFuA3MharK3A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="601" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication states the Galaxy S25 Ultra could see the following colors upon release: Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silver Blue, and Titanium White Silver.</p><p>On the other hand, the other two siblings in the series: the S25 and the S25 Plus might not receive such a "significant" glow-up. Per the leaked renders, both devices look relatively the same as the S24 alternatives. Each device features rounded corners, a triple camera array, and thin bezels. However, the only suggested change is with the lenses as those could grab the same black rings as the Ultra model.</p>

<p>The post claims the base and S25 Plus models could see the following colors: Silver Shadow, Ice Blue, Navy, and Mint.</p><p>This alleged in-depth look at the next trio arrives quite quickly after a major leak dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-specs-leak">the entire spec sheet</a> of the S25 series. The Ultra sibling is rumored to grab a 6.9-inch screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. For its cameras, the device could see a 200MP primary lens, a 50MP ultra-wide-angle camera, a 50MP periscope telephoto camera, and a 10MP telephoto.</p><p>A 5,000mAh battery is suspected to arrive within the device to empower your days with 45W fast charging to boot.</p><p>For the other two, the S25 could see a 6.2-inch Full HD Plus display and a 6.7-inch display for the Plus model.</p><p>Either way, with so much information to chew through, this could hold us over until the official launch of the series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-release-date">on January 22</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>A few late leaks suggest what consumers can expect from Samsung's next Ultra model's camera in terms of features and AI.</p><p>Two separate lists were posted on X by Egyptian tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AhmedQwaider888/status/1877589986154869029">Ahmed Qwaider</a>, who claimed that Samsung is boosting the Galaxy S25 Ultra's camera with new AI software (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-more-camera-features-leak-3515455/">Android Authority</a>). The machine-translated post states the next Ultra model's camera could benefit from "higher screen color" and an increased "brightness rate of 43%."</p><p>Additionally, the Korean OEM <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AhmedQwaider888/status/1877594739484074212">could build on</a> its AI-based editing tools for its camera with "Auto Eraser." The tipster claims this feature will let users "remove annoying sounds in the video."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚≠ïÔ∏èAi skill It will give you a higher screen color&brightness rate of 43%üî•logVideoYou will be able to take the video in raw colors,and you can add colors &control themNow While filming you can move between cameras without cutting or lagging due to the increase in framesüî• pic.twitter.com/GuzA9vFTnI<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1877589986154869029">January 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Continuing with videography, the tipster claims the S25 Ultra will give users "control" over the colors of a video and allow you to record in "raw colors," as well. More importantly, the post states that users can swap between camera focal lengths when filming "without cutting or lagging" your final product. The tipster states this is a result of increased frames on the device's recording side.</p><p>Samsung is allegedly boosting the resolution capabilities of the S25 Ultra for "less noise." Moreover, the device's macro mode is supposedly receiving an upgrade for better clarity.</p><p>Likely, several of the S25 Ultra's camera enhancements and AI tools are a result of Samsung's One UI 7 software and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>. The former recently entered its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">second beta</a>, which hauled in fixes for a load of issues that plagued testers early on. The software has been rumored to drop near or alongside the Galaxy S25 this month.</p><p>Regarding the S25 Ultra's cameras, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fresh-leak-suggests-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-could-get-a-major-camera-boost">rumors claim</a> the device could grab a major boost with a 200MP primary lens, a 50MP ultrawide camera, a 3x zoom 50MP telephoto camera, and a 50MP super-telephoto camera with 5x zoom capabilities. Recently, another batch of rumors allege the device could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-rumored-low-light-video-improvements">shine in low-light situations</a>. It's purported that the phone's videography side could let users record better videos with more clarity and color without an abundance of light.</p><p>The feature is rumored to heavily rely on the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-seemingly-confirms-the-galaxy-s25-series-will-have-a-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Qualcomm seemingly confirmed</a> will arrive inside the series.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 series is confirmed to debut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-release-date">during Unpacked</a> on January 22.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung recently announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">launch date</a> of the most anticipated Galaxy S25 series, which is less than two weeks away. A new leak has revealed every possible spec of the trio before the launch.</p><p>The leak comes from Steve Hemmerstoffer in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-specifications">Android Headlines</a>, and it shows all the specifications of the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The Ultra, the premium model, will be powered by the latest and greatest Qualcomm chip‚Äîthe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>‚Äîthe same one that was featured in the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and will likely see its way into most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> of 2025.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Back in September, in collab with @Androidheadline, I provided the very first and early look at the #GalaxyS25 Series.In addition, today we joined forces again to bring you #GalaxyS25 #GalaxyS25Plus #GalaxyS25Ultra full specs sheets!üòèYou're welcomeüëâüèª https://t.co/qRMywd6X3b pic.twitter.com/GCVrLKcvSa<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1877692152173482475">January 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The same chipset is shared across the Galaxy S25 trio, at least for the U.S. region. The Ultra will have a flat display like the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, measuring 6.9 inches, with a WQHD resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>The storage options, on the other hand, according to the tipster, will include at least 12GB of RAM, and consumers get to choose between 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage variants. Further, the handset will have the same 5000mAh battery as the previous iteration, supporting 45W fast charging.</p><p>Lastly, for optics, the premium handset will incorporate a 200MP primary camera paired with a 50MP ultra-wide-angle lens, a 50MP periscope telephoto camera, and another 10MP telephoto shooter. For selfies, users will get a 12MP shooter.</p><p>Per the leaked specs and prior <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">renders leaked</a> earlier, the Galaxy S25 Ultra seems to be a minimal upgrade when it comes to the overall look at the specs ‚Äî yet there should be a significant amount of improvements in terms of performance ‚Äî thanks to the new Qualcomm SoC.</p>

<p>The other two shorter siblings of the Ultra ‚Äîthe Galaxy S25, and S25 Plus, share most of the specs and design, as per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-alleged-rendering">leaked renders</a>. Both models will also be powered by Snapdragon 8 Elite and carry the same storage options as the Ultra model.</p><p>The standard Galaxy S25 will feature a 6.2-inch Full HD+ display, while the S25 Plus model, on the other hand, will feature a 6.7-inch display with a WQHD resolution.</p><p>The S25 Plus will have a 4900mAh battery capacity, and the shorter Galaxy S25 will feature a 4000mAh battery. They also support 45W and 25W wired charging, respectively.</p>
<p>The Galaxy S25 and the S25 Plus will have a triple camera array featuring a 50MP primary lens next to a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera and a 10MP telephoto lens. Both handsets will also have a 12MP selfie shooter on the front.</p><p>Other interesting features across all three models include Android 15-based One UI 7, Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 5.3. Lastly, here are all the expected measurements of all three models from the lineup:</p>
<ul><li>Galaxy S25 ‚Äî 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2mm, weight 162 grams.</li><li>Galaxy S25 Plus ‚Äî158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3mm, weight 190 grams.</li><li>Galaxy S25 Ultra ‚Äî 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm, weight 218 grams.</li></ul>
<p>While these specs pretty much look like the real deal, we ought to take these leaks with a grain of salt until the official announcement later this month at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Galaxy Unpacked</a>.

<p>Samsung is starting its year with a fresh patch of updates for its devices. The company's security update came in hot with about 51 patches that include 21 Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures(SVEs), which are specific to Samsung. The rest of the 29 patches are Android bug fixes.</p><p>These patches aim to improve the security of the devices as part of Samsung's monthly Security Maintenance Release (SMR) process. The update was first rolled out to the Samsung Galaxy S24 series in South Korea for users who have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out" target="_blank">One UI 7 Beta 3</a> update. Today (Jan. 9), the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Galaxy Z Fold 4, and Galaxy Z Fold SE received the security update.</p><p>A bulk of these patches focused on blocking vulnerabilities that allowed hackers to read or execute codes on the user's device without permission, and one of them even changed the configuration of device notifications without the user's knowledge on Android versions 12, 13, and 14. (Via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-monthly-updates-january-2025-security-patch-detailed/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p>

<p>While Samsung didn't disclose what these vulnerabilities exactly were, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb" target="_blank">patch changelog</a> mentions five "Critical" level fixes alongside 24 "High" level fixes. They address issues with Samsung‚Äôs  Messages, Notification Manager, and Bootloader.</p><p>As of today, this security patch is available only on carrier-locked units in the U.S. and all devices in South Korea. However, according to its website, Samsung plans on releasing this update to all above-mentioned devices globally and said that "delivery time of security patches may vary depending on the regions and models."</p><p>Users can check for an update on their devices by heading to <strong>Settings ></strong> <strong>System & updates > Security update</strong>. Don't be too bumped if you didn't receive the update yet as it has been rolling out in phases.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pixel devices also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/january-2025-security-patch-rolling-out-for-google-pixel-devices-heres-whats-fixed">received</a> its January patch this week, rolling out for devices Pixel 6 and up. There were bug fixes for the Pixel 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> series, but the Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 series only get security improvements.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors claim Samsung could drop Bluetooth connectivity from the S Pen of the new Galaxy S25 Ultra.</li><li>If true, a tipster on X claims that the stylus would lose "gestures" and "remote control" functions, such as those for the phone's camera.</li><li>Samsung's previous Ultra models could pair with multiple S Pens and styluses, granting users alternate options.</li><li>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is preparing to debut on January 22.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent rumor suggests Samsung's next S Pen might be a disappointing facet with its upcoming Ultra model.</p><p>The information was posted by X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1877621301583474842">Ishan Agarwal</a>, who claims the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen could drop its (typically expected) Bluetooth connectivity (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/10/galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-without-bluetooth/">9to5Google</a>). The user states they discovered this supposed loss of connectivity via "retail sources," but fails to cite those sources.</p><p>However, this possible loss of Bluetooth could indicate that the next Ultra model's S Pen will lose some of its features. Agarwal claims the stylus would force users to lose "gestures and remote control" on the next Ultra.</p><p>The folks at 9to5 speculate that the removal of Bluetooth could be a "cost-cutting" measure by Samsung. Moreover, the removal of such connectivity would negate the necessity of charging it within the S25 Ultra. This was a sentiment the tipster discussed in their X thread; however, if this is true, it seems more like a "take it or leave it" scenario.</p><p>The tipster claims the removal of Bluetooth may only provide a measly "15 to 20-minute" addition of battery life to the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: S Pen on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will no longer feature Bluetooth according to retail sources!Which means you will lose certain features like gestures & remote control.How do you feel about this downgrade? #GalaxyS25Ultra pic.twitter.com/ASDKB06nsx<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1877621301583474842">January 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The S Pen has continued to be a useful tool for Galaxy Ultra users who want to write by hand, especially if it's for note-taking. Typically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-galaxy-s24-work-with-the-s-pen">like on the Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, the S Pen can turn your handwritten words into digital text for messages, text extraction from photos, coloring, and more. Interestingly, one "remote control" feature the S25 Ultra may lose is the ability for the S Pen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS10000758/#:~:text=Capture%20photos%20and%20screenshots">to control its camera shutter</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the Galaxy Ultra and the S Pen typically featured a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-galaxy-s24-work-with-the-s-pen#:~:text=Which%20S%20Pens%20work%20with%20the%20Galaxy%20S24%20Ultra%3F">pairing function</a>. Users could pair multiple styluses to the device, in case they wanted to swap to another that could do more or things differently. What the current rumors propose could see that go away with the next iteration.</p><p>With the recent S Pen rumors, perhaps the Korean OEM will deliver additional features for the stylus via One UI 7. The OS skin entered its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">second beta</a> before Christmas, which fixed a host of malfunctions and errors across the S24 series.</p><p>Elsewhere, Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-seemingly-confirms-the-galaxy-s25-series-will-have-a-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">seemingly confirmed</a> that the Galaxy S25 series will rock its Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset ahead of its January 22 launch. Samsung will host its usual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-release-date">Unpacked event</a> where we should see the next flagship trio and, maybe, even more surprises.</p>

<ul><li>People on iOS might soon have an enhancing privacy feature on Google Chrome.</li><li>YouTube Incognito links are likely to open in Chrome Incognito mode. This helps users prevent the browser from saving their watching history.</li><li>It is also likely to help users avoid receiving unwanted advertisements as the feature also eliminates tracking.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Chrome on iOS is developing a new feature to increase privacy when using YouTube Incognito mode.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mspoweruser.com/chrome-ios-to-open-youtube-incognito-links-directly-in-incognito/">MSPowerUser</a>, a new feature might soon be introduced into Chrome for iOS users. This feature will open YouTube Incognito links directly in the browser's Incognito mode as a significant privacy measure.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2eVc334fHSBSNuLipjwTqR" name="YouTube-LifeStyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="YouTube on Galaxy Z Fold 2 with toys around it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2eVc334fHSBSNuLipjwTqR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The evidence was found through a new Chrome flag through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6152054/3">Chromium Gerrit</a>, which indicates, "Enable the opening of links from YouTube incognito in Chrome incognito." Enabling it will open up YouTube Incognito links directly through Chrome Incognito.</p><p>Whenever the feature goes official, it enhances privacy for users, as Chrome doesn't store browsing history. This wasn't the case earlier when YouTube Incognito links opened in regular Chrome and were not in Incognito mode.</p>
<p>MSPowerUser further notes that users will see a bottom sheet message indicating that they are in Chrome Incognito, and they will see "Chrome automatically opens YouTube incognito links in Incognito." The indication is pretty similar to what we are used to on the YouTube Incognito screen, with a similar indication at the bottom.</p><p>Alongside the privacy aspect of the upcoming new feature, it also helps users with data tracking, usually done through a web browser, including Chrome. Since it is incognito, it is one less thing to worry about, as it also saves from unwanted advertisements. Users have to bear in mind that the feature on the Chrome browser only applies to YouTube Incognito links and not to videos.</p><p>All in all, the upcoming feature on Chrome on iOS is a component of the search giant's larger initiative to enhance user control and online privacy. It is still unclear whether the feature will eventually debut on Google Chrome browsers on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. If it does, it will be a nifty addition.</p>

<ul><li>Google is widely rolling new feature for its popular Quick Share tool on Android devices.</li><li>Quick Share users can now take advantage of a new QR code option to send their files to other users.</li><li>Recipient can quickly scan the QR code to get the files through a link.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Quick Share is a nifty equivalent to Apple's AirDrop for Android users. While it has been around on Android handsets for a while, the quick sharing functionality is adding new means to share files with other users.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> users can now share files through Quick Share with the help of a QR code, which will make receiving files by the recipients hassle-free and also make it more secure. This feature happened to be rolling out widely (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/07/quick-share-qr-code-rolling-out/">9to5Google</a>) when it was announced last month and was initially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-quick-share-speedier-sharing-option-tipped">spotted back</a> in May last year.</p>
<p>Up until now, users who wanted to share photos or files had to turn on the Quick Share feature either to their Contacts or for everyone nearby, which showcases the device's availability to almost any Android device nearby. However, the new QR code-sharing users can now tap on the "User QR code" feature, which will be visible in the "Send to nearby devices" pane.</p><p>Tapping it further will reveal the QR code alongside the number and types of files that a user wants to send. The recipient can now scan the code from their Android phone and click on the quick share link (<u>quick share.google</u>) to get the original files. There is also a nifty prompt over the QR code indicating that the Android phone recipient should scan the respective code.</p>
<p>It eliminates the need to keep searching for contacts or pairing for new devices nearby, as scanning a QR code is a bit easier. Also, the QR code can be read by more than one Android device, which means multiple users nearby can benefit from quickly receiving the original files, which can be a savior in gatherings or at events.</p><p>Android users on the latest version of Quick Share (version <strong>24.49.33</strong>) will be able to see the functionality on their devices, as the rollout has just begun.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OnePlus had a strong 2024 on the back of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">12R</a>, and it is looking to emulate a similar success this year. The OnePlus 13 introduces a bold new design, better cameras, and a larger battery ‚Äî all while being thinner than last year's phone. The software is also much better this time around, and although you don't get a clean interface, it is fluid and doesn't have many bugs.<br> <br>I really like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, and think it has the potential to be one of the best phones of 2025. That said, the phone is costlier by $100, edging it ever closer to what Google and Samsung charge. If you don't want to shell out that much cash, there's an alternative ‚Äî the OnePlus 13R. <br><br>Just like last year, the OnePlus 13R is launching globally, and that's absolutely the right call ‚Äî there's obviously a lot of interest in the device outside India and China. Also, the  OnePlus 12R continues to be the best mid-range phone you can buy, and the 13R builds on that foundation, delivering increased performance by way of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and a bigger 6,000mAh battery. <br><br>OnePlus is making considerable changes to the imaging as well, with the phone featuring a new 50MP main camera and a dedicated 50MP telephoto with 2x optical zoom. With these upgrades comes a price hike, and the OnePlus 13R costs $100 more as a result in North America and the U.K. Thankfully, Indian buyers don't need to worry about paying more, as the device costs the same as the 12R a year ago. <br><br>Does the OnePlus 13R do enough to retain its mantle as the best value flagship? I used the phone as my daily driver for two weeks, and here's what I think.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13r-pricing-and-retail-availability"><span>OnePlus 13R: Pricing and retail availability</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pRatN24iays3TBpVAMU3Yo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pRatN24iays3TBpVAMU3Yo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R was unveiled on January 10, 2025, and the phone is now available to buy in India, the U.S., U.K., and select global markets. Like last year, OnePlus is selling the phone in 256GB and 512GB storage variants, but North American buyers will just get the 256GB model. <br><br>Thankfully, the base model comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB storage, and it gets UFS 4.0 storage as standard ‚Äî unlike last year. This model costs $599 in the U.S., ¬£599 in the U.K., and ‚Çπ42,999 ($501) in India. The 16GB/512GB variant is debuting at ‚Çπ49,999 ($582) in India, and you get the usual launch incentives. <br><br>While the device costs more in the U.S. and U.K., that isn't the case in India; OnePlus tends to be aggressive in the country in this category, and I think it is a good value considering the hardware you're getting.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13r-design"><span>OnePlus 13R: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WEYLGyVXsFFWuYqNHJx5Vo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WEYLGyVXsFFWuYqNHJx5Vo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like every other phone launching these days, the OnePlus 13R switches to a flat aesthetic with boxy sides. While the OnePlus 13 also has a similar design, that phone has beveled edges that make it comfortable to hold and use. You don't get the same on the 13R, and it doesn't have anywhere close to the same in-hand feel.<br> <br>The sides tend to dig into your palm, and while it is technically lighter than the OnePlus 13, it doesn't feel that way when holding both phones. It's thinner as well at 8mm, but the boxier sides minimize that effect ‚Äî I like the in-hand feel of the 12R much better to this year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VWvQph3sxN3sbps5fqjTWo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VWvQph3sxN3sbps5fqjTWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the design at the back highly interesting; the Astral Trail model has a set of rings etched into the glass that looks cool, and the camera housing has a cleaner design than previous years. The mid-frame uses aluminum, and there's a clear difference in the sturdiness of the device over the 12R.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JvuCo8FKKsfmHDTU5vySUo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JvuCo8FKKsfmHDTU5vySUo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you need a matte texture, the 13R is also available in a Nebula Noir color variant, but that model doesn't quite have the same striking design at the back. The alert slider is intact, and it easily allows you to switch between ring, vibrate, and silent profiles without too much of a hassle.</p>

<p>While the slider continues to be a differentiator, I don't like the OxygenOS 15 bundles calls and notifications into a single category in Do Not Disturb; if you enable DND but want calls to come through (as I do), there's no way to set it up. Every other manufacturer has calls and messages split into different categories, and that needs to be the case in OxygenOS as well.</p>

<p>Although the OnePlus 13 gets a new ultrasonic fingerprint module, the 13R has an optical unit instead, and it is positioned too low on the screen, making it awkward to access when holding the phone one-handed. The module was higher up than usual last year, and that made it uncomfortable as well, and OnePlus course-corrected too much this time, putting it too low on the panel ‚Äî now we'll need to wait and see if next year's phone has it in the goldilocks zone.</p>

<p>You get IP65 dust and water resistance, and while that is decent enough in its own right, it isn't quite as effective as IP68 or IP67 that's used by a few manufacturers in this category. While there are a few quibbles with the design, the OnePlus 13R looks better than last year, and more importantly, it is more durable.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Zmt4FvJ4mJJ3iTgn4HZZYo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zmt4FvJ4mJJ3iTgn4HZZYo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus retained the same 6.78-inch AMOLED panel as last year, but it is flat this time; it goes up to 120Hz and has a maximum brightness of 1600 nits in HBM. There's Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and interestingly, the panel is protected by Corning's new Gorilla Glass 7i, which has increased scratch resistance. <br><br>As you get the same BOE panel, I didn't see any issues with color vibrancy or contrast levels. The panel gets bright enough in daily use, and even under harsh sunlight, I didn't notice any problems. It doesn't get quite as bright as the Pixel 9 Pro or Vivo X200 Pro, but you'll only notice the difference when using the 13R next to these devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GJB8GVM2MbhXu9rpauJD" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJB8GVM2MbhXu9rpauJD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get a decent amount of customizability with the panel when it comes to adjusting color balance, and OxygenOS has the best always-on styles you can get on any phone, with unique options that allow you to tailor the lock screen to your tastes. And just like the OnePlus 13, you get Aqua Touch on the 13R, which gives you the ability to use the phone when there's water on the screen.</p>
<p>Gaming is similarly enjoyable, and while you don't get 120fps on the device, it does an admirable job at 60fps with most titles. The one positive is that BGMI goes up to 120fps using frame interpolation, but it has jitter at times. Stereo sound is detailed enough that you can use the onboard audio for casual gaming, but I recommend using earbuds if you're listening to music ‚Äî the OnePlus Buds 3 continue to be a terrific choice in this regard.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XqAacLBSCPjwupZijofZE" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XqAacLBSCPjwupZijofZE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus messed up with the storage variants last year, incorrectly stating that the 256GB version had UFS 4.0 storage. It's addressing those shortcomings with the 13R, with the phone now offering 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage on the base model. Indian buyers also get a 512GB model, and this variant also gets UFS 4.0 storage. <br><br>There's good news on the hardware side as well, with the phone powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. It is just as capable as last year, and continues to deliver outstanding performance ‚Äî I'm yet to see any games challenge the chipset. There is thermal throttling after the 30-minute mark, but the phone has a higher threshold than the regular OnePlus 13; I noticed it going up to 47 degrees in extended testing, whereas the OnePlus 13 didn't go beyond 42.2 degrees.</p>

<p>I didn't encounter any lag or slowdowns in the two weeks I used the phone, and it held its own in demanding games as well. Annoyingly, there's no eSIM connectivity on the phone, but you get OnePlus's new BeaconLink standard that builds on Bluetooth, delivering increased range of up to 100 ft. <br><br>The rationale for not including eSIM is that it doesn't get much use in countries like India ‚Äî where the phone will see a bulk of its sales ‚Äî but the manufacturer is betting on BeaconLink as a new standard that has potential, so it's included instead. Thankfully, the phone doesn't miss out in other areas, and you get a good Wi-Fi 7 modem, Bluetooth 5.4, AptX HD, LHDC, NFC, and dual-band GPS. This is easily one of the best hardware packages you'll find in the sub-$700 category, and barring the omission of eSIM, there isn't anything to fault.</p>

<p>I easily got a day and a half out of the OnePlus 12R's battery, and the 13R manages to last two days thanks to a bigger 6000mAh battery. Even with heavy use, the phone managed to last over a day and a half, and I averaged two days in regular use. This is the case on other devices I tested recently that had 6000mAh batteries as well, and I'm excited that we're at a point where you no longer need to charge your phone daily. <br><br>Unlike the OnePlus 13, the 13R doesn't have silicon-carbon tech, and instead uses a single 6000mAh cell. As it no longer uses dual cells, it takes considerably longer to charge the device. In my testing, the phone took just over 55 minutes to charge using the bundled 80W charger ‚Äî 17 minutes more than the OnePlus 13. <br><br>Obviously, the charging time isn't ideal, but it is still better than what you get with Samsung and Google phones, and there's a charger bundled in the package. The downside with the phone is that you don't get wireless charging, but seeing as how I don't use it at all, it isn't as big a limitation.</p>

<p>OnePlus is using a 50MP Sony LYT-700 imaging sensor as the main camera on the 13R, and it's joined by a 50MP Samsung JN5 telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom and an 8MP wide-angle lens that uses Sony's IMX355 module. The tele lens is limited in its usability as a 3x sensor would have been much better, and in a similar vein, the wide-angle lens needs a better sensor. <br><br>The camera interface itself is identical to last year, but you get a ton of new AI-assisted editing features that do a good job. Just like the regular OnePlus 13, all three modules at the back can shoot 4K60 video, but the video quality itself isn't as good. The phone does a better job shooting photos of moving objects, and you can take live photos that retain motion even when you move the images over to iOS.</p>

<p>Although you don't get any Hasselblad tuning, the OnePlus 13R delivers photos that look similar to the OnePlus 13, which was the case last year as well. The wide-angle lens doesn't quite manage to deliver the same vibrancy of photos, and again, this was something the 12R struggled with. The resultant images are decent enough, but you don't get the same detail, and there's visible noise in low-light situations.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=ec3764ba-cf47-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>Shots taken in daylight have good colors and detail, but they have higher levels of contrast, and foliage rendition isn't as natural. That said, the resultant shots look great in their own right, and there isn't that big a difference in this scenario.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=ffb1448e-cf47-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>It's in low-light conditions where the OnePlus 13R struggles to hold against the standard model. It boosts the exposure to eke out additional detail, and in doing so you get colors that look washed out at times, visible grain, and aggressive smoothing at the edges.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=14f00de4-cf48-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>That said, the phone does a good enough job if there's some artificial lighting.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=40eb9d00-cf48-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>On the whole, the device manages to deliver one of the best cameras in its category. It's a letdown that the auxiliary modules aren't quite as good, but other than that, this is a great showing. Unless you need the additional versatility that you get with the 3x lens on the OnePlus 13, this is a good enough choice if you're looking to save some cash.</p>

<p>Software has been a point of contention for OnePlus in the last three years, but the OnePlus 13R doesn't have any shortcomings in this area. The device runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a> based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and it is just as fluid as the OnePlus 13 ‚Äî and has the same feature-set. <br><br>There's a sprinkling of AI thrown in for good measure this time, but as is always the case with these things, the usability is dubious. Like most other manufacturers, OnePlus is using a mix of on-device LLMs and cloud servers, and there's a dedicated section in the settings that lets you see all the features available. <br><br>The interface is fast and doesn't have any slowdowns or bugs, and it's refreshing to be able to say that about a new version of OxygenOS. There's good customizability (as always), and the latest iteration of the software brings a slew of lock screen styling options, and they look great.</p>

<p>Outside of that, I don't really have much to point out. I didn't see any issues with notifications or aggressive battery management, and the device does a great job with the basics. The only quibble is that the UI is heavily customized, but that's the case with most phones other than Pixels, and if anything, I prefer OxygenOS to MIUI. <br><br>Coming to updates, the device will get four years of software updates and six years of security updates. OnePlus basically made it clear last year that this would be the maximum it would offer on its devices, and while it isn't on the same level as Google and Samsung, it's still decent enough.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NXqaxUrtomCUQTqTpB3sXo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NXqaxUrtomCUQTqTpB3sXo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's so good about the OnePlus 13R is that it is positioned in a segment where you don't have many devices. I like what Vivo is doing with the V series, and the V40 Pro has the best cameras in this category, and the sleek design is a differentiator as well. That said, it isn't anywhere as fast as the 13R, nor does the battery last as long. <br><br>The Reno 13 Pro is a good choice to consider as well, with the device touting great cameras and a long-lasting battery. It doesn't quite have the same power, but that's about the only limitation, and it is quite similar to the 13R in regular use.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13r-should-you-buy-it"><span>OnePlus 13R: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rpfFcHfSZwGgVhgaKoCiWo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpfFcHfSZwGgVhgaKoCiWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a mid-range phone with the best hardware</li><li>You want a phone that lasts two days between charges</li><li>You need a great camera</li><li>You want fluid software</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need great auxiliary cameras</li><li>You want a watertight design</li></ul>
<p>I called the OnePlus 12R the bargain of the year in 2024, and if anything, the OnePlus 13R does more to deserve that title this year. The phone delivers better performance, has a bigger battery, double the amount of storage, takes better photos in challenging situations, and will get more software updates. You're paying the same as last year's model while getting a decent set of upgrades, and I call that a win. <br><br>The cameras are among the best in its category, and OnePlus nailed the software as well this time, rolling out plenty of AI features you'll actually end up using. Just like the standard OnePlus 13, there isn't anything inherently wrong with the 13R, and the only limitation I've come across is that the auxiliary cameras aren't on the same level as the main sensor. Outside of that and IP68 water resistance, you don't have anything missing here. <br><br>If anything, I'd suggest getting the OnePlus 13R instead of the OnePlus 13 if you don't need the absolute best cameras. There really isn't any other device that offers quite the same caliber of hardware in this category, and for the second year in a row, OnePlus managed to deliver the best value flagship.</p>

<p>Google announced Android XR at a surprise event in December 2024, unveiling the first version of Android built for AR and VR devices. Just as the term "smartphone" encompasses several different form factors ‚Äî slabs, folding phones, etc. ‚Äî XR is the combination of AR and VR under one umbrella term.</p><p>While Android XR is a bit late to the game, Google has the chance to learn from Meta and Apple. From everything we've seen so far, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">Android XR</a> looks to be the perfect combination between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os">Meta's Horizon OS</a>, which powers Meta Quest headsets, and Apple's Vision OS on the Apple Vision Pro.</p><p>But while Google looks like it has figured out the operating system side of things, we still don't have any proper product announcements. That's going to change in 2025, and I fully expect to see at least one flagship VR/mixed reality headset and one pair of AR glasses make a commercial debut. We also know about a few other projects in the works, so here's what you can expect from Android XR in 2025.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fvs4ZjW6pCjET9gczvTffL" name="Xreal-one-with-Beam-Pro-01" alt="A pair of Xreal One glasses hooked up to an Xreal Beam Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fvs4ZjW6pCjET9gczvTffL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first major Android XR product launch I expect in 2025 is from Xreal. The company has already proven itself as the market leader in smart display glasses segment and has launched two full-fledged standalone smart glasses products to date ‚Äî Beam, and Beam Pro. Beam Pro redefined the company's standalone solution in 2024, and I believe Xreal will continue to evolve this concept with its first Android XR product.</p><p>Xreal Beam Pro looks a lot like an Android smartphone with dual ports on the bottom. I expect the first pair of Android XR-powered smart glasses from Xreal to replace this design with a "compute puck" similar to what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> is using. I don't expect it to be wireless like Orion's puck, as Xreal would likely prioritize battery life and comfort by putting the battery in the compute puck.</p><p>I also don't think the compute puck will feature a display, as Android XR is built to display an XR user interface rather than a traditional flat-screen Android UI. As such, the puck will only function when the glasses are attached, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/spacetop-g1">that one Xreal-powered laptop</a> that got canceled.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1980px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Pr5HopUsbmpN3BxEnFVwr4" name="spatial-ui-panels" alt="An Android XR UI design template provided by Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pr5HopUsbmpN3BxEnFVwr4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1980" height="1114" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I still expect the glasses to have a custom piece of silicon inside, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-spatial-ar-glasses-announced">Xreal One</a>, the company's recently updated smart display glasses. Xreal One has an optional camera coming out soon, but I expect Xreal's first Android XR glasses to have cameras built in for full spatial tracking. I got a glimpse of this future at MWC 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/smart-glasses-mwc-2024">when I went hands-on</a> with Xreal Air 2 Ultra, which featured a very beta custom UI, full 6DoF tracking, and rudimentary hand tracking support.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Xreal Android XR glasses will almost certainly use a compute puck that sits in your pocket or is clipped somewhere else on your body.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>With Android XR powering the experience, hand tracking will be flawless and the UI will look gorgeous. I'm quite confident in Xreal's ability to deliver excellent hardware at this point, and fully expect Xreal's Android XR glasses to challenge Meta Orion in a serious way.</p><p>While the ultimate goal of Android XR smart glasses will almost certainly be to replace your phone, I think initial versions from companies like Xreal will mainly be focused on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-really-saved-my-neck">providing a neck-saving experience</a> for entertainment and productivity on the go.</p><p>When will we see Xreal Android XR glasses? I believe we'll see them debut at Google I/O 2025, which is typically held in May. Google I/O is the company's annual developer conference, and what better way to encourage development for a new Android platform than to fully debut it and a new set of products than at a developer conference? I can't think of one.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung"><span>Samsung</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.73%;"><img id="GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Side-render" alt="An official product render of Samsung's Project Moohan VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5120" height="2700" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to years of leaks, Samsung and Google had originally planned to launch its first mixed reality headset powered by Android XR sometime in the latter half of 2024. That all changed when Apple unveiled the Vision Pro in the summer of 2023, which seemingly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-xr-headset-reportedly-delayed" target="_blank">compelled Samsung to go back to the drawing board</a> to make a more compelling device.</p><p>The result is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>. We don't know the final product name for it just yet but we do know Samsung plans to release it commercially sometime later this year. That's a full year late, but it absolutely means we're going to get a better product because of it.</p><p>Samsung aims to deliver a cutting-edge product that looks like a melding of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Meta Quest Pro</a> and Apple Vision Pro into a (hopefully) more affordable headset. It sports the same ski goggles-like form factor as these two products and even uses a similar magnetic light blocker system and halo-style strap as the Quest Pro, which I still find to be the most comfortable VR headset for long-term use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b5qhEdSGH8kVnjNEpbr7Sf" name="Android-XR-infinite-desktop" alt="A mock-up of Android XR showing floating screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b5qhEdSGH8kVnjNEpbr7Sf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because Samsung waited a bit, it's able to fix the biggest problems with the Vision Pro and Quest Pro, namely by delivering an ideal balance between price, performance, and long-term comfort. Moreover, unlike Apple, Samsung will be launching its headset with motion-tracked controllers instead of relying entirely on hand tracking.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google is using the Job Simulator developers to help give its headsets a unique personality that we'll see later this year.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Google has already tapped into its long history with XR development by getting Owlchemy Labs ‚Äî creators of the infinitely popular Job Simulator VR game ‚Äî to create the onboarding experience for Android XR. Owlchemy built this new experience in the Job Simulator world and, appropriately, calls it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://owlchemylabs.com/blog/save-jobbot-from-reality-in-owlchemy-labs-new-android-xr-title-inside-job">Inside [JOB]</a>.</p><p>Google's use of Owlchemy Labs for this project feels like the "good old Google" that had fun creating projects and pouring lots of character into them. That, combined with Samsung's hardware expertise and what we've seen of the incredibly polished Android XR, gives me high hopes that we'll finally have a good standalone VR headset to compete with Meta's seemingly unstoppable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3" target="_blank">Quest 3 domination</a>.</p><p>While Project Moohan <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-and-mixed-reality-prototypes-remind-us-not-to-get-excited-too-early">is just a prototype</a>, hands-on demos from Google's Android XR event give us a good idea of what we should expect when the final headset makes its debut, which I expect to happen later this Summer at the second Samsung Unpacked of 2025. This is usually where Samsung unveils its latest foldable phones, smartwatches, and other wearables, which, this year, should include a wearable mixed reality headset.</p>

<p>Google has also partnered with Sony, Lynx, and Magic Leap to debut Android XR devices in the near future, but we know next to nothing about what any of these companies are working on. At the least, I can surmise what each company might do based on existing products.</p><p>Magic Leap will, undoubtedly, make a new pair of AR glasses that'll be powered by Android XR instead of the OS that powers existing Magic Leap glasses. Magic Leap was the first AR company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-magic-leap-partnership">that partnered with Google last year</a> to help build Android XR. It makes sense, then, that Magic Leap will at least tease a new pair of AR glasses this year.</p><p>Sony is known in the XR space mainly for PlayStation VR, but the company also announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-announces-high-end-xr-headset-to-compete-with-apple-vision-pro">a new mixed reality headset</a> last January for enterprise customers but has yet to properly release it. That headset ‚Äî now called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/vr-ar/i-just-tried-sonys-new-xr-headset-concept-at-ces-2025-but-its-not-what-youd-expect">Sony XYN</a> ‚Äî is powered by the same Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 chipset that powers Samsung's Project Moohan (detailed above), so it would make sense for Sony to build another version of this headset using Google's new XR OS and give it a wider audience than who it's currently made for.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Three other major companies, Lynx, Sony, and Magic Leap, are also expected to debut Android XR products this year, but those may not make store shelves.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>And that just leaves Lynx. The company's first headset, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lynx-r.com/" target="_blank">Lynx R1</a>, soft-launched in the spring of 2024 to a handful of early financial backers. The headset featured cutting-edge "no latency" mixed reality vision and is also powered by a Snapdragon XR2 chipset, although the R1 never went into mass production.</p><p>It's entirely likely that the company is working with Google to properly launch a headset built upon similar tech in the R1 but using a newer Snapdragon chipset and Android XR on the backend. That helps the company with the app support it needs to ensure a rich experience and help Google to launch a healthy Android XR product portfolio by the end of 2025.</p>
<h2 id="bridging-the-gap-2">Bridging the gap</h2>
<p>Android XR feels like the beginning of Android back in 2008. Much of Android's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZZ-R3p_w8">original public announcement</a> talked about how fragmented the space was and how one company (Google) could bring them all together with an OS that helps set standards and define the user experience.</p><p>Meta is trying the same thing at the same time, but Google has nearly 2 decades of experience building a platform that works on thousands of devices. The company absolutely can deliver on the promise of an OS that bridges the gap between different types of hardware and delivers a stellar experience for anything you want it to do, and we can't wait to see what the first real product brings this year.</p>

<ul><li>Google is starting to develop a feature in Photos that lets users decide which faces they'd like to "see more" of in Memories.</li><li>The feature was reportedly spotted in version 7.12 of the Photos app and is placed alongside the "hide faces" option in a picture's description box.</li><li>Google Photos is also opened its early waitlist for its upcoming "Ask Photos" feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly working on a way for people to surface the memories they'd love to see the most in Photos.</p><p>A discovery by notable X tipster AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/photos-memories-show-more-3514639/">Android Authority</a>), a recent update for Photos reportedly contains details about an upcoming feature refresh. Per the tipster, Google is seemingly working on a way to make faces you'd love to see more of in Photos a little easier. According to the teardown, when viewing a picture in Photos, users can navigate to its information description containing the time it was taken, the lens used, and more.</p><p>There, users will also see small snapshots of the faces and people in the photo that the app recognizes.</p><p>The tipster's test shows that users may soon be able to long-press a person's icon and see a new pop-up menu. The app's code shows a new option: "Show more in memories." This button joins the "hide face from memories" option, an update the app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-photos-hide-faces-3465522/">picked up last year</a>, per the publication.</p><p>What's unclear in this early test is if the "show more" option will deliver a pop-up menu like the "hide face" choice. Memories typically creates a collage of a user's photos that can be grouped. The post states that the "hide face" option lets users decide to show "less" of a person's face, but they will still show in grouped collections. However, the alternative involves not showing the person at all, even in grouped situations.</p><p>With the (happier) "show more" function in development, perhaps there will be more in store for users who want to relive certain memories of specific people. Maybe users can have the app create curated collages of a singular person or photos with both parties in them. We'll have to wait and see as more concrete details weren't readily available.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:271px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:221.40%;"><img id="k4cP7bfWiRDA6KHrAqhjVY" name="google-photos-show-more-face-example" alt="Google Photos is working on a way to make it easier for users to make certain faces show up more in Memories." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k4cP7bfWiRDA6KHrAqhjVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="271" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The good thing about this previous "show less" change is that it removes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://proof.vanilla.tools/androidcentral/articles/edit/B6GNTpjPbYXRdwSS3oTnbB">long list of steps</a> previously needed for a simple task. More importantly, there was never a way for users to show <em>more </em>of who they would like to see. The company pushed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-memories-view-rollout">new Memories view</a> during the summer of 2023, alongside a few AI-powered tools. With generative AI at its heart, the tab "curates and organizes" your picture together, so long as they're similar. These similarities can include people, places, and occasions (like parties).</p><p>The AI will also generate a quick title, which users can fix later.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that Google opened its early test waitlist for its AI-backed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">Ask Photos</a>" feature in September. This will bring even more of its software to the app by letting users converse with its AI model about content stored in their photo galleries.</p>

<p>As described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is a fantastic smartwatch with a rugged construction, bright, vivid display, and all of the intelligent hardware upgrades that you&apos;d want in a modern wearable. There&apos;s a ton of accurate health and fitness tracking features, plus you get dual band GPS, built-in LTE support, and up to 100 hours of battery life (in power saving mode).¬†</p><p>Sure, the bulky design isn&apos;t for everyone, and the cost may be prohibitive compared to other watches (even with a discount), but if you want one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">best wearable experiences</a> that Samsung has ever introduced, now&apos;s your chance.¬†</p>

<ul><li>In an internal memo, Google CEO Sundar Pichai previewed what employees should expect for 2025.</li><li>After viewing demos, Pichai was impressed by the "amazing" progress Google is making with new AI features.</li><li>A few things Google could release in 2025 are full-fledged Gemini 2.0 models and Project Astra.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Last year, Google began 2024 with mass layoffs, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/more-job-cuts-on-the-horizon-for-google-says-ceo-sundar-pichai">its CEO Sundar Pichai had to send internal memos to employees</a> explaining the company's plan. At the start of 2025, it looks like Google is in a very different place, as an internal memo from Pichai viewed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/08/sundar-pichai-2025-ai-launches/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> revealed. In the email sent to employees, the Google CEO cited the "amazing" progress of future AI features currently in development.</p><p>"We ended 2024 on a super high note with Gemini 2.0, Willow, Veo 2, and lots of innovation across Search, YouTube, Cloud, Android, Pixel, and more," Pichai wrote. "The foundation to all of this is our technical and AI leadership, made possible by our full stack approach, and people were inspired by what we built."</p><p>By the full-stack approach, the Google chief executive is most likely referencing the company's development of AI features, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> models that enable them, and the Tensor smartphone processors that run them. Google is able to make efficient, tailor-made AI features by controlling the software, SoC, and AI models from top to bottom.</p><p>"As we start the year, I have been reviewing demos for the products and features we‚Äôre rolling out in the next few months," Pichai continued. "The progress is amazing, and I‚Äôm confident we will keep the momentum going in 2025."</p><p>Google already has a few work-in-progress features for 2025 that we know about, like Project Astra. That's t<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">he multimodal AI interface that we tried at Google I/O 2024</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">opened up for waitlisted signups in December</a>. There's also the crop of Gemini 2.0 models, which are listed as "experimental" now but should fully release this year. Other projects, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Project Mariner</a>, could make an appearance.</p><p>There are surely projects that we don't know about, too. If Pichai's remarks are any indication, 2025 could be a good year for AI for Google.</p>

<ul><li>The Gemini app on Android is reportedly rolling out its new lock screen capabilities for calls and texts.</li><li>When enabled, the feature lets users command the AI via voice to call or text one of their stored contacts.</li><li>Google brought this feature into beta in December and, shortly after, the company started testing its new Flash 2.0 model.</li></ul>
<p>Google is pushing an update for Android users that makes its AI Gemini a little more useful.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/09/gemini-call-message-without-unlocking/#more-652193">9to5Google</a>, the Gemini app on Android is beginning to roll out its new calling and messaging capabilities via the lock screen. The publication notes that this update for the Gemini app affects the basic Google Assistant, too. The company has reportedly reduced the amount of available features the Assistant can offer users as Gemini picks up calling/messaging via the lock screen.</p><p>Google's more capable AI model's feature has supposedly "replaced" the Assistant's "lock screen settings" and "Assistant routines."</p><p>Additionally, as the feature arrives on more Android phones, it has been recommended that users enable the Phone app and Messages extensions via the Gemini app settings. Google details both extensions in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15575143?sjid=14948406395937871357-NA">a support page</a>, stating that, when enabled, users can "ask" Gemini to make a call or send a text when in the app.</p><p>However, with this function arriving for the lock screen, users only need to produce the AI's overlay and speak their command into their phone. It seems like users can follow the same basic written commands when using the hands-free voice capabilities. Essentially, users can say "Hey Google, call..." followed by the person's name.</p><p>This should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15574940">work similarly for messages</a> as saying "Hey Google, text/message..." is likely to get the job done.</p><p>The publication states the lock screen feature for Gemini's calling/messaging was spotted in version 15.50 of the Google app. So, if the feature hasn't yet appeared on your device, it's likely still making its rounds.</p>

<p>In December, Google first dropped its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-on-lock-screen-call-messages--rollout">Gemini on lock screen</a>" capabilities on Android tester. The beta showed that some users may see a new settings app within the Gemini app that details its lock screen functions. When activated, users can freely produce the AI without opening their phones. However, it was discovered that not every device will have this option available.</p><p>For devices without full support, Gemini will prompt users to unlock their devices so the call may be placed.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google continues to progress with its AI software by rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-subscribers-can-now-use-gemini-flash-2-0-experimental-in-latest-gemini-app-beta">Flash 2.0 experiment</a> to Advanced subscribers. The test concerns those subscribers and the Gemini app on Android, letting them in on the new faster, lightweight model. The Flash 2.0 model takes things beyond what you'd find with Flash 1.5 or even the Gemini 1.5 Pro model.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung Display was at CES 2025 and it showed off several screen concepts.</li><li>Among them, the company showed a "Slidable Flex Duet" and "Solo," which can slide out to the sides for a larger screen experience.</li><li>The company also showcased the world's first rollable OLED for laptops, which it states will arrive by June as it enters mass-production in April.</li><li>In CES 2024, Samsung Display showcased an in-and-out foldable phone and its rollable phone concept.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>CES 2025 is nearly over, but it was full of notable screen concepts from Samsung Display for multiple form factors.</p><p>Samsung Display released a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31326">press release</a> detailing its plans for CES 2025, highlighting several of its design concepts. Among them were a couple of concepts that could (potentially) be used for future phones or tablets. The first involves a Samsung Display concept called the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQ8hkci8o0">Slidable Flex Duet</a>." The company states this screen allows users to slide out from the left and right.</p><p>The post states that the display is roughly 8.1 inches when compact; however, fully sliding things out brings it up to 12.4 inches. There's also a "Solo" variant of this, which seemingly only lets users slide the screen out from one side. Per the post, this display starts at 13 inches before reaching 17.3 inches maximum.</p><p>Another concept seems befitting of a phone as Samsung Display dubs it the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFMFS0eoRhA">Slidable Flex Vertical</a>." This concept involves a user holding the device on either side at the top to pull upward. Samsung states that, at base, the device is 5.1 inches, but fully extending it brings it to 6.7 inches ‚Äî the size of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">S24 Plus</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:886px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.72%;"><img id="UA6Wy9rwNuoLeohCPUSU8b" name="samsung-display-slidable-flex-duet-example" alt="Samsung Display's "Slidable Flex Duet" lets users expand a screen from two sides, creating an even larger experience." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UA6Wy9rwNuoLeohCPUSU8b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="886" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung Display)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During CES 2025, Samsung also showed off a rollable OLED concept for a Lenovo laptop. The concept involved a display that, when "rolled in," is a 14-inch screen that reportedly supports a 5:4 aspect ratio. Samsung states the display reaches 16.7 inches with an 8:9 aspect ratio when rolled out. Seeing as this is a laptop, the post ‚Äî and the CES demo ‚Äî states that the screen expands vertically.</p><p>The display was placed on the Lenovo ThinkPad Plus G6, a device that has to be released. However, today (Jan 9), Samsung Display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31332?category=67&page=1&type=list">announced</a> that it will begin mass-producing this rollable OLED laptop concept in April ahead of an official launch in June 2025.</p><p>Additionally, the company states it has applied its "Eco¬≤ OLED" technology to the upcoming ThinkPad, which "reduces panel thickness and power consumption."</p><p>In other news, our friends at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/tvs/i-just-saw-samsungs-stretchable-microled-display-at-ces-2025-and-its-totally-mind-boggling">Tom's Guide</a> spotted a stretchy Samsung Display concept that <em>literally</em> makes your content move off the screen. The publication states that the OEM calls this technology a "Stretchable MicroLED." As the name implies, the tech is relatively small, but will reportedly shift its form (like moving at you) depending on what is shown.</p><p>It's always interesting to see certain "proof of concepts" of sci-fi-like ideas, which is no different than what Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-display-foldable-rollable-tech-concepts-ces-2024">showed during CES 2024</a>. Last year, the company was deep in its foldable phase as it showcased concepts for an in-and-out folding phone and a rollable display for a smartphone. Also, Samsung first showcased a "stretchable" display at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-demoes-stretchable-oled-display">Global Tech Korea in 2021</a>. The concept four years ago looked different than it does now, but the core functionality of morphing its shape for content remains the same.</p>

The device boasts a glorious FHD+ Super AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate, 5,000mAh battery, and a IP54 water/dust resistance rating. The Exynos 1330¬†chipset is also pretty decent, but the A16&apos;s biggest selling point has to be the six years of guaranteed software updates.

<ul><li>The latest Android Auto 13.5 update swaps "Car" for "Vehicle" in settings, hinting at broader vehicle support.</li><li>New icons in the interface, like one for Indian motorcycle brand TVS, suggest Google‚Äôs planning to bring Android Auto to bikes.</li><li>Android Auto is also prepping for a visual upgrade, with support for higher resolution displays coming soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seems to be working on a few changes for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a>, including bringing it to more vehicle types and giving it a fresh makeover for a smoother ride across all kinds of vehicles.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/07/android-auto-13-5-vehicle-support/#more-656369" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> recently spotted some subtle but telling tweaks in Android Auto version 13.5. Screenshots show that Google swapped out the word "Car" in the app‚Äôs settings for the more inclusive "Vehicle." While it might seem small, this change hints at a bigger plan: making Android Auto work across a wider range of rides, including motorcycles.</p>

<p>Currently, Android Auto <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-vehicles">depends on your car model</a> or having a compatible aftermarket stereo. But according to 9to5Google's findings, that might be changing. It is speculated that Google could break free from these limits, with motorcycles possibly leading the charge.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-auto-motorcycle-support-apk-3513842/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> also spotted new icons in the Android Auto interface that hint at motorcycle-specific features. One standout is an icon for TVS, an Indian motorcycle brand, suggesting Google is teaming up with manufacturers to bring Android Auto to bikes.</p><p>TVS' app icon shows up with other motor brands like China‚Äôs Geely and Leap Motor, California‚Äôs Lucid, and Italy‚Äôs Fiat. Interestingly, Fiat is the only one from that list officially compatible with Android Auto so far.</p><p>It also looks like Android Auto is gearing up for a visual upgrade. Code from the latest update hints at support for higher resolution displays, stepping beyond the current 1920x1080p limit.</p>

<p>This move could take full advantage of high-end vehicle screens, delivering a sharper and more polished experience to match modern infotainment systems.</p><p>Furthermore, Google seems to be making strides in bringing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> AI model to Android Auto. While it‚Äôs still early days for the backend integration, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-auto-gemini-ui-3514032/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> spotted a visual clue‚Äîa Gemini-style gradient on the microphone icon.</p><p>When you tap the microphone icon (assuming it eventually becomes live), it kicks off an interaction with Gemini, showing the prompt "Ask Gemini" at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>These updates aren‚Äôt available in the current version of Android Auto yet, but they‚Äôre expected to roll out in future software updates.</p>

The X7 and X7 Pro are now available globally, and the latter model is particularly interesting, as POCO teamed up with Marvel to release an exclusive variant of the device, dubbed the POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition. <br><br>I'm a big fan of these limited-edition models, and OnePlus used to do a terrific job rolling out unique designs in the past with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-5t-star-wars-review">OnePlus 5T Star Wars</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-6-avengers-edition">OnePlus 6 Avengers</a>, OnePlus 6T and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-7t-pro-mclaren-edition">7T Pro McLaren</a> models, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-nord-2-pac-man-edition">Nord 2 Pac-Man</a> variant. It's exciting to see POCO get in on the action with the X7 Pro, and what's notable here is that the brand is doing so on a budget phone, making the device much more accessible to a wider audience.</p>

<p>That said, POCO isn't launching the X7 Pro Iron Man Edition in India, its biggest consumer market ‚Äî the phone is instead debuting in select Asian countries. It is available in a single 12GB/512GB model, and costs $399. The base model of the X7 Pro, meanwhile, costs $299, with the 512GB model selling at $369, so you're basically paying $30 additionally for the Iron Man Edition.</p><p>With that out of the way, let's talk about the design. POCO clearly paid a lot of attention to small details, with the SIM card ejector in the box styled to look like an Arc Reactor.</p>

<p>The packaging itself is done really well, and it has a "mechanical lift structure" that's meant to mimic the feel of "donning Stark's armor," and you get a cutout highlighting blueprints of Iron Man's suit. There's a case included in the box that does a good job reinforcing the device while simultaneously showing off that design at the back.</p>

<p>Coming to the phone itself, the X7 Pro Iron Man Edition has a distinctive back design with red and gold hues, with the Iron Man helmet prominently highlighted. The helmet is housed within a stylized Arc Reactor, and the rest of the back has a "3D relief enhanced with platinum detailing" that does a great job accentuating the design.</p>

<p>POCO used a tiered system to create a sense of dimension to the design at the back, and the effect is rather interesting. "Thanks to the sophisticated layout of the tiered platinum serrations inside, the shining finish has been perfected for an even brighter, more sparkling look, creating a sense of dimensionality that mirrors the detailed craftsmanship of Stark's engineering. While using a combination of matte and gloss finishes with a sparkling sand texture, the helmet reflects a subtle brilliance under light, while the Arc Reactor's intricate patterns appear both powerful and precise."</p>

<p>While my immediate reaction after taking the device out of the box was that it looked a little tacky, I don't feel the same after using the phone for a week. POCO did a great job with the overall aesthetic of the X7 Pro Iron Man Edition, and the red accents around the cameras at the back and the power button distinguish the design quite a bit. You also get the Avengers logo at the bottom with the POCO logo located at the top, and both of these are decked out in gold, adding a nice bit of contrast.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LRsen3ZbCKHuTvAq74kgVY" name="POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition" alt="POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LRsen3ZbCKHuTvAq74kgVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sides have a boxier design, but there are subtle curves, and I didn't see any issues with usability. That's mostly down to the matte texture on the sides, which just makes it easier to hold and use the device. Other niceties include custom backgrounds and an icon pack that has red borders, which is preinstalled. While I like the backgrounds, the icon pack is too distracting, and thankfully, you can easily switch it out.</p>

<p>The rest of the hardware is identical to the X7 Pro. You get a 6.67-inch AMOLED panel with 120Hz refresh and 1920Hz DC dimming, and it is backed by Corning's Gorilla Glass 7i.</p>

<p>The phone is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 8400 Ultra, and you get 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. The phone doesn't run demanding games at the highest setting, but it is decent enough in its category, and I didn't see many issues in this area. I'll go into much more detail in my review, but as a teaser, I'm including synthetic testing scores above.</p>

<p>Coming to the cameras, there's a 50MP Sony IMX882 that serves as the main shooter, and it's joined by an 8MP wide-angle, with POCO sensibly choosing to limit the device to two good sensors. There's a 6000mAh battery with 90W charging, and interestingly enough, the Indian model of the X7 Pro gets a bigger 6500mAh battery. The Iron Man Edition is based on the global variant, so it has a 6000mAh battery. Rounding out the hardware, you get IP68 ingress protection, NFC, IR blaster, and a decent vibration motor.</p>

<p>On the software side of things, the phone runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box, which gives it a distinct edge over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-14-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 14 Pro+</a>, a device that costs $150 more.</p><p>Overall, I really like what POCO did with the X7 Pro Iron Man Edition. The brand put a lot of thought into the design of the phone as well as the packaging, and it doesn't have an absurd premium over the standard X7 Pro. I would have liked to see the device in India, but outside of that, I don't really have anything to fault with the device ‚Äî it is one of the best limited-edition models I used recently.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Nubia is best-known for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z60-ultra-review">Z60 Ultra</a> and the latest Z70 Ultra (which I'm reviewing), but the ZTE sub-brand also makes budget phones in select regions, and its latest device has a unique attraction. The Nubia Music 2 is a fairly standard entry-level phone; it has a 6.7-inch LCD panel that goes up to 120Hz, a Unisoc T7200 chipset with outdated Cortex A75 and A55 cores, 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, 50MP camera, 5000mAh battery, and 10W charging. <br><br>Why am I interested in this device, you ask? Because of the built-in audio. The Music 2 includes three full-range speakers, and it produces sound up to 95dB. You get a speaker at the bottom and one up top, and a third driver located at the back. If that isn't enough, you even get LED lights around the rear speaker, and there's a 3.5mm jack as well as a MicroSD slot. <br></p>
<p>The ancient chipset coupled with limited memory means the Music 2 isn't a particularly good phone by any measure, but it costs the equivalent of just $88 (MYR389) in Malaysia. I can see this device being a good digital audio player thanks to the built-in sound and inclusion of a 3.5mm jack, and you get Android 14 out of the box ‚Äî most digital players I use still run Android 10 or Android 12, so this is an upgrade in that area. <br><br>The phone is now available in Malaysia and should be heading to select Asian markets. There are obviously much better options around if you need a new phone, but if you want something that doubles as a digital audio player, this looks like a decent enough choice, and I'll see if I can get my hands on one ‚Äî for testing, obviously.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus is offering a competitive warranty guarantee for OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R devices purchased in India before Feb. 13, 2025.</li><li>The promise entitles buyers in India to get a one-time, free replacement if their device suffers from a hardware defect in the first 180 days.</li><li>This policy is in addition to the lifetime display warranty for OnePlus phones in India, which is meant to address the green-line issues that have affected them in the past.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> is a standout flagship phone, and Android Central's own tester gave it a rare 5/5 score in his review. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-makes-a-bold-move-to-tackle-green-line-issues-once-and-for-all">prior OnePlus flagships have been plagued by green-line display issues</a>, and that might give you pause before buying the OnePlus 13. That's why OnePlus is going above and beyond with an offer to replace ‚Äî not repair ‚Äî the OnePlus 13 if you experience a hardware issue in the first six months, but there's a catch.</p><p>The impressive warranty guarantees are only available in India, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13-13r-180-day-replacement-guarantee-3514312/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. Here's how it works: if you buy a OnePlus 13 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-13r-launch">OnePlus 13R</a> in India before Feb. 13, 2025, you'll be entitled to a one-time free device replacement if you experience a hardware issue in your first 180 days with the smartphone. That extends beyond most normal warranty guarantees, which typically cover repairs or refurbished replacements if something goes wrong.</p><p>In other words, this generous warranty guarantee for Indian customers is sure to make those in other regions a bit jealous of what they're missing. For reference, OnePlus' U.S. policy allows for refunds and replacements 15 days after purchase, plus a one-year limited warranty. There's nothing quite like what OnePlus is offering in India.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="5he6VsnBsFWKWmWnE3isk7" name="OnePlus-13-and-13R-180-day-phone-replacement-plan-1920w-1440h.jpg" alt="The phone replacement plan for the OnePlus 13." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5he6VsnBsFWKWmWnE3isk7.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority / OnePlus India)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If that wasn't enough, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1743847105291616260?irclickid=xwZ2ZnQ5mxyKTjsxSSw78yEIUks0l8xBMxZlR40&irgwc=1&utm_source=impact&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_content=Future%20PLC.&utm_term=ac-us&utm_campaign=12532" target="_blank">OnePlus offers a lifetime display warranty</a> for customers in India. Again, there's nothing like it offered globally, but that's partly because the display failures have disproportionately affected phones in that region. These two guarantees to customers in India may help give some peace of mind to people who have had negative experiences with OnePlus hardware failures in the past.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3609px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JcEaHVNMj4cnvWYMBZ2h2D" name="samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-green-line-lifestyle-3.jpg" alt="Green line of death on the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JcEaHVNMj4cnvWYMBZ2h2D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3609" height="2030" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The green line on a Samsung Galaxy phone.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it would be nice to see OnePlus extend these promises to global markets, it's probably best not to hold your breath. OnePlus' current warranty guarantees in North America align similarly with its other competitors, like Apple and Samsung. However, at a time when the brand would likely love to earn more North American market share, a warranty policy that went above and beyond could go a long way.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When Samsung announced the Galaxy S24 with Galaxy AI last January, many of us noticed a conspicuous lack of marketing for the company's terrible virtual assistant, Bixby. While Bixby had some useful features for a while ‚Äî like real-time translation or text scanning ‚Äî it often felt redundant alongside Google Assistant and Gemini, which both offer a plethora of features and better voice recognition than Bixby ever had.</p><p>But Bixby's big return seems to be inevitable as the teaser for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Samsung Unpacked 2025</a> ‚Äî which will see the announcement of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a> on January 22, 2025 ‚Äî all but confirms. In the 16-second video, which you can watch below, a voice speaks to a familiar-looking microphone icon, asking it when Samsung Galaxy Unpacked takes place.</p><p>The invitation notes that we'll see "the next evolution of Galaxy AI," which will be "more natural and intuitive." Traditionally, that's been a code phrase for voice activation, and it lines up perfectly with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-major-gen-ai-bixby-rework-arrives" target="_blank">the new Bixby we saw launch</a> on China's exclusive Galaxy W series in November.</p>

<p>This move is a curious one since Samsung used the Galaxy S24 series to deliver a public show of its strong relationship with Google by including many new Google search and AI features first. Features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> didn't appear on other Android phones for months, and Samsung phones have often been used as launch platforms (along the Pixel series) for Gemini advancements throughout the year.</p><p>While it's possible that Samsung developed a lot of the new Bixby features specifically for the Chinese market ‚Äî Google services are banned in China, after all ‚Äî Samsung was among the first smartphone companies to launch a major new AI computing platform with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, and it would make sense for the company to continue developing its ecosystem with a predictive voice assistant for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>.</p><p>Samsung says the new Bixby can "deeply perceive" what a user wants, as well as maintain a sharp understanding through multi-step instructions. This sounds a lot like what Gemini and ChatGPT can do, but it's not clear if Samsung is tapping into either service or if it's Samsung's own Large Language Model (LLM) running the show.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p5K6YCqMums" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung says the new Bixby can "deeply perceive" what a user wants, as well as maintain a sharp understanding through multi-step instructions.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Samsung is also said to be upgrading Bixby's understanding capabilities so it can "cleverly integrate text and video" into the conversation. The new Bixby also upgrades office document editing and generation, letting users generate entire Word, PowerPoint, and other documents based on their needs.</p><p>OnePlus recently launched something similar with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, allowing users to generate entire documents based on short ideas, but Samsung's Bixby will likely integrate more voice-driven commands into the equation.</p><p>While a lot of this sounds "nice," it's anyone's guess for now as to how often it'll actually be used by Galaxy users on a regular basis. I don't know a single person who enjoyed using Bixby when Samsung pushed it as the default assistant on its devices, and I can't see generative AI changing people's minds and making them want to use it more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZXEqXTh6mbDK3VRNheBtX7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-dbrand-lineup-renders" alt="Galaxy S25 lineup renders with Dbrand skins" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZXEqXTh6mbDK3VRNheBtX7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>I certainly don't think anyone wants a new Bixby and would rather just see it go away forever. That said, I do think Samsung can make the most of this opportunity to further push its edge in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">offline AI computing</a>. The company recently announced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-next-gen-model-gauss-2-ai-model-reveal">new offline AI model</a> that's designed to "integrate into products to deliver higher levels of convenience and personalization.‚Äù</p><p>If that doesn't sound like a new voice assistant model, I don't know what does.</p><p>Samsung is one of the few companies that offers users the option to only process AI-related tasks on-device, even if that means some features are slower or unavailable for use. It allows users to prioritize local computing and privacy over more feature-rich cloud processing.</p>
<p>It also presents the possibility of having AI features long term, as cloud-based AI capabilities like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> require users to pay a monthly subscription fee to maintain server costs. If Samsung has any edge in the AI game, it's this offline processing functionality and a more mature backend software stack thanks to how quickly it moved to integrate AI into its phones.</p><p>But Samsung needs to be careful here. Adding another annoying virtual assistant to a phone that's already chock full of confusing and sometimes redundant features is a recipe for frustration. People don't want two gallery apps. They don't want two assistant apps. And they definitely don't want more AI to raise the price of their phones for the third year in a row.</p><p>The question is if Samsung is listening to users or just its investors, and I'm not fully convinced it's the former.</p>

<ul><li>A recent leak revealed that the Samsung S25 Ultra will be able to capture better videos in low-light settings.</li><li>IceUniverse said this feature will be highly reliant on the capabilities of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.</li><li>The device is also rumored to get an upgraded camera system and sensors that would capture smooth shots in low light ambiance.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We're just weeks away from Samsung's yearly Galaxy Unpacked event set for Jan. 22, and it's raining S25 leaks. The most recent one gives us the scoop on the S25 Ultra's video recording abilities.</p><p>Prominent leaker IceUniverse took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/P8w4MdES1" target="_blank">Weibo</a> to reveal that the upcoming Samsung S25 Ultra will boast camera abilities that will help it capture better videos in low-light settings (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-low-light-video-improvements-3514370/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). This could be attributed to two things, one of which is that the new device is said to come with enhanced cameras.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to come with a 200MP main camera, 50MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and the new 50MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom.</p><p>The leaker added a second factor, which is that the low-light upgrade will be highly dependent on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>'s capabilities, as the chip is rumored to power the upcoming phone. Because of this, the leaker says these improvements would not make it to last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1310px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.53%;"><img id="AyCSsK7FTwcCwmmdMnZBQ3" name="IceUniverse-leak-screenshot" alt="Samsung's functionality with low light videos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyCSsK7FTwcCwmmdMnZBQ3.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1310" height="1055" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: IceUniverse/Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ice Universe was the one that also leaked in November 2024 that the S25 series would come with the above chipset, although Samsung has not yet confirmed as much. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-seemingly-confirms-the-galaxy-s25-series-will-have-a-snapdragon-8-elite-chip" target="_blank">Qualcomm seemingly put these rumors to rest</a> this week when it replied to Samsung on the Unpacked tweet, saying, "See you there." This gave us a subtle confirmation about the core of the S25 series.</p><p>That aside, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is expected to bring in higher video quality, and the Ultra model is said to come with 8K HDR at 60fps and 4K at 120fps when compared to a lower 8K HDR at 30fps, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. Higher frame rates mean video movements that are smoother and more fluid in 8K HDR on the new S 25 Ultra‚Äî presumably in low-light settings as well. As Samsung continuously touts low-light improvements, it'll be interesting to see how it pushes the envelope this time.</p><p>Of course, we ought to take these leaks with a grain of salt until the official announcement later this month at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Galaxy Unpacked</a> where Samsung will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-release-date">launch the Galaxy S25 series</a>. But with all the other factors falling in place, the Ultra will likely shoot better low-light videos.</p><p>We'll be tuning in to Samsung Unpacked on Jan. 22, but until then, you can check out our<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide"> Galaxy S25 guide</a> for more about what we expect from this year's flagships.</p>

<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25 lineup</a> will be revealed at the company's Galaxy Unpacked event, slated for Jan. 22. However, you don't have to wait for the official unveiling if you want a peek at the Galaxy S25 default wallpapers. A leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1876950194601775585" target="_blank">AllAboutSamsung's Max Jambor on X (formerly Twitter)</a> reveals what are claimed to be the official, high-resolution wallpapers that will ship on Samsung's next-generation flagships.</p><p>The two wallpapers shared by Jambor depict a stylistic "S" pattern, clearly an homage to the Galaxy S brand. The shape of the curves of the S in the wallpaper could also be resembling the material surrounding the Galaxy S25 rear camera lenses. Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, the Galaxy S25 series is expected to feature DSLR-style accents around its back camera sensors.</p><p>Aside from those two callbacks, the rumored Galaxy S25 wallpapers are quite simple in nature. They're shown in blue and gray gradients, but more may be available to match every unique Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra colorway.</p>

<ul><li>Google Home is testing expanded presence sensing support for more smart home devices.</li><li>The feature can now consider the media playback statuses of other devices, like game consoles or smart displays.</li><li>You can try out this feature today in the Google Home app public preview.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's presence sensing features make it possible to set up home and away automations for your smart home devices based on your location. To date, the most reliable way to use presence sensing is to have every household member opt-into geofence location sharing. The way it works is simple ‚Äî if everyone leaves the house, your away automations can run, and vice versa.</p><p>Now, there's a few new data points presence sensing can consider, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/08/google-home-presence-sensing/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. Beginning as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home app</a> public preview, presence sensing can take into account the status of your smart home devices to detect whether you're home or away, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12494697#zippy=%2Cuse-smart-media-devices-for-presence-sensing" target="_blank">support document</a>.</p><p>"You can now use your smart media devices for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/10000312" target="_blank">presence sensing</a>," the support document for this public preview feature explains. "Your media devices can contribute to presence sensing with media status, such as when they detect media playback or when you turn them on or off."</p>

<p>Google says the following types of smart home devices can be used for this presence sensing test:</p>
<ul><li>Smart speakers and displays</li><li>TVs (including Google streaming devices)</li><li>Game consoles</li><li>Streaming sticks and boxes</li></ul>
<p>You can turn presence sensing on or off for a specific device in the Google Home app. Tap <strong>Settings </strong>><strong> Presence sensing</strong> to view the list of eligible devices, and then press the toggle beside one to turn it on or off. By default, smart speakers and displays will automatically report media playback status if you've already turned on presence sensing for those devices.</p><p>These data points, while not foolproof, can help Google Home figure out if anyone is home or if everyone is away. Chances are, if someone just casted a video to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-review">Google Nest Hub display</a>, there's probably someone at home. Conversely, if nothing is playing, that could be a sign no one is home.</p><p>You can try this presence sensing feature by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-gemini-help-me-create-public-preview">opting-into the Google Home app public preview</a>. To do so, open the Google Home app, then tap <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Public Preview </strong>> <strong>Join Public Preview</strong>.</p>

<ul><li>Google is testing a Daily Listen feature that turns your Discover feed into a five-minute podcast.</li><li>The experiment is starting out a Search Labs feature, and users in the U.S. on iOS and Android can opt-in.</li><li>The podcast will be tailored to your individual preferences using your Discover and Search data.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google surprisingly played a significant role in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-wrapped-2024-arrives">Spotify's Wrapped 2024 experience with Audio Overviews</a>, an AI-generated podcast that recapped your year in music leveraging <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">NotebookLM</a>. Now, the company is testing out a Search Labs feature that would let you recap your daily news in a similar way. Instead of revisiting your Spotify playback history, this experimental "Daily Listen" feature sums up your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-personalize-google-discover-feed">Google Discover feed</a> in a five-minute audio podcast.</p><p>Google Discover, a news aggregator that appears in the Google app and Android, has quickly become a popular way for people to find stories. Taking account your Discover and Search history, Daily Listen will pick the articles that are most interesting to you and review them in audio form (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/08/google-discover-daily-listen/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The test is starting as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-labs-english-speaking-practice-ai-experiment">Search Labs feature</a>, which you may be able to participate in by tapping the Labs icon in the top-left corner of the Google app. From there, look for the Daily Listen card to opt-in. It's available to Google app users on iOS and Android in the U.S., but may not show up for everyone immediately.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="fkTHpi4xhV4ETNBLoVAfQm" name="Google-Daily-Listen-lab.jpg" alt="The experimental Daily Listen feature in Discover." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fkTHpi4xhV4ETNBLoVAfQm.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After opting-into Daily Listen, users can expect it to take about a day for the first audio recap to appear in the Google app. When available, it'll show as a block on the Google app homepage, between the Search bar and the Discover feed. Tapping it will start the podcast-like experience, fully featured with playback controls and timestamps.</p><p>The Daily Listen experiment, albeit only a test at the moment, appears to be yet another step by Google toward the so-called "zero-click internet." By summing up Discover posts in audio form, Google app users may have less incentive to navigate to the website providing the information recapped in Daily Listen episodes. This tracks with other Search Labs features, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overview-save-feature-expansion">AI Overviews</a>, which have since been opened up to the public.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, the OnePlus 13 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">was awarded a rare perfect score</a> from senior smartphone expert Nicholas Sutrich yesterday, and that is no small feat. The flagship device boasts a gorgeous 6.8-inch OLED display with an unbelievable 6,000mAh battery and the efficiency of the new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. It&apos;s also the first phone to sport IP69 water/dust resistance, and you get a ton of fun features thanks to Oxygen OS 15. So, yeah, not only is the phone OnePlus&apos; greatest creation, but it&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> ever built, period.</p><p>The only reason I would skip the OnePlus 13 is if you need more than six years of software support or you simply prefer devices from Samsung or Google. You also need to be connected to the internet to use a lot of the phone&apos;s AI features, but these minor weaknesses pale in comparison to the OnePlus 13&apos;s many, many strengths.¬†</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's vice chairman, Han Jong-hee, announced that the company will begin a phone subscription service under its "AI Subscription Club."</li><li>This service pertains to South Korean residents only as Samsung has said whether the U.S. or other markets will see the Club or the phone plan.</li><li>Han Jong-hee also announced that Samsung's robotic companion, Ballie, will arrive in Korea and the U.S. in the "first half" of 2025.</li><li>Samsung's Galaxy S25 series is preparing to debut on January 22.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is reportedly preparing to reveal the details of its proposed smartphone subscription service.</p><p>The report arrives courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.etnews.com/20250108000240">EtNews</a> (Korean), which cites Samsung's vice chairman, Han Jong-hee, from a recent CES 2025 press conference (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338974/samsung-galaxy-subscription-smartphones-ballie">The Verge</a>). According to Han, the company is preparing to bring a smartphone subscription option to its "AI Subscription Club" in South Korea. The vice chairman said, "We will apply the subscription service to Galaxy smartphones starting next month."</p><p>So, it seems consumers in Samsung's home region of South Korea can expect this new phone option to appear sometime in February.</p><p>The publication adds that bringing Samsung's Galaxy phones to its subscription service will surface no possibilities for Korean consumers. In short, consumers will have access to "maintenance services" ‚Äî for repairs ‚Äî in an installment plan that works for them.</p><p>Samsung notably launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/%EC%82%BC%EC%84%B1%EC%A0%84%EC%9E%90-ai-%EA%B5%AC%EB%8F%85%ED%81%B4%EB%9F%BD-%EC%8B%9C%EC%9E%91">AI Subscription Club</a> on December 1, letting users engage in AI-powered home appliances for a set period. The plan, which is set to include phones, seems reminiscent of purchasing a contract phone from a cellular provider. This is something the vice chairman noted, as well, as the publication states "It is expected to have a positive effect on improving the sales performance of mobile devices at Samsung Store." Consumers can instead slowly pay off a device in smaller amounts, instead of dropping a chunk of cash at once.</p><p>Han Jong-hee adds that South Korea <em>and </em>the U.S. can soon expect the arrival of its personal robot, Ballie. The bot is expected to arrive in the "first half" of 2025. Those in South Korea will see the bot available via the AI Subscription Club, as well, if consumers would like to avoid a complete purchase.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meet #Ballie, Samsung‚Äôs human-centric vision of robots that takes personalized care to the next level.

<p>With Samsung's South Korean consumers preparing for this phone subscription service, it's unclear if folks anywhere else will see it. Other regions would need Samsung's AI Subscription Club ‚Äî that's for sure, but Han Jong-hee didn't allude to anything of the sort. So, for right now, it's probably best to not hold your breath about it.</p><p>In other news, Samsung's Ballie was first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-ces-2020">highlighted five years ago</a> during CES 2020. The small, rollable home companion was showcased in a video turning the TV on and cleaning up floor messes. Ballie was also stated to follow its owner around with cute chirps alongside the ability to understand and adhere to voice commands.</p><p>For home security, Ballie was also equipped with a camera, meaning users could check in on their house when away. The first half of 2025 includes January to June, so we have a few months before we see this little bot.</p><p>While U.S. users aren't getting in on this phone subscription, we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25 launch</a> in our immediate future. Samsung's January Unpacked is set to get going on January 22 with the Galaxy S25 series, One UI 7, and more likely on deck.</p>

It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div>
<p>At the center of it all is a new back-end algorithm OnePlus plainly calls Dual Exposure, where each frame is composed of two instantaneous captures: one long exposure and one short. The combination results in photos that have punchy contrast, incredibly moving object clarity, and extremely wide dynamic range when called for.</p><p>On top of that, OnePlus is using two brand new Sony LYT sensors, helping deliver the best image quality possible on its main and telephoto sensors. This, combined with a tweaked camera UI and improved AI-powered software stack, allows incredible clarity up to 30X zoom, as well as impressive tricks like 4K 60FPS Dolby Vision capture on all four cameras.</p><p>Overall, it's a huge win for the company that fought to prove itself as a contender in mobile photography for years with its Hasselblad branding. Now, OnePlus can stand tall alongside that H on the back of the OnePlus 13 knowing it's got one of the finest mobile cameras available today.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motion-capture"><span>Motion capture</span></h2>
<p>For years, I've weighed motion capture more highly than any other metric when judging a smartphone's camera system. Any camera can take good enough photos in almost any lighting condition now, but only a select few can get the job done when a person or pet isn't willing to hold still.</p><p>OnePlus talked up a big game during the OnePlus 13's announcement, saying it finally solved the motion capture problem. While standard image capture works well for moving objects, action mode, and clear burst are the best solutions for ensuring you capture the moment.</p><p>In standard photo mode, the OnePlus 13 impressed with a complete lack of shutter lag. Very few phones do this well ‚Äî the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> is a great example of getting it right ‚Äî while phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> have a rather horrible shutter lag that feels like it takes "forever" to capture a photo after pressing the shutter button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="QBEetobWgoaY2uMAhS3yHM" name="oneplus-13-camera-sample-night-motion" alt="A low light camera sample from a OnePlus 13 showcasing excellent motion capture detail (see the bowling ball traveling down the lane)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QBEetobWgoaY2uMAhS3yHM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The above photo is a perfect example of what can be captured by simply opening the camera app and tapping the shutter button. Not only is this a low-light environment, but the bowling ball in the middle of the frame was moving down the lane at the time of capture.</p><p>Because of OnePlus's excellent new dual exposure algorithm, though, the ball has been captured in crisp detail. It even did an excellent job of balancing the exposure throughout the scene, while some phones might underexpose the photo in order to capture the moving object best.</p><p>The improvement over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>'s camera can be seen at times like these, as that bowling ball would be blurrier when captured on last year's OnePlus flagship. This difference even occurs during the day, as you can see in the two images of a moving carousel ride below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:37.49%;"><img id="kRK3hnSbS2btMxgH7QpuWG" name="oneplus-13-camera-motion-capture-versus-1" alt="Comparing motion capture of the OnePlus 13's camera versus the OnePlus 12 by photographing a moving carousel during the day" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kRK3hnSbS2btMxgH7QpuWG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4092" height="1534" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Using Action Mode bumps the camera viewfinder up from 30FPS to 60FPS, making it easier to time the moment when you tap the shutter button. Better yet, rapidly tapping the shutter button or just holding it down will activate "clear burst" mode, which delivers multiple dual exposure captures per second. This works in bright or dim light equally as well.</p><p>It also works on <em>all</em> of the phone's rear cameras, so you can capture action mode shots at any zoom level or even using the ultrawide camera. As evidenced in the comparison below using at 3X zoom in the camera's viewfinder, OnePlus's action mode is particularly effective even when compared to the Google Pixel 9 Pro's very capable cameras.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 nailed the exposure and color temperature of the scene, plus captured every movement in crystal clear detail. Thanks to action mode, it was easier to capture the moment mid-swing, while the Pixel 9 Pro automatically chose the least blurry photo it captured when I tapped the shutter button.</p><p>For reference, Pixel phones are always taking photos even before you tap the shutter button, and they automatically pick the best frame based on AI analysis on the back end. When using action mode and Clear Burst on a OnePlus 13, you can select from a handful of images captured during the image-taking process, giving you far better manual control after taking a photo.</p><p>The OnePlus 13's action mode also holds up well in lower light, as this second example of my son jumping off the top bunk of his bed shows. The OnePlus 13's photo is overexposed around the light source, but the rest of the scene looks excellent. Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro's photo is underexposed throughout the image, even if it nailed the highlights around the light on the ceiling.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-zoom-detail"><span>Zoom detail</span></h2>
<p>The OnePlus 13 not only uses a huge new Sony LYT-600 50MP 1/1.95-inch sensor, but it packs the sensor behind a new triple-prism lens that's 24% flatter and 30% lighter than the one on the OnePlus 12. Like a lot of companies, OnePlus is baking AI right into the photo capture, ensuring that the 3X lens performs a lot better than it might seem at first.</p><p>I can see this being a controversial decision because there are some fairly obvious "AI-looking" enhancements in regular photos. I don't think it detracts from photos, and OnePlus isn't the only company doing this, but phones like a Pixel 9 Pro will produce a more natural image even if it's of lower quality in some situations.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="470" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=ea71ef56-cdc6-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>The OnePlus 13 shots are almost always of higher contrast than shots from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">competing Android phones</a>, giving them a distinct look. Many of the phone's photos look best on the phone's display because of the enhanced HDR represented by the Pro XDR capture, which is enabled by default. Exporting photos or editing them often removes this Pro XDR layer, making them slightly lower quality than the original capture.</p><p>This is similar to how HDR video captured on the phone will often look better than after it's posted on social media or other platforms. This isn't OnePlus's fault, but it can affect the end result.</p><p>At night, the extra contrast and punchiness of the OnePlus 13's photos really shine. This 20X zoom photo comparison with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra shows that off particularly well, as the OnePlus 13's colors look richer and more accurate than the washed-out ones on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. The OnePlus 13 also nails the exposure, giving the scene more moodiness and keeping the lights from being blown out.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="850" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=d1e5e0a0-cd35-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>One area OnePlus needs to improve is with direct frame crops which occur at both 2x and 6x. The 2x button crops the main sensor by 50%, while the 6x button does the same with the telephoto sensor. Typically, companies call this an "optical zoom equivalent" because there's no real digital zooming happening, and, instead, the number of binned pixels is just cut in half.</p><p>However, the OnePlus 13 appears to be doing some extra processing at these two zoom levels, which doesn't do it any favors. Compared to the OnePlus 12's 2x photo of the same subject, the OnePlus 13's photo looks heavily digitally processed. This didn't <em>always</em> happen, but I never saw this behavior on the OnePlus 12, so the company needs to tweak the algorithm a bit for these specific zoom levels.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-night-light"><span>Night light</span></h2>
<p>One of the chief complaints about modern smartphone photography is that too many phones make night photos look like daytime photos. Pixels and Galaxy phones are particularly bad about this, and thankfully, OnePlus doesn't seem to suffer from this issue the vast majority of the time.</p><p>I've taken hundreds of low-light photos with these phones and have been supremely impressed with the OnePlus 13's ability to make a nighttime photo actually look like it's <em>nighttime</em>. This photo of a giant Christmas tree in the park taken from the ultrawide angle lens perfectly illustrates that.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="850" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=98fc9574-cd38-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>The OnePlus 13's photo here is the epitome of perfection. Everything is right, from the exposure to the contrast, the color temperature, and even the fine details on the sign at the base of the tree. The Pixel 9 Pro tried to pull out as much shadow detail as possible, which is admirable, but it ended up making the photo look far brighter than it was in real life.</p><p>Since nighttime photography typically ends up requiring longer exposures, the OnePlus 13's new dual exposure algorithm helps the phone capture anything that might be moving during that long exposure. This shot of the moonlight reflecting on the open ocean, taken from the side of a cruise ship, perfectly illustrates that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.43%;"><img id="cdK6PZJyAVoRNPgWy4mum5" name="oneplus-13-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-night-ocean" alt="A photo taken from the deck of a ship at night, looking at the moon reflecting off the ocean, comparing the OnePlus 13 to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cdK6PZJyAVoRNPgWy4mum5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4096" height="1820" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notice how the waves are super crisp and detailed on the OnePlus 13, while the Pixel 9 Pro and Galaxy S24 Ultra's shots exhibit double imaging or blurriness. This kind of motion clarity is consistent with the shot of the bowling ball rolling down the lane in the dimly lit bar at the beginning of this article.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-selfies-and-portraits"><span>Selfies and portraits</span></h2>
<p>OnePlus phones have had a very good portrait mode for quite some time now, but I've called Samsung the king of portrait mode several years in a row. That being said, OnePlus is giving Samsung (and Honor) a run for its money with the OnePlus 13's enhanced Hasselblad portrait mode, which does an even better job of subtly separating the subject from the background.</p><p>In the first shot, I used the widest portrait zoom I could get from each phone to capture myself in a dashing surfer Santa statue. Clearly, Santa needs to work on his beach bod, but there are two standouts in this comparison.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro did a great job of blurring the background in the top half of the picture but the bottom half's blurred background is a bit messy. The cutout between the surfboard and Santa's leg is nonexistent, while lower down the leg, the edge of the cutout is very messy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.43%;"><img id="BDNX2VZA8CDhyYphXgHPtL" name="oneplus-13-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-night-portrait" alt="Comparing the OnePlus 13, Samsung Galaxy S24, and Google Pixel 9 Pro's rear camera portrait modes using a nighttime shot of a surfer Santa" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BDNX2VZA8CDhyYphXgHPtL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4096" height="1820" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13's lighting is considerably better than the other two phones with better colors and highlights all around. It also subtly blurred the background all around Santa and the surfboard and did an excellent job of the cutout all around. The blur depth is configurable in the viewfinder, but this is the default setting. The one issue with this shot is the surfboard pattern, which lacks detail compared to the other two phones' shots.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra's shot is the most detailed but it's also the darkest and has no portrait mode blurring at all. It also exhibits some nasty sensor noise that Samsung's algorithm tried to clean up by my face, in particular, looks extremely digitally processed.</p><p>Samsung's front-facing camera fared much better in this same scenario when I took a selfie in front of the giant Christmas tree right near the surfer Santa. While I like how the OnePlus 13's photo came out, the punchy contrast from the Galaxy S24 Ultra's photo looks better to me.</p>

<p>The next shot on a sunny beach uses the portrait mode from the front-facing camera of the OnePlus 13, Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, and Google Pixel 9 Pro. The Galaxy S24 Ultra's shot is consistently darker than the other two phones in portrait mode and isn't nearly as wide as what's offered by OnePlus or Google. The portrait cutout is extremely nice; however, it is something Samsung has done consistently excellently for years.</p><p>The OnePlus 13's photo is my favorite of the bunch, sporting warmer colors, excellent exposure balance between foreground and background, and an ultra-clean cutout between me and the background with subtle blending between.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro's photo looks crisp but a close inspection at the cutout shows the usual errors Google's portrait mode always exhibits. I also think the Pixel blurred the background far too much ‚Äî again, something it always does ‚Äî and made the photo look fake.</p>

<p>For the first time in history, I feel confident carrying around a OnePlus phone for use as my main camera. While I've used the OnePlus 12 as my main phone throughout most of 2024, I almost always carried another phone along with me so I'd have the best camera and my favorite phone with me at all times.</p><p>This year, things are different. The OnePlus 13's camera is magnificent, and, outside of a scant few situations, it meets or beats the competition and gives me the photo I was hoping for. Amazingly enough, this even includes capturing motion, something OnePlus and Samsung have historically been the weakest at.</p><p>It feels like a miracle that OnePlus would finally get its act together and craft a world-class camera, especially considering this is the 5th generation Hasselblad branded camera. A combination of new sensors and a new backend processing algorithm have worked some serious magic, and I'm happy to say that the OnePlus 13 is now my favorite mobile camera.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube Music detailed the start of its new "monthly audience" metric for fans on an artist's page.</li><li>This statistic will involve more than just song listens on YouTube Music as the metric will grab video and Short views, collaboration views, and other content.</li><li>YouTube Music's recent string of tests has involved AI, particularly its latest "restyle" test for 30-second AI-created clips.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube Music is testing an interesting new stat for its artist pages, reminiscent of another platform.</p><p>The company detailed its latest test in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/15621827?hl=en">a support page</a>, stating it's "exploring new ways to show an artist‚Äôs presence and reach." YouTube Music explains this new "monthly audience" metric as a "fan-facing, public" statistic that will appear (for some) on an artist's discography page. Interestingly, the number of "unique" listeners won't come from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-underrated-feature-device-files-upload">YouTube Music</a> alone.</p><p>The platform states that its experimental monthly audience stat concerns those who've listened to their music (obviously). However, this metric broadens its reach to the main YouTube video service, too. The explainer states that "non-music" content created by the artist will fall into this monthly metric. Additionally,  views on long-form and short-form videos created/uploaded by the artist "or their label" count toward the "monthly listeners."</p><p>Elsewhere, YouTube states collaborations with an artist featured on other channels and videos/Shorts created by content creators using their music will factor into this number.</p><p>The post extends its reach to the YouTube Kids app, as well, for displaying how far an artist's "reach" goes.</p><p>It seems that YouTube Music will refresh this monthly audience statistic every "28 days."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="GzQNJ8Q6j77Rdsyt2oQSP8" name="youtube-music-create-a-radio.jpg" alt="Create a radio section in Youtube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzQNJ8Q6j77Rdsyt2oQSP8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Users may be familiar with a similar stat as Spotify also prominently features its "monthly listeners" number for artists. There is some overlap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/">as Spotify states</a> it refreshes the number every 28 days, as well. However, the company breaks that number into three "segments:" active audience, previously active, and programmed. The first are those actively listening most days with "previously active" regarding those who haven't in the past 28 days, but may still listen "from programmed sources."</p><p>The final segment involves listeners from "editorial playlists, Discover Weekly, Radio, Autoplay," and more.</p><p>The recently started YouTube Music test seems a little more tame compared to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-song-restyle-ai-remix-test-spotted">trend toward AI</a> via "restyle." With Dream Track access, content creators were given time with an AI-based feature that lets them "restyle" a song and turn it into a 30-second clip. This test lets users describe the feeling (mood) and genre of the new, restyled song they'd like.</p>

<p>More often than not, Samsung flagships use a mix of the company's own Exynos chips and Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. This time around, leaks and rumors heavily pointed to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> being Snapdragon-only.</p><p>With just a few weeks to go until the Galaxy S25 is officially revealed at Galaxy Unpacked, Samsung and Qualcomm's playful banter on social media is as close to a confirmation we'll get that the two companies are working together on the next-generation smartphones.</p><p>Samsung announced that it'll <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">reveal the Galaxy S25 series at a Galaxy Unpacked event on Jan. 22</a> with a post on X (formerly Twitter). That post went live on Monday, Jan. 6, but the interesting part came a day later. The official account for the Snapdragon brand quoted Samsung's post on Jan. 7 with the cryptic message: "See you there."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We‚Äôre just as hyped as you are! üôå Mark your calendars ‚Äî what‚Äôs coming at #GalaxyUnpacked will redefine the future of innovation üëÄ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1876926152792498629">January 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While not a confirmation in the traditional sense, this post from Qualcomm signals that Snapdragon will be a focal point of the Galaxy S25 series. Right now, there's only one Qualcomm mobile chipset that would fit the bill, and that's the powerhouse Snapdragon 8 Elite platform. Geekbench 6 scores hint that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-use-an-overclocked-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-in-the-galaxy-s25-series">Samsung could be using an overclocked "Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy" chipset</a> for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and perhaps the rest of the lineup.</p><p>Put it all together, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims">prior reports about Samsung's low Exynos yield rates</a>, the Geekbench 6 scores, and now Qualcomm's cryptic post all seemingly confirm that the Galaxy S25 series will be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite platform</a>.</p><p>If existing Snapdragon 8 Elite phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-is-the-best-gaming-phone-and-its-here-in-the-us">Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro</a>, are any indication, the Samsung Galaxy S25 series should be a performance champion ‚Äî especially if it's overclocked.

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-may-soon-get-gemini">Gemini is likely coming to Wear OS watches</a>, but the leaked news leaves plenty of unanswered questions. We don't know when it'll arrive, whether tools like Gemini Live and app extensions will work, how Gemini's answers will look on tiny watch screens, and whether all the processing will require your phone on hand.</p><p>With the right answers to these uncertainties, Google could give Wear OS users a real excitement boost with Gemini smarts. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-9-is-a-hit-pixels-earn-double-digit-market-share-for-the-first-time">Major Pixel 9 sales growth</a> proves that Gemini marketing is working on consumers, and getting AI insights with your phone in your pocket will appeal to many.</p><p>But <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> isn't just one service: It's a label applied to different functions and levels of intelligence, varied based on whether it's cloud- or device-based. Wear OS's version of the assistant/chatbot would significantly differ from what your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> or laptop offers, for example.</p><p>Wear OS will likely depend on phone and cloud processing to make Gemini work, at least until the hardware becomes smart enough to handle things itself. And Gemini itself has features that might not work well on a smartwatch. So what <em>will</em> Gemini bring to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> that Assistant couldn't? I have some ideas!</p>

<h2 id="what-little-we-know-about-gemini-on-wear-os-2">What little we know about Gemini on Wear OS</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4DStjDLKKkTcnbvQaxXvVN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-google-assistant.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4DStjDLKKkTcnbvQaxXvVN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/06/gemini-wear-os-prep/">9to5Google</a> discovered the Gemini references in Google app beta code, with the language "Easily talk back and forth to get more done with an assistant on your watch, reimagined with Google AI" describing the wearable app.</p><p>The site also found references to Gemini being summonable by the same methods as Assistant: Using the "Hey Google" phrase or holding down the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>'s side button. You can safely assume that Google will keep its always-listening option for Gemini, too, though this will burn through battery life faster.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/307540908">confirmed</a> in November that the Pixel Watch series' next Wear OS update would be in March. Wear OS updates usually arrive monthly with minor changes, so why is the Watch 3 stuck with its September launch software? Perhaps because Google needed six months to get Gemini ready in wearable form, pushing other updates to the back burner.</p><p>If not March, we could see Gemini arrive alongside the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>, both of which should launch with Wear OS 6 in late summer. Google in particular will probably have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new SoC hardware</a> by then; Qualcomm's VP of wearables Dino Bekis told me their 2025 Wear chip will have "more on-device AI capability."</p><p>Gemini Nano, the portable version of Google's AI, still requires a phone's neural processing unit for edge tasks like summarizing an email or transcribing conversations. So it's likely that some Gemini on-watch tools will be exclusive to newer models that <em>add</em> NPUs, while older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> with decade-old Cortex cores will have to rely solely on your phone and cloud computing.</p>
<h2 id="what-gemini-could-bring-to-wear-os-watches-2">What Gemini could bring to Wear OS watches</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p3FVWNhhsQUNpF5xaKUpY6" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-16.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Gemini results" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3FVWNhhsQUNpF5xaKUpY6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The most obvious Gemini Wear OS application is to enable on-wrist conversations, like you get with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>, or simply more intelligent answers to questions. The leaked language "talk back and forth" sure seems to imply an actual conversation, which gives me hope that you'll be able to have in-depth discussions with remembered context until you have the answer you need.</p><p>The biggest hurdle is that most Gemini answers take about 10‚Äì15 seconds if they require pulling up information ‚Äî compared to 4-ish seconds for simpler questions ‚Äî and phone-to-watch Bluetooth communication may add an additional delay. Google Assistant has gotten faster at on-device answers, but Gemini will feel like a step backward for speed ‚Äî even if it's a step forward for clarity.</p><p>The second hurdle is the size of the screen. Gemini spits out a ton of information to any question or prompt to provide enough context (see the photo above). Ask your Wear OS watch the same question, and you'll have to scroll through a lot more tiny text or stand and wait for Gemini to read everything out loud for a couple of minutes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MEypxaySVNEaqavKxefoBf" name="Gemini-Google-Home-Integration.jpg" alt="Google Home integration in the Gemini app for Android." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MEypxaySVNEaqavKxefoBf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The next potential Gemini application on Wear OS is to work with Gemini extensions. Imagine being able to prompt Gemini from your wrist to summarize your unread emails, create a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> playlist based on your mood, or tell you about nearby 4-star lunch spots via Maps. Your phone would do all the work, but it would remain in your pocket.</p><p>Google began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-integrates-gemini-for-smarter-home-automation">integrating Gemini and Google Home</a> last year, and it's hard to say that Gemini is any better than Assistant was at controlling your smart home tech, barring a few minor perks like summarizing who came to your door via Nest Doorbell. But any future innovations will be Gemini-exclusive, so Wear OS owners with smart homes will benefit in the long run.</p><p>Then, of course, you have Gems, or the customizable and specialized versions of Gemini built for specific tasks like playing chess or serving as a "running coach," one Google example that feels especially apt for Wear OS.</p><p>I think specialized Gems you can quick-swap between in a Gemini Tile would be perfect for the format, because no one wants to stand around waiting for generalized answers on your wrist. If you know what topic you're usually curious about while on the go, why not have that Gem quick-loaded on your Pixel Watch?</p><p>Beyond these obvious Gemini applications on Wear OS, I'd be interested to see if the app's image generation tools could be put to use for watch face creation. Imagine if you could use Imagen 3 to create an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">XML-compatible face</a> cropped to your screen's proportions in less than a minute.</p><p>Gemini could also prove useful for finding new Wear OS apps, which can be a pain to find in the on-watch Play Store. You could ask the assistant to recommend a few options for different categories (e.g., fitness, weather, productivity, etc.) and summarize their differences and strengths.</p>
<h2 id="the-most-obvious-gemini-application-is-health-and-fitness-2">The most obvious Gemini application is health and fitness</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fPpvjgpUCN64ZdtqTgkJyP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-and-Android-statue.jpeg" alt="An Android statue wearing a headband and a dummy Pixel Watch 3, standing behind a display of Pixel Watch 3s." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPpvjgpUCN64ZdtqTgkJyP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If it's not apparent from the list above, I'm hopeful about Gemini on Wear OS, but also skeptical that Google can deliver a transformative Gemini assistant experience with lightweight hardware and a tiny screen.  I'm ready to be proved wrong, but I don't know if smartwatches can support enough tokens to provide the context necessary for intelligent answers. So I'm expecting delayed answers and a significant battery drain while using Gemini for long conversations. We'll find out soon!</p><p>I could see Gemini proving more useful in the backend. If Google uses Gemini to analyze your Fitbit results upon request ‚Äî ideally while preserving your data privacy ‚Äî that could provide useful insights on your current health, recent fitness or sleep trends, and so on. It could then highlight the key AI insights in your Morning Brief.</p><p>On the fitness side, Google already recommends daily runs to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> users based on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">training load</a>. In theory, a Gemini Coach could take things to the next level and analyze post-run results (like Strava's Athlete Intelligence) or expand beyond running and recommend gym workout routines, for example.</p><p>Google could even provide those insights <em>during</em> an activity; you could say, "Hey Google, how am I doing?" and have it tell you that you're on PR pace or that your heart rate is too elevated over your wireless earbuds."</p>

<ul><li>Rumors from a South Korean publication claim Samsung could utilize COE screen tech on the S26 Ultra, which was previously used on its foldable.</li><li>The tech could deliver a richer color, brighter, and power-conscious experience for future owners of the device.</li><li>Recent rumors claim the Galaxy S26 Ultra could feature Samsung's new 2nm Exynos chip quite "significantly."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While we sit in the Galaxy S25 waiting room, rumors have appeared about what upgrades a member of the S26 series could feature.</p><p>The rumors surface from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=32201">The Elec</a> (Korean), which cites an unnamed source about the alleged enhanced screen functionality for the Galaxy S26 Ultra (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s26_ultras_display_to_be_brighter_and_more_efficient_-news-66012.php">GSMArena</a>). According to the publication, Samsung may seek out COE screen technology, which could positively affect the power consumption of the 2026 Ultra model.</p><p>The post states this is facilitated by swapping the display's underlying polarizer for "color filters," instead. The post notes that the thicker polarizing plates used by OLEDs reflect light, but hampers brightness, thus requiring users to boost up when outside.</p><p>The report states Samsung's adoption of COE technology could improve the richness of color for the S26 Ultra with the proposed color filters. Also, rumors of a "Black PDL" (Pixel Define Layer) could further prevent light from reflecting within the screen, improving its brightness in various situations.</p><p>Another side effect of this supposed new technology is its thinness. The rumors claim that the alleged polarizer swap to color filters with the COE tech could make for a thinner display. We've heard for a while how Samsung is likely entering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-alleged-rendering">its thin phone era</a>, so this doesn't seem too far-fetched.</p><p>The idea of these displays being thinner is likely because, as the publication noted, Samsung has previously featured COE display tech on its foldables (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">think Fold 6</a>). A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.electronicspecifier.com/news/coe-to-dominate-as-the-main-antireflection-technology-for-foldable-oleds">Electronic Specifier</a> states that COE's tech is typically applied "directly onto the panel," which facilitates this thinner design. It also notes how its screen technology can deliver longevity to the lifespan of a device's display.</p>

<p>There's been little about Samsung's 2026 phones ‚Äî and that's no surprise as we're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-alleged-rendering">weeks away from the S25</a>. However, we've heard rumors about the potential return of the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-curved-edge-display-patent-2024-report">curved-edge</a>" Galaxy phone. Following a recently filed patent, speculation rose about the chance for Samsung to bring back its curved-edge display for future Galaxy Ultra phones. The Korean OEM has slowly moved away from that in its Ultra models, opting for flatter displays like the rest of the cast.</p><p>The patent held information about a boost in durability, which phones with curved displays are prone to.</p><p>What's more, rumors from December claimed Samsung is developing a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-rumors-galaxy-s26-exynos-change">Exynos chip for the Galaxy S26</a> series. It's been purported that the company may feature this Exynos chip (on a new 2nm process) "significantly" on the next-gen series. These very early rumors are worth taking with a grain of salt. It's been alleged that Samsung could still drop the phones with the next Qualcomm chip in the U.S., though.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google wants you to focus on your Pixel phone's battery as it dictates the device's lifespan. In a detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15738128?s=31" target="_blank">post</a>, the tech giant has laid out steps to maximize your battery life, including the temperature at which it should be charged and when to send it in for a replacement.</p><p>Like most devices, Pixel phones also use rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that get worn out after a set number of complete charging cycles. One full charging cycle is typically when your phone is being charged to 100% after it is completely discharged. Different Pixel devices have varied charging cycle limits before the battery needs to be replaced.</p><p>Per Google:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Pixel 3 through Pixel 8 Pro, including Pixel Fold:</strong>¬†This should retain up to 80% capacity for about 800 charge cycles.</li><li><strong>Pixel 8a and later:</strong>¬†Should retain up to 80% capacity for about 1000 charge cycles.</li></ul>

<p>"Your device‚Äôs actual lifespan depends on usage patterns and other factors," the post added.</p><p>These factors include charging the Pixel where the ambient temperature where your Pixel is charging. Ideally, the room/space should be at a temperature of about 25‚ÑÉ or 78‚Ñâ, where exposure to direct sunlight or heat is minimal. Or by simply turning off features that could be running in the background/ ones that you don't use.</p><p>Other things that could maximize your battery life are updating the Pixel to the most recent Android version, turning on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7015477?sjid=1193958818943232076-NC" target="_blank">adaptive charging</a>, and storing your phone with at least 50% charge if you plan to store it for more than 30 days without using it. We also have a set of tips to help you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">extend your Android phone's battery health</a> that you may want to check out. Ultimately, this may help if you plan to keep your phone for the remainder of its software support cycle.</p><p>However, there will come a time when users might have to replace their Pixel's battery‚Äîthe timeline is determined by the device's performance in cold or warm ambient temperatures, if the user sees a decrease in the device's run time, or if the device reaches its maximum cycle charge count. Users who face the above-mentioned issues should have their battery replaced and head to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9004345" target="_blank">Pixel‚Äôs support page for available options</a>.</p>

<p>Google also mentions that on the off chance, of a swollen battery, that can cause liquids or dust to enter the device more easily as the battery is more susceptible to accidental damage. Users should follow the steps to factory rest their device, allow the phone to get discharged, and contact Google's customer service. Users shouldn't attempt to remove a swollen battery or repair the phone themselves, as this could be hazardous.</p><p>To check your phone‚Äôs cycle count on Pixel 8a and later:</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Settings > About phone > Battery information</strong>, which will give you an in-depth analysis of your daily usage and battery life. Users can also run battery diagnostics on their phones to check for any issues with their devices.</p>

<ul><li>Google was spotted preparing to rollout Gemini's "Ask about this PDF" overlay button to more Android users.</li><li>Like what was given to Gemini Advanced users, the feature lets users ask a question that pertains to a specific PDF document in the Files by Google app.</li><li>The feature is essentially a timesaver as users can let the AI quickly scour lengthy PDFs, as well as the option to ask follow-up questions.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>PDFs often contain a wealth of information, but Google is rolling out an AI update that makes them easy to handle.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/07/gemini-ask-about-pdf-rollout/#more-656441">9to5Google</a> spotted the AI model, Gemini, rolling out its "Ask about this PDF" button in beta version 16.0.5 of the Google app. The publication notes that this feature ‚Äî asking about a PDF ‚Äî is similar to uploading the document straight to Gemini. To start, users on Android viewing a PDF can surface the Gemini overlay and see a new interactable button to ask about the document.</p><p>When tapped, the name of the PDF in question will appear in the chatting area alongside the option to ask a specific question.</p><p>Since Google's Gemini is deeply involved, users can ask specific questions regarding the document, and the AI will discover and display it promptly. After your question is posed, Gemini will take a brief moment to process it. An "analysis complete" tab will appear, followed by the answer, and a citation for where the AI leveraged its answers ‚Äî which is the PDF you've asked about.</p><p>The publication notes that this feature with Gemini only pertains to the Files by Google app. Additionally, this beta version should wrap up fairly quickly as it's no different than what Advanced users received late last year. If anything, as 9to5 notes, this is indicative of a wider rollout for all Android users.</p>

<p>Before the holidays, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-ask-about-this-pdf-has-a-wider-rollout">a report by Mishaal Rahman</a> detailed the arrival of "Ask about PDF" for Gemini Advanced users running Android 15. The feature is identical to what Google has brought to its test server for the remainder of its Android users. The goal is to reduce the amount of time users spend reading or sifting through lengthy PDFs for information. Moreover, Gemini's overlay functionality mirrors an extension for the AI involving Drive.</p><p>When given permission, the main Gemini app will scour your Drive documents to find the answers to what you've requested. Similarly, both the "Ask about PDF" and the upload function let users ask follow-up questions to continue their document analysis. This AI update arrived soon after Google gave its Files app a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/files-by-google-has-a-new-pdf-viewer-and-its-ditching-google-drive">new PDF viewer</a>, too.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google is still working on its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">Ask Photos</a>" feature for the Photos app. Unlike the Gemini overlay, this feature will be integrated directly into the Photos app for direct conversations with the AI about your stored memories.</p>

<h2 id="your-oneplus-13-deserves-a-high-grade-screen-protector-4">Your OnePlus 13 deserves a high-grade screen protector</h2>
<p>The roster isn't as big when it comes to the best OnePlus 13 screen protectors, at least not yet. There aren't many noteworthy brands that have released accessories for the OnePlus 13 yet, but hopefully, we'll see new launches in the coming weeks. For now, you've got to play it smart when selecting a screen guard.</p><p>See, OnePlus opted for an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor this time around. Typical tempered glass screen protectors don't play nice with most ultrasonic fingerprint readers, so you're better off picking a flexible TPU, EPU, PET, or hydrogel film for your OnePlus 13.</p><p>Ringke has the best screen protector to offer for the OnePlus 13 right now. At nearly $17, the brand's two-pack is sort of expensive. However, the price is worth your while considering there aren't many high-quality alternatives out there. The Ringke Dual Easy Film Screen Protector for the OnePlus 13 is made of EPU or elastomeric polyurethane, so it's flexible and capable of self-healing from minor abrasions and nicks. Ringke added an oleophobic layer to each film, so liquids like oil and water roll right off the surface. This also repels little dust particles and fingerprints. To fortify the screen protectors, each film has a hard coating on top so you get impact and scratch-proofing.</p><p>Those of you who insist on having a tempered glass screen protector can try your luck with the zZjoOoj Oneplus 13 Screen Protector with Camera Lens Protector. It might interfere with the OnePlus 13's fingerprint reader though, so think it through before going through with your decision.</p><p>After picking out a decent screen protector, be sure to browse and select one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-oneplus-13-cases">best OnePlus 13 cases</a> for your device. Other parts of the phone can also be damaged by bumps, knocks, or falls, and a phone case thwarts such damage.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> made its global debut, and it is now available for $899 in the U.S. and ‚Çπ69,999 ($815) in India. It was always a given that the phone would get a price hike ‚Äî the Chinese model was costlier by $80 than the OnePlus 12, so it was obvious that the global model would also follow suit. <br><br>This is the second year where OnePlus increased the cost of its device by $100; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-review">OnePlus 11</a> debuted for $699, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> for $799 last year. Even in India ‚Äî where OnePlus continues to sell a majority of its phones ‚Äî the device is costlier by ‚Çπ5,000 ($58). With the hike comes the inevitable question: do you still buy the OnePlus 13, or pay more and get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> or the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra? That's what I'm here to answer.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>Even though the OnePlus 13 costs $100 more than last year, you get considerable upgrades; the phone has much better durability, a bigger battery, better cameras at the back, and the latest Qualcomm silicon. Out of all these changes, the one that I like the most is the design. OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/exclusive-onepluss-head-of-industrial-design-on-delivering-the-best-in-hand-feel-with-the-oneplus-13">overhauled its design</a> language this year, moving to an aesthetic with flatter sides. <br><br>While I'm not usually a fan of this design style, OnePlus added beveled edges to the sides to make holding and using the OnePlus 13 much more comfortable, and it has better in-hand feel than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>. The OnePlus 13 is somehow lighter than last year ‚Äî and other phones with 6,000mAh batteries ‚Äî and the weight distribution is about the best of any phone I used recently.</p><p>If you're eyeing the phone, I highly recommend getting the Midnight Ocean variant; the blue color looks fantastic, and the microfiber vegan leather back has a soft texture that's unlike any other leather-backed phone. OnePlus also switched to a Goodix ultrasonic fingerprint module this time, and thankfully, there are no issues with positioning ‚Äî it is high up on the panel, and I didn't have any problems with authentication or accessing the sensor.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WaYAGooi56AYfBWHTdLGYC" name="oneplus-13-blue-snapdragon-8-elite-01" alt="A blue OnePlus 13 with a Snapdragon 8 Elite placard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WaYAGooi56AYfBWHTdLGYC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the hardware. OnePlus always does a good job in this area, and the OnePlus 13 continues that heritage, delivering the latest hardware coupled with excellent optimization. The interface is noticeably faster than last year, and the fluidity is among the best of any phone today. <br><br>It's still annoying that 120fps gaming is limited to just three games, but in most titles I tested, the phone delivered steady framerates without any overheating issues. I didn't have any problems with the basics ‚Äî cellular connectivity was great, and it had a strong signal throughout. While I don't use eSIM yet, the phone doesn't miss out on the feature, and that's good to see. <br><br>Another big upgrade is around the battery tech, with the device getting a bigger 6,000mAh battery that lasts a day and a half. The battery uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon tech</a> and has 10% silicon in the anode to deliver better density, and an added bonus is the ability to use the phone in freezing weather without any detriment to battery life.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, OnePlus retained the dual-cell configuration even with a silicon battery, and it is the only manufacturer to do so ‚Äî OPPO and Vivo switched to a single-cell design this time around. The advantage with a dual-cell design is that you can easily charge both batteries at the same time, and as a result, the OnePlus 13 takes 38 minutes to fully charge via the 80W standard; by contrast, the X200 Pro takes 12 minutes longer.</p><p>Battery life isn't as good as the Find X8 Pro or Vivo X200 Pro, but I still got a day and a half between charges, with SOT hitting over ten hours (I'm addicted to Balatro). What's particularly interesting is the AirVOOC charging puck; this accessory lets you charge the phone at 50W, and it does a terrific job. The caveat is that the OnePlus 13 doesn't have magnets at the back, and you'll instead need to buy a case to use the charging puck.</p>

<p>OnePlus went with new camera modules this time, including a 50MP Sony LYT-808 main camera alongside a 50MP Sony LYT-600 telephoto with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and a 50MP wide-angle lens. The zoom lens uses similar tri prism tech as the Find X8 Pro, so you basically get a smaller module. <br><br>The camera quality is better than last year, and while I still give the edge to the Find X8 Pro and Vivo X200 Pro, the OnePlus 13 effortlessly holds its own against the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL, and that's a sizeable achievement in and of itself. It takes terrific portrait shots, detailed low-light photos, and much better videos.</p>

<p>I can't find much to fault with the software either. The interface is fluid and doesn't have any notable bugs out of the box, and there's a decent amount of AI-backed utilities if that's what you need in a phone. And with four years of updates, the phone will stay relevant a lot longer. <br><br>Even though the OnePlus 13 costs more than last year, you get more than enough upgrades to justify the increase, and it is now my go-to recommendation if you need a new phone in 2025. I like the X200 Pro better because of the cameras and color tuning, but it is costlier by the equivalent of $250, and not available in as many global regions as the OnePlus 13. <br><br>If you need an all-rounder that looks great, has the best hardware, lasts over a day, and takes fabulous photos, the OnePlus 13 is the phone to buy ‚Äî OnePlus finally delivered a flagship without any noteworthy flaws.</p>
