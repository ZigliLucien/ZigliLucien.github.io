<p>In what should come as a surprise to absolutely no one, Humane is reportedly looking to sell. The same can&apos;t yet be said for Rabbit, but no matter what, don&apos;t buy what these companies are telling you. I did, at least with the Rabbit R1, and it&apos;s looking more and more like I was finally bamboozled.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve been pretty skeptical about devices like the Humane AI Pin and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a>. After all, what&apos;s the point when my phone, or smartwatch, is capable of doing almost everything these devices aim to deliver? While I never thought twice about getting the AI Pin, I <em>did</em> buy the R1, mainly because the design looks cool. It also helps that the R1 is $199, without a monthly subscription, while Humane charges $699 and then you have to pay another $25 per month.</p><p>Although done in different ways, ultimately, both the AI Pin and R1 essentially aim to become their own AI-powered virtual assistant. With the former, there&apos;s a bunch of cool and unique tech built-in, as you can use your voice or via the "Laser Ink" display that appears in the palm of your hand. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">for the latter</a>, it&apos;s more like a phone in that you still have to take it out of your pocket and press the "push-to-talk" button before you can start to use it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JtN94fiqctZgVURWBaJqw4" name="humane-press-interactions.png" alt="AI pin projection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JtN94fiqctZgVURWBaJqw4.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Humane)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s definitely an argument to be made about how the AI Pin is the "better" option of the two. It lets you "enjoy the world around you," without cranking your neck down to look at your phone while trying to find the closest coffee shop.</p><p>But, I&apos;m not here to talk about how one is better than the other. I&apos;m here because I can&apos;t help but feel like I&apos;ve been scammed for the first time.</p>
<h2 id="what-happened-2">What happened</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NPOHf20slZg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPOHf20slZg">Coffeezilla video</a> above appeared on my YouTube home page, and I was both excited and terrified. Coffeezilla has a reputation for doing some of the best investigative work on YouTube, covering everything from largely focusing on different types of crypto scams and "get rich quick" schemes.</p><p>I never really got into the crypto game, outside of messing around with it in small quantities a few years ago. But, when seeing the thumbnail of the Rabbit R1, I knew it wasn&apos;t going to be good. And so far, it hasn&apos;t been.</p><p>It appears as though this isn&apos;t the first time that Rabbit CEO, Jesse Lyu, has been in some sort of spotlight. According to Coffeezilla, Rabbit was previously called "Cyber Manufacture," and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/Synergis_and_Collab_Currency_Lead_6M_in_a_Pre_Series_A_Round_for_Cyber_Manufacture_Co_the_Studio_Behind_Next_Generation_NFT_Project_GAMA/prweb18346003.htm" target="_blank">raised $6 million</a> in relation to its "next-generation NFT project GAMA."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rabbit went viral at the beginning of this year, raising $30m in venture capital and selling $20m in consumer products.But most people don't know that the company Rabbit Inc used to be called Cyber Manufacture Co, and raised $6 million for an NFT project. This project was WILD pic.twitter.com/1aQXTSVysu<a href="https://twitter.com/coffeebreak_YT/status/1792962211264245943">May 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Using our trusty friend, the Wayback Machine, I pulled up the old GAMA website. In a snapshot from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230410171154/https://gama.io/" target="_blank">April 2023</a>, the front page shows GAMA as being described as "building the principles of the future through its next generation metaverse, the GAMA Space Station." This included creating "GAMA Coin" which Lyu describes as being "basically Bitcoin 2.0." </p><p>Lyu goes on to say "So the general concept is, let&apos;s say if you own a GAMA NFT, that means you own the equal portion in valuation of your NFT&apos;s, at that moment of that clean energy grid that we started building in the real world. [...] And that also means that you own that portion of that power and that power will be used to generate GAMA Coins. That means you can earn your GAMA Coins out of this entire clean energy cycle."</p><p>Phew. </p><p>Since GAMA has vanished, what happened to those who bought NFT&apos;s, believing in GAMA&apos;s mission? At the time, Jesse Lyu is quoted as saying "And I better pay my money to collect your NFT back if you think this is just a NFT hype and dump project, I have to say that." </p><p>As it turns out, that last part never happened. In response to the Coffeezilla video, Rabbit provided the following:</p><p>"The "coin you refer to never materialized nor was it promised or delivered. The idea was brought up during some conversations with both major investors and community members. The team ultimately decided to not release any "coins." Jesse and the GAMA team have never released cryptocurrency or "coins in any form. The only ownership objects community members could own are blockchain-based digital art and unique gaming avatars."</p><p>In response to Coffeezilla&apos;s questions regarding the relationship between GAMA and Rabbit, a statement says "GAMA, in our opinion and as stated in the fact sheet, has no connection with rabbit."</p><p>You can go further down the <del>rabbit</del> GAMA hole, but it all just reads like the various crypto and NFT scams that promise the world, take your money, and disappear into the night. This is where my skepticism comes into play.</p><p>Android Central subsequently also reached out to the company about the investigation, and a spokesperson for Rabbit provided the following:</p><p><em>"The GAMA project concluded when it was open-sourced. Jesse strongly disputes Coffeezilla’s allegations that he and the GAMA team were not forthright about the open sourcing of the project, which had the support of investors, and his shift in focus to AI hardware. Jesse has a long history as an entrepreneur and has been involved in a range of projects over his career, including the GAMA NFT project. It’s a project he has talked about at length in the past, but it ended before he started rabbit. At the end of the day, many companies do pivot."</em></p>
<h2 id="overpromise-under-deliver-2">Overpromise, under-deliver</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1991px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cZfxNYTtf5aZVGwbJiu7aR" name="rabbit-r1-services-launch-video.png" alt="Teased services during Rabbit R1 launch video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZfxNYTtf5aZVGwbJiu7aR.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1991" height="1120" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Rabbit / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s very similar to what tech companies have done for years: promising things to its customers, taking their money for devices, and then either delaying or never shipping the promised features.</p><p>Funnily enough, it&apos;s exactly the same thing that Rabbit has done with the R1. When the R1 was introduced, it was promised to basically act as a "bridge" between you and the different services you rely on. During the launch video, you briefly see a glimpse of different services, including Amazon, eBay, Best Buy, Postmates, and more.</p><p>What&apos;s actually available now with the R1 pales in comparison. And in many cases, things just don&apos;t work. Sure, it&apos;s cool to be able to point the R1&apos;s camera at something and have it tell you what it is. You can even set up MidJourney, an AI image generator, as one of the services and then ask the R1 to create images with just your voice. Well, that is, if it actually works. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="n5ohzTSPgZ7LQfdqiKBrSD" name="rabbit-r1-midjourney-fail.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 Midjourney fail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n5ohzTSPgZ7LQfdqiKBrSD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here&apos;s the thing, though, that rectangle in your pocket can already do that. Plus, a few of the features shown off during the R1 launch video are still missing. The list of "planned" additions includes the likes of "point-of-interest research," "navigation," and "reservations."</p><p>Not to mention that when the R1 arrived, many early adopters couldn&apos;t even change their time zone. Even with built-in Wi-Fi, GPS, and cellular, the time zone remained the same. It wasn&apos;t until about a week later before a software update fixed that specific issue.</p><p>However, I have to give credit where credit is due. </p><p>Since its launch, the R1 has received five software updates "directly addressing customer feedback and launching new features." The most recent of which includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/rabbit_hmi/status/1793742658617393309">seven new features</a>, such as a new "list view," and the ability to "take pictures on r1 with a single click of the ptt button." There are also five fixes "thanks to rabbit community support," primarily focused on network and Bluetooth connectivity.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">https://t.co/u1e4euNjjJ<a href="https://twitter.com/rabbit_hmi/status/1793742658617393309">May 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>When speaking to Rabbit, a spokesperson informed me that there are about "10,000 or so" R1 owners in the wild. Of that number, R1 owners "have generated more than 600,000 interactions over the past thirty days." The spokesperson went on to tell me that it&apos;s "being used for more than 20,000 queries per day."</p><p>While the number of units might seem like peanuts compared to the number of phones that are being sold, it&apos;s not an insignificant amount. Let alone that the R1 resides in a new product category.  </p>
<p>Learning about the alleged origins of Rabbit as a company, paired with what we&apos;ve seen so far, didn&apos;t leave me feeling great about the future. But then, OpenAI kind of put both Humane and Rabbit on notice.</p>
<h2 id="there-apos-s-no-escaping-ai-2">There&apos;s no escaping AI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bfrvFTcdoqM8oi9GxXUidB" name="Google-IO-2024-ai-count.jpeg" alt="AI count of 121 at Google I/O" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bfrvFTcdoqM8oi9GxXUidB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everywhere we look, the phrase "AI" is being used, even if it&apos;s being done improperly. Hell, Google CEO Sundar Pichai even called it out at the end of the I/O 2024 Keynote. Of course, in some instances, it&apos;s just a buzzword that companies are using to try and score SEO points and jump on the hype train, or worse, entice investors.</p><p>However, companies like Google and OpenAI are taking a different approach to the AI-powered digital assistant. The day before I/O 2024 began, OpenAI held an event where it introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">GPT-4o</a>.</p><p>This is a new AI model basically does everything that the R1 and AI Pin promised. That includes using it to "answer questions about your surroundings, talk to you with audio, and respond to text." All from an app on your phone. OpenAI even managed to improve the response speed with GPT-4o, down to 232 milliseconds from the previous 320 milliseconds average response time.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Say hello to GPT-4o, our new flagship model which can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time: https://t.co/MYHZB79UqNText and image input rolling out today in API and ChatGPT with voice and video in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/uuthKZyzYx<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1790072174117613963">May 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The real kicker for Humane and Rabbit is that OpenAI wasted no time getting this into the hands of consumers. Its improved text and image capabilities were available for everyone in ChatGPT on the day GPT-4o was announced. Meanwhile, ChatGPT Plus members received access to Voice Mode "in alpha."</p><p>Then, Google followed up the next day with what felt like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">the longest I/O Keynote in history</a>. Upgrades were announced across the board, with Gemini gaining multimodality, making it possible to "provide reason for images and videos uploaded" to the model.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">all ai pins internally + a small number externally are now running gpt-4o! still early, but so far lots of great improvements:14% decrease in latency28% shorter answers33% fewer bad answersbeyond the numbers, everything just feels smarter and more accurate (as expected) pic.twitter.com/H3Y6MGsOc0<a href="https://twitter.com/GK3/status/1790171601398583524">May 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Google also gave everyone a tease by showing that those same multimodal capabilities would be coming to our phones. This will be possible via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Gemini Nano</a> model, which is currently available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>.</p><p>Both Gemini and ChatGPT have the added benefit of either "Extensions" or "GPTs," adding more functionality to these AI-powered assistants. And, any updates or changes that are implemented, are available as soon as these companies decide. Meanwhile, you&apos;ll have to wait for Humane or Rabbit to implement the changes, then likely wait for an update to arrive.</p><p>I asked Rabbit about what it envisioned for the future of the company and its little orange box. A Rabbit spokesperson provided the following:</p><p><em>“At rabbit, we stand behind our product, technology and vision to build a personalized operating system that can understand users’ intentions and intuitively help them get things done. We firmly believe that we are building something new in a frontier category and that it requires a different approach from the existing personal devices that are already in the market. AI-native products are quickly evolving and improving at exponential rates, and we are looking forward to what we can build in this new industry.”</em></p>

<p>Let&apos;s try and wrap everything up in a nice bow. Humane is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-ai-brand-humane-looking-to-sell-sources-say">looking to sell</a>, according to a report by Bloomberg. Ignoring the exorbitant asking price of something "between $750 million and $1 billion," it was always going to come to this.</p><p>Any piece of hardware that is built with the intention of making AI easier to access will be doomed. Well, that&apos;ll be the case for as long as we&apos;re able to use the Gemini or ChatGPT apps on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a>. They&apos;ll be updated faster, and the only "middle-man" we have to worry about is Apple with its App Store or Google with its Play Store.</p><p>While this is all alleged, I&apos;m incredibly disappointed in myself for falling into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-current-problem-with-tech-ai-devices-why-its-your-fault">rabbit trap</a>. I stepped right into it without looking at where I was going or what was going to happen on the other side. Now, I have a $200 prop that I&apos;ll use in pictures just because it looks so sleek, thanks to Teenage Engineering.</p><p>Unless someone at Rabbit reads this and turns it into a paperweight, I&apos;ll also keep trying out the R1 occasionally. Just to see if the company can prove me wrong. But, based on its history, I won&apos;t be holding my breath.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Realme’s front-runner for its latest 12 series is the 12 Pro+ 5G, and it’s easily the most interesting of the lot. While the company is most popularly known for its budget offerings, it does have a few mid-range models with unique features. The big highlight in this one, and why I was waiting to get my hands on it, is a periscope telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom and a maddening 120x of digital zoom. </p><p>This is a longer zoom range than even what Samsung offers on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. While the real-world usefulness of such a high zoom level is debatable, the fact that we have a phone around $400 that packs similar telephoto camera tech as phones above $1,000, is a feat in itself. </p><p>And if you think Realme has had to compromise in other areas in order to sell it at such a low price, you’d be wrong. The 12 Pro Plus 5G packs a flagship-grade main camera, a curved-edge 120Hz AMOLED display, IP65 rating, and a massive battery with very fast charging. So, is there a catch or could this be the best bargain in its segment? Time to find out. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FhUGTVVYXbQwsQXTufpHuh" name="Realme-12-Pro-Plus-5G_2.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Pro+ vegan leather back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FhUGTVVYXbQwsQXTufpHuh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Realme 12 Pro Plus 5G starts at ₹29,999 (around $360) in India, but it’s also available in other markets like Malaysia and Philippines. The base model comes with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. The higher storage variant with 256GB is priced at ₹31,999 ($383), while the top-variant comes with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage for ₹33,999 ($407). </p><p>Realme tends to have perpetual discounts for the upper tier variants if you buy it from its site, so it makes good sense to aim for either the top or second-top variant. It also has plenty of cashback and banking offers, and is even bundling the Realme Buds 2 Neo TWS earphones with any purchase. </p><p>This top model in the 12 series also has a more exciting choice of colors, compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/realme-12-plus-5g-review"><u>Realme 12 Plus 5G</u></a>. The Navigator Beige trim that I received looks classy, but I’d much rather have bolder shades like the Submarine Blue or Explorer Red (more like orange, going by the press photos). </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="z6VJeK2nBWUwwikkZ9omb3" name="Realme-12-Pro-Plus-5G_7.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Pro+ camera dial" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z6VJeK2nBWUwwikkZ9omb3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you liked the design language of the 12 Plus 5G, then you’ll certainly love 12 Pro Plus 5G too. In fact, this model feels a bit more premium thanks to a sturdier frame, and curved edges on the back and the display. The faux-leather finish feels great to hold, and it adds to the grip while keeping fingerprints at bay. The circular camera module embodies a luxury watch design, which is a running theme with the 12 series. The Pro model has an added decorative gold ring around the rear camera dial, for a bit of flair. </p><p>The phone feels slim to hold at 8.75mm, and has just the right heft so it doesn’t feel toy-like. The buttons are clicky, speaker grills are placed well so your hands don’t accidentally block them, and you get a dual-SIM slot. There’s no microSD support, so storage is not extendable. The 12 Pro Plus 5G gets a nifty IP65 rating for dust and water resistance. </p>

<p>The other great thing about the Realme 12 Pro Plus 5G is the display. It’s a large 6.7-inch AMOLED panel with a Full HD+ resolution. It produces rich colors and can get very bright. Viewing content even under direct hard sunlight was not an issue. You get an in-display fingerprint sensor too which is quick, but the face unlock is the quickest way to get to your apps. </p><p>The curved edges on either side of the display gives you the feeling of using a much more expensive phone. The display also gets a 120Hz refresh rate, which scales to 90Hz or 60Hz based on the app or your interaction with the screen. </p>

<p>The Realme 12 Pro Plus 5G is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, which is peppy and does a good job of handling all your typical social and productivity apps. Multitasking was a breeze on the 12GB model that I tested, and I feel it should be a similar experience on the lower variants too. HDR videos looked good on this display and the stereo speakers provided an engaging experience. </p><p>Battery life is especially good thanks to the 5,000mAh capacity, which easily lasts for about a day and half on medium to heavy workloads. There’s no wireless charging, but wired charging is a quick 67W with the bundled adapter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Lvkwv52KB96QCvbwRFjCKL" name="Realme-12-Pro-Plus-5G_3.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Pro+ display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lvkwv52KB96QCvbwRFjCKL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the main reasons you should consider this phone is for the cameras. The 12 Pro Plus features the 50MP Sony IMX890 sensor for the main camera, which is also found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, while the telephoto is the OmniVision OV64B 64MP sensor as seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>. Both sensors are optically stabilized and offer superb clarity, colors, and details in both daylight and night time shots.</p><p>The primary camera’s wide f/1.8 aperture ensures a creamy bokeh effect in close-up photos, while in low light, the app automatically takes a long-exposure shot. The telephoto or Portrait camera as Realme calls it, is equally impressive. It has a 3x optical zoom, which has good stabilization when you’re framing. Image quality is quite impressive even at 10x magnification. However, there are diminishing returns as you go beyond 20x zoom. At the maximum 120x level, large text on distant objects is just about recognizable but it’s clear that the camera is well beyond its comfort zone.</p>

<p>Video recording maxes out at 4K30 on the Realme 12 Pro Plus. Image quality is quite good during the day and you have the ability to switch between the ultra-wide, primary, and telephoto cameras when recording at 1080p. The primary and tele can shoot at 4K, but you have to choose which sensor you want before you hit record. </p><p>The 32MP selfie camera is equally impressive, capturing sharp and detailed images in daylight and indoor lighting. The post-processing works well in cleaning up noise, and the default skin smoothing filter isn’t too aggressive and produces pleasing portraits. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9V2GvAZdYFMS2ugiwEf37b" name="Realme-12-Pro-Plus-5G_4.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Pro+ ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9V2GvAZdYFMS2ugiwEf37b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Realme 12 Pro Plus 5G doesn’t have a macro camera or even a macro shooting mode, which some might miss. Realme could have completed the trifecta by using a more substantial ultrawide camera with autofocus. This would have helped in getting sharper photos as well as enabled macro photography. This is the only rear camera that can’t record at 4K resolution, which I feel was a missed opportunity.</p><p>The other area which could have used a better upgrade is the SoC itself. Don’t get me wrong, it works just fine in day-to-day use but it’s not as powerful as some of the others in this segment. Going by benchmark numbers, it put out nearly the same scores or just slightly better numbers than the MediaTek Dimensity 7050 SoC, which sits in Realme’s much cheaper 12 Plus 5G. We  also could have gotten better features like 4K at 60fps video recording on the 12 Pro Plus 5G, had Realme used a more potent processor. </p>
<p>The last complaint with this phone has been a recurring one on most Realme phones, and that’s the software. Realme UI 5.0 is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and my unit received multiple updates for Android security patches and bug fixes, which is good to see. But there’s no getting around how unnecessary bloated it feels, with tons of needless apps and many first-party ones that bombard you with unsolicited notifications. You can work around this by being careful during setup and not giving permission to certain apps, but it’s still a hassle which we shouldn’t have to deal with. </p>

<p>The Realme 12 Pro Plus’s biggest competitor is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus</a>. It sits in a similar price range, and boasts of better water resistance, a higher-resolution AMOLED display, and quicker charging. Between the two, I’d still put my money on the 12 Pro Plus 5G simply because of the better auxiliary cameras and due to the fact that it comes with Android 14 out of the box. </p><p>The Vivo V30 is another phone that competes in this segment, featuring an equally eye-catching design as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v30-pro-review">more expensive sibling</a>, good quality rear cameras, 80W charging, and a more powerful SoC. It does miss out on a telephoto camera though, which is the big highlight of the Realme 12 Pro Plus. </p><p>For those in the U.S., it&apos;s still hard to beat the Pixel 7a at its current price. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> is very new, and will eventually replace the 7a as our go-to recommendation once it gets a decent deal. </p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a versatile telephoto camera with good zoom range </li><li>You want a stylish mid-range phone  </li><li>You want long-lasting battery life </li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li> You want clutter-free user interface </li><li> You want strong gaming performance </li><li> You need wireless charging  </li></ul>
<p>Realme continues to deliver great value even with its mid-range offerings, and the 12 Pro Plus 5G is a good example. For what it costs, the phone truly excels in the camera department thanks to a strong primary sensor, versatile telephoto camera, and a solid selfie camera. Realme doesn&apos;t stop there though, as it delivers an equally premium usage experience thanks to a faux-leather back panel and the luxury-watch inspired rear modules. Performance is also decent, the phone is water and dustproof, and the battery easily lasts more than a day. The vivid curved-edge AMOLED display is excellent for binge-watching on the move.</p><p>The typical software hurdles continue to haunt Realme phones, as the interface is too cluttered and bloated with needless apps. The ultrawide camera is also nothing special, when compared to how good the other cameras are. Lastly, there&apos;s the processor itself, which would have been perfectly decent on a phone at around $300, but not at this price. If the 12 Pro Plus 5G isn&apos;t available where you live, here&apos;s a list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">great alternatives</a> that should work just as well. </p>

<ul><li>Meta is bringing Calm, Amazon Music and integrating Instagram stories with a new update to their Ray-Ban smart glasses.</li><li>These apps will be powered by Meta's Llama 3 AI model, giving users a hands-free experience without needing to reach for their phones.</li><li>The new update will be "rolling out gradually," according to the company.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta announced on Monday, May 2, it is adding a host of new apps to the AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, keeping mindfulness, music, and social media at the center of this update. </p><p>Just a month ago, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses gained new "powers" with Multimodal AI thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Meta&apos;s Llama 3</a> model, allowing users across the U.S. and Canada to use vocal commands, share views on a video call, and have hands-free control over Apple Music. Now, it has added Calm, Amazon Music, and Instagram stories to the mix of the already existing apps.</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/ray-ban-smart-glasses-amazon-music-calm-instagram-new-styles/">press release states</a> that Meta has partnered with Calm to provide its users with hands-free guided meditation, mindfulness exercises, and self-care content. This feature can be particularly useful for people who have to quickly access the calm app on the go, get a moment to themselves, or deal with a stressful situation.  Users need to download the app and say, “hey, Meta, play the Daily Calm.” Follow the on-screen prompts in the Meta View app to get started. </p><p>Along with Apple Music, Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be integrated with Amazon Music. When users say, “Hey Meta, play Amazon Music,”  the glasses will start playing a recommended playlist. Users can then control audio playback with touch or voice commands, all hands-free while their phones stay in their pockets.</p><p>Finally, could there be an update from Meta that doesn&apos;t involve their social media platforms? Now, users can post Instagram stories just with a voice command without pulling out the phone. After users snap a photo/ record a video, say, “Hey Meta, share my last photo on Instagram.”  It also allows you to click and post a new picture on the go by saying, "Hey Meta, post a photo to Instagram," which instantly will open up camera mode and click a picture of what the user is looking at. </p><p>Meta says that these updates to the glasses will be "rolling out gradually" to its users. However, it remains unclear which countries these updates will be available in.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new rumor claims that Samsung is planning a big makeover for the next Galaxy Buds, adding a stem to make them look more like Apple&apos;s AirPods.</p><p>South Korean news outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2024/05/23/DW7O5M2M3NEFRPX4YTSH2SED3M/" target="_blank">The Chosun Daily</a> reports (and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-buds-3-rumored-design-change-audio-improvement/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> echoes) that the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-development-rumor">Galaxy Buds 3</a>—both the standard and Pro versions—will ditch the current bean-like design for something more akin to "bean sprouts." If this rumor holds true, this would mark the first major redesign of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-earbuds">Samsung&apos;s earbuds</a> since they debuted in 2019.</p><p>The design tweak has a purpose: the longer stem is meant to bring the microphones closer to the user&apos;s mouth, aiming to boost the call quality.</p><p>Samsung has stuck with the same design for its Galaxy Buds line from the start, and it&apos;s often knocked for mediocre call quality because the mic doesn&apos;t directly target the sound source. Adding an AirPods-style stem could be Samsung&apos;s solution to amp up the audio clarity.</p><p>Another potential benefit of the rumored design is a better fit. The current Galaxy Buds can feel a bit bulky for some users, and the slimmer profile with a stem might address those concerns.</p><p>The rumored design could also free up more space inside the earbuds. This extra room might be used to fit a bigger battery for longer battery life per charge or to include extra tech needed for AI features.</p><p>Samsung has already packed some impressive AI capabilities into their earbuds, like live language translation on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review">Galaxy Buds 2</a>, and Galaxy Buds FE. It looks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/samsung-upcoming-galaxy-buds-with-on-device-ai">there&apos;s even more advanced functionality in the pipeline</a>.</p><p>According to the report (machine-translated), we can also anticipate a significant upgrade in the active noise cancellation (ANC) capabilities of the next Galaxy Buds.</p><p>The Chosun Daily says Samsung is set to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-3-pro-case-spotted-rumors">reveal the Galaxy Buds 3 series at the upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event</a> on July 10 in Paris. Along with the new earbuds, we&apos;re also likely to see the latest in foldables and wearables.</p>

<ul><li>iFixit announced that it is ending its repair partnership with Samsung, effective in June 2024.</li><li>The company states that Galaxy devices are too "glued together," making it hard for iFixit to provide the necessary parts consumers need without driving up costs.</li><li>iFixit will continue to deliver Galaxy parts when it can, however, it will no longer create new guides on how to repair Galaxy devices moving forward.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Today (May 23), iFixit announced that it will end ties with Samsung in June as the two companies&apos; goals regarding device repairability "do not align."</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/96162/were-ending-our-samsung-collaboration">iFixit</a>, the company is ending its partnership with Samsung through its Repair Hub, which started in 2022. Starting next month, iFixit will no longer be a certified third-party partner for parts and tools to repair Samsung devices. The post states, "despite our best efforts" to deliver a high standard for self-repair, "we have not been able to deliver on that promise."</p><p>iFixit adds that it has continuously tried to get the necessary parts to local shops within reasonable price ranges while "the design of Samsung’s Galaxy devices remained frustratingly glued together."</p><p>The company states this forced it to "pre-glue" batteries and screens in bundles, which drove up the cost for the consumer.</p><p>Just because iFixit is dropping Samsung, the company isn&apos;t giving it the cold shoulder entirely. The self-repair service will continue to sell Galaxy device parts when it can, but its in-house guides will no longer exist. Pre-existing information on repairing Samsung&apos;s devices will not be removed, meaning users can still return for help on past devices.</p><p>iFixit is remaining focused on the future, stating it&apos;s preparing to launch more parts for devices in more countries this year. The company is also moving to partner with third-party point-of-sales services so consumers can grab spare parts easier for repair.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Samsung regarding iFixit&apos;s canceled partnership but did not hear back in time for publication. We will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<p>While not through iFixit, our very own Andrew Myrick had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-im-skipping-galaxy-z-fold-5">a horrible experience</a> attempting to get a Galaxy Z Fold 4 repaired through Samsung Care and uBreakiFix. Of course, foldable phones have a lot more going than your typical slab phone, but the process of attempting to gain a repair broke it all. The issue (which was a non-functioning display) was worsened by the choice of purchasing a Graygreen Fold 4.</p><p>Samsung had parts for that particular color of choice on backorder. The company had replacement parts for a Black or Beige Fold 4 in stock, however, if you had Graygreen, consumers were required to pay out of pocket to get parts — even through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-care-plus-vs-applecare-plus">Care Insurance</a> program.</p><p>As iFixit cuts ties with Samsung over its apparent misaligned goals for repairability, the company is considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-publicly-endorses-oregon-right-to-repair-bill">Right to Repair bill</a>. This is a law that Google backs, with hopes that more OEMs will move to create devices that consumers can easily repair at home without much stress. Additionally, manufacturers hope to provide complete repair kits instead of just separate parts.</p>

<ul><li>A supposed "reliable" list of Samsung products has leaked as the tipster states they could launch within the "near future."</li><li>Among the devices are the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro, the Galaxy Ring, the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra, and the recently rumored Watch 7 FE.</li><li>The Watch 7 FE was recently spotted going through the FCC while the Galaxy Ring had its potential price and subscription information leaked.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A "reliable list" has reportedly leaked, detailing what consumers could expect from Samsung soon and later this summer.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1792657340929605751">Evan Blass on X</a>, the Korean OEM is preparing to pack these hot months with eight new product launches (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-summer-unpacked-hardware-lineup-leaked/">Android Police</a>). The list mentions items like the Galaxy Buds 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-3-pro-case-spotted-rumors">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, Samsung&apos;s next wave of TWS (true wireless earbuds) for 2024. Next, the list slides into other devices we&apos;ve been keeping our eyes on, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>.</p><p>Then, three upcoming Samsung smartwatches are listed: the Galaxy Watch 7, Watch 7 Ultra, and the Watch 7 FE.</p><p>We have roughly two months until Samsung is expected to debut many of these new Galaxy devices. Considering the range of products this list covers, the company&apos;s summer Unpacked could be quite stacked this year.</p><p>Blass briefly mentioned the Galaxy Book 4 Edge and the Book 4 Edge Pro; however, those laptops have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-book4-edge-next-gen-ai-pc-expands-galaxy-ai-ecosystem/">already launched</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">According to a reliable list, these are the only notable SS products on deck in the near future:Galaxy Book4 EdgeGalaxy Book4 Edge ProGalaxy Buds3Galaxy Buds3 ProGalaxy RingGalaxy Watch FEGalaxy Watch7Galaxy Watch7 UltraQ6/B6 https://t.co/5O3p2DNuu0<a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1792657340929605751">May 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Samsung has no shortage of heavy-hitting devices, especially with its highly anticipated Galaxy Ring. Most recently, the device had its supposed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-us-price-subscription-rumors">price leaked</a>, which pits it in a $300 to $350 range, similar to the Oura Ring 3. That same rumor came with speculation that Samsung could kickstart a subscription service for its Health app, which might be "under $10."</p><p>The Galaxy Ring is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-model-number-sizes-leak">also rumored</a> to arrive in several American ring sizes, ranging from 5 to 13.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rumored-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-has-one-path-to-success">Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra</a> was rumored earlier in May, pushing us to expect a larger display and a better battery life. The device will supposedly arrive with a 578mAh battery, but more specifics are still unknown. Additionally, a cheaper Galaxy Watch 7 FE was reportedly discovered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fcc-listings-foreshadow-galaxy-watch-7-series-and-budget-galaxy-watch-fe">passing through the FCC</a>.</p><p>Aside from these devices, there are the foldables, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6, which we&apos;re expecting this summer. Samsung typically waits for its second Unpacked to reveal such devices, so those will likely be the headliners. The company is expected to host its event on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini's YouTube Music extension is rolling out now for desktop and Android, with an array of prompts users can give the AI.</li><li>Users must make sure their YouTube Music and Gemini accounts are the same and hop into their extension settings to enable it.</li><li>Prompts include asking Gemini to find a specific music genre radio, songs by artist, playlists, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A couple of weeks after Gemini&apos;s YouTube Music extension was discovered, Google is officially rolling it out for English-only prompts.</p><p>Arriving as a Gemini extension, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13695044#zippy=%2Cexamples%2Cabout-your-youtube-music-watch-history">Google explains</a> that users can connect YouTube Music to the AI bot on the web with their account (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/23/youtube-music-gemini-extension/">9to5Google</a>). However, the company states this account must be the same for Gemini and YouTube Music. Functionality includes asking Gemini to "show, find, or play" songs, albums, artists, your custom playlists, and more.</p><p>It seems that the YouTube Music extension is disabled by default. On your PC or the Gemini app, hop into your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/extensions">extensions settings</a> and quickly toggle the extension on to get going.</p><p>Users can give Gemini a few prompts with the extension such as "play me rock music radio," "play music that I like," and more. Google then provided a few prompt formats that users can use interchangeably with different music genres.</p>
<ul><li>Find [song name] by [artist name]</li><li>Find the album [album title] by [artist name]</li><li>Find [playlist name] playlist</li><li>Find [genre] music</li><li>Search for songs similar to [song name] by [artist name]</li></ul>

<p>Gemini can "play" a specific song when asked, however, it doesn&apos;t appear to be working on computers. Gemini returns with a "I can&apos;t assist you with playing media yet, but I can provide you with a link to the song on YouTube Music" response. The publication was able to play music through Gemini on the Android app, which produces the YouTube Music app.</p><p>Moreover, users must accept a few permissions before the extension can work. Google informs that Gemini needs access to your playback history, playlists, and preferences. The company adds via its support page that your watch history is stored "based on your settings" when using the new extension.</p><p>A lot was going on with Google and its adventures with AI during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">I/O 2024</a> keynote. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">highlighted several improvements</a> for Gemini, such as its faster 1.5 Flash model. This variant is said to handle "high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale" while being faster and lighter than the Pro model.</p><p>Gemini Nano for Android devices is getting a boost, courtesy of Multimodality. The company stated this will help the AI "understand the world the way people do." There&apos;s also a brand new wave of image and video generation technology entering the scene, thanks to Veo and Imagen 3.</p>

<ul><li>A new report claims Samsung could charge a required subscription fee for its upcoming Galaxy Ring.</li><li>The proposed subscription would be in addition to a high upfront cost for the wearable, as it is rumored to cost between $300 and $350. </li><li>The combination of high MSRPs and required subscriptions is a trend in tech that needs to be stopped. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has been teasing its Galaxy Ring for some time now, but we&apos;re starting to learn more about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-us-price-subscription-rumors">the upcoming wearable&apos;s pricing model</a>. According to leaker Yogesh Brar and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-ring-subscription-price-leak-3445434/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> , the Galaxy Ring could come with both a high initial cost and a perpetual subscription fee. Brar doesn&apos;t offer any concrete details, but says the possible subscription would cost "under $10" for U.S. users.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung Galaxy Ring as of now is priced at Rs 35k in India.US price in the $300-350 rangePretty expensive piece of tech..<a href="https://twitter.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1793155170093969897">May 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>It seems unlikely that Samsung would require a subscription for use of the Galaxy Ring, because there&apos;s no precedent of the company doing so in the past. However, if Samsung did tie a monthly subscription to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">wearable</a>, it would continue a dangerous trend. </p><p>Companies want a slice of the cake and eat it, too; they’re trying to charge high upfront costs to buy hardware while requiring users to pay perpetual fees on top of that.<br></p><p>Eventually, we, as consumers, need to say that enough is enough. Using a subscription-model is fine, using an ad-supported model is alright too, and charging a high upfront cost is another option. Any combination of those three models, however, is downright unacceptable. </p>
<h2 id="subscriptions-are-okay-and-whoop-proves-it-2">Subscriptions are okay, and Whoop proves it</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kaFKUS592UQxjQmXdXkjDP" name="whoop-4-battery.png" alt="Whoop 4.0 battery charger on wrist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kaFKUS592UQxjQmXdXkjDP.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Courtney Lynch / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s easy to hate subscriptions, especially as more and more products and services we use daily move to a subscription model. They really aren&apos;t that bad on their own, though, especially if users know what they&apos;re getting into before they sign up. A great example of a good subscription offering comes from Whoop, the health and fitness company that makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whoop-40-review">Whoop 4.0 band</a>. </p><p>Unlike what Samsung could be considering for the Galaxy Ring, Whoop doesn&apos;t make you pay anything for the Whoop 4.0 band. The entire experience is centered around a subscription. As long as you&apos;re subscribed, you&apos;ll be able to use a Whoop 4.0 band for free. It&apos;s an entirely different situation than it would be if Whoop made you pay for the band <em>and</em> the service. </p><p>The other thing Whoop has going for it is a competitive pricing model and a unique feature set. The company is in the business of advanced fitness and health insights, especially those related to recovery. Using artificial intelligence, Whoop has managed to provide personalized insights and continues to add features over time. A subscription costs $30 per month, $239 for the year, and and $399 for two years. Considering an Apple Watch Series 9 costs $399 flat, the Whoop subscription isn&apos;t that bad of a value, and the band is included. </p>
<h2 id="optional-subscriptions-are-fine-too-2">Optional subscriptions are fine, too</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hk5spapGvpEr5EKwEmJwW5" name="Fitbit-Charge-6-display.jpeg" alt="A close-up of the Fitbit Charge 6 display showing the time and heart rate data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hk5spapGvpEr5EKwEmJwW5.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Alternatively, having an optional subscription that unlocks advanced features is tolerable as well. Fitbit does this with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-premium-worth-annual-subscription">Fitbit Premium</a> subscription. Just by buying a Fitbit wearable, you&apos;ll get access to all the essential features it is marketed as having. Things like heart rate, basic health metrics, blood glucose monitoring, skin temperature scores, and more are all included with your Fitbit device. The Fitbit Premium subscription adds advanced features like guided workouts, more comprehensive data, and wellness reports.</p><p>The key here is that the subscription isn&apos;t necessary to use a Fitbit wearable, and you can get tons of value out of a Fitbit tracker without spending a dime on subscriptions. It&apos;s fine for companies to give users a way to gain access to advanced features through an optional subscription plan. However, when a subscription is tied to a product&apos;s core functionality, and that product comes with a high standalone MSRP, it becomes unacceptable. </p>
<h2 id="high-upfront-costs-and-required-subscriptions-are-never-okay-2">High upfront costs and required subscriptions are never okay</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qg7zgqqYynueYAgqoPHbsb" name="humane-ai-pin-lifestyle-camo.jpg" alt="Humane AI Pin lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qg7zgqqYynueYAgqoPHbsb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Humane)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If the Galaxy Ring comes with a retail price of around $300 and a required monthly subscription, it would continue a dangerous trend that the Humane AI Pin brought into the forefront earlier this year. To use the AI Pin, you need to pay a whopping $699 just to buy the hardware and a $24 per month subscription every month thereafter. The second you stop paying for the AI Pin&apos;s subscription, the $699 device becomes a paperweight. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MBUFKrUfBvXCDw7oCAbjcL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-MWC-silver-close.jpg" alt="Eyes on with the Samsung Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBUFKrUfBvXCDw7oCAbjcL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung can do one of three things with regard to the Galaxy Ring&apos;s pricing model. It can charge an upfront cost to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> with all features included, it can offer an optional subscription on top of the upfront cost, or it can use a subscription model entirely. However, the rumored plan to charge as much as $350 for a Galaxy Ring that you can&apos;t even use without a monthly subscription is outrageous. If Samsung goes that route, no one should buy it. </p>

We had already found a treasure trove of weaponry and some sweet new armor in this dungeon, but there was one chest left that we’d been waiting to find the key for. Too bad the chest had other intentions when we opened it. I’ve seldom screamed like that in my adult life!</p>

<p>Turns out, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/dungeons-and-dragons-meta-quest-vr-games">Dungeons of Eternity</a>’s latest update added Mimics, a fantasy creature that disguises itself as a valuables-filled chest and hides itself in the deepest dungeons you might try to raid. Once opened, the Mimic’s fanged visage is fully revealed, very killing the person who attempted to loot its coffers.</p><p>Finding this chest alone would have been cool enough, but there’s something special about quality father-son bonding time that made it significantly better. I cheered my son on as I dodged fireballs that emitted from the chest, and as we both went in for the killing blow, the high fives that erupted from the room were the kind some only reserve for the stands at a stadium.</p><p>It&apos;s these moments and countless others have helped shape the bond between my son and I, and I&apos;d love to encourage other parents to do the same. Even if it&apos;s playing a game that you normally wouldn&apos;t like, doing things together — especially if that&apos;s playing immersive VR games — creates lasting memories and a childlike sense of joy that&apos;s akin to when he was even younger and we would play with action figures or LEGO on the floor together.</p>

<p>There’s something special about gaming with your kids that helps bridge the traditional generational gap in interests and understanding. Gaming breaks down borders, but it can also be an unhealthy way to add more couch time to your life. That’s where VR comes in.</p><p>Most VR games are inherently more active than traditional games on a flat display because they force you to move around more, even if that just means moving your head or your arms. It’s better for your body and mind because you’re not spending another Friday night just sitting on the couch.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Traditional games can encourage unhealthy habits, but VR games encourage movement and physicality in a new and different way.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But VR gaming is also about more than just getting up and moving around a bit. It’s a way to create lasting memories in a way that’s unique to our brains’ ability to capture spatial information.</p><p>While traditional flat-screen gaming can elicit emotions and create memorable moments, our brains were built to experience things with more than just our eyes and ears. They were built to explore with our hands, to walk with our legs (or roll in a wheelchair), and sense the ethereal quality of being there with our presence.</p><p>When my son asks me if we can play Dungeons of Eternity, he speaks about it the same way he might speak about playing with his friends outside or exploring the woods. That’s because he’s going on a <strong>real </strong>adventure with his dad, slaying actual skeletons and undead wizards with the weapons his hands hold and his eyes behold, exploring new places we’ve never been (and can never go back to), and, of course, finding gobs of treasure as a reward.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CAqDtbaFHbgDnXZAVZx4UA" name="dungeons-of-eternity-screenshot-torch-in-the-dark.jpg" alt="A Screenshot of lighting the way with a torch in a dark hallway in Dungeons of Eternity running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CAqDtbaFHbgDnXZAVZx4UA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>We love our outdoor time and get plenty of it, but VR gives us the ability to go on a real adventure in a way that the fully-explored real world sometimes can't.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It’s fun because we can experience a romanticized version of life together. It’s impossible to actually set out on “a medieval quest” — the one created by fantasy books and movies, not the plague-filled serfdom — because, quite frankly, nearly everything has already been discovered or done in some way, usually then recorded and rebroadcast over YouTube to be experienced in some cheap second-hand way.</p><p>So instead of just watching or reading about someone else doing these things, we’re able to actually <em>do</em> them and create lasting memories from the experiences. It’s the difference between simply observing someone do something cool and <strong>actually</strong> doing something cool yourselves.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="taaufbcUsvFHsHsgiiwU9A" name="dungeons-of-eternity-screenshot-acid-pits.jpg" alt="A Screenshot of jumping across acid pits in Dungeons of Eternity running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/taaufbcUsvFHsHsgiiwU9A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My son and I have been gaming together since he was four or five — it’s hard to remember exactly when he started joining in for more than a few seconds — and we’ve poured our fair share of hours into plenty of games across a wide variety of systems. Whether it’s playing Minecraft cross-platform on different devices, leveling up on the living room TV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/why-minecraft-dungeons-going-be-amazing-parents-and-kids">with Minecraft Dungeons</a>, or taking turns passing the controller in Breath of the Wild, we’ve made memories neither of us will ever forget.</p><p>And while I cherish all those times together, there’s something truly special about being able to play the same game together inside if the virtual world together. It’s a substantially more personal experience because you can see and understand the body language of the other person.</p>

<p>When we play in VR, it’s not sitting next to each other on a couch. Games like Dungeons of Eternity make it feel like he’s 4 again and I’m sitting on the floor with him while we play with stuffed animals and action figures, making a story while we make memories. It also feels like a way to preserve childhood because age barriers are irrelevant in a game.</p><p>Of course, I love time outdoors with him and we spend a lot of it there. There’s a reason I live in a mountainous area where we can still naturally explore. But there’s something satisfying about being able to still feel like we got a physical adventure even if we didn’t go outside for it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kw6CRcYWdPQdLx2g8zFheA" name="dungeons-of-eternity-screenshot-treasure-chest.jpg" alt="A Screenshot of opening a treasure chest in Dungeons of Eternity running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kw6CRcYWdPQdLx2g8zFheA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you haven’t played VR with your kids yet, I wholly encourage you to try it! If you’ve only got one VR headset in the house, check out the best Meta Quest 2 deals and pick up an extra one for under $200. You’ll eventually have to upgrade it to keep playing the latest games, but the most popular VR headset of all time will still be around for a few years, yet.</p><p>Think of it as an early start to Summer vacation so you can take completely different adventures all throughout the week.</p><p>Or if that’s too much for you, just play what you have around the house. Whether it’s crafting and mining on two phones or taking turns passing the controller back and forth, I encourage you to do more gaming with your kids. It’s ridiculously fun, helps build relationships, and creates lasting, active memories. Plus, there’s something for every interest, so it’s not hard to find games that at least two people can love together.</p>

<p>If you were considering getting both smart glasses and a VR headset, now's your chance! Verizon is selling the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> and the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> in a bundle for $200 cheaper than what they would cost separately. Gamers will especially appreciate the huge stockpile of Quest games available for the platform, and it's a major upgrade from the last-gen Quest 2. The Ray-Ban smart glasses are easy to use, and this particular bundle comes with the Wayfarer green lenses.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/products/buy-meta-quest-3-plus-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wayfarer-green-lenses-and-save-200/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="43fb3cff-d90f-4492-8e26-801ebe048326" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest 3 and Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses: $798.99" data-dimension48="Meta Quest 3 and Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses: $798.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headset</a> available, offering a wide variety of both virtual reality and mixed reality applications. It&apos;s especially great for gamers, boasting super high-powered graphics for some of the most immersive VR gaming the modern industry has to offer.</p><p>As for Ray-Ban&apos;s latest generation of smart glasses, they offer a powerful set of speakers and microphones, a high-quality camera, and easy-to-use Meta AI features. For the most part, they look like regular glasses, apart from the built-in LEDs at in the corners of the frames.</p><p>What else can be said? If you were already planning to up your mixed-reality game with both of these innovative products, it&apos;s hard to argue with this price. Then again, it may not be worthwhile for you if you don&apos;t think you&apos;ll use the smart glasses, or vice versa. </p>
