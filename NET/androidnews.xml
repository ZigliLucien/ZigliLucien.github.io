<hr>
<p>Snapchat is highlighting a few new tools that are arriving for its community that might provide a little more peace of mind.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://values.snap.com/news/new-features-to-help-protect-our-community?lang=en-US">Policy Hub post</a>, Snapchat announced an expansion of safeguard measures to better protect its users from "suspicious" users. Moving forward, teen users should notice an improved version of those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://values.snap.com/news/new-safeguards-for-snapchatters-2023?lang=en-US">in-app warnings</a>. Snapchat states such users will be warned about a user with an unsavory past, i.e; they&apos;ve been blocked or reported several times before.</p><p>Additionally, the new in-app warnings will factor in whether or not the person privately messaging a user is from another country. The post adds that such a signal could be indicative of a scam, thus provoking the warning.</p><p>Snapchat details "enhanced friending protections," designed to go hand-in-hand with the upgraded in-app warnings. These new protections should make it more difficult for strangers to use Search and discover teen users through Quick Add. The app is said to block the delivery of a friend request from a user a teen account doesn&apos;t have a mutual friend with.</p>

<p>The block button gains a buff, with the company stating that blocking a user will now "block new friend requests sent from other accounts created on the same device." The intention is to help get a handle on early signs of cyberbullying and other forms of harassment.</p><p>Lastly, Snapchat states it&apos;s increasing the frequency of its location-sharing reminders. This will be joined by the introduction of "simplified location-sharing" through the Snap Map. The feature will provide simpler customization controls to help users quickly enable which friends can view their current location.</p><p>Users will find options to select which friends are excluded from seeing their location or handpicking a specific list of users. Additionally, users can have their location open to everyone they&apos;ve befriended.</p><p>These security and safety updates should begin rolling out in the days ahead.</p><p>Similarly, Meta introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-stricter-messaging-settings-instgram-facebook">an array of protections</a> for supervised teen accounts on Instagram and Facebook earlier this year. Not only must teens submit a request for a settings change, but "Stricter Messaging" rolled in to protect those aged 16 (or 18) from texts from unknown users.</p><p>In other news, Snapchat <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/snapchat-edit-button-teaser-feature-highlights">highlighted a few new features</a> for its platform, such as My AI reminders, avatar reactions in Snap Map, and Bitmoji customization options. The kicker in that previous update was confirmation of an edit button for messages. Snapchat calls them "editable chats," giving users five minutes to return to a text to correct mistakes.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/snapchat-plus-launch">Snapchat Plus</a> subscribers will get their hands on this before it flows down to everyone else.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is rolling out a new update for its Chrome app on Android and iOS, bringing with it five new features.</li><li>The update includes new Chrome Actions, making it easier to interact with search results as you type.</li><li>There's also a "refreshed" address bar for Chrome on tablets, as it will now show the current website in the drop-down menu.</li></ul>
<p>Things have been pretty quiet on the Chrome front lately, but as version 126 starts rolling out, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/chrome-mobile-features-june-2024/">Google has included</a> five new features. Although none of these features are "ground-breaking," there are a couple of exciting ones.</p><p>Although it&apos;s not the first highlight on Google&apos;s list, the Chrome address bar has been redesigned for the iPad and Android tablets. Along with being tweaked to make better use of the screen real estate, it&apos;s also been refreshed to match the "Material You design language."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:152.80%;"><img id="4zXg8pVPbRcvaMeZUX5SQc" name="redesigned-chrome-address-bar-tablets-render.png" alt="Redesigned address bar in Chrome for tablets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4zXg8pVPbRcvaMeZUX5SQc.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1000" height="1528" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it might not be something you notice immediately, there&apos;s another handy trick. When tapping within the address bar, the current webpage that you&apos;re using will appear within the drop-down menu. Handy and useful, for sure, but we&apos;re still keeping our fingers crossed for the ability to move the address bar to the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Chrome Actions is probably a feature that you forget about even exists, but Google hasn&apos;t. Once the update arrives, shortcuts will appear below the search box as you type. Then, you can tap a button, as opposed to waiting for the search results to appear and trying to decipher the results.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:152.67%;"><img id="EA7ypbT8hwEN8LaqQbqWcc" name="updated-chrome-actions-render.png" alt="New Chrome Actions when performing a search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EA7ypbT8hwEN8LaqQbqWcc.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="2290" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.15%;"><img id="tsF9QZXm6Qtoc5SGLvntCc" name="google-chrome-shortcut-suggestions-update-render.png" alt="Suggestions shortcut in Google Chrome" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tsF9QZXm6Qtoc5SGLvntCc.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1983" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Suggestions shortcut in Google Chrome </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Keeping with the idea of speeding things up, Google is adding a new "shortcut suggestions" feature to Chrome for Android and iOS. If there&apos;s something that you look up on a regular basis, the most pertinent results should now appear at the top of your suggestions.</p><p>The last two features further blur the line between Chrome and the standalone Google app. First, Google is bringing its "live sports cards" to the Discover Feed within the Chrome app. Based on the render provided, it&apos;s practically identical to what&apos;s found in the Discover Feed on your Android devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1352px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:171.01%;"><img id="74wBYUjyuxGKiSRgm2ujWc" name="sports-card-discover-feed-chrome-render.jpg" alt="Sports Cards appearing within Discover Feed on New Tab Page in Chrome" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/74wBYUjyuxGKiSRgm2ujWc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1352" height="2312" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly is a feature that&apos;s already been available on Android, but is now coming to iOS. Once the update arrives, you&apos;ll now see a list of "Trending Searches" appear when tapping within the address bar "from the New Tab page."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1352px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:171.01%;"><img id="6JGXNfiCuXhdaH27c7KuHc" name="search-trends-in-chrome-on-ios.png" alt="Trending Searches in Chrome for iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6JGXNfiCuXhdaH27c7KuHc.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1352" height="2312" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We can&apos;t help but feel as though Google might be moving away from the Discover Feed, as more features get integrated into the Chrome app. Perhaps that&apos;s in the cards, but, we&apos;re hopeful that isn&apos;t the case, even if it is a bit more convenient for those that practically live within the Chrome app.</p><p>All of these features are rolling out in some capacity starting now. The only exception is with the new Chrome Actions, as it&apos;s coming to Android first, and will be available on the iPhone "later this fall."</p>

<hr>
<p>YouTube is testing a new feature that lets users take their favorite shorts with them, but it&apos;s only for Android viewers.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-shorts-smart-downloads-3454371/">Android Authority</a>, YouTube has kickstarted a test it calls "Shorts Smart Downloads." The company&apos;s experimental <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/new">lab notes</a> state that Premium users can have any recommended Shorts downloaded onto their device automatically.</p><p>YouTube adds users enrolled in the test, who head into their "You" tab and go down to "Smart Downloads." If you&apos;ve watched Shorts recently, the company states that you should see a few previously downloaded videos that you may enjoy.</p><p>This test is only available for YouTube Premium users on Android until July 15. Users must opt into it if they would like to test it.</p><p>The publication notes that YouTube conducted a test run of these Smart Downloads for Shorts back in April, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1cc5yp9/how_to_disable_shorts_from_smart_downloads/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">detailed on Reddit</a>. Speculation suggests this was an early, limited experiment, and with feedback going well, YouTube likely extended it to gain a broader understanding.</p>

<p>With the latest Shorts test, it seems YouTube continues bringing more awareness to its short-form videos after plugging them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-wants-to-show-you-shorts-in-more-places-on-the-web">into the sidebar</a>. YouTube announced that its short-form content generates over 70 billion views daily. As such, Shorts have made their way into the sidebar on the web and beneath videos on mobile. The carousel is filled with Shorts of a similar theme to the current video you&apos;re watching.</p><p>Another test, dubbed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-is-testing-a-new-way-for-fans-to-show-some-love-to-their-favorite-channels">Hype</a>," lets users directly impact the length of their favorite video&apos;s reach across the platform. YouTube focuses on helping smaller creators reach larger audiences by installing Hype votes, letting viewers help adjust their content&apos;s ranking in the Explore tab.</p><p>Elsewhere, YouTube recently started testing its next phase in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-server-side-injectable-ads-test">war against ad blockers</a> with server-side ads. These advertisements are woven into the video a user would watch, effectively rendering their browser&apos;s ad blocker useless.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch FE is the first entry-level model in the line-up. It’s designed for those who are new to the world of health and fitness tracking as well as notifications on your wrist. It’s stylish, durable, and has many of the same features you’d find in the more advanced models, with some concessions, of course.</p></p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is coming up on being three years old, which is ancient in the tech space. However, for entry-level users who don’t need all the bells and whistles of the most premium models, it’s a viable option. But you’d most likely be better off with something newer, even if it costs a bit more.</p></p>

<p>If you’re new to the world of fitness and health tracking via wearables and you have a Samsung Galaxy phone, you might be considering getting an affordable smartwatch first to test the waters before diving into a more premium option. It might also be something for a teen or tween that they can use to keep on top of schedules, chores, and health.</p><p>Two good models to consider are the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE vs. Galaxy Watch 4. The former is the newer of the two, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-launch">released in summer 2024</a> and designed for new users. The latter is an older model but was premium at the time of its launch. Which should you choose? Let’s take a look.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-the-basics-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch FE vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 4: The basics</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="z7S7D2XFiNZcDPhqXFHTLi" name="Galaxy-Watch-FE-renders.jpg" alt="Galaxy Watch FE renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z7S7D2XFiNZcDPhqXFHTLi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sudhanshu Ambhore)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch FE might be an entry model, but it’s no slouch in the style department. It’s available in a 40mm size and employs a design based on the other, more premium models in the line with a circular face and two side buttons.</p><p>The 1.2-inch Super AMOLED screen is made of sapphire crystal glass, so it’s durable, and protected against scratches and scuffs. The screen is a full color always on display offering 396 x 396 pixel resolution.</p><p>Available in Black, Pink Gold, or Silver with new watch bands that have blue and orange stitching, you can customize the watch face to make it your own. The band is one-click style so it’s easy to swap out for other colors and styles. The watch meets 5ATM and IP68 ratings for both water and dust resistance, along with MIL-STD-810H standards so you can be confident that it’s well made.</p><p>Like all other Samsung Galaxy smartwatches, the Galaxy Watch FE can seamlessly connect with Samsung Galaxy devices, like smartphones, tablets, and earbuds. Use features like Find My Phone from the watch to locate a misplaced device, remotely control a Samsung smartphone camera, and pay for items on the go with Samsung Wallet. You can also store ID cards, like a driver’s license and student ID from Samsung Wallet as well. You can use it with other Android phones, too, but you won’t get as seamless an experience.</p><p>With Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, and built-in GPS, there’s an LTE option if you want to get a separate cellular plan for this watch to remain connected wherever you are, even without your phone (think morning run, in a meeting while your phone is at your desk, or at the gym). It also comes loaded with apps like Google Maps and YouTube Music thanks to WearOS.</p>

<p>By comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is made from armor aluminum and comes in a 40mm or larger 44mm (stainless steel) size, great for those who have larger wrists or want something less dainty. It’s available in Black, Green, and Silver (44mm version) or Black, Pink Gold, and Silver (40mm version) and has the same two side keys for home and back. The interchangeable bands are made of comfortable fluoroelastomer that doesn’t irritate the skin, as we found in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">review of the smartwatch a few years ago</a>.</p><p>Equipped with either a 1.4-inch or 1.2-inch circular Super AMOLED full-color, always-on screen, the smaller version offers 396 x 396 resolution and it’s 450 x 450 for the larger 44mm edition. The screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass DX+, so it’s durable as well. You can enjoy plenty of custom watch faces with this model as well, and even a full QWERTY keyboard if you’re adventurous enough to attempt composing a message from the tiny screen.</p><p>The larger model has a bigger 316mAh battery but if you opt for the smaller one, it’s the same 247mAh battery as the Galaxy Watch FE. Our reviewer found that it lasted about a day and a half with typical usage. The Galaxy Watch 4 meets the same 5ATM and IP68 rating as well as MIL-STD-810G, a step down from MIL-STD-810H. The latter is the latest revision of the specification which involves some additional testing, but you can rest assured that both smartwatches are pretty durable.</p><p>With the older Bluetooth 5.0 spec, there’s an LTE option for this watch as well. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 also comes with NFC and built-in GPS. But there’s no access to the new Samsung Wallet (though you can presumably use the Samsung Pay).</p><p>As with every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung Galaxy Watch</a>, you can connect this one seamlessly to your Samsung Galaxy smartphone and other devices within the Galaxy ecosystem. This watch also has Google Assistant built-in, which some users might find handy.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch FE vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 4: Specs</h2>
<p>When it comes down to the bare bones specs, these two smartwatches are pretty similar in many ways.</p>

<p>When comparing the 40mm size of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 to the same-sized Samsung Galaxy Watch FE, are a lot of similarities between these two devices.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CdHNrSTxNmyxe2sNirB7v5" name="golfpad-galaxy-watch-4-on-green.jpg" alt="GolfPad on the Galaxy Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CdHNrSTxNmyxe2sNirB7v5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now comes the question, what can these watches do and how do they operate? </p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch FE runs an Exynos W920 dual core 1.18GHz processor, an older version of what you’ll find in the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> and the same processor from the Galaxy Watch 4 as well as the Galaxy Watch 5. It is powered by WearOS with Samsung’s One UI 5 Watch.</p><p>Despite its affordable price and entry-level target, the Galaxy Watch FE has plenty of sensors. At its heart is Samsung’s advanced BioActive Sensor, which is designed to not only track your activity but also provide personalized and actionable tips to help you improve.</p><p>Like the latest Samsung smartwatches, the focus is on sleep and helping you get the best rest possible. There are advanced sleep features like the ability to monitor sleep patterns, sleep coaching, and assistance in creating a sleep-friendly environment.</p><p>For heart health, there are loads of monitoring features. Along with tracking 24/7 heart rate, the watch can deliver HR Alerts when it detects abnormally high or low heart rates. It also has an Irregular Heart Rhythm Notification (IHRN) feature that monitors heart rhythms and advises if atrial fibrillation (Afib) is suspected. The Watch also measures blood pressure and ECG, adding more data to the holistic picture of your health and wellness.</p><p>For exercise, the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE can track more than 100 different workouts and show progress right on your wrist. There’s advanced running analysis for runners, which tracks overall performance to help you maximize efficiency and provide guidance and insights. Runners will also appreciate the ability to use personalized heart rate zones to set their own custom goals based on physical capabilities.</p><p>Additionally, the Watch offers Body Composition tracking, which provides body and fitness data to help you track progress. As a bonus, it even sends motivational messages to guide and encourage you along the way.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ieLLop8DCY6LEfbzoKAzUC" name="galaxy-watch-4-notification-with-picture.jpg" alt="Galaxy Watch 4 Notification With Picture" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ieLLop8DCY6LEfbzoKAzUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 runs on the same Exynos W920 dual core 1.18GHz processor, so you won’t get a snappier experience from this watch than you would with the newer Galaxy Watch FE, despite the latter being an entry model while the Watch 4 was a premium model when it launched in August 2021. However, our Galaxy Watch 4 reviewer found that everything ran really well on the smartwatch when he tested it way back when, saying the device did everything asked of it almost instantaneously.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 operates with Wear OS powered by Samsung as well. You can access various Google apps thanks to Wear OS, like Google Maps as well as third-party ones like Spotify and Calm.</p><p>This watch has a Samsung BioActive sensor, too, which can track activities and metrics like heart rate, bioelectrical impedance analysis (though you need to manually input your weight each time to get the data), ECG, and more.</p><p>You won’t get the same deep sleep tracking and insights but our reviewer found that the Galaxy Watch 4 did a pretty good job tracking sleep, including stages, and providing a sleep score. You can also access sleep coaching through the Samsung Health app. Nonetheless, if sleep tracking is important to you, this might be a deciding factor between the two. You do, however, get features like body composition, which leverages the BIA analysis.</p>

<p>If you’re on a tight budget, the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE provides an almost identical experience to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 yet it’s about $100 cheaper. That makes it a pretty good value option that will be considered outdated long after the Galaxy Watch 4 reaches that point (it arguably already has).</p><p>With both watches, you get a slower, outdated processor and shorter battery life compared to more premium models, which are arguably two pretty big concessions. Considering that the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is just $100 more than both, you might be better off just going with that model, even if you have to wait longer to save up a bit more.</p><p>There isn’t really a compelling reason to go for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 when comparing these two, beyond the larger size option with a slightly higher resolution screen and longer battery life. When comparing apples to apples with the 40mm version of both, the Galaxy Watch FE will provide enough and then some to justify choosing it instead.</p><p>It’s also important to keep in mind that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> is likely to launch soon. When it does, you will probably be able to find even better deals on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 models. By that time, the Galaxy Watch 4 will be even farther in the rear-view mirror, making it a less appealing option, even for new users.</p><p>Between these two, if you’re dead set on the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 4, go with the Galaxy FE. Newer is almost always better, and that watch has similar specs to the Galaxy Watch 4 with other new features you won’t find. It will also future-proof your purchase a little longer until you save up for something better. Then, you can choose from among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">the best Android smartwatches</a> which, coincidentally, includes the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6.</p>

<p>You’ll get a nearly premium experience with the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE without spending a fortune and be confident that you have the latest and greatest. But given that it’s not significantly less than the step-up Galaxy Watch 6, you might be better off getting that model, or waiting for the Galaxy Watch 7 to launch and that one to come down further in price.</p></p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 was a fabulous watch when it launched, and it’s still not far behind the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE in terms of specs. In fact, it’s fairly on par with it. But it’s older, outdated, and not the type of product you want to buy right now. If you’re getting similar features, stick with the latest, especially since it’s offered at the same price.</p></p>

<p>If you&apos;re stuck on a strict budget, there are plenty of cheap Android smartwatches we&apos;d recommend. Which you choose will depend on how you define "cheap," but also whether you need a proper Wear OS watch with Android phone integration or more of a fitness tracker for health data and basic notifications.</p><p>Most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> cost between $300 and $500, so we&apos;ve tried to keep this list in the $200-and-under range as much as possible. The Samsung Galaxy Watch FE is a solid budget option for affordable smarts, but we&apos;ll also point you to even cheaper options, or ones focused more on fashion or athletics.</p><p>Depending on where you&apos;re willing to compromise — whether it&apos;s on price, apps, fitness features, or design — you&apos;ll be happy with at least one of the best cheap Android smartwatches available.</p>

<p>Samsung makes our favorite Android watches, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> is too expensive for this list, and our old favorites like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a> or Watch 4 are mostly out of stock and sold by shady resellers. Plus, they&apos;ll lose software support from Samsung fairly soon. However, Samsung just launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-launch">Galaxy Watch FE</a>, a slightly redesigned Galaxy Watch 4 due to receive years of software support.</p><p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a>, the Galaxy Watch FE offers heart rate with passive AFib data, blood oxygen, ECG readings, and body composition scans for body fat percentage. It has IP68 dust and water resistance, plus military-grade protection against shock. Plus, it has tap-to-pay and support for both Google Assistant and Bixby.</p><p>What&apos;s different about it? Samsung added fun stitching to the default watch bands for a signature look and a Sapphire Crystal layer to the 1.2-inch display. And this new release resets the clock on software support, so even though it has an older Exynos chip than the latest Galaxy Watch, it should still get Wear OS updates for years. Still, this is essentially a watch with tech from 2021 and 2022, repurposed for 2024. That&apos;s what you have to accept for the discount!</p><p><strong>Cheap alternative:</strong> With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> arriving soon, you may find discounted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review"><strong>Galaxy Watch 6</strong></a> models available for not much higher than the Watch FE. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Samsung Galaxy Watch FE vs. Galaxy Watch 6</a> guide runs through the differences.

<p>Most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> today are on the pricey side. But the TicWatch E3, which originally launched with Wear OS 2 and received Wear OS 3 recently, is the rare option that&apos;s quite affordable, especially since it frequently goes on sale. You&apos;ll simply have to accept some downsides for the low price.</p><p>First, the positives. Most of our other cheap Android smartwatch picks are fitness watches with proprietary OSs and no app support. The TicWatch E3 gives you all the apps you could want, and it has a stronger battery life than the Galaxy Watch FE—especially in Essential mode. </p><p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mobvoi-ticwatch-e3-review">TicWatch E3</a> reviewer had a laundry list of positives when describing it. He noted "little to no delay in opening apps or loading up the Play Store on the watch," something you can&apos;t say for many fitness watches. And on that note, it has heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring for workout and sleep tracking, with the results on par with those he measured on Samsung and Amazfit watches. </p><p>In exchange for the low price, you&apos;re getting an LCD with a thick bezel that our reviewer called "a bit excessive." You also have to rely on the touchscreen, which may bother you if you&apos;re used to a digital crown. The TicWatch E3 has less RAM and storage than the Galaxy Watch FE, as well. But since we&apos;ve seen it discounted for half the price of Samsung&apos;s cheapest watch, these are fair compromises.</p><p><strong>Cheap alternatives:</strong> We&apos;ve also seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-3-gps-review"><strong>TicWatch Pro 3</strong></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ticwatch-pro-3-ultra-gps-review"><strong>TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra</strong></a> discounted into the $150 range. They have the same software and performance, but far stronger battery life, AMOLED displays, and better materials. We just can&apos;t guarantee they&apos;ll be as cheap as the E3 at any given moment.</p>

<p>When it comes to cheap Android smartwatches, Amazfit is one of the first brands we think of. It sells a dozen or more watches at any time, most of which cost $230 or less. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch">best Amazfit smartwatch</a> guide runs through several great options, but we&apos;re highlighting our top pick here: the Amazfit GTS 4.</p><p>Like our previous pick for this spot—the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazfit-gts-3-review">Amazfit GTS 3</a>—the GTS 4 has all of the essentials, from continuous heart, blood oxygen, stress, and breathing data to hundreds of sports modes (with 8 auto-recognized activities like running or cycling). They both have Alexa commands and simple apps like weather and alarms. You also get a gorgeous 1.75-inch AMOLED display with 1,000 nits of brightness and 341 pixels per inch.</p><p>With the GTS 4, Amazfit added a speaker so you can make Bluetooth calls and hear Alexa&apos;s responses instead of reading them. It also added dual-band GPS for more accurate tracking results. Unfortunately, it still lacks NFC for contactless payments, and the revamped "BioTracker 4.0" cuts the battery life down compared to the GTS 3. But it&apos;s still just as long-lived as most other fitness watches, and longer than a Wear OS watch.</p><p>We appreciate how Amazfit takes your workout data and judges your fitness level, training load, and other data via its PeakBeats algorithm. You don&apos;t get the Zepp Coach AI of some of the newer watches, but it&apos;ll still help guide you to get fitter, without the subscription that our next pick charges.</p><p><strong>Cheap alternatives:</strong> As we said, Amazfit has plenty of cheaper options that cut specific features like the mic and speaker. Look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-gtr-mini-review"><strong>Amazfit GTR Mini</strong></a> for a more circular design, or the <strong>Amazfit Active</strong> for a cheaper squircle. You may also want to look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness trackers</a>, which aren&apos;t proper "watches" but are often significantly cheaper.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Fitbit Versa 4</a> is a bit of an odd fitness watch. After Google acquired Fitbit, it made the company change some of its design and hardware strategy, and that played out in the Versa 4. Our reviewer wasn&apos;t a big fan of its cutbacks, but it still gives you Fitbit&apos;s respected health and fitness insights for $100 less than the Sense 2, making it a lock for this list.</p><p>Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-versa-3-review">Fitbit Versa 3</a>, the Versa 4 lost the old Fitbit OS&apos; third-party apps, replaced by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-google-maps-fitbit-sense-2-versa-4">Google Maps</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-google-wallet-fitbit-sense-2-versa-4">Google Wallet</a>—arguably more useful. More frustratingly, it no longer supports Google Assistant, nor music storage or playback controls like the Versa 3 did. That makes it less of a "smart" watch than its predecessor. You still have Alexa commands, but the Wi-Fi antenna is disabled, making responses slower than they should be.</p><p>Still, you get a 6-day watch with a gorgeously bright AMOLED display, built-in GPS with an altimeter for judging elevation, Bluetooth calling, continuous heart rate, blood oxygen, heart rate variance (HRV), and breathing rate. It&apos;s enough for Fitbit to give you a ton of insights into your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-fitbit-daily-readiness-score-and-how-do-i-use-it">Daily Readiness</a> and your overall wellness, so long as you keep subscribing to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-premium-worth-annual-subscription">Fitbit Premium</a> after the free 6-month trial ends.</p><p><em><strong>Cheap alternatives:</strong></em> We&apos;ve seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review"><strong>Fitbit Sense 2</strong></a> dip to $199 during various deal events in the past couple of years; if you spot it at that price, you can upgrade to get an ECG and stress sensors, among other perks. You may also want the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review"><strong>Fitbit Charge 6</strong></a>; you lose the pretty squircle display and altimeter but gain YouTube Music controls, the ECG, an upgraded HR sensor for accuracy, and a lighter fit.</p>

<p>Most cheap Android smartwatches have cheap, toy-like appearances, whether you choose a squircle or circular display. That&apos;s why many gravitate towards <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-hybrid-smartwatches">hybrid smartwatches</a> that pick style over substance. But since most of our favorite hybrids are expensive, we&apos;re picking the reasonable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-vivomove-sport-review">Garmin Vivomove Sport</a> for this spot.</p><p>Shipping in Ivory, Cocoa, Cool Mint, or Black, the Vivomove Sport looks like a traditional watch, with actual watch hands and a subtle monocolor OLED touchscreen on the bottom half of the watch. It&apos;s designed to passively track your heart rate, stress, blood oxygen, Body Battery, and other data for you to check in the Garmin Connect app.</p><p>Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a>, the Vivomove Sport is pretty limited. You won&apos;t find Garmin Pay, built-in GPS, or robust training tools like Garmin Coach. This is much more of a subtle tool for basic stats like Intensity Minutes, steps, calories burned, and sleep insights. But we think plenty of people will prefer a simplified, stylish experience.</p><p><strong>Cheap alternatives:</strong> Most Garmin watches cost $400 and up, with a few hitting $1,000! So even though they&apos;re too expensive for this list, the $250 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review"><strong>Garmin Forerunner 165</strong></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review"><strong>Garmin Venu Sq 2</strong></a> are <em>relatively</em> cheap for the brand. The Forerunner is a fantastic training tool for runners with workout suggestions and post-run recovery time; the Venu gives you the squircle look and a solid 11-day battery life.</p>

<p>As we mentioned with the GTS 4, Amazfit makes a variety of cheap Android smartwatches. The Amazfit T-Rex 2 is basically the opposite of the GTS 4, which is much daintier and focused on a traditional smartwatch experience. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-t-rex-2-review">T-Rex 2 reviewer</a> said that this watch "will likely outsurvive you" thanks to its rugged durability, and that&apos;s a nice reassurance when most cheap watches aren&apos;t built to last long.</p><p>The T-Rex 2 weighs a hefty 66.5g, making it noticeable on your wrist compared to most of the thin, shorter-lived entries on this list—but significantly lighter than the stainless steel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-t-rex-ultra-review">T-Rex Ultra</a>. It survived over a dozen MIL-STD-810G certifications and has a 10ATM water resistance rating, twice as deep as most smartwatches can handle. Plus, it can last for weeks per charge under normal conditions.</p><p>Otherwise, this watch and the GTS 4 aren&apos;t that different. You get a ridiculous number of sports modes and eight automatic exercises, plus data on your heart rate, blood oxygen, stress, and breathing. It even has the Zepp Coach AI, though not the GTS 4&apos;s mic/speaker combo or its newer HR sensor LEDs that are supposed to be 33% more accurate.</p><p><strong>Cheap alternatives:</strong> We&apos;ve already brought up other cheap Amazfit watches to consider, and other rugged watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2-solar-review">Garmin Instinct 2</a> are too expensive for this list. We also like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazfit-t-rex-pro-review">T-Rex Pro</a>, though it has an even older health sensor suite, a smaller display, and other downsides. If you don&apos;t need ruggedness and just want a cheap fitness watch, consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-pacer-review">Polar Pacer</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">Coros Pace 3</a>.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-between-the-best-cheap-android-smartwatches-2">Choosing between the best cheap Android smartwatches</h2>
<p>Hopefully, this list will make it clear that you can find a cheap Android smartwatch that doesn&apos;t feel like a complete downgrade. Most of them have a baseline of features that you&apos;ll want: health and sleep tracking, notifications, and solid battery life. But in other ways, you&apos;ll have to accept compromises.</p><p>Your first big decision is whether to choose Wear OS or a secondary option like Fitbit or Garmin OS. We appreciate the Galaxy Watch FE and TicWatch series for giving you access to Play Store apps and the ability to respond to notifications on your wrist. But in exchange, you&apos;ll have to charge them every one to two days, while other picks on this list will last a week or more.</p><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> are smarter than others, and most of our picks sacrificed features that you may really want. You&apos;ll want the Versa 4 for Bluetooth calling, but not for music playback. Amazfit watches don&apos;t have tap-to-pay. Hybrid watches typically don&apos;t have built-in GPS. Make sure to do your research before you buy, so you don&apos;t end up regretting your choice.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch FE looks smart and superior next to our other picks, but do remember that it&apos;s a downgrade compared to other full-priced smartwatches. Specifically, it has less RAM, an older CPU, and a thicker border around its display than the Galaxy Watch 6. You may want to hunt for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/prime-day-smartwatch-deals-2024">Prime Day smartwatch deals</a> instead of compromising.</p>

<h2 id="wait-this-is-what-the-razr-plus-2024-apos-s-ip-rating-means-2">Wait! This is what the Razr Plus 2024&apos;s IP rating means</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rGwGHzDny625oebApQjdCk" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-and-Razr-2024-2.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and Razr 2024 next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rGwGHzDny625oebApQjdCk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) uses an IP (ingress protection) rating system to grade an enclosure&apos;s dust and liquid entry resistance. The first digital (or X) indicates protection against solids, while the second digital indicates protection against liquids. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> has an IPX8 rating, meaning it has not been tested for dust resistance but can withstand 30 minutes of submersion in 1.5 meters of water. If there were a zero instead of an X, that would indicate that it underwent testing and is not dust-resistant.</p><p>While the phone&apos;s water resistance was tested in a lab with fresh water, it&apos;s advisable to avoid exposing it to salt water, chlorinated pools, or other liquids like soft drinks and juices, as these could potentially damage the phone.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, which features on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-waterproof-phone">best waterproof phone</a> list, shares the same IPX8 rating as the Motorola Razr Plus 2024. However, like the Flip 5, it&apos;s wise not to take the Razr Plus 2024 swimming or expose it to excessive dust, particularly in environments where fine particles can easily get inside the phone. While keeping dust out of a folding phone can be challenging, using a dustproof bag or case can offer significant protection.</p><p>It&apos;s important to note that the IPX8 rating can deteriorate over time due to drops, impacts, and rough handling. The seals and gaskets can crack, become loose, or compress. Extreme temperatures and areas with high humidity can also contribute to the rating decreasing over time.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-clean-and-disinfect-your-android-smartphone">Properly cleaning your Android phone</a> will also help keep the rating at its highest as long as possible and prevent any damage from occurring. Also, avoid trying to replace any hardware on your waterproof Razr Plus 2024 since any unauthorized modifications can affect the rating over time. </p><p>The highest rating you will see on a phone is IP69K, meaning it&apos;s completely dustproof (6), and nine means it can withstand high-pressure hot water from different angles. When you want to know how much water a device can withstand, the IP rating will give you a more precise indication than words. While a phone might be able to withstand slightly more water than its IP rating suggests, it&apos;s best not to risk it. It&apos;s not a common rating you would see on phones, but some phones have that rating, such as the Nokia XR21.</p><p>If you don&apos;t want that much protection, you can go with flagship phones such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, which has an IP rating of IP68, meaning it&apos;s completely dustproof and waterproof for up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2023 was a great entry into the growing foldables market. But you get a vastly improved experience with the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 that leaves this one in the dust.

<p>Motorola has improved greatly on its popular Razr Plus foldable phone with a new version that boasts tons of enhancements in AI, design, specs, and more. If you’re considering buying the new phone as an upgrade or looking to compare both to decide which one to buy, we’re here to help. Looking at the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 vs. Razr Plus 2023, here’s what you need to know.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="78tE4SHLAESmQ2jbu5zXTe" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-06.jpg" alt="The back of a Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78tE4SHLAESmQ2jbu5zXTe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First, let’s consider the design and basics of these two phones. </p><p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2024, which will be available starting July 10, 2024, has a 6.9-inch FHD+ pOLED 2,640 x 1,080 main foldable screen with HDR 10+. In his hands-on, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">Android Central’s Derrek Lee</a> said the screen is brighter and more vibrant. The smaller external display once folded is the largest you’ll find in a foldable device to date at 4 inches, boasting 1,272 x 1,080 resolution, and covering almost the entire front of the phone once folded. The larger inner screen offers a 165Hz refresh rate and 3,000 nits brightness while the smaller external display offers the same refresh rate at 2,400 nits peak brightness.</p><p>Available in Midnight Blue, Spring Green, Peach Fuzz (the Pantone Color of the Year), and a Hot Pink throwback to the original Razr, the phone has a soft vegan leather back with contoured edges. Lee said that beyond the bigger external screen and new colors, the phone looks nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same curvaceous frame. The cameras, however, do protrude more from the bottom corner.</p><p>The screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus and the phone is submersible in up to 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes, making it quite durable. However, it does not have a dust resistance rating, which you’ll want to keep in mind when using it while out and about.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mc9H6pcxQdLgW4mCZYcbDg" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-03.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 main display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mc9H6pcxQdLgW4mCZYcbDg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hinge has been improved with a simplified design that not only offers good dust protection for this part of the device, but it’s also easier to flick open or snap shut with one hand. Lee said it feels smaller but sturdier, holding the phone nicely in place at various angles. It offers a wide range of Flex View positions, allowing for hands-free photo capture along with a shake-free camcorder mode that’s optimized for social media.</p><p>With a 4,000mAh battery, the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 supports 45W TurboPower charging (charger sold separately), 15W wireless charging (charger sold separately), as well as 5W reverse charging. It has 256GB built-in storage, dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos and Spatial Sound (along with Qualcomm Snapdragon Sound 4), and three microphones.</p><p>Offering USB-C charging, it also includes Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi, 5G, NFC, a fingerprint reader, lock screen, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uqQYR7pWJuZMVHSVcYaiNn" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-how-its-going-9.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2023 hinge and back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uqQYR7pWJuZMVHSVcYaiNn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparatively, the Motorola Razr Plus 2023, which launched in summer 2023, has the same 6.9-inch internal pOLED screen with the same 2,640 x 1,080 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. But it taps out at 1,400 nits brightness. The external screen is smaller at 3.6 inches in size and offers a lesser 1,066 x 1,056 resolution with a 144Hz refresh rate and 1,100 nits brightness.</p><p>If you’re going to be using the external screen a lot, you’ll find it much more pleasurable with the new phone versus this older one. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">his review last year</a>, Lee said the 1,400 nits isn’t enough in direct sunlight, and he’d often find himself struggling to see the display.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2023 comes in Infinite Black, Glacier Blue, and Viva Magenta with the same faux leather back on the latter option that Lee said adds a nice texture to the phone. The Gorilla Glass Victus screen is just as durable but this phone only meets an IP52 rating. You won’t get the same level of intelligent personalization, but there are lots of wallpapers from which to choose, along with lock screens and clock styles.</p><p>The flex mode adjusts the angle of some apps, like YouTube, to take advantage of the phone if it’s sitting at a different angle. With Ready For support, you can connect the phone to a compatible PC to cast the display to the bigger screen without the need for wires.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uUghf2sg5tnb7i42XbVDfj" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-how-its-going-7.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2023 internal display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uUghf2sg5tnb7i42XbVDfj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hinge is a big difference here since it was difficult to open and close the phone with one hand with the Motorola Razr Plus 2023. “It’s not as easy as I’d like” one-handed, said Lee, “but it’s not impossible.” He did find closing the phone, however, to be quite smooth. Considering that’s one of the big draws with a foldable phone, it’s a major upgrade that Motorola has improved on one-handed opening and closing with the Motorola Razr Plus 2024.</p><p>The older phone has a smaller battery as well at 3,800mAh and supports slower charging at 30W wired or 5W wireless. For power users, this is a significant upgrade with the new phone. Lee said battery life isn’t great with the Motorola Razr Plus 2023, with the phone struggling to get through a full day on a charge. With stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos and three mics, you will get a favorable audio experience with this phone. It also has the same 256GB storage. </p><p>Along with USB-C charging, you get the older (but still good) Bluetooth 5.3 spec, Wi-Fi, 5G, fingerprint sensor, face unlock, and other similar features. Motorola promised three OS updates with the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 and four years of bi-monthly security updates. The new Motorola Razr Plus 2024, it should be noted, offers the same.</p>

<p>Now, let’s get down to the nitty-gritty. What is it about the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 that makes it a worthwhile upgrade from the Razr Plus 2023, or the better option to buy between the two, if that is what you’re pondering?</p><p>First off, the new phone adds access to the Google Gemini app right from the external display: all you need to do is press and hold the power button. A Gemini Advanced subscription is included for three months, which includes access to Google Gemini in apps like Gmail and Docs along with 2TB of cloud storage. You can also access Google Photos right from the external display.</p><p>The panels are improved: they’re more fluid to use with animations as you swipe. There’s also the option to pinch to zoom out and view all at once, and more app choices, like Google Messages that can take up the entire cover screen. </p><p>You can change the Desk Display to show your own selection of text and images, effectively creating your own modern screensaver. With moto ai, you can use Style Sync, a neat feature that develops wallpaper options based on your outfit. With Magic Canvas, meanwhile, you can generate images based on simple and descriptive text prompts.</p><p>Equipped with a powerful Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 mobile processor and Hello UX software along with 12GB RAM, the phone comes with Android 14. Moto ai offers enhanced experience features leveraging generative AI. While not available out of the gate, there are some new features coming to the phone in a few months. </p><p>Catch me up will provide a prioritized summary of your personal communications so you don’t have to sift through notifications. Pay attention enables instant recordings of conversations or speakers, then transcribes and summarizes them. Remember this, meanwhile, can capture live moments or on-screen information so you can easily recall it later. You can also access moto ai with virtually any app or function on the phone, getting suggestions, answers to questions, guidance on how to use the phone, and more, all powered by Gemini from Google Cloud.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nb99u8YSDN3JzrJyMF9KhV" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-how-its-going-4.jpg" alt="YouTube Music on a rotated Motorola Razr Plus 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nb99u8YSDN3JzrJyMF9KhV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While you won’t find all the same Google Gemini integration and features with the Motorola Razr Plus 2023, it does have some interesting features. There are panels you can arrange for the external screen as well, including apps for things like weather, a calendar, contacts, games, news, music, and more. But you won’t find as many and they don’t work as fluidly.</p><p>Nonetheless, you can still easily access a selection of apps and even use them without having to open the phone. Lee said he absolutely loved using the outer display and access to the apps, finding it very responsive. But the experience is presumably much better with the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, not only with more app options and better navigation through them, but also because of the larger screen size.</p><p>The apps aren’t optimized for the smaller display, but most are relatively easy to use. Although you’ll run into a few, like Instagram, that are a bit more challenging since it’s so scaled down. Lee does, however, love the app continuity such that if you find an app too difficult to use on the external screen, you can open the phone and it will automatically open on the full screen. Presumably, this works the same way in the Motorola Razr Plus 2024.</p><p>With 8GB RAM and running the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor, the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 did pretty well at running games in Lee’s testing. The built-in gaming mode provides an extra boost as well, though Lee noticed that the phone can get warm if you’re playing very graphics-heavy games.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2023 comes with Android 13. Though it can be upgraded to Android 14 and likely beyond, it won’t be supported for as long as the newer Motorola Razr Plus 2024, which would go up to Android 17 versus 16. So, this is something you should factor into your decision.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-plus-2024-vs-razr-plus-2023-the-cameras-2">Motorola Razr Plus 2024 vs. Razr Plus 2023: The cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="S8xDDjsbgjzBr33xC4myiV" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-02.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S8xDDjsbgjzBr33xC4myiV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cameras have been vastly improved with the Motorola Razr Plus 2024. There’s a 50MP main camera or 12.6MP camera with optical image stabilization. The 50MP secondary camera, while much higher resolution than what was found in the Motorola Razr Plus 2023, is strangely a telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom instead. Lee interviewed an executive at the company who said the decision was made since consumers tend to use portrait mode more often than ultrawide. The front camera is 32MP.</p><p>You get all the usual suspects you’d expect from a Motorola device when it comes to photo modes, like portrait, Face Beauty, night vision, panorama, Auto Smile Capture, and more. Plus, there are moto ai enhancements. </p><p>The Photo Enhancement Engine uses AI to apply settings from multiple shooting modes so you get the best possible pictures every time. It fine-tunes images for detail, clarity, highlights, shadows, color, and even bokeh effects. Adaptive Stabilization automatically determines the speed of movement and dynamically adjusts stabilization to provide the best results as well while you’re recording moving videos, like a sporting event or riding a bike.</p><p>Action Shot automatically increases and adjusts the shutter speed and illumination to account for the lighting condition; while Long Exposure helps you capture content like artistic light trails or waterfalls with a single tap. Super Zoom is also available, helping you take crisp photos from further away. It uses AI-based machine learning to help capture fine details.</p><p>Lee hasn’t had the chance to put these features and the cameras through their paces just yet: stay tuned for more details.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3S8QFTpRzPa8aQLkLC4FqX" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-how-its-going-3.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3S8QFTpRzPa8aQLkLC4FqX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nonetheless, with the Motorola Razr Plus 2023, the cameras leave much to be desired so you can be certain that they’re better in the Motorola Razr Plus 2024. There’s a decent 12MP wide camera and a 13MP ultrawide and macro camera that can take acceptable photos. The same goes for the 32MP front “selfie” camera. But these are nothing to write home about.</p><p>There are some interesting photo features beyond the usual in the Motorola Razr Plus 2023, like photo booth mode for taking a series of photos in a row, just like if you were in a photo booth. But there’s nothing particularly compelling about the camera experience with this phone.</p><p>Lee said photos taken with these cameras are “okay” and “fairly balanced,” but feel slightly muted: there’s something missing he just can’t put his finger on. Low light and night shots are decent, however, as are portrait and macro shots. So, you’ll get good results, just nothing jaw-droppingly great when it comes to photos you take with the Motorola Razr Plus 2023.</p>

<p>The decision between the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 vs. Razr Plus 2023 seems pretty obvious: go with the newer phone. It offers notable upgrades over the older model and comes in at the same starting price point that one did. Though you can find the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 for much cheaper now, it’s not worth getting, especially since Motorola doesn’t promise as many years of software and security updates as other brands.</p><p>If you’re concerned about cost, you can also consider the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-launch">Motorola Razr 2024</a>,  which offers pared-down specs for a more affordable price. But comparing the Razr Plus 2024 to the Razr Plus 2023, you get plenty more AI features, much better cameras, a larger external screen on which you can do (and see) more, and a hinge that has been drastically improved.</p><p>We named the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phones</a>, but this model will likely be replaced by the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 in the ranking. If you’re considering a foldable phone, this model is a great option to consider that will be a solid upgrade or a first great device in this growing space.</p>

It incorporates all the latest AI features, some coming within the next few months, and boasts impressive specs that are worlds above the previous generation phone. You’ll appreciate the improved peak brightness, especially if you are outdoors a lot, the better cameras, more powerful processor, longer battery life, and more. Plus, there are funky new colors from which to choose.</p></p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2023 was a great phone when it launched and it still is among the best foldable phones you can buy. But it will likely be replaced by the more powerful, better-designed Motorola Razr Plus 2024. If you’re buying new, you’re best to save up for this newer version. If you have the Razr Plus 2023, keep it until the upgrade cycle is here, and then look into enjoying the benefits of this new phone.</p></p>

<ul><li>OpenAI took to X to announce that it will delay the launch of the advanced Voice Mode, which was slated for release this spring. </li><li>The company is testing the new voice model on a small group of people for feedback and learning before rolling it out to all Plus users.</li><li>If all goes as anticipated, the other Plus users will get access to the advanced voice model in the fall. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Open AI quickly tweeted on Tuesday (June 26) that it will be holding off on launching the advanced Voice Mode that was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">demoed last month</a>. It planned to roll out this feature widely in the software&apos;s spring update; however, it looks like people who were looking to experiment with it need to wait a bit more.</p><p>The new voice assistant is said to have "human-like" conversations that users can interrupt, emoting and bringing life-like interactions like laughter, sarcasm, and humor that come as a relief from the usual robotic prompts we expect from an assistant. However, despite promising a quick rollout to subscribed users, OpenAI has now announced a delay in releasing the upgraded "Voice Mode" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/openai-delays-chatgpts-new-voice-mode-by-a-month/">Android Police)</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We're sharing an update on the advanced Voice Mode we demoed during our Spring Update, which we remain very excited about:We had planned to start rolling this out in alpha to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users in late June, but need one more month to reach our bar to launch.…<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1805716393524183136">June 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>While it continues to test this new voice mode, the company says it will be giving access to it to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users in late June, and some of them have already received an update on their phones. One such user who got access took to X to share an invite she received. The invite stated, "advanced voice is in limited Alpha, it may make mistakes, and access (to it)  is subject to change."</p><p>Open AI stated that its systems will use the audio and video content that the user shares via Chat GPT to train the model better. Users can also opt out of sharing their data and training the model by hitting " improve the model for everyone" in settings.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">👀 pic.twitter.com/6RfCMkanN4<a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1805863101637722167">June 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The user also posted a tweet with the new voice of "Sky" that appears to be different from the one we heard at the Chat GPT- 4o announcement. Initially, users on social media pointed out the similarities between the voice of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-trying-to-steal-scarlett-johanssons-voice-to-make-ai-feel-comfortable-is-the-reason-why-its-so-worrying">assistant and Scarlett Johansson</a>, the award-winning actress. However, OpenAI denied that Sky&apos;s voice was based on Johansson and even released a blog post explaining how the voices were chosen. The actress countered those claims with a statement about how OpenAI approached her about officially voicing GPT-4o, which she declined, and then the company quickly removed the Sky voice option from its platform.</p><p>The new voice has a more "cheery tone," the user states, as the voice model describes the weather in San Francisco. Other users on the same tweet thread seemed unhappy with the new voice. One user said, "It&apos;s horrifying; someone help it," while others were particularly "cringed" by it, listen in below.</p>

<p>OpenAI added in its tweet, that based on the feedback they recieved from this small group of testers, they will be planning to roll out the model to Plus users in the fall. </p><p>"Exact timelines depend on meeting our high safety and reliability bar. We are also working on rolling out the new video and screen sharing capabilities we demoed separately, and will keep you posted on that timeline."</p>

<p>Until the Galaxy Watch 7 arrives, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is perhaps the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-best-overall">best Android watch</a> out there, in no small part due to its large, aesthetically pleasing screen and minimal design. Walmart cutting $82 off the price of the Watch 6 almost brings it down to the prices of prior-generation Samsung watches. Going with the Watch 6 instead of past generations will net you better performance, an improved capacitive bezel, and an enlarged display, so it's easy to consider upgrading with this big of a price cut.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>battery charging speeds are a major priority for you when it comes to a smartwatch; you want a premium smartwatch at a discount price; you&apos;re looking for a watch with a large, easy-to-read display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you need a smartwatch that&apos;s especially long-lasting; you want to wait for the arrival of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>; you&apos;d rather get a smartwatch that&apos;s even cheaper than what this deal can offer.</p><p>There&apos;s more than one reason why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 6</a> is the best smartwatch on the market today, but the speedy performance and good-looking display certainly help lead the charge. The Watch 6 also features the easy-to-use Wear OS, and it tends to be compatible with a wide range of smartphone brands.</p><p>If you want industry-leading battery life, you might want to consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> instead. The Watch 6 has also been called out for some occasionally inaccurate GPS mapping, so many folks are waiting to see what the Galaxy Watch 7 offers when it&apos;s presumably revealed next month.
