Software bugs from its rushed launch, recycled hardware from cheaper watches, and the $1,000+ price tag frustrated me, even as I acknowledged that the overall package was fantastic.</p><p>Weeks of testing have only confirmed my initial suspicions that (A) the Fenix 8 is overpriced and (B) the Fenix 8 is the best Garmin watch for anyone who can afford it. Multiple sizes and display types let you tailor the Fenix 8 to your needs and style; whichever you pick, it's a great fusion of everything great from the Venu, Forerunner, and Instinct series — with a few legacy problems brought along for the ride.</p><p>Garmin certainly has no regrets about its rushed launch and absurd price. Despite plenty of forum complaints about buggy software and public drama about the dive-certified watch crashing in cold water, Garmin fans bought and kept their Fenix 8s en masse. During its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www8.garmin.com/aboutGarmin/invRelations/reports/2024_Q3_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf">Q3 2024 earnings call</a>, Garmin specifically credited the "highly successful launch of the new Fenix 8 series" for why it hit over $500 million in quarterly outdoor watch sales for the first time.</p><p>In other words, I'm not here to sell you on buying a Fenix 8 by giving it a high rating; tons of people already sold themselves on it. Instead, I'll try to paint a realistic and fair picture of everything Garmin nailed with the Fenix 8 while also pushing back on the areas where it's a letdown for <em>anyone</em> spending a grand on a smartwatch.</p>

<p>Garmin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-launches-new-fenix-8-and-enduro-3">announced the Fenix 8</a> and Enduro 3 on August 27, the first Fenix model to come in both AMOLED and MIP Solar models. This effectively killed off the short-lived Garmin Epix series, which was developed as an AMOLED reskin of Fenix.</p><p>The Fenix 8 AMOLED comes in three case sizes — 43mm, 47mm, and 51mm — while the Fenix 8 Solar only comes in 47mm and 51mm. The AMOLED series comes in either stainless steel/Gorilla Glass or lighter titanium with more durable Sapphire Glass. Both Solar sizes ship in titanium by default.</p><p>The steel 43mm or 47mm Fenix 8 AMOLED costs $999, but most versions — the titanium 43mm/47mm AMOLED, 51mm steel AMOLED, or 47mm Solar — cost $1,099. Upgrade to the titanium 51mm in AMOLED or MIP for $1,199. These aren't Garmin's most expensive models, but they're pricier than past Fenixes.</p><p>In terms of colors, the Fenix 8 series is fairly basic in most sizes, with either Carbon Grey titanium, silver Titanium, or Slate Grey steel. Only the 43mm Fenix 8 is more creative with a Soft Gold titanium or Silver steel, and I suspect many Fenix 8 buyers will prefer a larger display and lengthened battery life. You can see the comparative specs for all five Fenix 8 models in the table below.</p>

<p>I chose the Garmin Fenix 8 47mm AMOLED watch for this review. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">dislike MIP displays</a> and was excited to test the first AMOLED Fenix model, prioritizing a better display for all contexts over better direct-sunlight visibility and another week or two of battery life that I probably don't need.</p><p>That said, the 47mm Fenix 8 Solar is more efficient than the last generation, beating the 47mm Fenix 7X Pro Solar by six days or 17 multi-band GPS hours with solar. The 51mm Fenix 8 Solar wins by 11 days or 24 multi-band GPS hours over the 51mm 7X. So if maximum battery paired with premium features is your main concern, either MIP model will meet your needs.</p><p>As for sizing, I picked the 47mm case because the 43mm Fenix 8 battery life felt deficient compared to other small Garmin watches, while the 51mm's extra 19g of weight would have felt oppressive; as it is, the 47mm Fenix 8 weight takes getting used to. If you <em>can</em> stand heavier watches, the 51mm Fenix 8 has some truly epic battery life for an AMOLED watch, but I wish it had a 1.5-inch display instead of 1.4 like the 47mm.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9scgk5x4hJLTagmWKyQYaX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-training-readiness" alt="Training Readiness widget on the Garmin Fenix 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9scgk5x4hJLTagmWKyQYaX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin gave the Fenix 8 the same quality of AMOLED display as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a>: a thin-bordered, vivid, 1,000-nit circular display with the same 320-ish pixels per inch as most smartwatches. I wouldn't ask for anything more...if the Fenix 8 fell in the same $450–600 range as those watches.</p><p>As it is, most mainstream smartwatches today have jumped to 2,000 nits, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> hit a dazzling 3,000 nits; they're not just visible in direct sunlight but dazzlingly colorful.</p><p>If Garmin was trying to convince MIP-loving Fenix users to adopt AMOLED, this effort feels a bit half-hearted. The Fenix 8 is fully visible in direct sunlight because most data fields and notifications are white text on black; I have no trouble reading it even while wearing sunglasses. But I'd still expect a visual upgrade at this price, as colorful widgets and maps can look foggy in the California sun.</p><p>I'm glad my version of the Fenix 8 uses sapphire glass; Garmin doesn't specify which Gorilla Glass type the stainless steel Fenix 8 gets — I assume GG 3 DX like the Forerunner 965 — but I want assurances that my $1,000+ watch has the best possible protection for worst-case scenarios.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="e2btkgXUAf9EJFtmPkPynX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-bottom-sensors" alt="The bottom of the titanium Garmin Fenix 8, showing the charging port, QuickFit watch band connectors, and etched info about the watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2btkgXUAf9EJFtmPkPynX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I briefly mentioned above, the 47mm titanium Fenix 8 feels slightly heavy until you get used to it. Past Fenix owners won't notice a difference, as 73g with strap compares favorably against other premium, metal-heavy watches. But I've been spoiled by the Garmin Venu 3 (47g) and Forerunner 965 (53g), which have steel bezels but much lighter polymer cases.</p><p>In spite of that, the Fenix 8 has become supremely comfortable to me, thanks in part to the default QuickFit silicone strap that secures it comfortably for runs without needing to be too tight. Despite my promise to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">"never wear a smartwatch to bed again"</a> because of how uncomfortable I find them at night, I've worn the Fenix 8 to sleep for three weeks in my quest to get my first-ever HRV Status score without it feeling oppressive. For me, that's a big deal!</p><p>If I upgraded to the 51mm, I think the Fenix 8 would tip over into being too heavy for me, <em>especially</em> if I bought the stainless steel version. No one should wear a 102g watch unless they're a Dragonball Z character ready to shed weighed clothes to raise their power level.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oUbG3VJHWr9MEx7yJFcUcJ" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-hike-activity" alt="A hiking activity showing elevation, distance, time, and direction on the Garmin Fenix 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oUbG3VJHWr9MEx7yJFcUcJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ignoring the comfort factor, this is a rugged and attractive design if you're a fan of traditional fitness watches and don't mind that it's a bit thick, even on larger wrists. With 10ATM water resistance, 40m diving certification, and military-grade shock protection, it matches the ruggedness of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a> without looking as bulky.</p><p>Its five dive-resistant buttons use Garmin's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/dive-science/builtfordiving/buttons/">"inductive button"</a> design without traditional holes that could become water-damaged during dives. They feel different from my usual full-press Garmin buttons, with an interesting haptic buzz to signal a successful press and an intentional feeling of <em>squishiness</em> so you can press as hard or lightly as you want. While you can use the touchscreen for most things, I love having the Up/Down buttons — which I miss on the casual Venu series.</p><p>So far, my Fenix 8 has withstood salt-water swims and a few slams into walls, but I haven't really tested its ruggedness to the limit; frankly, I assume that even if the Fenix 8 <em>can</em> handle scratches and impacts, its titanium frame will probably show damage more than the Instinct 2X's polymer would, so I'm careful with it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jUNVoitpCtXTVbsvFDP6oX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-voice-assistant" alt="The Garmin Fenix 8 showing "Listening" for the new voice assistant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jUNVoitpCtXTVbsvFDP6oX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Garmin Fenix 8 borrowed two key features from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> I've reviewed before: a mic/speaker combo from the Venu 3 and a built-in LED flashlight from the Instinct 2X Solar. Add in the familiar AMOLED display, and it's clear the Fenix 8 is designed to combine all this hardware into one package.</p><p>My original thoughts on the Venu 3 mic & speaker apply here: The mic quality is crystal clear for Bluetooth calls, but the speaker is on the quiet side for hearing responses, especially when out and about. Garmin's version remains a bit underwhelming compared to the speaker quality on an Apple or Galaxy Watch.</p><p>While the Venu 3 used its mic for passthrough voice commands to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> or iPhone, the Fenix 8 has a new offline voice assistant that lets you open watch apps, start a workout, open Garmin Pay, ask about a specific stat, and so on. It's very useful when it works, but I've noticed two common problems. First, the processing time takes a few seconds, so it's often better to use button/watch face shortcuts instead. Secondly, the assistant doesn't recognize all of my commands and will just spit me back out to the main watch face if it doesn't.</p><p>The other new mic-enabled feature is Voice Notes, a standard Recorder app that saves your thoughts on your watch. I like that it's there, but it'd be even better if you could manually or auto-sync your notes to your phone and potentially associate a note with a workout so you could go back and listen to a summary of how it felt or something cool you saw during it, like a workout diary.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="KfzQt4nrHePNEf59bYqpKQ" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-track-summary-flashlight" alt="A track run summary on the Garmin Fenix 8, with the built-in LED flashlight on and visible and the intensity menu shown on the side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfzQt4nrHePNEf59bYqpKQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin's built-in LED bulb sits directly between the display top and where the band stops, so if you turn it on, you hold your wrist straight to point the light forward. It has three levels of brightness for the default white bulb or one dull red setting for illuminating without being blinding. You can set different Strobe settings, like Blink or Beacon, if you want to signal your location while running in the dark or after falling and hurting yourself.</p><p>As with the Instinct 2X Solar flashlight, the Fenix 8 flashlight is very nice for emergencies or for subtly lighting up a room at night if you can't find your phone, but it's not a great alternative to an actual flashlight for night workouts. It's not bright enough to illuminate more than a small strip directly in front of you; it requires you to hold your arm at a rigid angle to angle the light in front of you, and it burns through the Fenix's epic battery painfully fast. I'm glad it's there, but I've tempered my expectations for what I can do with it.</p>

<p>Looking more generally at the Garmin Fenix 8 hardware, it's hard to say what kind of processing power or memory it has because Garmin doesn't advertise that data; it must be faster than other Garmin watches to handle the new UI and apps, but it hasn't stopped the watch from maintaining the brand's trademark efficiency. Still, I notice some occasional lag in menus, especially when using maps.</p><p>Outside of a buggy first charge cycle where it died in two days, my Fenix 8 AMOLED has remained on pace to last the full 16-day estimate, even with daily sleep tracking and frequent dual-band GPS runs and hikes<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-i-learned-running-20-mile-race-wearing-four-watches"></a>. I can't understate how impressive the battery life is; some fitness bands might <em>claim</em> multiple weeks, but fall short in practical use cases. Not the Fenix 8.</p><p>Garmin gave the Fenix 8 the Elevate v5 sensor suite, which includes an ECG sensor and skin temperature data on top of the standard heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen (SpO2). Garmin doesn't have passive heart rhythm tracking like the big-name brands, but the ECG inclusion is a nice start for anyone with heart health issues. And Garmin continues to be the only watch option for all-day blood oxygen tracking if that appeals to you.</p><p>The one bit of hardware the Garmin Fenix 8 lacks but <em>should</em> have is some kind of 4G LTE support, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-lte-review">Forerunner 945 LTE</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids">Garmin Bounce LTE</a>. Anything that costs this much should have standalone capabilities, either to make emergency phone calls or broadcast your LiveTrack position to family while you're out on a multi-day excursion. Garmin would rather you buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-inreach-messenger-plus-announced">InReach Messenger Plus</a> and pay a monthly premium for satellite, but that's not a reasonable wish for a lot of people.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NbSHsnAzJWRHg2hNnZfHMQ" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-track-run-new-UI" alt="Starting a new track run activity on the Garmin Fenix 8.

<p>The Fenix 8 is my first "high-end" Garmin watch, so I can't compare its UI to past models; all I can say is that it seems to be a revamped and improved version of the upgraded interface introduced on the Garmin Venu 3.</p><p>Apps and settings used to be shunted off in hard-to-find submenus. Now, there are more apps available, all found in the main Start menu or by holding the Back button for recent apps. When you're about to start a workout, Garmin now shows workouts, courses, and settings directly under the start screen instead of hidden behind button presses. And the main widgets seem to have added more in-depth data on the watch, instead of making you look in Garmin Connect.</p><p>Of course, when I say "apps," I mean standard tools you'd expect on a fitness watch. Garmin is better than most by supporting a few third-party apps like Spotify and Komoot through the Connect IQ store, but by and large, you won't see the level of smarts of a Wear OS or Apple Watch. It's the trade-off for excellent battery life.</p><p>The Garmin Fenix 8 launch was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/outdoor-recreation/outdoor-recreation/f/fenix-8-series/382626/fenix-8-list-of-software-issues">particularly buggy</a>; it received media attention for crashing in cold water (despite being dive-certified), but had plenty of other issues. I myself had the Fenix 8 freeze after a workout and require a computer reboot.</p><p>Now Garmin is working on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/beta-program/fenix-8-series/f/announcements/390538/beta-version-12-15---available-ota---phased-rollout">new Fenix 8 beta version</a> with nearly 100 "fixed" or "improved" features, along with about 20 new ones. I've never seen a Garmin update changelog that big before, and it goes to show that Garmin is compensating for its rushed-to-market Fenix 8 software. In theory, though, these fixes should make the Fenix 8 experience even better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="htkG5ZCF9d6bJ8yEWNGN4R" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-training-status" alt="A post-run training status summary showing the current VO2 Max, acute load, and recovery time on the Garmin Fenix 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/htkG5ZCF9d6bJ8yEWNGN4R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm not going to dwell too much on Garmin's core training software, simply because about 80% of the Fenix 8's training tools can be found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> for $500 less, particularly the workouts and metrics for running, cycling, hiking, swimming, and multisport, plus golfing and maps to an extent.</p><p>I gave the Forerunner 965 a 5-star review, and the Fenix 8 is just as fantastic for athletes, without holding any features back. There's a reason why I keep returning to Garmin when I have a whole array of other watch brands in my closet, from COROS and Polar to Apple and Samsung. Garmin watches have helped me <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watc">become a better runner</a> with suggested workouts and training load focus, track my progress at hill training, and avoid overtraining with recovery estimates.</p><p>The tricky thing with the Fenix 8 is that most of its exclusive software is incredibly niche. Do you need 2,000 pre-downloaded ski maps? A surf activity to auto-record the number of waves surfed? Tracking your gases and the tides for scuba diving? The option to pay even more for Outdoor Maps+ satellite imagery on your wrist?</p><p>If the answer is yes and you have a vacation home in Tahoe or a regular surfing spot near your home in Santa Cruz, then you probably have the money to buy the Fenix 8 and not worry much about the high cost. For everyone else, be honest with yourself: You don't <em>need</em> the Fenix 8 software or the 16-day battery life. You're probably just paying top dollar because of some combination of FOMO and wanting a titanium status symbol.</p>

<p>The one new Garmin Fenix 8 feature that I think will have broad appeal is the new Strength Training tool. In the same way you can build a running or cycling training plan based on your current fitness level and goals, you can now build a weeks-long plan that takes into account your current abilities and whether or not you have access to gym equipment.</p><p>I myself wrote about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">Garmin needed to make its indoor workouts better</a>, so this feature excited me. Having tested it out, it's a bit overwhelming for a layman. The generated workouts are truly fully-fledged workouts, starting with cardio and stretches before extending into various dumbbell activities focused on a broad range of muscles for push, pull, and leg days.</p><p>If you already have a gym routine, then this advanced, auto-generated strength training will slot right in. But given how ubiquitous Garmin Coach is across all of its watches and that the plans are generated on your phone, I have to assume that these strength workouts will eventually come to new Garmin watches at more reasonable price points. Fenix 8 owners are just paying for early access.</p>

<p>The Garmin Fenix 8 has a major focus on maps, but I don't have an Outdoor Maps+ subscription and didn't spend that much time using the standard topographical maps for a couple of key reasons.</p><p>Garmin advertises "dynamic round-trip routing" as a new and compelling feature for the Fenix 8, letting you choose a distance and see various routes that will get you back to start within a certain time. But it didn't work well for me when I tried to create a 10-mile route through a local state park. I'd tell it to give me a route north or west into the park, and after a long "calculating" wait, it created three courses that all sent me in the <em>opposite</em> direction through the suburbs.</p><p>So, instead, I decided to follow an AllTrails route for five miles, then try to create a new Back to Start route and see what map it generated. It sat on "Calculating" for a long stretch and then sent me an error message. That's not great!</p><p>One of the beta changelog lines in the upcoming Fenix 8 update is "Fixed Round-Trip Routing from the Map App," so it's possible Garmin will resolve this issue soon. But at present, this high-profile launch tool disappointed me, and I found it easier to create courses in the Connect app instead. And even then, its auto-generated paths in my neighborhood would sometimes send me on limited-access or inaccessible routes.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, Garmin's courses and turn-by-turn navigation are useful if you're the kind of person who pre-downloads GPX maps. Otherwise, you can try dropping waypoints or looking at nearby trailheads mid-activity, but I'd see it as a nice-to-have last resort rather than something you'd want to depend on regularly.</p><p>Why? Because navigating maps on a 1.4-inch watch screen is more trouble than it's worth, especially since the Fenix 8 processor seems somewhat laggy for navigation. By default, you're zoomed in so close that you have little context for what trail you're on or which way you're going; zooming out is quite slow and often takes too long to fill in the blank gaps.</p><p>With time, I'm sure I could master these map features, but I'm not inclined to. I think anyone who wants a proper Garmin map experience should look into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-gpsmap-67i-review">GPSMAP handheld</a> — which itself is hard to master but offers a larger screen and useful buttons — or (for cyclists) an Edge computer. With the Fenix 8, I'm going to stick with the basics.</p>

<p>Garmin gave the Fenix 8 the same multi-band GPS functionality and heart rate sensor as most of its other watches of the past few years. In other words, you can expect a high level of quality but nothing new — which continues to be the theme of this Fenix 8 review.</p><p>I did my due diligence to test their accuracy; some of my results will be pulled from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-gps-and-hr-accuracy-test">COROS PACE Pro fitness test</a> — which used the Fenix 8 as a baseline — and my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-i-learned-running-20-mile-race-wearing-four-watches">recent 20-mile race</a> wearing the Fenix 8 and three other watches.</p>

<p>The three HR charts above show a normal run, a hard track run, and a three-hour race. Outside of one obvious error early in the track run, the results are surprisingly consistent: They're always in close lockstep, but the Fenix 8 is often 1–2 bpm above the COROS HRM, both for increasing and decreasing effort before eventually settling to the correct reading.</p><p>I've noticed an issue on several Forerunner watches, and now the Fenix 8, where the optical HR monitor struggles to capture my exact heart rate if I start a workout and immediately run hard. It needs a couple of minutes to ramp up to high-aerobic and anaerobic levels before it can stay in sync; from that point on, the Elevate sensor is more accurate than almost every competing brand. I simply wish this one issue would be fixed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2176px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.58%;"><img id="73owH5zKbgGE8N7FfwoQBC" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-vs-COROS-HRM-12-miler" alt="A HR chart comparing the Garmin Fenix 8 against the COROS HRM for accuracy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/73owH5zKbgGE8N7FfwoQBC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2176" height="1166" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another 12-mile run shows similar results: the Fenix 8 is almost always 1 bpm above the heart rate monitor but ends up with the correct average and max heart rate. That also applies to my three-hour race and any other "normal" run I've done; only the track workout's average was skewed by the initial glitch.</p><p>Basically, I wouldn't feel the need to wear an external HR monitor with the Fenix 8 with results this consistent; many other popular running watches wouldn't get the same seal of approval.</p><p>As for GPS accuracy, I usually use Garmin watches as the <em>control group</em> for these kinds of tests because they consistently do the best of any brand. The Fenix 8 mostly lives up to that standard: You can see in the screenshots below of my 20-mile race how it sticks to the trail, barring a couple of noticeable exceptions where I'm parallel to bridges but slightly out in the water. Garmin's distance total beat the other three watches I was wearing for accuracy.</p>

<p>In another pair of city runs with both Garmin and COROS watches, it was a surprisingly mixed bag for the Fenix 8. In some instances, Garmin was the better option, sticking to the path while COROS drifted; in others, the reverse held true, as Garmin showed a tendency to map me more to the left of my actual position, shoving me into streets and lawns. But in both instances, they ended up with near-identical distance totals; the deviations barely mattered from a training load perspective.</p>

<p>In the end, the Garmin Fenix 8 does as well as other multi-band Garmin watches I've tested, with good enough accuracy for serious runners that beats most other dual-band GPS watches. My only problem is that you can get a similar level of accuracy with any of the Forerunners in the $350–600 range, with the same corrective algorithm to try and clean up any bad tracking.</p>

<p>If you haven't guessed yet, my picks for the best-competing options for the Fenix 8 are the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a>. If the Garmin Fenix 8 is a fusion of the Forerunner 965's training tools and AMOLED display, the Venu 3's UI and mic/speaker, and the Instinct 2X Solar's battery life and flashlight, then you have to decide if you need all of these tools or can make do with one specialized option that costs less than half as much but falls short in looks, battery life, and extreme-sport features.</p><p>Otherwise, anyone looking for a premium smartwatch that's better for apps but does well enough for fitness should consider the Apple Watch Ultra 2 or Galaxy Watch Ultra. The Fenix 8 obliterates them for battery life — you'll have to charge them every two or three days — but these watches have better displays, equally rugged designs, better voice assistant commands and phone integration, and surprisingly solid fitness tools for casual users.</p><p>Anyone interested in the Fenix 8 MIP Solar should consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-announced-with-46-day-battery">COROS VERTIX 2S</a>, which has no recharging capabilities but still lasts 36 days per charge, has a rugged design and COROS' patented training tools, and held its own in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">VERTIX 2S accuracy test</a> against Garmin and Polar. I considered it too expensive at $699, but that'll save you $500 compared to the 51mm Fenix 8 Solar.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Garmin Fenix 8 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're a serious self-guided athlete that needs useful training insights and mid-workout guidance.</li><li>You have enough disposable income to afford the best-possible Garmin watch.</li><li>You need specialized fitness software but don't want a specific model like the Approach (Golf), Quatix (Boating), or Descent (Diving).</li><li>You want excellent battery life, but still prefer a stylish design to pure longevity with the Garmin Enduro 3.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy the Garmin Fenix 8 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You can't afford it or you're used to "traditional" smartwatches; either way, try a cheaper Garmin model first.</li><li>You'd miss the smarts of an Apple Watch or Wear OS watch.</li><li>You're expecting many new, game-changing features over the Fenix 7 series.</li></ul>
<p>Unlike Apple and Samsung, Garmin isn't known for its trade-in deals. When the Fenix 9 arrives in a couple of years with new features that the Fenix 8 may or may not get, you'll have to resell it for yourself — or else accept the Fenix 8 as your primary watch for years to come to justify the cost.</p><p>Now that Garmin has worked through a lot of the launch issues, the Fenix 8 is a fantastic smartwatch. But I called it a "Frankenstein's watch" for a reason: Garmin sewed in new features from other watches like the flashlight, mic/speaker, and (on the MIP version) a more efficient solar panel, creating a hodgepodge of tools in a long-lived, attractive watch that doesn't really have a signature feature to call its own.</p><p>I don't think I need the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-leak-suggests-fenix-8-microled-watch-coming-but-reasons-for-skepticism">Garmin Fenix 8 MicroLED</a> that'll make the normal Fenix 8 look cheap; I just wish Garmin had given this version a brighter display, louder speaker, cellular support, or <em>anything</em> to make it feel more like a standout instead of a "greatest Garmin hits" album.</p><p>To get the most out of the Fenix 8, I can't <em>just</em> be a runner; I have to start cross-training more with cycling, hiking, and strength training, learn how to ski again, and maybe take some scuba lessons. Truly, this is an "adventurer's watch," and I don't think I could personally justify spending $1,100 on one, no matter how great it is. If <em>you</em> can justify it, then you're <em>really</em> going to love this watch.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's Chrome and Android dominance could be shattered by US legal action. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-18/doj-will-push-google-to-sell-off-chrome-to-break-search-monopoly" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> reports that the Department of Justice wants to force the tech giant to sell off Chrome after presiding judge Amit Mehta ruled Google's search monopoly is illegal.</p><p>Back in August, Judge Mehta issued a landmark decision, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">ruling that Google broke Section 2 of the Sherman Act</a>. This part of the law is in place to keep things fair and ban any shady moves to grab total control of a market.</p><p>After the ruling, speculation took off about what the DOJ might do next, with many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-be-forced-to-split-up-chrome-and-android-over-antitrust-concerns">thinking a Google breakup could be on the table</a>.</p><p>A recent Bloomberg report says the DOJ plans to ask Judge Mehta to make Google sell off parts of its business, including the Chrome browser. U.S. lawyers are also pushing for rules on data licensing.</p><p>As the world's go-to web browser, Chrome has been a powerhouse for promoting Google’s ecosystem. But government lawyers claim it’s boxed out competition by shrinking options and stifling rival incentives.</p><p>Antitrust officials are reportedly looking to shake things up by splitting Android from Google Search and Play without forcing a sell-off. They’re also pushing for Google to share more data with advertisers and let them call more shots on ad placements.</p><p>Google poured a ton of time and cash into locking down exclusive deals with companies like Apple, keeping its spot as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">top web browser</a> on mobile and desktop. These deals made it tough for rivals like Microsoft’s Bing to grab a decent slice of the search market.</p><p>Google’s dominance has given a huge boost to its ad business and let the company harness search power in AI products like Gemini. On top of that, officials are planning to suggest that Google give websites more control over how their content is used in its AI products, as per the report.</p><p>Officials are also planning to propose a ban on exclusive contracts. On the search front, they’re suggesting either selling “click and query” data or allowing search results to be syndicated independently. At the moment, Google has pretty strict rules on syndicating results, especially on mobile.</p><p>If Judge Mehta gives the green light to the DOJ’s proposals, it could seriously change the way the internet, search, and even AI work.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google for a comment and will update once we hear back. Meanwhile, Google’s VP of Regulatory Affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland, told Bloomberg that the DOJ's proposed fixes are "a radical agenda" that goes way beyond the legal issues at hand.</p><p>"The government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed," Mulholland said in a statement.</p>

This year though, the brand changed up its strategy with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-review">ROG Phone 8 Pro</a>, overhauling the design to make the device look a little mainstream without too much overt styling.</p><p>That seems to have made a difference, with ASUS noting that the ROG Phone 8 saw a decent 15% increase in sales during the initial six months of availability versus the ROG Phone 7. Interestingly, the brand said that it was the Pro model that drove a bulk of the sales (66%), a threefold increase over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-7-ultimate-review">ROG Phone 7 Ultimate</a>. Sure, these phones don&apos;t sell anywhere in the same volume as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24</a>, but there is a growing demand for phones that deliver the absolute best performance, and ASUS is ideally positioned to take advantage.</p><p>With the ROG Phone 9, ASUS is continuing that momentum while delivering timely upgrades. The phone uses a similar foundation as its predecessor — the design is nearly identical — but you get Qualcomm&apos;s latest silicon, a new 50MP camera at the back that takes much better photos, and a bigger 5800mAh battery.</p><p>The rest of the features are the same, and that&apos;s a good thing; there wasn&apos;t a whole lot wrong with the ROG Phone 8 Pro to begin with. The result is that the ROG Phone 9 Pro is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">best gaming phone</a> you can buy today, but it goes beyond that — this is a great all-rounder if you want clean software and the best performance available today.</p>

<p>ASUS unveiled the ROG Phone 9 series on November 19, and the phones are now up for pre-order. There are two models in the series — the ROG Phone 9 Pro and the regular ROG Phone 9 — and the main difference is that the Pro model has a a 32MP 3x telephoto lens this time, and you get an Anime Vision panel at the back with higher LED density.</p><p>Both phones are available in various storage configurations, and the 16GB/512GB variant of the ROG Phone 9 Pro costs $1,199 in the U.S. and €1,299 in most European countries. There&apos;s a higher-end model dubbed the ROG Phone 9 Pro Edition, and this comes with 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, and you get more accessories bundled, including two phone cases and the AeroActive X Cooler Pro attachment. This variant costs $1,499/€1,499.</p><p>ASUS is rolling out a 12GB/512GB model in Europe, and it will cost €1,149. This configuration isn&apos;t launching in the U.S., and although ASUS didn&apos;t share any additional information, it should make its way to other global markets. The regular ROG Phone 9 is available with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and it costs $999 in the U.S. and €1,099 in most western markets.</p><p>As for availability, the ROG Phone 9 series is going on sale in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China starting November 20. The devices are up for pre-order in the U.K. and other European markets, with deliveries starting in December. Both phones will be available in the U.S. in January 2025, and will make their way to other global markets sometime in Q1 2025.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-rog-phone-9-pro-design"><span>ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5imQbP893a9LmBQrLgmFCk" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-29.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5imQbP893a9LmBQrLgmFCk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS didn&apos;t change the design to a noticeable degree with the ROG Phone 9, with the device continuing with the same overall aesthetic as the Phone 8 Pro. That means you get a giant slab of a phone with a glass back and a silky crystalized nano-texture, and a few etched lines that highlight the device&apos;s gaming roots.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UrTzWsJ5YUzX52DkAQSK2f" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-5.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UrTzWsJ5YUzX52DkAQSK2f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera island is identical as well, but there&apos;s now a distinctive red line that runs just beneath it, giving the device a little visual flair. The ROG Phone 9 Pro has flat sides with beveled edges that make it comfortable to hold and use, and as always, ASUS nailed the weight distribution. While the ROG Phone 9 Pro is big and bulky — it weighs 227g — you don&apos;t feel the heft that much. The regular ROG Phone 9 comes in Storm White and Phantom Black variants, but the Pro model is limited to the black version.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SHSaafGrLuBAahug277BGg" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-8.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SHSaafGrLuBAahug277BGg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While ASUS toned down the design flair, there are a few things that differentiate the ROG Phone 9 Pro from regular phones. The obvious feature is Anime Vision, a secondary panel at the back that&apos;s made up of LEDs. This time, ASUS added a second panel at the back of the regular model as well, albeit with 85 LEDs versus 648 LEDs on the Pro model. The panel is unquestionably cool, and it comes with white and red LEDs on the Pro variant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bD9dPrzxbbsXs4WryDiTy" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-30.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bD9dPrzxbbsXs4WryDiTy.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like the best is that you can actually play games on the back panel, with ASUS recreating facsimiles of classic titles. You use the ultrasonic AirTriggers to control the action, and if you grew up playing these kinds of games (like I did), it&apos;s plenty of fun — I&apos;ll admit that I wasted entirely too much time playing the four bundled games. Because of the limited nature of the LEDs on the standard model, this Anime Play feature is limited to the ROG Phone 9 Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7XttXp7GFrVBPqPfazikvd" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-3.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7XttXp7GFrVBPqPfazikvd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like previous years, the screen at the back is extensively customizable, and you can add your own text, images, and just about anything at the back. There&apos;s also an ROG Together option that unlocks additional visuals when two ROG Phone 9 units come into contact, and it&apos;s pretty cool.</p>

<p>There are other niceties; the ultrasonic AirTriggers continue to be great, and while they&apos;re useful during gaming, it&apos;s the customizability in day-to-day tasks that makes the feature stand out in my own usage. You can use short and long squeezes gestures with the AirTriggers to launch Gemini, toggle the flashlight, enable DND, launch the camera, and so much more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sHzydehPitDwHTDTUcK7xf" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-13.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sHzydehPitDwHTDTUcK7xf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rest of the design is pretty standard; you get the power and volume buttons on the right, and they have good tactility. The USB-C port is at the bottom, and like previous years, it sits to the left, with the SIM card tray located in the middle. The 3.5mm jack is thankfully intact, and the onboard sound continues to be excellent. ASUS notes that eSIM is only available in Taiwan and Japan, and while the feature will come to other countries, that will only be with the next model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="x2aWGzGgHVHFhdUKbX4aXf" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-10.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x2aWGzGgHVHFhdUKbX4aXf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notably, the side-mounted USB-C port is retained, and this is how the brand&apos;s AeroActive cooling solution connects to the device. You get IP68 dust and water resistance as well; you don&apos;t usually get ingress protection with gaming phones, so it&apos;s good to see ASUS offer this.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-rog-phone-9-pro-screen"><span>ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro: Screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gVbrECoGWjRvEATfbD3eXg" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-16.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gVbrECoGWjRvEATfbD3eXg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS is sticking to the same 6.78-inch Samsung AMOLED panel that debuted on the ROG Phone 8, and it goes up to 2500 nits maximum and 1600 nits in HBM mode. You get Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection as standard.</p>
<p>Similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, the panel gets LTPO tech to dynamically adjust the refresh according to on-screen content, and it makes a noticeable difference. What gives the device a distinct edge is that it has 165Hz refresh rate instead of the usual 120Hz on most devices, and the result is that the ROG Phone 9 Pro feels unmistakably fluid even next to the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">Vivo X100 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to onboard audio, you get what is arguably one of the best packages available today. The ROG Phone 9 Pro retains the 3.5mm jack, and the internal DAC is decent enough that you don&apos;t need a standalone unit if you want to use IEMs with the phone. There&apos;s also AptX Lossless and the entire suite of Qualcomm&apos;s codecs, and the onboard sound is once again tuned by Dirac, and it is noticeably better than most devices.</p>
<p>As you&apos;d imagine, picture quality is terrific, and the phone comes alive during gaming. Colors are vibrant and saturated, and you get a decent eye protection mode that shifts to warmer hues at night. There&apos;s a 185Hz mode as well, but that&apos;s limited to games, and can be unlocked within Game Genie.</p>

<p>I had no issues playing games or streaming content on the ROG Phone 9 Pro; the phone handled HDR content well, and there were no issues with brightness levels even under harsh sunlight. While the panel itself hasn&apos;t changed, it still has a lot going for it, and it absolutely delivers at gaming.</p>

<p>I get to use a lot of phones over the course of a year, and while most phones share the same Qualcomm hardware these days, no manufacturer does as good a job optimizing the hardware as ASUS. Both models in the ROG Phone 9 series feature Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, and it is a powerhouse that&apos;s on a whole new level.</p><p>Clearly, Qualcomm made a lot of tweaks with this generation, and even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> is plenty fast in its own right, you get huge gains on the Elite. Obviously, the difference is more noticeable when running synthetic workloads, with both the ROG Phone 9 Pro and the standard model posting the highest scores out of any phone I tested.</p>

<p>There&apos;s absolutely no lag or stutter in the two weeks I used either device, and if anything, the interface is the most fluid — ASUS knows what it&apos;s doing in this regard. What&apos;s interesting is that ASUS once again has a higher thermal threshold than other brands, and as a result, the ROG Phone 9 Pro went up to a scorching 52 degrees Celsius during 3DMark&apos;s Steel Nomad Light stress test with X Mode enabled. The standard model got even hotter at 53 degrees, and at that point, both devices were so hot that it wasn&apos;t possible to touch the mid-frame, much less use the phones in-hand.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sY6kiVR78cXLdFedpGrech" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-19.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sY6kiVR78cXLdFedpGrech.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The side effect of unrestricted thermals is that the ROG Phone 9 Pro has a nearly-flawless 99.2% score in the demanding 3DMark stress test, but again, you&apos;re not able to hold the device, so the scores are just for bragging rights. Also, this isn&apos;t anything new — earlier ASUS gaming devices also got just as hot.</p><p>Thankfully, this isn&apos;t as big an issue in day-to-day gaming sessions; while the device still gets hot — more so than other high-end phones — it doesn&apos;t get to a point where it&apos;s unbearable to hold, and if you switch to the Dynamic mode, you get much better thermal efficiency.</p><p>What all of this means is that in real-world use, the ROG Phone 9 Pro is the best device if you care about mobile gaming. I got much better framerates in demanding titles even with extended gaming sessions, and there was no lag whatsoever. ASUS deserves credit for allowing 120fps gaming across a multitude of titles — much more so than any other brand.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wRDu5LiL5rgmVYh2dNtfRk" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-25.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wRDu5LiL5rgmVYh2dNtfRk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the ultrasonic AirTriggers aren&apos;t new, they provide an additional dimension of immersion in most games, and they&apos;re easy to set up and use. You get LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage on both devices, with the standard model going up to 16GB/512GB and the Pro model hitting 24GB/1TB — this is the variant I&apos;m using.</p><p>One of the reasons I like using ASUS devices is that the manufacturer uses the full suite of features that Qualcomm has to offer — this isn&apos;t the case with most brands. As such, you get great connectivity, and all the AptX codecs. I didn&apos;t see any issues whatsoever with connectivity or while making calls, and the device excels at the basics. The vibration motor is better this time around, and it has better feedback in regular use.</p><p>Overall, the ROG Phone 9 Pro is the fastest phone money can buy today, and while other devices powered by the same hardware are set to launch imminently, they&apos;ll be thermally constrained.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wZhovcsWZ5yTpse8GfZ9h" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-34.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wZhovcsWZ5yTpse8GfZ9h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS always rolled out exciting accessories with its gaming phones, and that&apos;s no different with the ROG Phone 9 Pro. The high-end model comes with the new AeroActive Cooler X Pro bundled in the package, and it makes a huge difference while gaming. The key difference between the Cooler X Pro and the standard Cooler X is that it now has a built-in subwoofer, delivering much better sound with a detailed low-end.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XxZiRtWrPgbwvDaPXRkz2n" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-36.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XxZiRtWrPgbwvDaPXRkz2n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get a 3.5mm out and USB-C port at the bottom, and there&apos;s customizable RGB lighting — obviously. There&apos;s a bigger fan this time around, and it does a great job ensuring the phone doesn&apos;t get too hot. And to round out the features, you get a kickstand as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XmofLciDasVxAneTPUMGYn" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-37.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XmofLciDasVxAneTPUMGYn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cooler is rather bulky, but it makes a difference during extended gaming sessions, and that&apos;s when you&apos;ll actually need it. The device doesn&apos;t get anywhere as hot in regular use or short gaming bursts, and if you enable Dynamic mode, you shouldn&apos;t see any issues with thermal management.</p>
<p>ASUS has the Tessen mobile controller as well, and it is a regular mobile gaming controller that can be used with any phone — just like GameSir&apos;s Galileo G8 Plus. I haven&apos;t used the controller as much, but it is decent enough in its own right, and I like that it has a foldable design.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5VXfKZYpD9a6A9HaepkvSe" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-2.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5VXfKZYpD9a6A9HaepkvSe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS is increasing the battery size with this generation, and the ROG Phone 9 Pro comes with a 5800mAh battery — 300mAh bigger than its predecessor. You get the same 65W charging tech over the USB PD standard, and there is a charger bundled in the package with both phones.</p><p>I got over a day&apos;s worth of use consistently with the device even with heavy use, but it doesn&apos;t last a day and a half like some devices I used this year. That said, the phone is the most powerful I&apos;ve used to date, so the fact that it actually lasts an entire day is a big deal in and of itself.</p><p>ASUS offers scheduled charging, steady charging — where the phone charges at a slower wattage — and charging limit as standard, and these features aren&apos;t new either. With charging limit, you can set the battery to not charge beyond 80% or 90%, extending its longevity.</p><p>While some brands are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">going with silicon-carbon tech</a> in 2025, ASUS is using the traditional dual-cell system. However, you get additional features to extend battery longevity, and that makes a difference.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-rog-phone-9-pro-cameras"><span>ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eQxi4vx43oFZvyGu4EYe7h" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-7.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eQxi4vx43oFZvyGu4EYe7h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Imaging has always been an afterthought on gaming phones, but ASUS is looking to change that narrative. The ROG Phone 9 Pro comes with an upgraded 50MP Sony Lytia 700 camera module, and it does a much better job than the IMX890 that was featured in the ROG Phone 8 Pro.</p><p>The phone gets a 32MP zoom lens with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and a 13MP wide-angle lens with autofocus. ASUS does a great job with its 6-axis gimbal stabilization tech, and when combined with the new camera sensor, there is a noticeable difference versus previous generations. A nice addition this time is Photo Vibe, which basically allows you to pick a tonal balance for your shots. There are four choices available — Gentle Cool, Vivid Cool, Soft & Warm, and Rich & Warm — and the colors change quite drastically between modes.</p><p>Physical shutter controls are cool again — mostly because of the iPhone 16 Pro Max — and while I didn&apos;t get much use out of the button, other phones are getting in on the action. ASUS is using the right-mounted AirTrigger as a shutter button, and you can use it to take photos.</p>

<p>Shots taken in daylight have a good amount of detail and white balance, and there are no issues in general. The tuning algorithm tends to be a bit aggressive with smoothening details like foliage, but outside of that, you get detailed shots. Like the ROG Phone 8 Pro, the wide-angle lens is strictly average, and it doesn&apos;t quite manage to deliver the same color balance as the main lens. The issue is even more evident in low-light scenarios, and you get visible noise.</p><p>While it isn&apos;t as effortless to shoot as other flagships, you get decent shots in challenging situations out of the ROG Phone 9 Pro. The main camera is good enough this time that you don&apos;t feel constrained in this area, and there are noticeable gains over previous years.</p><p>That said, the phone is still at the same level as a mid-ranger in this regard, and it doesn&apos;t quite measure up to the camera-focused devices available today. If you see yourself taking a lot of photos, you should just wait until the Vivo X200 Pro or Find X8 launch globally, but if you just need usable cameras that deliver good enough shots, the ROG Phone 9 Pro gets the job done.</p>

<p>The ROG Phone 9 Pro runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and as is the case with every single phone, you get a suite of AI features. There&apos;s AI-assisted call translation, notes transcribing, image generation, and semantic search, and what&apos;s interesting is that they&apos;re all powered on-device — no data is sent to the cloud. The only service that relies on a signal is Circle to Search, but that&apos;s a given anyway.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UmVtaQgH7aHAn3A8VJsAGn" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-38.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UmVtaQgH7aHAn3A8VJsAGn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUS has an AI-assisted utility dubbed X Sense 3.0 that allows you to automate mundane tasks in games, including collecting loot and upgrading skills. There&apos;s AI-backed noise isolation as well, and it does a decent enough job. While not reliant on machine learning, the volume splitter option allows you to change the volume level of an individual game, so if you&apos;re multitasking or using picture-in-picture, this feature is definitely handy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C2LpU96bmHS9V5Fb346XXm" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-35.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C2LpU96bmHS9V5Fb346XXm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have no issues with the software of the ROG Phone 9 Pro in daily use. The interface is as close to vanilla Android as you&apos;ll get on any device, and that alone is worthy of celebration these days. ASUS did a magnificent job (as always) tailoring the software to take advantage of the powerful hardware, and the UI is smooth on a level you just don&apos;t get with other phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uUyovdDUPBqAwZfnm7BWGm" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-33.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uUyovdDUPBqAwZfnm7BWGm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s extensive customizability as well, and there&apos;s even a back tap gesture that lets you pull down the notification shade or toggle the flashlight without having to interact with the phone. In short, there&apos;s a lot to like about the interface itself, and it&apos;s great to see ASUS continue to offer a clean UI without any bloatware.</p><p>Software updates continue to be a point of contention, and while the ROG Phone 9 Pro will get five years of security updates, it will only pick up two platform updates. As I&apos;ve said several times in these reviews, two updates just aren&apos;t adequate any longer, and with budget phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a> getting three updates, it doesn&apos;t make sense that a $1,499 device is limited to two Android OS updates, particularly when Google is starting to roll out these updates sooner.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-rog-phone-9-pro-the-alternatives"><span>ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro: The alternatives</span></h2>

<p>The ROG Phone 8 Pro is still a great choice, and with the introduction of the ROG Phone 9 Pro, the older device should get decent discounts. You don&apos;t get the absolute best hardware or the biggest battery, but the phone is just as performant in demanding games, and you get the same software.</p><p>If you need better cameras, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is a good alternative as well. The phone takes better shots, and you still get powerful hardware that&apos;s great for gaming. The software isn&apos;t anywhere as good though, and the interface has overt styling. The upside is that the device is much more affordable.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus-rog-phone-9-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bBpVQ37eSKtfw6imFqoZmm" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-24.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bBpVQ37eSKtfw6imFqoZmm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best gaming phone money can buy</li><li>You need meaningful software extras and a clean UI</li><li>You want a fluidic interface with 165Hz refresh</li><li>You need great battery life</li><li>You want a 3.5mm jack</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a phone that'll get long-term software updates</li><li>You want great cameras</li></ul>
<p>ASUS continues to be the best at optimizing the software, and the ROG Phone 9 Pro is fluid like no other device I used recently. Of course, the 165Hz panel also makes a difference in this regard, as does the upgraded Qualcomm hardware. The new 50MP camera at the back is great too, and while it won&apos;t challenge the Vivo X100 Ultra or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, it is much better than its predecessors, and that&apos;s a notable achievement.</p><p>I like what ASUS does with the software as well; the interface itself is clean and doesn&apos;t have any bloatware, and the brand knows what it&apos;s doing on the optimization front, so you get a fluidic UI. You don&apos;t miss out on anything either — the phone has a 3.5mm jack, IP68 ingress protection, reliable 65W charging over USB PD and 15W wireless charging, and a terrific 165Hz AMOLED panel.</p><p>In short, this is one of the best hardware and software packages you can get today, and if you&apos;re interested in mobile gaming, there really isn&apos;t a better device. Even if you don&apos;t play many games on your phone, the ROG Phone 9 Pro has a lot going for it, and the changes to the cameras makes it an all-rounder. However, like previous years, the fact that you just get two Android OS updates continues to be a deal-breaker, and ASUS really needs to do better.</p><p>There are better phones in the market, but if you need the one with the best performance, the ROG Phone 9 Pro is the one to get — if you don&apos;t mind the middling update guarantee.</p>

<p>Motorola has been gearing up to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> to its smartphone lineup, and a new report indicates the company is adding more devices to the update list, making the rollout even bigger.</p><p>The company hasn’t officially shared its Android 15 roadmap yet, but updated support pages are quietly revealing which of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">beloved Motorola phones</a> will get the upgrade. Seven more devices just made the cut, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/11/15/motorola-confirms-android-15-for-more-devices-complete-list/" target="_blank">Gizmochina</a>.</p><p>The additional handsets getting the Android 15 update include:</p>

<p>Motorola’s support pages have offered a glimpse of its Android 15 plans. Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-edge-50-fusion-gets-android-15-beta">October’s initial list</a>, more models have been added, showing Motorola’s commitment to keeping its devices current.</p><p>The previous list featured 23 phones set for the update, including flagship models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Moto Razr+ (2024)</a>, the standard Razr (2024), and the latest Edge devices.

Samsung’s beta release for One UI 7 is expected soon, so it’s likely Motorola will speed up its Android 15 rollout.</p>

<ul><li>A leak of Samsung’s next budget phone, the Galaxy A26, fully reveals the device's design.</li><li>It will sport an Infinity-U display, likely measuring 6.64 inches, and includes notable bezels with a large chin.</li><li>The sub-$300 phone is expected to carry a “Key Island” design again and be powered by Exynos 1280 SoC.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As we wait for the next flagship Galaxy S25 series early next year, Samsung has a history of releasing its budget phones towards the end of the year to kick things off. These come under the Galaxy A series, and a new leak reveals what to expect from the Galaxy A26 budget phone.</p><p>Tipster Steve Hemmerstoffer, widely known as OnLeaks, has provided CAD-based renders of the Galaxy A26 in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/topic/samsung-galaxy-a26">Android Headlines</a>. The renders showcase the device from all angles, and it largely looks similar to the previous iteration, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-galaxy-a25-launch">Galaxy A25</a>, which comprises a compact form factor. The device is expected to come with a flat display with an old-school water drop notch and flatter sides.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey #FutureSquad! Here comes your very first look at the #Samsung #GalaxyA26 (360° video + gorgeous 5K renders + dimensions)! 😏On behalf of @Androidheadline 👉🏻 https://t.co/5aeKJuYJdp pic.twitter.com/xXnj59lOgV<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1857117722426970395">November 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Since it caters to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" target="_blank">budget Android phone</a> segment of Samsung's lineup, it evidently has significant bezels, with a sizable chin at the bottom. Like its predecessor, the Galaxy A26 will possibly again feature a “Key Island” — an area where volume rockers and power button protrude a bit from the side frame to make users easily spot them instead of lying them flat on the frame.</p><p>The publication also shared other expected specifications, including a 6.64-inch display and the device that will probably measure 164 x 77.5 x 7.7mm (9.7mm with the camera bump. One difference we notice is the camera housing, which is now a singular bar placed vertically on one corner of the phone. This is a change from the current design language, which features three individually-placed camera sensors in a row.</p>

<p>The upcoming Galaxy A26 is believed to be powered by an Exynos 1280 chipset and paired with at least 6GB of RAM. The device is also expected to ship out of the box with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">One UI 7</a>, which could make it one of the first Samsung phones with the update ahead of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> launch.</p><p>If the predecessor’s launch is any indication, we expect the Galaxy A26 and its sibling, the Galaxy A16, to launch sometime in December. The Galaxy A25 was priced at around $299, and the successor is believed to fall in the same price segment.</p>

It's a gallery app, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-google-photos">cloud storage service</a>, and photo editor all-in-one. One of the great things about Google Photos is that it includes a <strong>Memories</strong> feature that automatically turns your photo library into a digital scrapbook. You can relive past experiences, remember trips, and more.</p><p>There's even a dedicated page in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> app for Memories. But what if you don't want to see a certain person or pet in Memories? Luckily, you can curate who shows up in Memories and who doesn't, and this guide will explain how.</p>
<h2 id="how-you-can-remove-people-and-pets-from-memories-2">How you can remove people and pets from Memories</h2>
<p>To prevent unwanted people and pets from showing up in your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-memories-view-rollout">Memories</a>, you can tweak your Google Photos app preferences. You can choose people to <strong>Show less</strong>, which will stop them from individually showing up in your Memories, but may still show them in group photos. Or, you can add people to the <strong>Blocked</strong> list, which will prevent them from showing up in Memories of any kind. Here's how to do it.</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Google Photos app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap your <strong>profile picture</strong> to open up a menu.</p><p>3. Then, press <strong>Photos settings</strong>.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Preferences</strong>.</p><p>5. Next, press <strong>Memories</strong>.</p><p>6. Select <strong>Hide people</strong>.</p>

<p>7. You'll now see a list of all the people you've selected to <strong>Show less</strong> or added to <strong>Blocked</strong>. To add a person to the list, press the <strong>+</strong> button, pick a person, and tap <strong>Done</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:378px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="CJgVoS3VsxwmjtLcNqWoYm" name="Google-Photos-Remove-Block-People" alt="Brady Snyder / Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJgVoS3VsxwmjtLcNqWoYm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="378" height="378" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From then on, any person or pet you add to <strong>Blocked</strong> will no longer appear in Memories. Anyone added to <strong>Show less</strong> will only appear if they're in a group photo with others. You can always edit your <strong>Show less</strong> and <strong>Blocked</strong> list by returning to this page in Photos settings.</p>

<p>Usually, it's fun to be reminded of good memories, but our Google Photos libraries aren't full of good times entirely. They might include photos of an ex-partner, someone you've had a falling out with, or a person or pet that has passed away. That's why Google Photos lets you pick and choose who does (and, more importantly, doesn't) appear in Memories.</p>

<p><em><strong>Anonymous asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I was wondering why phones don't have the same instant-on capabilities that newer laptops and Chromebook do. Is there a good reason? </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Hey there, and thanks for the great question! It's something I've never thought about, but now that I've been paying attention, I can definitely see that some phones seem to take a while to get up and running if they've been powered off.</p><p>The quick and dirty answer for people who aren't interested in all the nuances of what happens when a phone boots up is that your phone is checking the software and file system before you get to use it. On some phones that takes longer than others.</p>

<p>To better understand what's happening, you need to understand how a computer boots up. There are three basic stages: powering, reading, and waiting.</p><p>A phone (which is really just another type of computer) sends power to the components on the main board as step one. There are components that need to power up and "run" their software before your phone can get up and running because they tell your phone how to boot itself. These get started once everything has power applied.</p><p>Some things need to be in place before Android or iOS can start on your phone. The reserved portion of the phone's memory needs to be set up to act as a buffer for video, run the firmware that enables the cellular radio, and then unpack and run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-z-what-kernel">the kernel</a> that tells the hardware how to interact with the software.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Lbt2xbDWvKQ9ovAZvMk9rE" name="google-pixel-9-charging-02.jpg" alt="Charging the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with Google's 45W Pixel charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lbt2xbDWvKQ9ovAZvMk9rE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Furthermore, if your phone's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery" target="_blank">battery ran dead</a> (it's not really dead when your phone says it's dead and shuts off), you might have to wait a few minutes until the battery has enough power to get all the hardware up and running because software plays a big part in charging your battery. It can charge while turned off, but not as efficiently as it does when software is helping regulate the incoming power.</p><p>If you've ever let an iPhone battery run down completely, you know this can take a while to get enough charge then take even longer to boot everything up. Short version: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-high-capacity-power-banks">never let your phone shut off because of a dead battery</a>. Turn it off manually when your battery gets super low and you won't have to deal with this.</p><p>Once the power is applied where it needs to be and the phone knows it has enough power to start the boot sequence, it checks the system software to make sure it's not been tampered with. If your software isn't signed with the right cryptographic key, your phone will not start unless the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-rooting-and-modding">bootloader has been unlocked</a> to allow it.</p><p>If the software checks out, booting begins. Part of the booting process is checking the file structure, creating dynamic symlinks (symbolic links; it's a Unix/Linux thing), and building a pseudo file system (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/proc.html">/proc</a> most of the time) for things like statistics and logs. All of this needs to be in place and working as expected before Android can run on your phone. It's all done automatically, but it takes time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RadYvcffTn6PHo3qtfAEQ6" name="Acer Chromebook" alt="Acer Chromebook on table open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RadYvcffTn6PHo3qtfAEQ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Your phone also needs to do things like connect to a network, load a user profile, allocate memory and resources for services that run at boot, among other small tweaks to get Android itself ready. Many of these things happen simultaneously, but computers really do one task at a time very quickly so it can take some time.</p><p>Once all this is done, your phone is in the waiting state. That's where you unlock your screen and can start using it. It's waiting for input. Some phones can do all of this faster than others, even if they are doing the same basic things.</p>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops">All computers</a> start this way. Some of the steps are different, but computers all need to apply power so booting can start, check that the software is ready, and then wait for your input. There are tricks that can speed this up, and you've probably used them even if you didn't know them, especially on a Windows laptop.</p><p>A PC can store the current state of your computer in a sort of file, then save it to a spot on the memory itself when you're turning it off. Since you're not really killing the power input when you do this, it's ready in an instant when you hit the button and you're right where you left off. This is most likely what happens if you shut the lid on your laptop instead of going through the motions of powering it down.</p><p>Android could do this, but when you consider the size of the battery running everything, you'll know why phone makers don't implement this feature. It'd be exactly the same as letting it sit with the screen off, and it would drain your battery in the same amount of time.</p>
<p>Let's get real for a minute and recognize that this doesn't matter in 2024. Older phones (and other computers. too) did take ages to boot up when you power cycled them, but that's not really the case any longer. Some phones, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Google's Pixels</a>, boot up super fast while others like an iPhone take a little longer but none of them take enough time for it to be a problem.</p><p>It is a neat question, though, because it takes a look at what your phone is doing between the time you press the power button and the time when it asks for your password.</p>

<h2 id="which-retailer-has-the-best-black-friday-samsung-deals-2">Which retailer has the best Black Friday Samsung deals?</h2>
<p>It depends on what you&apos;re looking for! Pretty much every retailer under the sun will be launching holiday sales as we approach Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend, so you&apos;ll want to be vigilant and look around before committing to one retailer (or you could simply bookmark Androidcentral.com for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">comprehensive deal coverage</a>). </p><p>That being said, if you are hoping to buy unlocked Samsung devices, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart will probably be your best bet. If you&apos;re willing to make a trade-in or update your wireless service, consider checking with your phone carrier or Samsung itself to see what offers are available. </p>

<p>One of the biggest surprises we&apos;ve seen this holiday shopping season has been the absolutely outrageous discounts on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch Ultra. These two top-rated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> have only been out since July and yet they&apos;ve already received historic discounts during Amazon&apos;s early Black Friday sale.</p><p>Will the price drop even further as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday? Only time will tell, but I certainly wouldn&apos;t wait to place your order if you&apos;re interested. </p>
<h2 id="when-will-black-friday-sales-start-2">When will Black Friday sales start?</h2>
<p>The Black Friday sales have pretty much already begun. In the coming days, you&apos;ll see retailers across the web launching sales to get shoppers ready for the holiday season — the big question is whether these offers will improve as we near November 29th. Needless to say, if you&apos;re looking for a Samsung deal this holiday season, bookmark this page: I&apos;ll keep updating this guide with new offers as they go live. </p>

<p>Samsung typically runs a big sale during Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend, but the offers on display usually involve a lot of fine print to get the max savings. </p><p>It seems like the site has learned its lesson this year, however, as Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/"><strong>Black Friday deals</strong></a> have never been as good as this. </p><p>The offers I&apos;ve seen so far from the Korean OEM easily rival retailers like Best Buy and Amazon. For example, you can currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-512gb-unlocked-sm-f956udbexaa/"><strong>score $800 off the Galaxy Z Fold 6</strong></a> when you buy the phone unlocked in select colors, while the unlocked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24-ultra/buy/galaxy-s24-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s928ulbfxaa/"><strong>Galaxy S24 Ultra comes with a $300 no-strings discount</strong></a> AND a free storage upgrade with select color variants. Neither of these deals require a trade-in or carrier activation, which is honestly pretty remarkable for Samsung. </p>

<hr>
<p>A Garmin Instinct 3 listing leaked on the company's official Spanish website, on a page estimating repair costs. The listing is for a black Garmin Instinct 3 45mm Solar, but provides no further details.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitness-tracker-test.info/en/garmin-instinct-3-first-information-surfaced-online/">Fitness Tracker Test</a> — which leaked the information — also linked to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GarminWatches/comments/1dvikkr/instinct_3_leaked/">Reddit post</a> from June 2024 sharing an alleged photo of the Instinct 3. Users responded skeptically, suggesting that the design was faked. Since there weren't any Instinct 3 renders on the Garmin page, we can't be sure.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2024/11/17/garmin-instinct-3-release-date/">Gadgets & Wearables</a> also spotted an Instinct 3 reference in Google search results for the official Hungarian Garmin website, with the translated text "Start the new year with a new watch — monitoring your health with care all day. Garmin Instinct 3."</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">Garmin Instinct 2 Solar</a> launched in February 2022, followed by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-crossover-review">Instinct Crossover Solar</a> hybrid in November 2022 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a> in April 2023. Garmin made the 2X Solar. All three used MIP displays with a solar panel overlay to recharge battery life, though the 2X Solar was 50% more efficient than the 2 Solar.</p><p>Since then, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-launches-new-fenix-8-and-enduro-3">Garmin Fenix 8 and Enduro 3</a> have launched with even <em>better</em> solar recharging efficiency, and we can assume the Instinct 3 will have a similar upgrade. While the last generation technically had "unlimited" battery life with a few hours of sunlight per day, the Instinct 3 should have better GPS battery life and require less time in direct sun for the power boost.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7pv3boyRMWE4BZpX9zjHtJ" name="Garmin-Instinct-2X-vs-2-activities.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Instinct 2X Solar and 2 Solar side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7pv3boyRMWE4BZpX9zjHtJ.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Instinct 2 Solar and 2X Solar </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even without any official leaked information, we can surmise that the Garmin Instinct 3 will have 10ATM water resistance and a thick polymer design. Current models have similar software to the Forerunner series like training load, daily suggested workouts, and recovery time, and the Instinct 3 should get newer features.</p><p>Since the Instinct 2X Solar had a built-in flashlight, it's possible Garmin will make that the standard for the Instinct 3 series, too. Likewise, since the Instinct 2X Solar added multi-band GPS over the GPS-only Instinct 2, the Instinct 3 should either have multi-band GPS or all-systems GNSS for better accuracy.</p><p>There was also a recent leak that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/garmin-smartwatches-could-soon-get-support-for-one-of-the-hottest-and-odd-sounding-trends-in-fitness-alongside-the-launch-of-the-instinct-3">Garmin will add a rucking activity</a>, which would be a perfect fit for the rugged Instinct 3 series; I myself recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rucking-workout-fad-is-fun-novelty-but-not-for-everyone">dove into rucking</a> and would appreciate better insights from Garmin about muscular load after tough hikes.</p><p>My guess is that the Instinct 3 will arrive in early 2025, about three years after its predecessor. The 45mm Instinct 2 and 40mm Instinct 2S launched at $399, with a $50 surcharge for solar. I suspect the Instinct 3 will also ship in 40mm and 45mm case sizes for the same prices, with a 50mm version coming later.</p>

<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GarminWatches/comments/1dvikkr/instinct_3_leaked/comments/1dvikkr/instinct_3_leaked">garminwatches</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GarminWatches/comments/1dvikkr/instinct_3_leaked">r/GarminWatches/comments/1dvikkr/instinct_3_leaked</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>I hope the "leaked Instinct 3" photo above is fake because the Instinct 2 display is probably its biggest weak point. Not because it's a low-resolution MIP, but because of its two-window design that cuts off a huge portion of screen real estate to highlight one random metric.</p><p>I'm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">not a fan of MIP displays</a> in general because they're too dim indoors and strain my eyes, but I tolerate them so long as they're big and colorful enough to display information palatably. The monocolor Instinct 2 display may help it achieve an "unlimited" battery, but it also prevents it from showing much information at once or any fun watch faces. That photo above shows another artificially small display slot and low-res text; let's hope the <em>real</em> Instinct 3 is better.</p><p>If Garmin has made its solar panel that much more efficient, then I'd hope it doesn't need to handicap the display that much. Even though MIP seems to be the Instinct series ' trademark, Garmin could even hypothetically release an AMOLED version that's still long-lived and rugged. Either way, I suspect Garmin will still restrict it to breadcrumb navigation, leaving TopoActive maps for the Fenix 8. And that's fine...so long as they give us a little color.</p><p>Assuming Garmin sticks with the same two-windowed MIP display as before, I'm sure Instinct 2 fans will still buy the Instinct 3, but it'll limit its appeal with a lot of athletes.</p>

<p>With a proper display, the Instinct series could fit the graphs and charts you see on other Forerunner and Venu models. But that'll only work with another upgrade to the processor. I've found that Garmin has historically given the Instinct series a slower CPU than the other models — possibly so it's more efficient — and that makes navigating through menus a bit annoying. That's another area where I'd love to see an improvement.</p><p>With a smarter CPU and more than a few megabytes of storage, the Instinct 3 could add music playlists and support for wireless earbuds, in case you want to take advantage of that extra juice and stream playlists on the go. And we can hope for an upgrade from the Elevate v4 sensor suite to the v5, which would give us an ECG and skin temperature readings at night.</p><p>Aside from these reasonable (boring) requests, I don't need <em>too</em> many changes. The Garmin Instinct series is excellent at what it does, and anything fancier is fulfilled by the Enduro 3 or Fenix 8 MIP. But I have one pie-in-the-sky Instinct 3 wish: cellular.</p><p>Not counting its Bounce kids watch, Garmin has only released one cellular watch: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-lte-review">Forerunner 945 LTE</a> in 2021. And maybe that means it didn't sell particularly well, scaring Garmin off? But I think the Forerunner series was the wrong place to start for basic LTE safety functions like live-tracking your location for family members, incident detection, and emergency response. The long-lived Instinct series would be a better fit because of its longevity and ability to counteract battery-guzzling LTE with the solar panel, in case your phone dies and you need help out in the wild!</p><p>I'm skeptical Garmin <em>will</em> give the Instinct 3 series (or any other series) cellular, but I can dream! Otherwise, the Instinct series is already among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> available today; I'll just have to hope the Instinct 3 lives up to the series' historical quality.</p>

<p>Additionally, users can see the number of total minutes they spent on the YouTube Music app listening to their favorites. Alongside the top tracks and artists, users can notice their top albums as well. While the Recap is kind of new to YouTube's streaming platform, its competitor Spotify has had it for a while, dubbed Spotify Wrapped.</p><p>If history is any guide, the latter's summary frequently arrives early. Just after Spotify's Wrapped last year, YouTube Music <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-2023-recap">released its 2023 Recap</a>, which took place in late November 2023. Even though we are in the same month this year, some individuals receiving it ahead of schedule could indicate that YouTube Music will release the Recap early.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the person who received it might have been extremely fortunate, or there might have been a glitch in the streaming service. As more users may receive it in the upcoming weeks, it should become evident.</p><p>Users who want to access their Recap on YouTube Music can either look for the banner, which should appear when the Recap of their music is ready, or navigate to the "Your Recap" section from their My Account page on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming app</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, YouTube and YouTube Music gained <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-and-youtube-music-gain-new-improvements">some nifty improvements</a> through a major update last month. The music streaming service has introduced new Badges, which users can add to their favorite creators.</p><p>Also, both have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-custom-playlist-thumbnails">gained the ability</a> to customize their playlist thumbnails by choosing a photo of their personal choice or relying on Generative AI entirely.</p>
