<ul><li>Disney Plus has launched its paid sharing program in the U.S., letting subscribers add an "Extra Member" to their household account.</li><li>Disney Plus Basic members can do so for an extra $6.99 while those with Premium can do it for $9.99.</li><li>The company's CEO Bob Iger warned users that this would take place in September following an enforced policy change in June and a limited run in other regions.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Disney is the latest streaming service to impose a paid sharing rule on its streaming platform and has detailed what subscribers should expect.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DeItaone/status/1838976321017266626">DeItaone on X</a>, Disney Plus has started rolling out its paid sharing program to users in the U.S. The service detailed the plan in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/paid-sharing-disney-explainer/">blog post</a>, stating users must "invite" a person living outside of their household onto their account to share content.</p><p>To do this, users must grab the Extra Member add-on package. This add-on is reportedly not available for Disney Bundle subscribers or those billed through a partner. Those with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus Basic</a> can add an extra member for $6.99 while others with Premium can do it for an additional $9.99 per month.</p><p>Disney warns that accounts only have "one Extra Member slot available."</p><p>To clarify, the company states users (the primary account holder) can watch Disney Plus content while away from home. Members of the household can do so, as well. However, the platform may ask for verification if it thinks the device you&apos;re viewing Disney Plus on isn&apos;t a part of the household. If that happens, the post states users must tap "I&apos;m away from home" or "update household."</p><p>Disney will send you a one-time passcode to submit to lift the restriction.</p><p>If you do not want the Extra Member charge, Disney recommends that users transfer an account to a new subscription if they&apos;re outside the home.</p><p>The U.S. has now joined Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Europe, and several more regions in the paid sharing program.</p>

<p>We were warned that Disney Plus would begin cracking down on password sharing earlier this year following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown-begins-june-2024">CEO Bob Iger&apos;s comments</a>. The platform updated its sharing policy on the platform in January 2024 and started enforcing that change in June. However, paid sharing only rolled out to a few countries or "select regions" this summer.</p><p>Iger stated that all Disney Plus subscribers would fall into the new paid sharing policy by September — so, here we are. The agreement explicitly states, "unless otherwise permitted by your Service Tier, you may not share your subscription outside of your household." Of course, the only way to "share" is to tack on an Extra Member to your subscription plan.</p><p>We saw the signs last year when Disney <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-explores-password-sharing-crackdown">joined the dark side</a> after seeing the success Netflix had with the same approach. It seemed Iger was inspired by that approach, stating, "wants Disney Plus to become a growth business for Disney and that effort appears to be starting with new password-sharing initiatives."</p><p>Netflix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-account-sharing-changes-us">hit the U.S. with its password-sharing</a> crackdown last year for a similar price to what Disney Plus&apos; basic plan is charging. One standout difference is Netflix lets users add one to two extra members to a primary (household) account while Disney graces us with one.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Today, Meta introduced the Quest 3S, a more affordable version of its popular Quest 3 headset.</li><li>As part of the move, the company discontinued the 128GB version of the Meta Quest 3.</li><li>The 512GB variant is now available at the same $499 price point that the 128GB model launched with.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta has a history of attacking the value sector of the mixed-reality market, and it continued that with a string of announcements at Meta Connect 2024. The company introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Meta Quest 3S</a>, a more limited and affordable version of its popular Quest 3 headset, hitting the $299 price point while delivering a familiar Quest experience. However, the bigger news might just be that the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> now ships with significantly more storage at the same $499 price point. </p><p>The reason that the Meta Quest 3S exists at all is that Meta has proved there&apos;s room in the market for budget virtual reality headsets. The original $499 retail price for the Quest 3 served as a real barrier of entry to buying what was a great headset. Even if you could afford it, the base model started at just 128GB of onboard storage. The bump to a more reasonable 512GB cost an extra $150, pushing the total cost to $650.</p><p>Now, with a new pricing model, Meta has a compelling headset for each tier:</p>
<ul><li>Quest 3S (128GB): $299</li><li>Quest 3S (256GB): $399</li><li>Quest 3 (512GB): $499</li></ul>
<p>The upgraded 512GB configuration of the Meta Quest 3 was already a pretty great deal when it launched. For an extra $150, you could get roughly four times the storage of the base model. Now that the Meta Quest 3S serves people who need the 128GB or 256GB storage options, there&apos;s no reason for Meta to keep the 128GB Quest 3 around. It&apos;s being discontinued, and in a surprising move, that 512GB model takes its place at the same $499 price point. </p><p>To sweeten the deal, you get a copy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-hands-on">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> for free if you buy a Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S before April 2025. The game doesn&apos;t come out until October 22, but it&apos;s yet another way Meta is adding value to Quest headsets. If that wasn&apos;t enough, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-plus-subscription">Meta Quest Plus</a> is free for three months after you buy a new Quest headset.</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3 was already the best mainstream VR headset for gaming, and the extra storage means you&apos;ll be able to store more of everything on your device. It isn&apos;t surprising that Meta discontinued the 128GB Quest 3, but at a time when everything is getting more expensive, it <em>is</em> surprising that it slashed the price of the 512GB model. The entire Quest lineup is now positioned in a way that buyers can get an excellent value no matter what model or storage configuration they choose. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KWhXbH4WSh2YZSJGxdztkh" name="meta-quest-3-on-couch.jpg" alt="A Meta Quest 3 headset on the arm of a grey couch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KWhXbH4WSh2YZSJGxdztkh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Products are introduced and discontinued all the time. They get price cuts now and then, too, usually when a new model is introduced. However, the Meta Quest 3 is still Meta&apos;s best consumer-grade VR headset (setting aside the pricey and professional Meta Quest Pro). Meta didn&apos;t have to cut the price of the Quest 3; in fact, the 512GB Quest 3 at $649 probably wouldn&apos;t have looked out of place with the Quest 3S at $299 for the budget crowd. </p><p>Meta&apos;s position on mixed-reality has been clear: it&apos;s trying to bring headsets to the masses. Apple took the opposite approach with the Apple Vision Pro, where the same 512GB model costs $3,700. Yes, there&apos;s a lot of hardware differences between the Vision Pro and the Quest 3, but this stark difference highlights the approaches that Meta and Apple are taking. </p><p>That approach seems to be paying off for Meta. Even Apple seems to have forgotten about Vision Pro, since we haven&apos;t heard a peep about Apple Intelligence coming to the platform. Meanwhile, the Meta Quest 3 is the most popular headset on the planet, and it should only get more popular with the price-competitive Quest 3S and 512GB Quest 3. </p><p>The announcement of the Meta Quest 3&apos;s price cut comes right as Sony is gearing up to launch the PS5 Pro at the $700 price point. That&apos;s $200 more than the regular PS5, and yet the PS5 Pro doesn&apos;t include a stand or a disc drive. Put simply, that&apos;s more than some gamers are willing to pay for a mid-cycle refresh in this economy, no matter how much better the console performs. Let&apos;s not even discuss the egregious PS5 Pro 30th Anniversary bundle, which is priced so highly that Sony hasn&apos;t even revealed the exact MSRP ahead of pre-order day. </p><p>To sum up, this is a rare win for Meta, a company that makes decisions that aren&apos;t always in tune with what the public is feeling. Meta got the 512GB Quest 3 pricing right, and it deserves credit for that.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Anytime a large amount of people buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">a new phone</a> at the same time you see the same thing on social media: complaints about overheating the first day people are using it.</p><p>It can be discouraging because you just spent a lot of money and were told how great it was, yet when you use it, you&apos;re told it needs to shut down because it is too hot. Of course, the bickering and finger-pointing that accompanies anything posted to social media doesn&apos;t help.</p>
<p>The good news is that nothing is wrong, and this should be expected on the first day (and maybe the second day), even if you&apos;re using your new phone inside and with air conditioning. It may seem crazy, but a notice that things are too hot means everything is working the way the company that made your phone intends.</p>
<h2 id="why-it-happens-2">Why it happens</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.50%;"><img id="C6Un6sKqndqkpcnJRZmEmU" name="samsung-smart-switch-restore-mac-3.jpg" alt="Samsung Smart Switch Restore Mac" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C6Un6sKqndqkpcnJRZmEmU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="564" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you first sign into your phone, especially if you&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-transfer-data-your-old-android-phone-your-new-phone">restored a bunch of data</a> from a previous one, your phone is working harder than it ever will at any other time. Your network is running full tilt, the phone is copying files nonstop, and system data is written in large bunches. If you pick it up while it is doing all this and mess with wallpapers, widgets, and icons, or even worse — try to play a game or browse the web — it&apos;s too much for the phone&apos;s processor to handle.</p><p>Only so much heat can be moved away from the chips inside your phone. As your using it heat is being created. When more heat is created than can be moved away, you&apos;re warned or the device may even shut down so that the chip inside isn&apos;t damaged. When it cools down a bit, things will go back to normal.</p><p>Because your phone is writing and indexing a large amount of data while it&apos;s first set up, almost any other interaction can cause it to get too warm.</p>
<h2 id="it-apos-s-worse-than-it-used-to-be-2">It&apos;s worse than it used to be</h2>

<p>The time you see the most people worrying about phone thermal issues is when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-launch-usb-c">a new iPhone</a> is released. Especially the last two models, and there&apos;s a reason for that; it ties into <em>why</em> the problem seems worse than it used to be.</p><p>It seems worse because it is. Manufacturers are convinced that phones need to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-dimensions-leak">very thin</a> and very fast, with a glass front that covers almost all of the phone&apos;s surface. As new phones become thinner and chips become faster, removing that excess heat becomes harder.</p><p>When you build a phone using titanium (like the last two iPhones), the problem is compounded. Titanium is a very poor conductor of energy. Using it will make it so you don&apos;t notice how hot your phone is getting because more heat is trapped inside.</p><p>When the front is glass, and the rear is titanium, the phone <strong>will</strong> get hotter. Apple quickly sent out a software patch that helped regulate the processor temps for the iPhone 15, and it may do the same for the iPhone 16. Apple can&apos;t be expected to know how things will react until the phone is in millions of hands.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:384px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="3NxDhUNzgfcpWb7H7ekJpX" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-cool-down.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch extreme heat warning" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3NxDhUNzgfcpWb7H7ekJpX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="384" height="384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: jab_storm82 / Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This doesn&apos;t mean titanium is bad it simply means it is different. It has different properties and requires a different cooling system for a very fast chip. That system needed a bit of fine-tuning for times when the phones were working extra hard, like during setup.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that this doesn&apos;t just apply to phones. Any device that&apos;s especially thin or small has a chance of overheating when it&apos;s working "too hard." Older devices were thicker and often built using plastic, which made for better heat dissipation, and we just didn&apos;t see the issue as often as we do today.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-do-2">What can I do?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="juB8wRbMzTeFMV2FbTDZsG" name="google-account-android-hero.jpg" alt="Google Account Android Hero" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/juB8wRbMzTeFMV2FbTDZsG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The way to "fix" things is easy and hard: let it cool for a while.</p><p>Go through the set-up process on your new phone and set it down until it&apos;s finished. Once everything is done, reboot it. Resist the temptation to pick up your new gadget and mess with everything until it&apos;s finished doing the hardest thing it will ever do, and everything will be fine.</p><p>You might hear silly suggestions like putting it in the refrigerator or on top of the air conditioner vent, and you should ignore them. You should also ignore people telling you that your phone is defective or that you should have bought a different model. If there <em>continue</em> to be thermal problems, the device could be faulty, or the company that made it will need to provide a software patch, but heating up on day one is, unfortunately, normal unless you use one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic-9-pro-review">with a fan built into it</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Spotify's new AI Playlist is rolling out for Premium users in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand.</li><li>It’s currently available only on iOS and Android, not on desktop or web.</li><li>The AI Playlist makes curating music collections faster and helps you discover new tracks that match your vibe.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Spotify’s new AI Playlist is now live for Premium users in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, processing your text prompts and spinning them into song collections.</p><p>Spotify first introduced the feature in April, but it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-launches-personalized-ai-playlists">only available to Premium subscribers in Australia and the UK back then</a>. Now, the feature is spreading its wings to four more countries.</p><p>According to Spotify&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-09-24/ai-playlist-expanding-usa-canada-ireland-new-zealand/" target="_blank">press release</a>, this feature remains in beta and available on both iOS and Android. That said, it isn’t available on the Spotify desktop or web apps yet.</p><p>Premium subscribers can tap into the AI Playlist feature by heading to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify">Spotify</a> library on their mobile device and tapping the "+" icon in the top right corner. From there, just select "AI Playlist" from the drop-down menu to start a chat interface. This lets you express exactly what you&apos;re looking for in a playlist—whether it&apos;s “upbeat pop music for my European summer vacation” or “a romantic playlist for date night at home.”</p><p>Spotify suggests that the more details you give, the better your playlists will turn out. You can tweak things later with extra prompts, but it’s smart to share as much information as possible from the get-go.</p><p>To get the best playlists, it’s a good idea to include specific details in your descriptions, like musical genres, decades, moods, or favorite artists. You can also use text, numbers, and emojis to get your point across, but keep it clean as the app doesn&apos;t allow offensive language.</p><p>To help users create playlist descriptions, AI Playlist will suggest prompts. Spotify notes that the feature is always learning and getting better with every user interaction, with more tweaks expected down the road.</p><p>Spotify’s dive into AI music curation isn’t brand new. Earlier in 2023, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-ai-dj-curated-music">rolled out an AI DJ feature</a> that adds a personal touch by curating song selections based on your unique listening habits.</p><p>The new AI-powered feature promises to make curating music collections way faster than the old-school way of putting playlists together, as is the case with many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming apps</a>. Plus, it’s great for finding fresh tracks that vibe with your style.</p><p>Unlike the AI DJ feature that mainly uses your entire listening history to create personalized playlists but doesn’t let you customize the final selections much, the AI Playlist feature feels more handy.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>CMF by Nothing should likely launch a Power 140W GaN adapter soon.</li><li>The adapter was recently spotted in a leaked e-commerce listing in India.</li><li>While the launch is still unclear, it is a significant step up from the previous Power 65W GaN charging brick.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While the parent company just launched a new product dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">Ear Open</a> Buds, its sibling company, CMF by Nothing, might probably have a new charger up its sleeve soon, as per a leaked e-commerce listing.</p><p>The leak was spotted by X user Abhishek Singh on Flipkart, a Walmart-owned e-commerce site in India. Leaked screenshots shared by the user indicate that it&apos;s a good 140W charging brick, which is GaN-based.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is Nothing about to launch a 140W GaN charger?👀 pic.twitter.com/b2tPv9CdsE<a href="https://twitter.com/AbhishekMarkets/status/1837875995803574608">September 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>It appears to be similar to what CMF launched earlier, which is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cmf-by-nothing-buds-pro-watch-pro-announced">Power 65W GaN</a> adapter. The shared images further showcase what to expect from the Power 140W GaN charger, which evidently includes 140W ultra-fast charging speeds.</p><p>The upcoming GaN charger is a 3-in-1 charge point that includes two USB Type-C ports and a USB-A port. It also has PD (Power Delivery) 3.1 output, which claims to charge two laptops simultaneously. </p><p>For reference, the screenshot indicates that the MacBook Pro (although the precise model is unspecified) will be charged 55% within 30 minutes. As for compatible Android phones, wherein CMF indicates its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">Phone 1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-plus-is-here-and-its-got-a-chip-no-one-else-has">Nothing Phone 2a Plus</a>, users can expect a good 66% charge in half an hour.</p><p>Users can further expect interesting things about the GaN charger and its technology. The primary aspect is less heat generation with the GaN charger alongside its compact form factor. Carrying it easier than most relevant charging bricks, which look significantly bigger than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-gan-chargers">GaN adapter</a>. </p><p>Despite the compact form factor, the Power 140W is believed to have nine safety mechanisms for additional protection. As mentioned above, users can also expect intelligent power distribution and universal compatibility with devices.</p>
<p>As for the launch, it is still unclear as CMF by Nothing hasn&apos;t indicated a launch date yet. According to the tipster, the arrival could likely be sooner than later since it was spotted on an e-commerce listing. </p><p>CMF by Nothing recently launched its first phone aimed to disrupt the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget Android phone</a> market dubbed CMF Phone 1. Despite the cheaper price point, the phone has been known for its bright AMOLED display, customizable hardware design, speedy processor, and good cameras.</p>

<ul><li>A report following a Climate Week NYC panel details a Google representative's words about bringing repairability to the Pixel Watch.</li><li>Their statement noted how Google is "thinking about" repairability for the Pixel Watch, but said there are several elements it must review.</li><li>Google recently confirmed that Pixel Watch 3 owners cannot get it repaired, leaving replacement as their only option when contacting support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google might walk back its previous choice by sticking with its non-repair plan for the Pixel Watch.</p><p>Google&apos;s Pixel Watches are complex, delicate devices considering that domed glass. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-is-thinking-through-the-pixel-watchs-design-to-be-repairable/">Wired</a> heard from a Google representative that the company might rework the intricate design to bring repairability to consumers (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/25/google-pixel-watch-repairable-future/">9to5Google</a>). Word was heard during a Climate Week NYC panel in which Google&apos;s manager of Government Affairs and Public Policy, Nicole Azores eluded toward the potential change.</p><p>During the panel, Azores stated, "we’re thinking about repairability on a broader scale, not just on phones and tablets, and we want to make sure that all of our products eventually become repairable."</p><p>Unfortunately, Azores (still) didn&apos;t have an official timeframe of when consumers can expect a more repairable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch</a> from Google. As Wired noted, products such as smartwatches can sit in development for up to four years. So, it&apos;s difficult to say which product in the series could see better repairability.</p><p>There appears to be more that Google is grappling with. Azores added that watches are still fairly "nascent" and "new," saying, "there are some design elements that need to be considered on how we make them repairable." The glass-dome could be one such element to consider and, perhaps, the rotating crown.</p><p>But with only speculation, we&apos;ll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s not get things twisted: Google&apos;s Pixel Watches haven&apos;t been repairable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-wont-repair-pixel-watch-displays">since the start</a>. If users were sitting with a damaged device, specifically its display, Google informed users that it wouldn&apos;t fix it. Instead, folks were told to contact support and they would go through any available replacement options.</p><p>That same sentiment was echoed in August when a report surfaced about Google confirming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-3-repair-lack-report">that it wouldn&apos;t repair</a> a damaged Pixel Watch 3. Contacting support is your only option; however, Google also ushered consumer attention toward the Preferred Care insurance plan to cover your damages.</p><p>Despite that, Google will still charge you a $49 service fee with the plan which covers out-of-warranty damages.</p><p>Hopefully, we&apos;re looking at a future Pixel Watch that consumers can send in (or take in) for repair <em>without </em>receiving an entirely new device. One thing that would likely need to change is the nightmarish repairability circumstances within the watch. A teardown video of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-teardown-video">the original Pixel Watch by iFixit</a> showed the hellish hoops one would go through to fix a simple part.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>At Meta Connect 2024, CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off Meta&apos;s first public prototype for AR glasses, codenamed Orion. We had the chance to test out these AR glasses during a private demo before the event and came away genuinely shocked at how much better they are than other AR prototypes we&apos;ve tested — even if they&apos;re not consumer-ready yet.</p><p>We first learned of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ar-glasses-woes-push-release-to-2027">Project Orion back in 2023</a>, in an Information report stating Meta was having trouble getting its AR tech consumer-ready. We later spoke with a Meta engineer who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">promised</a> that their first AR glasses would be as groundbreaking for AR as Oculus Rift was for VR, but we didn&apos;t know what to expect from a non-consumer prototype with behind-the-scenes baggage.</p><p>Now, Meta is sharing Orion with "select external audiences" as they "build towards our consumer AR glasses product line, which we plan to begin shipping in the near future."</p><p>My colleague Nick Sutrich, who got hands-on time with both Orion and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Meta Quest 3S</a> the night before Meta Connect 2024, and I discussed with Nick in length his experience with the Meta AR glasses on everything from design and comfort to apps and visuals. Overall, he came away more optimistic about AR than he&apos;d ever been before.</p>

<p>Picture the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Bans</a> smart glasses, with their cameras, music streaming, and Meta AI tech. Make everything a bit thicker and heavier, and add lightweight silicone carbide lenses with uLED projectors and eye-tracking cameras to follow your gaze. </p><p>Then stick a wallet-sized computing puck in your pocket to handle the processing and battery, with the same 6DoF tracking and operating system used by your Quest headset — including window-pane apps with spatial anchors that float in mixed reality and stay in one place instead of being locked in front of you.</p><p>Mix all that together, and you get Meta&apos;s AR glasses!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6aZeaVzghXfsFX5MY73EqD" name="meta-project-orion-ar-glasses-official-02.jpg" alt="An official product photo of Meta Orion glasses along with its wristband and compute puck" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6aZeaVzghXfsFX5MY73EqD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most current AR prototypes run a wire from your phone to your glasses, and even then, the glasses might only last an hour or two. Meta&apos;s Orion glasses use tech similar to Quest Air Link, pulling data remotely from the pocket puck, and they collectively have "all-day battery life," according to Meta. It would be a real game changer if they can pull that off in the consumer version.</p><p>The glasses themselves use "highly specialized custom silicon" that only requires "a few dozen milliwatts" of energy to run simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) tech so that the glasses don&apos;t overheat when tracking your eyes and gestures.</p>

<p>Like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a>, Meta&apos;s AR glasses use cameras for hand tracking. They also use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-says-neural-interface-controls-are-close-to-ready">electromyography (EMG) neural interface wristband</a> Zuckerberg teased earlier this year. It&apos;s much more subtle than past bulky prototypes; Nick says it looks like a normal fitness band on your wrist.</p><p>With it, Orion registers pinch gestures to select menu items, scrolling by making a fist and moving your thumb up or down, and other shortcuts. The EMG band detects tiny muscle movements in your wrist to interpret what gestures you&apos;re making, even if the AR glasses&apos; cameras miss it. In his demo, Nick found the EMG gestures seamless.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mE3gZXr6R8a68xtFEMgfwP" name="meta-project-orion-ar-glasses-hands-on-ui-03.jpg" alt="A view from Meta Orion glasses showing pinch gestures" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mE3gZXr6R8a68xtFEMgfwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What exactly can you do with these gestures? During Nick&apos;s demo, he was able to video call someone, scroll Instagram, and check a third messaging app simultaneously, each window splayed across his vision. He also played a game of AR pong with a Meta rep, with the software shared across both glasses.</p><p>Otherwise, it has the same tools that make Meta Ray-Bans so popular: you can snap a photo at any time, play music over the built-in speakers, or look at an object and ask Meta AI a question about it. Meta is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-just-got-a-bunch-of-ai-upgrades-and-live-translation">adding live-translation and live-video AI interpretation to Ray-Bans</a> this year, and no doubt Meta AI will keep growing in the ensuing years before Orion becomes consumer-ready.</p>

<p>Most current AR glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/rayneo-air-2s-xr-smart-glasses-review">RayNeo Air 2S XR</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-really-saved-my-neck">Xreal Air 2</a> restrict their FoV to a small portion of the glasses lens, about 40–50º, and you have to be very conscious of slotting it directly in your vision to see anything. Plus, they typically plug into your smartphone or a puck with a thick cable, either draining your phone or burning through the puck in a few hours.</p><p>Meta&apos;s Orion glasses have a 70º FoV that extends from edge to edge across each lens, avoiding the sweet-spot issue. They don&apos;t need a wire, and Meta made its computing puck much more efficient.</p><p>If that sounds too good to be true, it is: There&apos;s a reason these Orion AR glasses aren&apos;t consumer-ready. However, Meta has already solved <em>some</em> common form factor problems, which makes us optimistic they can solve others.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="whZ2y3aPiLJofXH2XTDkQ5" name="meta-project-orion-ar-glasses-hands-on-02.jpg" alt="Photo of Nick Sutrich wearing and using the Meta Orion AR glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/whZ2y3aPiLJofXH2XTDkQ5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First, this prototype is fairly heavy. Meta says it weighs 93g; for context, the Meta Ray-Bans weigh about 50g, and most wired AR prototypes — designed for streaming comfortably indoors — weigh in the 75g range. The Magic Leap 2, which has a comparable 70º FoV, weighs a whopping 250g, more like a headset than glasses.</p><p>Nick noted that the thick glasses temples would probably hurt his ears if he wore them for too long and that the frames themselves are thick enough that they&apos;re immediately noticeable as "tech" to onlookers — though not as goofy-looking as the new Snap Spectacles. </p><p>Meta wants its AR glasses to be all-day devices like its Ray-Bans, but it probably needs to cut the weight down another ounce if possible. Still, it&apos;s on the way there.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="nDxHrvU7jviWKhmBLDpr6Y" name="Meta-orion-ar-glasses-press-photo-1.jpg" alt="Press photo of a woman wearing the Meta Project Orion AR glasses and using the multitasking software." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nDxHrvU7jviWKhmBLDpr6Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other issue, which Meta readily acknowledged, is that the Orion glasses&apos; resolution, frame rate, and color fidelity need work. </p><p>Nick describes the Meta AR glasses&apos; holographic layer as having a "rainbow shimmer," like the screen protector over a phone display before you peel it off. It&apos;s not overwhelming and doesn&apos;t cause any warping; it&apos;s just a slight discoloration. But it&apos;d likely feel distracting if you had that filtering your view all day.</p><p>Playing the pong demo made it clear to Nick that AR gaming falls short of the quality you get with Quest 3 mixed reality passthrough. It can be hard to follow fast-moving objects, and things planted in the world don&apos;t look as real at Orion&apos;s current resolution. But again, that feels like something Meta has years to improve on before its consumer version.</p>

<p>Meta claims augmented reality glasses "might be the most challenging consumer electronics device produced since the smartphone."</p><p>Smart glasses have become more popular, but the successful ones with AR functionality are essentially extended displays. You plug them in to watch movies or play video games on a virtual, flat 100-inch screen while laying in bed or sitting on an airplane, with your phone trackpad for controls. </p><p>No one has figured out portability, or making hand tracking viable for primary controls, or any of the other considerations necessary for AR glasses to be worn outdoors on a daily basis, the way people envisioned when Google Glass first launched. However, Meta Orion does all of these things as closely as we&apos;ve seen to the sci-fi concept yet.</p><p>Even though Meta&apos;s AR glasses have problems, they feel like they&apos;ve come closest to that vision. The Meta Quest hand tracking and mixed reality software are a perfect fit for AR glasses. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate">Meta AI based on Llama is only getting smarter</a>, and they&apos;ve solved at least two classic AR problems: the narrow FoV and short-lived battery. Now we just have to hope they keep on this path and improve in other areas.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> are picking up a host of updates in beta designed to make them smarter than before.</p><p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg just announced that soon, you’ll be able to ask the smart glasses to remember things you spot—like when you’re about to run out of your cereal.</p><p>These spectacles already give you insights about what’s in front of you by using their cameras, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">earlier beta updates from this year</a>. For example, the AI can recognize objects, share info about landmarks, and even translate languages while you’re traveling.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5464px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="pQF9J4HU82zBmsDMkmBNxP" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-glasses-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses worn by a man" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQF9J4HU82zBmsDMkmBNxP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5464" height="4098" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Building on those features, the company is adding video to Meta AI, allowing the glasses to see what you see in real-time when you ask. Meta mentions some scenarios where AI can assist you more naturally, such as when you’re out exploring a city or cooking up a meal. This new feature is set to roll out later this year.</p><p>The smart glasses have also picked up some extra features, including the ability to scan QR codes and phone numbers. Plus, they offer expanded live translation between English and French, Italian, or Spanish, though this won&apos;t be available until later this year.</p><p>Additionally, you’ll soon be able to enjoy integrations with Spotify, Amazon Music, Audible, and iHeart. Meta has also added a fresh selection of Transitions lenses from EssilorLuxottica.</p>

<p>With all the hype around AI hardware lately, Meta’s glasses are trying to make their mark by offering vision-based services. Whether this approach can help the product avoid the rocky launch that the Humane AI Pin had remains to be seen.</p><p>Sure, the Humane AI Pin has a camera for spotting objects and describing them, but there’s a certain ease to wearing a camera on your face.

<p>Meta AI has announced new means of communication for its users, who can now talk to it. It now responds in familiar AI voices, including some celebrities. Additionally, it can answer questions about users&apos; shared photos and edit them in interesting ways.</p><p>For the unaware, Meta AI is accessible through Messenger, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram DM. Users can ask assistant questions through their voices and get answers or casually listen to jokes.</p>

<p>Meta notes in a shared press release that users can also choose familiar voices to hear the response, which includes the AI voices of Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan Michael Key, and Kristen Bell. The rollout of this voice feature will be first seen in regions including the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>

<p>Users in the U.S. will further be able to share photos with Meta AI. The assistant is believed to understand what the photo is, and users can ask questions about it. For instance, you can share a photo of a flower or dog and ask about the kind, or they can snap a picture of a dish and simply ask for a recipe on how to prepare it.</p><p>Moreover, users can ask Meta AI to edit a photo or ask for ideas on how to edit it. They can instruct the assistant what they want to add or remove or even tell it to make changes, which can include the ability to change the outfit or replace the background entirely. </p><p>Since Meta AI is available on Instagram, users can also share their photos to the Story and generate a fun background by giving Meta AI the relevant prompt before sharing it.</p>

<p>Another interesting addition is a new Meta AI translation tool, which "will automatically translate the audio of Reels. "</p><p>This will allow creators to reach a wider audience with their content and consumers to rely less on captions and experience the reels in their preferred language. Content creators can enjoy the benefits of "automatic dubbing and lip syncing; Meta AI will simulate the speaker&apos;s voice in another language and sync their lips to match. "</p>

<p>Facebook is also getting nifty AI features, which are basically an expansion of Meta AI Imagine features. Users can generate their own AI-powered superhero photos, which can be shared as Stories or set as their profile pictures on the social media platform. These images can also be shared with friends who can see, react, or even mimic them. Like Instagram, Meta AI can suggest captions for Stories on Facebook as well.</p><p>For Messenger and Instagram DMs, people can choose from a wide range of chat backgrounds or change the text bubble color. While they are preset, users can now create personalized ones with the help of AI.</p>
<p>Meta says it also tests AI-generated content for Facebook and Instagram feeds with which users could see images made by Meta AI specified for each user based on their interests or current trends. They can further "tap a suggested prompt to take that content in a new direction or swipe to Imagine new content in real time."</p><p>Lastly, Meta is expanding its business AIs to other businesses by utilizing click-to-message ads on its platforms like WhatsApp and Messenger. This will help in quickly setting up business AIs to talk to their customers, further provide support, and facilitate commerce. </p><p>The support includes answering customer questions and finalizing a purchase, among other things. These business AIs aim to help businesses "engage with more customers and increase sales."</p>

<p>The image-sharing capabilities could be part of the latest Llama 3.2 rollout, which includes Meta&apos;s vision models (11B and 90B), as they understand both "images and text." Then, there are smaller 1B and 3B models aimed at mobile devices made by Qualcomm and MediaTek chips. These models are also optimized for ARM-based processors. </p><p>Meta is sharing its official Llama Stack Distributions so developers can work effortlessly with Llama models in environments like single-node, on-prem, cloud, and on-device. It further works with companies like AWS, Databricks, Dell, Fireworks, Infosys, and Together AI "to build Llama Stack Distributions for their downstream enterprise clients. "</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S is here as a low-priced alternative to the Quest 3. If you compare the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 closely, you&apos;ll note a ton of similarities. Although it looks like a Quest 2 with new cameras, it shares more in common with the newer headset, from performance to accessories.</p><p>If you&apos;re a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest 2</a> owner, you might have been put off by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a>&apos;s higher price and held off on upgrading. Now, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Quest 3S</a> has the same price and many of the same upgrades; however, Meta has also discounted the Quest 3 512GB from $649 to $499 — the original price for the 128GB Quest 3 — and now&apos;s a good time to choose the mainline headset, too.</p><p>Based on our year testing out the Quest 3 and our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Quest 3S hands-on demo</a> at Connect, we&apos;ll break down every main similarity and difference between the Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3!</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S is essentially a hybrid between the Quest 2 visuals and Quest 3 hardware. Before breaking down the specific downgrades, we&apos;ll explain every way that the Quest 3S will modernize things for Quest 2 users.</p><p><strong>New CPU & extra RAM:</strong> Both the Quest 3 and 3S share the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip and 8GB of RAM. Meta says this combination delivers twice-as-fast GPU performance for faster loading times. </p><p>Even though the Quest 2 and 3 share most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">same games</a>, the Quest 3 version will often have an exclusive patch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/which-quest-2-games-have-quest-3-enhancements">graphical enhancements</a> like higher refresh rates, reduced fog, better lighting and shadows, more enemies or environmental objects on screen at once, better colors, and improved textures. </p><p><strong>Quest 3 exclusives:</strong> Most developers try to target both the Quest 2 and Quest 3, but some upcoming AAA games will be Quest 3 exclusives because they&apos;re too graphically demanding for the Quest 2&apos;s headset.</p><p>So far, we know of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-hands-on">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a>, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and the recently-released Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded. Aside from those, many other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Quest games</a> are Quest 3-exclusive because they need full-color passthrough with high mixed-reality resolution to work well. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QHNC96jpPMEUCSG9zpoaC8" name="Meta-Quest-3S-vs-Meta-Quest-3-side-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Meta Quest 3 to the Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QHNC96jpPMEUCSG9zpoaC8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Full-color passthrough: </strong>Despite the different camera configuration, the Meta Quest 3S has the same 4MP RGB camera with 18 pixels per degree (PPD) passthrough resolution, letting you see your living room in full color, if not at quite the same resolution as full virtual reality.</p><p>Mixed-reality games were gimmicky and unpolished when the Quest 3 first launched, but these games have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/mixed-reality-games-getting-good">improved significantly in 2024</a>; on the hardware end, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/an-update-just-fixed-the-biggest-quest-3-mixed-reality-problem">fixed mixed-reality warping</a> and made MR apps <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-news-recap-july-26-2024">use 80% less GPU processing</a> in software updates over the summer. With the Quest 3S, you&apos;re getting a better MR experience right from the start.</p><p><strong>Controllers: </strong>The Meta Quest 3S uses Touch Plus controllers, the same controller generation as the Quest 3. These controllers remove the bulky tracking ring, relying on LEDs around the controller body for inside-out tracking. They also add improved haptics.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AYo2LSz9WiCQozNoVZBuPF" name="Meta-Quest-3S-hands-on-wearing-06.jpg" alt="Wearing the Meta Quest 3S at a hands-on event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AYo2LSz9WiCQozNoVZBuPF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Weight: </strong>Even though the Meta Quest 3S is thicker than the Quest 3, it weighs 1g less (514 vs. 515g), making the fit experience pretty darn comparable. </p><p><strong>Accessories:</strong> We were surprised to learn that most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Quest 3 accessories</a> should carry over to the Quest 3S. According to Meta, its first-party carrying case, Elite Strap, Elite Strap with Battery, Touch Plus Active Straps, Compact Charging Dock, and Link cable will work with the Quest 3S, too. We assume that our favorite third-party Elite Straps will work as well; we&apos;ll test this as soon as we have our Quest 3S review unit.</p>
<h2 id="meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3-design-and-lens-changes-2">Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3: Design and lens changes</h2>
<p>The obvious aesthetic difference with the front cameras aside, both the Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3 look very similar to one another, with the white plastic frame, sensors along the edge, and Meta label in front. </p><p>One small design difference is that Meta removed the Quest 3&apos;s 3.5mm headphone jack from the left arm and moved its right-side USB-C charging port to the left. That gives you fewer headphone options than before; your best bet is wireless earbuds with a USB-C dongle that allows for charging passthrough, so you can still use a battery pack.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bMNrBuaRgJYvq2VwgMBXV7" name="Meta-Quest-3S-vs-Meta-Quest-3-lenses-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Meta Quest 3 to the Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bMNrBuaRgJYvq2VwgMBXV7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Quest 3 (left) and Quest 3S (right) lenses </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 was the first to use pancake lenses, with a flattened, reflective design that takes up less horizontal space but also requires more brightness. Most other VR headsets use thicker Fresnel lenses that make them front-heavy and have a noticeable "sweet spot" at the center. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3 reviewer</a> specifically praised the pancake lenses for eliminating that sweet spot for better visual clarity.</p><p>One of the Quest 3S&apos; cost cutbacks is using a Fresnel lens. Meta managed to make the Quest 3S 19.3mm thinner than the Quest 2, but it&apos;s still 11.6mm <em>thicker</em> than the Quest 3, shifting the weight forward. Just as many people upgraded the Quest 2 with an Elite Strap for better support and security during fast-paced VR games, you&apos;ll probably want the same for the Quest 3S.</p>
<h2 id="meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3-display-and-ipd-2">Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3: Display and IPD</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4rem2vuhUaTRgFPekLjg9g" name="Meta-Quest-3S-hands-on-breathable-facial-interface-03.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the new breathable facial interface for the Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rem2vuhUaTRgFPekLjg9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Quest 3S with its Breathable Facial Interface, which won't fit the Quest 3 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, the Quest 3 and Quest 3S both use LCDs, but the Quest 3 (2,064 x 2,208) gives you 30% higher resolution than the Quest 3S (1,832 x 1,920, or the same as the Quest 2 display). That, combined with the Fresnel sweet spot, will make the visual experience familiar to Quest 2 owners and detract a bit from the next-gen graphics.</p><p>Also, the Meta Quest 3S shares the Quest 2&apos;s shorter and narrower field of view (FoV) compared to the Quest 3. </p><p>Unfortunately, the Meta Quest 3S brought back the Quest 2&apos;s interpupillary distance (IPD) system to save money. You can slide the lenses to three preset distances — 58mm, 63mm, or 68mm — instead of the IPD wheel and 1mm gaps from 53mm to 75mm you get on the Quest 3. </p><p>During our hands-on, we found you could slide the Quest 3S lenses in-between those three IPD presets (about 60mm or 65mm), in case your personal IPD doesn&apos;t match one of those three presets; it&apos;s just trickier and less exact than on the Quest 3.</p><p>Because the Quest 3S made these lens and design changes, Quest 3 facial interfaces won&apos;t work with the Quest 3S; Meta will sell a unique "Quest 3S Breathable Facial Interface" if you want a comfort upgrade for VR workouts. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1545px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="snZ3fLKwjauXok7d3vfEuX" name="meta-quest-3s-press-photo-10.jpeg" alt="The Meta Quest 3S sitting on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/snZ3fLKwjauXok7d3vfEuX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1545" height="869" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta started out selling the Quest 3 in 128GB and 512GB versions, but it&apos;s phasing out the 128GB model and making 512GB the default. The Quest 3S will ship in 128GB and 256GB sizes, matching the Quest 2 before it went out of stock. Most casual VR gamers will happily make do with 128GB of space; your average VR game takes up 5GB or less, though some of the major titles are 10GB or more.</p><p>Both headsets use camera sensors to track your controllers or hands and map your surroundings so you don&apos;t hurt yourself, as well as a 4MP RGB camera for full-color passthrough. The only camera difference is that Meta gave the Quest 3 a physical depth sensor to determine how close or far away things are, while the Quest 3S uses software to detect it (as the Quest 2 did).</p><p>Both the Quest 3 and 3S burn through battery quickly because of the Snapdragon XR2 and 8GB of RAM. But even though the Quest 3S (4,324mAh capacity) has a smaller battery than the Quest 3 (5,060 mAh), Meta estimates that the Quest 3S lasts about 18 minutes longer per charge (2.5 hours versus 2.2 hours). </p><p>We assume that the Quest 3&apos;s higher resolution and brighter pancake lenses require more power, making the Quest 3S more efficient. We&apos;ve asked Meta for confirmation on this.</p>

<p>If you own the Quest 2 and want a new VR headset, then you&apos;re probably already happy with the level of immersion the Quest 3S will offer with the same resolution and lens. The Quest 3 resolution and storage boost would certainly be nice to have, but maybe not nice enough to justify spending another $200.</p><p>Because it has the same CPU and memory, the Quest 3S will handle all the same VR and MR games equally well, receive support for the same amount of time, and do slightly better for battery life. It may feel more front-heavy, but an Elite Strap will fix that; frankly, we think the Quest 3 needs an Elite Strap for long-term comfort too, so you&apos;ll have to spend the extra money either way.</p><p>Even though we&apos;ll still rank the Meta Quest 3 as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headset</a> today, the Quest 3S will be good enough for everyone who skipped the pricier headset.</p>
