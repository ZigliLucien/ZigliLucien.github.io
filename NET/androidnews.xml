<h2 id="how-can-you-charge-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip6-2">How can you charge the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip6?</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, one of two new foldable phone models launched by Samsung at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-2024-biggest-announcements">Galaxy Unpacked event in July 2024</a>, can be charged in a number of ways. Along with wired charging at 25W via USB-C using a compatible cable and charger, it can also charge wirelessly. </p><p>The phone charges wirelessly at 15W, which is pretty much the industry standard rate. Thus, it can’t be charged as quickly as competing phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 12</a>, which can charge wirelessly at a rapid 50W using a compatible AIRVOOC charger. However, it will do the trick. </p><p>It works with any wireless charging pad, stand, or surface, so go ahead and plop it down or atop one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">the best wireless chargers</a> to get a battery boost. Given the speed, don’t expect to be up and running quickly. But you can keep the phone on a wireless charging pad on your desk while you work through the day, for example, or give it a boost on a wireless charging surface at the airport before your flight. </p><p>Additionally, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 offers 4.5W reverse charging, which can be used to recharge other compatible devices, like a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">Samsung Galaxy Buds</a> or Galaxy smartwatch. As the name implies, it takes battery power from the phone and uses it to charge other devices, effectively functioning as its own charging pad. </p><p>Naturally, using reverse charging will drain your phone’s battery. But if you need to give your earbuds a quick boost to be able to listen to tunes or a podcast on the way home from work or school and your phone’s battery is full, this could be worth it for the top-up. Given the slow rate, however, this is something you’ll probably only use for emergencies and quick recharges to get you through a commute or to make a phone call. </p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that even with wired charging, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 doesn’t charge very quickly, either. It only charges at a rate of 25W, which is much slower than many other phones, including Samsung’s own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> non-foldable device. </p><p>Bottom line: make sure to keep this phone juiced up at all times, and invest in one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">the best portable battery packs</a> to bring along with you if you’re a power user.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Charges slowly </strong></em></p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 might be an advanced, premium foldable phone, but it lacks fast charging. While it does support wireless charging, the rate is pretty slow. The same goes for wired charging. It also works with reverse charging, however, so you can recharge compatible buds, smartwatches, and more. If you plan to use this phone a lot, invest in a portable charging bank.</p></p>

This means you can safely wash dishes, have a shower, go for a quick dip in the water, or run in the rain with it on. But as with any water-resistant device, you should always take precautions.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="what-is-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-water-resistant-rating-2">What is the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 water-resistant rating?</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> boasts both an IP68 and 5ATM water-resistance rating. The IP68 rating means that you can submerge the watch in up to a meter of water for up to 30 minutes. You could theoretically swim with it as well, as long as you aren&apos;t diving deep or staying submerged for a period longer than half an hour. </p><p>The 5ATM rating, meanwhile, refers to the pressure the watch can withstand. With this rating, the watch can withstand pressure up to a depth of 50 meters. So, it’s OK for swimming in a pool or at the lake, showering, relaxing in the bathtub, or light water or snow activities. But it isn’t for more intense water or snow activities. </p><p>Note that water-resistant ratings apply at the time of manufacture. This degrades over time so as with any other smartwatch (or other electronic device, for that matter) that has an IP68 or 5ATM rating, it will become more susceptible to water damage as it gets older. </p><p>What’s more, the rating relates to freshwater sources, so if you’re swimming in a heavily chlorinated pool, for example, or saltwater ocean, you might want to remove the watch to prevent damage, or invest in a waterproof casing for an added layer of protection. This rating also does not withstand high pressures of water, like while water skiing, nor high temperatures, like in a hot tub. Use your best judgement. </p><p>If you are swimming or doing outdoor activities in the rain or snow with the watch, make sure you also have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">water-resistant band</a>.  </p><p>If you want something with a higher water-resistance rating and that’s more durable overall, you can consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> instead, which offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/is-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-waterproof">rating twice as high at 10ATM</a>. Otherwise, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is just like any other premium smartwatch, and you can wear it with confidence just about anywhere. Just wear with caution when swimming, make sure to thoroughly rinse and dry it when you&apos;re done, and you&apos;re good to go!</p>

<p>As the latest Samsung Galaxy smartwatch in the line, the Galaxy Watch 7 boasts some enticing upgrades like an improved chip, dual-band GPS, and Sleep Apnea detection. It has the same IP68 and 5TAM rating, protecting it against both water and dust. But, like most other smartwatches, it isn’t completely waterproof. If you need something more serious in this department, consider the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra instead.  </p></p>

<ul><li>The Meta Quest 4 and Quest 4s are coming in 2026, according to one report.</li><li>The Meta Quest Pro 2 will debut in 2027, confirming earlier reports on the pro-level headset sequel.</li><li>Meta is said to be cutting R&D costs for Reality Labs by 20% by 2026.</li></ul>
<p>While the Meta Quest 3 is only just about to celebrate its first birthday, a new report suggests that its successor will be headed to market in just two years from now. What&apos;s more, Meta is reportedly looking to release a Meta Quest 4s at the same time, debuting a premium and budget line at the same time.</p><p>That&apos;s opposed to Meta&apos;s current strategy, as the company is rumored to be debuting a budget-minded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3s</a> this Fall. The report comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/reality-comes-to-metas-reality-labs">The Information</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-quest-4-2026-quest-pro-2-2027-report/">UploadVR</a>) and is written by Wayne Ma and Kalley Huang. Ma has reported on several Meta leaks in the past that turned out to be true, which means there&apos;s a high likelihood of this report being quite accurate.</p><p>Releasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Meta Quest 4</a> when the Quest 3 is just three years old might seem like a fast timeframe — especially if you&apos;re a console gamer who is used to 6-8 years between major Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo releases — but it falls right in line with the length of time between the Quest 2 and Quest 3&apos;s release.</p><p>The report also says that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2">Meta Quest Pro 2</a> headset is still in the works for a 2027 release despite the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/lg-made-meta-quest-pro-2-canceled">recent cancellation</a> of an LG-made prototype. Quest Pro 2 rumors have been all over the place recently, so it might be wise to take this one with a grain of salt.</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;ve heard of Google developing a "Satellite OS" for Pixels for a while now, but a discovery shows it might cost you.</p><p>With enrolled testers getting their hands on Android 15&apos;s latest beta, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-satellite-sos-free-apk-teardown-3462798/">Android Authority</a> discovered something interesting about Pixel&apos;s SOS feature. Through an APK dive, it was seen that Google might charge users for its Satellite OS services after a brief free period.</p><p>A string in the code states, "Satellite SOS is included at no charge for two years." It seems that Google is eyeing an approach similar to Apple and its emergency services, which are also free for the initial two years.</p><p>Other information in the code details the Pixel Satellite SOS feature more by stating, "your name, email, phone number, location, device information, and emergency contact information" will be shared with 911. That data is given to satellite service providers, as well.</p><p>One final sentence within Android 15&apos;s code mentions updating your Pixel to receive support for the SOS function. This is an occurrence older Pixels, like the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, will likely see as the emergency service is coming with Android 15. By extension, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-official-teaser-gemini">Pixel 9 series</a> should have it ready and waiting.</p><p>Concrete information regarding <em>how much </em>Google intends to charge (if it does) for its SOS service is unknown.</p>

<p>The past few Android 15 betas have held informative insights into what Google has planned for its SOS feature, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-satellite-sos-ui-spotted">such as its UI</a>. Early walkthroughs were discovered, showing that users will be prompted to gain a "clear view of the sky" before activating their SOS services. Users will then need to locate the appropriate satellite through the on-display animation.</p><p>Users can retain text-based contact with their family and 911 services <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-pixel-feature-spotted">after enabling the emergency SOS feature</a> within the settings.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-4-is-here-as-the-stable-release-gets-closer">Android 15 Beta 4</a> was released for enrolled testers yesterday (July 18) and pushes us ever closer to a full OS launch. One of its key changes was a switch from PNG-based emoji fonts to a vector format. Technically speaking, this ensures your emojis scale in size without sacrificing quality and becoming distorted or blurred.</p><p>Android 15&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-space-full-details">Private Spaces</a> were in the spotlight once again alongside better app activity management. It seems the software can better allocate its resources to keep apps active only when prompted by the user.</p>

<h2 id="here-apos-s-what-you-should-know-about-the-water-and-dust-resistance-of-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-2">Here&apos;s what you should know about the water (and dust) resistance of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</h2>
<p>Being the company&apos;s newest flagship foldable, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> packs a laundry list of features, including everything from top-tier hardware specifications to AI-backed software smarts. It&apos;s a premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphone</a> that you&apos;d want to take with you everywhere, and the good news is that you certainly can, without having to worry (too much) about it getting damaged.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Foldable smartphones</a> are complicated and intricately designed gadgets that need to be protected well from the elements if they are to keep working. That&apos;s why it&apos;s great that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is backed by an IP48 rating. This rating means that this thing can survive being submerged in up to 1.5 meters (approximately 5 feet) of water for around 30 minutes.</p><p>While that&apos;s reassuring, it&apos;s important to know that the above-mentioned rating only holds true for fresh water. This means that most natural water bodies (which usually have salt water) and swimming pools (which generally have chlorinated water) aren&apos;t recommended. You should also ensure to keep other liquids (e.g., oils, beverages) away from the smartphone. In case that does happen, make sure you immediately turn off the device and try to wipe/clean as much liquid as possible with a clean microfiber cloth. Once you do that, we suggest heading to your nearest Samsung authorized service center, as they know how to handle these situations the best.</p>

<p>The IP48 certification is a big step up if you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-vs-galaxy-z-fold-5" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. the Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, as the latter only comes with an IPX8 rating. This means that in addition to fresh water, Samsung&apos;s latest foldable is protected against solid particles (more than 1mm in size) as well.</p><p>Even though it&apos;s just launched, we&apos;re sure the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 will end up being one of the best foldable phones available out there. It&apos;s thinner and lighter despite having improved ingress protection and better durability. However, you can never be too careful with a smartphone this expensive, which is why we recommend getting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-cases" target="_blank">proper case</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-screen-protectors" target="_blank">good screen protector</a> as soon as you get the device.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung reports that it achieved 910,000 foldable units pre-ordered in South Korea, much smaller than its record-shattering number in 2023.</li><li>Pre-orders dropped by 10% with the Flip 6 making up 60% of the total and the Fold 6 rising to 40%.</li><li>Samsung's TM Roh informed reporters shortly after Unpacked that the company hopes to grow its foldable sales by 10% this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Early numbers indicate that Samsung&apos;s 2024 line of foldables isn&apos;t as popular when compared to the numbers achieved last year.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240719050428&ACE_SEARCH=1">The Korea Herald</a>, Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 have reached a pre-order peak much lower than last year (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_z_fold6_galaxy_z_flip6_south_korea_pre_order_numbers-news-63779.php">GSMArena</a>). The company reported 910,000 unit pre-orders for its foldable phones in South Korea. This reportedly marks a 10% decline in Galaxy foldable interest this year.</p><p>The Flip 6 makes up 60%, leaving the Fold 6 to pick up the remainder of the pre-order totals. The publication states this marks a 10% growth for the larger, book-style foldable.</p><p>However, everything isn&apos;t sour, as Samsung reported that it made gains with younger consumers. Numbers indicate that the company has done well in attracting consumers in their 20s to 30s, which the post states is Samsung&apos;s "target audience." Consumers within that age range make up "more than half" of the foldable pre-order numbers in 2024.</p><p>You might remember last year when Samsung boasted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-preorders-break-records-south-korea">record-shattering pre-order numbers</a> for the Flip 5 and Fold 5 in South Korea. The totals defied their expectations, reaching 1.02 million pre-ordered units. That number beat its previously held record of 970,000 units, which 2024&apos;s total misses by 60,000 devices.</p><p>The Flip 5 amounted to a whopping 70% of the sales, while its book-style partner achieved 30% in 2023.</p><p>Shortly after Unpacked, Samsung&apos;s Head of Mobile, TM Roh, spoke with reporters and offered insight into the hope <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discussed-foldable-sale-estimates-2024">surrounding its foldable sales</a>. Roh stated that Samsung wanted to grow its foldable sales by 10% following AI advancements with its Flip 6 and Fold 6. However, the company had quite a lackluster reveal of its new foldable line this year, showing that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/with-its-latest-foldables-samsung-proves-that-it-cant-innovate">its innovation has hit a snag</a>.</p><p>Neither device offers any notable or worthwhile hardware upgrades when compared to 2023. Moreover, both phones picked up an unsavory $100 increase.</p>

<p>We&apos;re entering peak launch season in the tech world, where there&apos;s something new right around the corner almost every other week. Samsung just kicked things off with the launch of the updated Galaxy Watch 7, along with a slew of other products. The new model promises more accurate health and wellness tracking, the latest software, and a more fluid usage experience. It&apos;s also priced the same as last year&apos;s model. </p><p>The OnePlus Watch 2, which launched earlier this year, is also priced the same and has a similar design and features. Its unique dual-identity for the processor and software helps it achieve incredible efficiency, which shows in the battery life. If you&apos;re looking at getting a new watch or thinking of upgrading, which one of these two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> should you pick?</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-vs-oneplus-watch-2-design-xa0-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 vs. OnePlus Watch 2: Design </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eQBqDky2XkE7PBWYDQekpQ" name="oneplus-watch-2-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 activity data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eQBqDky2XkE7PBWYDQekpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> and OnePlus Watch 2 have similar designs, with large circular dials, two physical buttons, and a traditional buckle-style clasp on the strap. The Watch 2 has a stainless steel chassis and only comes in a single 46mm size. This is a bit of a letdown, especially since those with smaller wrists might find it too large. </p><p>It&apos;s also on the heavier side, weighing 80g with the straps. It comes in two combos: Radiant Steel with a green rubber strap or Black Steel with a black rubber strap. OnePlus sells additional bands, or you can pick from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-oneplus-watch-2-bands">best Watch 2 bands</a> from other manufacturers. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6N2L9X9Q8U5PiMqQCXTmJm" name="oneplus-watch-2-3.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 side buttons on red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6N2L9X9Q8U5PiMqQCXTmJm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> is great. The 1.43-inch AMOLED panel has a high resolution and good brightness, and we didn&apos;t face any outdoor legibility issues when we tested it. It also has 2.5D sapphire crystal glass for better durability. The physical buttons on the watch have an asymmetrical design, which is said to have been inspired by vintage cars. </p><p>The rotating crown on the Watch 2 gives it a cool analog feel, but it&apos;s not functional, sadly. The second, more recessed button can be used to launch workouts or be programmed to do other things.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kLSPhFFayHEWQZWzUZRRmA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-buttons-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kLSPhFFayHEWQZWzUZRRmA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 comes in two sizes—40mm and 44mm—and each weighs 28.8g and 33.8g, respectively. Thanks to the aluminum frame, it&apos;s much lighter than the OnePlus Watch 2. The two sizes should also appeal to a wider audience. The larger variant comes in Green and Silver, while the smaller one is available in Green and Cream. </p><p>Samsung offers more options for watch straps with the Watch 7, including two sizes. You can choose between Fabric, Sport, or Athleisure options, and each type comes in multiple colors.  You can take this customization one step further with Watch Design Studio, which has even more colors to choose from. Finally, you get LTE or cellular options for both sizes, too. </p>

<p>Folks with smaller wrists will prefer the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7. It has a 1.3-inch Super AMOLED display, color always-on mode, and sapphire crystal for scratch protection. The 44mm version has all the same features but a larger 1.5-inch AMOLED screen and a higher resolution. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Dz67gBExkKy3Ef6RRBE6fA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-band-02.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dz67gBExkKy3Ef6RRBE6fA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 2 has a unique combination of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a> SoC and a BES2700BP chipset. The former powers Wear OS 4 tasks, while the latter handles the low-power RTOS and all the sensors. In our experience, the interface is fluid, and you never really notice the switch between the two chipsets. The Watch 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-how-many-updates">has been promised two Wear OS updates</a>, so it should be getting Wear OS 5, although OnePlus hasn&apos;t said when. </p><p>When we reviewed it, the software was very buggy. We faced issues receiving timely notifications, getting the DND mode to work, and when Sleep mode refused to engage. OnePlus did roll out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-watch-2-gets-relax-and-barometer-apps-with-new-update" target="_blank">big update</a> for the Watch 2 in May, which added two new apps and included bug fixes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vqm2SLjkKdMi7tqCdFodJR" name="oneplus-watch-2-19.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 DND mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vqm2SLjkKdMi7tqCdFodJR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 2 supports dual-frequency GPS for more accurate positioning when using it outdoors. There&apos;s also dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5 LE, and NFC. All the usual health tracking sensors are present, like an optical heart rate sensor, SpO2 monitoring, a geomagnetic sensor, and a barometer. There&apos;s no support for taking an ECG, though, which is a big miss. Apart from the accurate GPS, we didn&apos;t have the best experience with health tracking. The Watch 2 was consistently off, whether it was tracking calories burnt, sleep, or even stress. </p><p>Battery life is where the OnePlus Watch 2 really shines. It&apos;s rated to last 100 hours on one charge, which is more than four days. We managed to run it for just under three days with the always-on mode, which is still amazing and better than most other watches. Using the power saver mode, you should be able to get up to 12 days of use, and you can still receive notifications in this mode. The Watch 2 can be charged from empty to full in just over an hour, thanks to the 7.5W VOOC charging. </p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 features a new Exynos W1000 (3nm) SoC, which Samsung claims has a 3x faster CPU and 30% better power efficiency than the previous model. There&apos;s 32GB of storage this time, which is double what you got on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>. The Watch 7 has an impressive set of health and wellness monitoring features. Along with everything the OnePlus Watch 2 tracks, it can also detect irregular heart rhythm (AFib), blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiogram (ECG), and more. </p><p>The Watch 7 runs on One UI 6 Watch, which is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>, making it the first smartwatch to ship with Google&apos;s latest wearable software. It has a long list of fitness and activity tracking, Galaxy AI integration for more nuanced auto-generated replies, and double-pinch gestures for touchless interaction with your watch.  </p>

<p>A 425mAh battery is the largest you can get on the Galaxy Watch 7 (44mm). The smaller model has a 300mAh battery. It&apos;ll probably be tough to compete with the OnePlus Watch 2 here, which has a much larger 500mAh battery, but you should expect a respectable full day to even slightly more with the 40mm model. We&apos;ll know for certain once we&apos;ve tested it. </p><p>The Watch 7 has a slightly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/does-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-support-wireless-charging">different charging system</a> due to changes to the sensors and glass on the bottom of the watch. Samsung recommends using only the charger that comes with the watch, as it&apos;s not compatible with older Galaxy Watch chargers. The ability to charge it via a phone&apos;s reverse wireless charging feature is also not supported anymore.  </p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 would be my recommendation between the two watches. It&apos;s priced well, has good first-party customization options, and the wealth of activity and wellness tracking is commendable. It also comes in multiple sizes, and you can opt for a cellular version if you need it. Even though we&apos;re yet to test it, we have no doubt that it&apos;ll soon end up on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">best Samsung watch</a> list. </p><p>The OnePlus Watch 2 is a good option if you want the best battery life at this price point. It&apos;s also highly durable, looks very classy, and often retails for around $250. Health tracking wasn&apos;t the most accurate when we tested it, but this could all change with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-launch">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>. The watch features small tweaks to the current design and (hopefully) better sensors, so it could be one to consider.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it&apos;s nice to sit back and reminisce about the old days. You know, the days when smartphones included things like headphone jacks, microSD card slots, and even removable batteries. Back when smartphones were fun, in the days of Moto Maker, LG G3, the HTC One, and so many more. </p><p>It was definitely the Wild Wild West, but it was so enjoyable because there were so many options to choose from. I mean, we even had the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gpe">Google Play Edition</a> lineup, comprised of phones from Samsung, HTC, Motorola, and even Sony!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7M2xP2QsfR9tRXdbb8wiKc" name="moto-x-wood.jpg" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7M2xP2QsfR9tRXdbb8wiKc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Back in those days, we&apos;d see some wild and crazy designs as companies weren&apos;t afraid of taking chances. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-edge-review-0">Galaxy Note Edge</a> was pretty unique, but was Samsung&apos;s foray into the curved screens that we saw on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> until the Galaxy S24 Ultra, for better or worse. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-z">Moto Z</a> was so thin that I thought Motorola was going to have an iPhone 6S moment on its hands. Funnily enough, the Moto Z also seemingly laid the groundwork for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe</a>, but naturally, didn&apos;t take off in the same way.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TQGhg9cFkYhHgz9vo42HSn" name="samsung-galaxy-note-7-microsd-card.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 7 with microSD card" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TQGhg9cFkYhHgz9vo42HSn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We didn&apos;t have to worry about running out of storage because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot was there. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a> were around, but why splurge on those when you could just plug in your wired headphones sans dongle? </p><p>Sure, today, we have phones that fold and flip and don&apos;t need to carry a point-and-shoot camera. We just use the camera in our pockets or bags. That&apos;s all fine and dandy, but it hasn&apos;t been enough to make me completely forget about the past.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GuN2SkrWNzz32aJhmw2QyB" name="xreal-air-2-galaxy-z-fold-5-desk-setup-1.jpg" alt="Desk setup with Xreal Air 2, Galaxy Z Fold 5, and Mokibo keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GuN2SkrWNzz32aJhmw2QyB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And don&apos;t get me wrong. I wouldn&apos;t trade a foldable phone for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/htc-one-review-m8">HTC One M8</a>, even if the underlying hardware was modernized. I&apos;m extremely grateful for how far smartphones have come, more than 15 years after I got my very first smartphone. </p><p>Perhaps my biggest disappointment is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nokia-lg-downfall-made-phones-boring">phones just aren&apos;t as fun anymore</a>. Some of this has to do with the inability to get phones from Europe, Korea, or China in North America. Here, the flagship realm is just the Samsung and Apple show, with a sprinkling of Google and OnePlus.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Looking at what comes to other regions makes me feel like a kid staring out of the window, longing to go outside and play. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/global-foldable-market-share-q1-2024">Huawei</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-and-magic-vs3-foldables-announced">Honor</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-xiaomi-phones">Xiaomi</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo</a>, and others are churning out new phones that put what we have here in the States to shame. Xiaomi is even gearing up to release its first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip</a> rival. But the only way I&apos;ll be able to get my hands on it is to spend an exorbitant (to me) amount of money to have it imported. The same goes for the Vivo X Fold 3 Pro, with its 100W charging and <em>true</em> flagship camera system. </p>

<p>At the same time, I can&apos;t help but wonder about what the future holds for smartphones. Slabs are pretty much all the same and I couldn&apos;t really care less, with the exception being for phone companies to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">fix the displays</a> so my colleague Nick can enjoy them again.</p><p>I would venture to argue that we&apos;ve reached the pinnacle of what smartphones can do in terms of raw horsepower. Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 seems to just about check all of the boxes, as it&apos;s powerful <em>and</em> efficient with little sacrifice.</p><p>It&apos;s also likely why phone companies are now putting more effort into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">AI capabilities</a>. That&apos;s the next "great frontier," as only a little bit of those cool and new features are handled by the on-device NPU. The rest is done in the cloud, which is incredible in its own right, but not the point. </p>

<p>However, the tradeoff to gaining more powerful and efficient phones is that we lose all the features we once cared about, and we continue to pay the price as the cost of these devices increases. It costs money to manufacture processors, and chips like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> aren&apos;t cheap as chipmakers include newer, more capable NPUs that could result in steeper costs to OEMs. </p><p>On the one hand, we can now reap the benefits of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device processing</a> as a wave of new generative AI features emerges. Meanwhile, OEMs will continue to make the most of what little space they have in these phones to bring that power while chipping away at the things that used to make phones truly fun, then charge us more for it.</p><p>Before we know it, the Galaxy S27 Ultra Pro Max will be here with a price tag of $2,000. It&apos;ll have all of the bells and whistles, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-teases-generative-ai-plans-bixby">Bixby</a> will be able to read your mind and do things for you. But you know what it won&apos;t have? A headphone jack, microSD card, or removable battery.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Maybe I just haven&apos;t been paying attention, but it feels like it&apos;s been a while since we&apos;ve seen a good Visible deal on cheap wireless. Fortunately, the Verizon-owned carrier is attempting to change all that with this promotional offer that drops $5 and $10 off its Base and Plus plan, respectively. The catch is that the discount is only applied to your first two years of service, you have to be a new member, and you&apos;ll need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visible.com/deals"><strong>use the promo code CHAMP</strong></a> at checkout to receive the savings. It&apos;s as simple as that.  </p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="09e11d30-6543-4d66-906d-3e12d388c6f0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Visible Plus: $45/month" data-dimension48="Visible Plus: $45/month" href="https://www.visible.com/plans" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="5rgqZH7kan3tFdsiZ8tmZN" name="visible-logo-blue-background.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5rgqZH7kan3tFdsiZ8tmZN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Visible Plus: </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans" data-dimension112="09e11d30-6543-4d66-906d-3e12d388c6f0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Visible Plus: $45/month" data-dimension48="Visible Plus: $45/month"><del>$45/month</del> <strong>$35/month for two years with code CHAMP</strong></a></p>
<p>New members who join Visible today can score $10 off the Visible Plus plan every month for their first 24 months of service, just use the code CHAMP at checkout. </p>
<p>Powered by Verizon's vast 5G Ultra Wideband network, the Visible Plus plan comes with unlimited talk, text, and data, 50GB of premium data, an unlimited mobile hotspot, and a boat load of international perks. </p>
<p>If you don't need all of that extra stuff, you can still save $5/month for 24 months when you opt for Visible's basic plan. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.visible.com/plans" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="09e11d30-6543-4d66-906d-3e12d388c6f0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Visible Plus: $45/month" data-dimension48="Visible Plus: $45/month">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Although both of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-buyers-guide">Visible discounts</a> included in the promotion are a welcome sight, I&apos;m particularly interested in the $10 off Visible Plus deal. After all, we&apos;re talking about two years of one of the world&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">best unlimited data plans</a> for a mere $35 per month. With this offer, new customers are getting unlimited talk, text, and 5G data powered by Verizon, plus 50 GB of premium data, unlimited calls to Mexico, Canada, and 30 other countries, and unlimited texting to over 200 international destinations worldwide. Sure, you could get the same perks by going with a Big Three carrier, but you can expect to pay at least twice as much.</p><p>That being said, Visible isn&apos;t the only great alternative carrier on the block. Mint Mobile could be an even better option if you have good T-Mobile coverage in your area, and there are usually some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes">Mint deals</a> that could save you serious cash if you bundle the purchase of a new phone with your data plan. The battle between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-vs-mint-mobile">Mint Mobile and Visible</a> has been waging for years, but if you can get a good deal, there&apos;s really no bad option.</p>

<p>Consumers who&apos;ve ordered a Galaxy Buds 3 Pro following Unpacked are receiving bad news about their shipment.</p><p>Samsung has started emailing consumers who&apos;ve pre-ordered the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-suspend-shipments-3462708/">Android Authority</a> also received. The company informs consumers that they are "conducting a full quality control evaluation" of the Buds to "ensure all products meet our standards." This process is expected to result in a delay in the item arriving on your doorstep later in July.</p><p>Samsung states it will continue to update its consumers about the status of their Buds 3 Pro while this inspection continues.</p><p>However, certain problems surfaced as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20240718161700017?section=industry/electronics">Yonhap News</a> (Korean) reported the issues that users had reported to Samsung (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-sales-stopped-quality-3462125/">Android Authority</a>). Following the conclusion of the Unpacked reserve program, several early-access consumers reported problems, such as with the Buds having "different heights." Other issues surfaced about the earbuds tearing easily and other problems with its LED lights.</p><p>The Korean publication noted that Samsung had started informing customers that they could contact support and request an "exchange or a refund." Elsewhere, the company has pulled its Galaxy Buds 3 Pro off of various store websites like Amazon, Best Buy, and Samsung&apos;s official page.</p><p>After reaching out to Samsung for comment about the delay, Samsung responded with the following statement:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>There have been reports relating to a limited number of early production Galaxy Buds 3 Pro devices.

We are taking this matter very seriously and remain committed to meeting the highest quality standards of our products. We are urgently assessing and enhancing our quality control processes. 

To ensure all products meet our quality standards, we have temporarily suspended deliveries of Galaxy Buds3 Pro devices to distribution channels to conduct a full quality control evaluation before shipments to consumers take place.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p><figcaption><cite>Samsung</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
