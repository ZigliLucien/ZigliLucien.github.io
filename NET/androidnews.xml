                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>POCO continues to make the best budget phones, and the manufacturer is doing things a little differently with its latest launch. The X7 and X7 Pro are now available globally, and the latter model is particularly interesting, as POCO teamed up with Marvel to release an exclusive variant of the device, dubbed the POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition. <br><br>I'm a big fan of these limited-edition models, and OnePlus used to do a terrific job rolling out unique designs in the past with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-5t-star-wars-review">OnePlus 5T Star Wars</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-6-avengers-edition">OnePlus 6 Avengers</a>, OnePlus 6T and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-7t-pro-mclaren-edition">7T Pro McLaren</a> models, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-nord-2-pac-man-edition">Nord 2 Pac-Man</a> variant. It's exciting to see POCO get in on the action with the X7 Pro, and what's notable here is that the brand is doing so on a budget phone, making the device much more accessible to a wider audience.</p>

<p>That said, POCO isn't launching the X7 Pro Iron Man Edition in India, its biggest consumer market — the phone is instead debuting in select Asian countries. It is available in a single 12GB/512GB model, and costs $399. The base model of the X7 Pro, meanwhile, costs $299, with the 512GB model selling at $369, so you're basically paying $30 additionally for the Iron Man Edition.</p><p>With that out of the way, let's talk about the design. POCO clearly paid a lot of attention to small details, with the SIM card ejector in the box styled to look like an Arc Reactor.</p>

<p>The packaging itself is done really well, and it has a "mechanical lift structure" that's meant to mimic the feel of "donning Stark's armor," and you get a cutout highlighting blueprints of Iron Man's suit. There's a case included in the box that does a good job reinforcing the device while simultaneously showing off that design at the back.</p>

<p>Coming to the phone itself, the X7 Pro Iron Man Edition has a distinctive back design with red and gold hues, with the Iron Man helmet prominently highlighted. The helmet is housed within a stylized Arc Reactor, and the rest of the back has a "3D relief enhanced with platinum detailing" that does a great job accentuating the design.</p>

<p>POCO used a tiered system to create a sense of dimension to the design at the back, and the effect is rather interesting. "Thanks to the sophisticated layout of the tiered platinum serrations inside, the shining finish has been perfected for an even brighter, more sparkling look, creating a sense of dimensionality that mirrors the detailed craftsmanship of Stark's engineering. While using a combination of matte and gloss finishes with a sparkling sand texture, the helmet reflects a subtle brilliance under light, while the Arc Reactor's intricate patterns appear both powerful and precise."</p>

<p>While my immediate reaction after taking the device out of the box was that it looked a little tacky, I don't feel the same after using the phone for a week. POCO did a great job with the overall aesthetic of the X7 Pro Iron Man Edition, and the red accents around the cameras at the back and the power button distinguish the design quite a bit. You also get the Avengers logo at the bottom with the POCO logo located at the top, and both of these are decked out in gold, adding a nice bit of contrast.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LRsen3ZbCKHuTvAq74kgVY" name="POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition" alt="POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LRsen3ZbCKHuTvAq74kgVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sides have a boxier design, but there are subtle curves, and I didn't see any issues with usability. That's mostly down to the matte texture on the sides, which just makes it easier to hold and use the device. Other niceties include custom backgrounds and an icon pack that has red borders, which is preinstalled. While I like the backgrounds, the icon pack is too distracting, and thankfully, you can easily switch it out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6KMx4ie3vCYCmbKGnWsndY" name="POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition" alt="POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition home page with custom background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6KMx4ie3vCYCmbKGnWsndY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rest of the hardware is identical to the X7 Pro. You get a 6.67-inch AMOLED panel with 120Hz refresh and 1920Hz DC dimming, and it is backed by Corning's Gorilla Glass 7i.</p>

<p>The phone is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 8400 Ultra, and you get 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. The phone doesn't run demanding games at the highest setting, but it is decent enough in its category, and I didn't see many issues in this area. I'll go into much more detail in my review, but as a teaser, I'm including synthetic testing scores above.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="haCgJeB5HGYyDcepJHf4cY" name="POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition" alt="POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition back view next to bookmark" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/haCgJeB5HGYyDcepJHf4cY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the cameras, there's a 50MP Sony IMX882 that serves as the main shooter, and it's joined by an 8MP wide-angle, with POCO sensibly choosing to limit the device to two good sensors. There's a 6000mAh battery with 90W charging, and interestingly enough, the Indian model of the X7 Pro gets a bigger 6500mAh battery. The Iron Man Edition is based on the global variant, so it has a 6000mAh battery. Rounding out the hardware, you get IP68 ingress protection, NFC, IR blaster, and a decent vibration motor.</p>

<p>On the software side of things, the phone runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box, which gives it a distinct edge over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-14-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 14 Pro+</a>, a device that costs $150 more.</p><p>Overall, I really like what POCO did with the X7 Pro Iron Man Edition. The brand put a lot of thought into the design of the phone as well as the packaging, and it doesn't have an absurd premium over the standard X7 Pro. I would have liked to see the device in India, but outside of that, I don't really have anything to fault with the device — it is one of the best limited-edition models I used recently.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Nubia is best-known for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z60-ultra-review">Z60 Ultra</a> and the latest Z70 Ultra (which I'm reviewing), but the ZTE sub-brand also makes budget phones in select regions, and its latest device has a unique attraction. The Nubia Music 2 is a fairly standard entry-level phone; it has a 6.7-inch LCD panel that goes up to 120Hz, a Unisoc T7200 chipset with outdated Cortex A75 and A55 cores, 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, 50MP camera, 5000mAh battery, and 10W charging. <br><br>Why am I interested in this device, you ask? Because of the built-in audio. The Music 2 includes three full-range speakers, and it produces sound up to 95dB. You get a speaker at the bottom and one up top, and a third driver located at the back. If that isn't enough, you even get LED lights around the rear speaker, and there's a 3.5mm jack as well as a MicroSD slot. <br></p>
<p>The ancient chipset coupled with limited memory means the Music 2 isn't a particularly good phone by any measure, but it costs the equivalent of just $88 (MYR389) in Malaysia. I can see this device being a good digital audio player thanks to the built-in sound and inclusion of a 3.5mm jack, and you get Android 14 out of the box — most digital players I use still run Android 10 or Android 12, so this is an upgrade in that area. <br><br>The phone is now available in Malaysia and should be heading to select Asian markets. There are obviously much better options around if you need a new phone, but if you want something that doubles as a digital audio player, this looks like a decent enough choice, and I'll see if I can get my hands on one — for testing, obviously.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus is offering a competitive warranty guarantee for OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R devices purchased in India before Feb. 13, 2025.</li><li>The promise entitles buyers in India to get a one-time, free replacement if their device suffers from a hardware defect in the first 180 days.</li><li>This policy is in addition to the lifetime display warranty for OnePlus phones in India, which is meant to address the green-line issues that have affected them in the past.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> is a standout flagship phone, and Android Central's own tester gave it a rare 5/5 score in his review. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-makes-a-bold-move-to-tackle-green-line-issues-once-and-for-all">prior OnePlus flagships have been plagued by green-line display issues</a>, and that might give you pause before buying the OnePlus 13. That's why OnePlus is going above and beyond with an offer to replace — not repair — the OnePlus 13 if you experience a hardware issue in the first six months, but there's a catch.</p><p>The impressive warranty guarantees are only available in India, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13-13r-180-day-replacement-guarantee-3514312/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. Here's how it works: if you buy a OnePlus 13 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-13r-launch">OnePlus 13R</a> in India before Feb. 13, 2025, you'll be entitled to a one-time free device replacement if you experience a hardware issue in your first 180 days with the smartphone. That extends beyond most normal warranty guarantees, which typically cover repairs or refurbished replacements if something goes wrong.</p><p>In other words, this generous warranty guarantee for Indian customers is sure to make those in other regions a bit jealous of what they're missing. For reference, OnePlus' U.S. policy allows for refunds and replacements 15 days after purchase, plus a one-year limited warranty. There's nothing quite like what OnePlus is offering in India.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="5he6VsnBsFWKWmWnE3isk7" name="OnePlus-13-and-13R-180-day-phone-replacement-plan-1920w-1440h.jpg" alt="The phone replacement plan for the OnePlus 13." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5he6VsnBsFWKWmWnE3isk7.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority / OnePlus India)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If that wasn't enough, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1743847105291616260?irclickid=xwZ2ZnQ5mxyKTjsxSSw78yEIUks0l8xBMxZlR40&irgwc=1&utm_source=impact&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_content=Future%20PLC.&utm_term=ac-us&utm_campaign=12532" target="_blank">OnePlus offers a lifetime display warranty</a> for customers in India. Again, there's nothing like it offered globally, but that's partly because the display failures have disproportionately affected phones in that region. These two guarantees to customers in India may help give some peace of mind to people who have had negative experiences with OnePlus hardware failures in the past.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3609px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JcEaHVNMj4cnvWYMBZ2h2D" name="samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-green-line-lifestyle-3.jpg" alt="Green line of death on the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JcEaHVNMj4cnvWYMBZ2h2D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3609" height="2030" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The green line on a Samsung Galaxy phone.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it would be nice to see OnePlus extend these promises to global markets, it's probably best not to hold your breath. OnePlus' current warranty guarantees in North America align similarly with its other competitors, like Apple and Samsung. However, at a time when the brand would likely love to earn more North American market share, a warranty policy that went above and beyond could go a long way.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When Samsung announced the Galaxy S24 with Galaxy AI last January, many of us noticed a conspicuous lack of marketing for the company's terrible virtual assistant, Bixby. While Bixby had some useful features for a while — like real-time translation or text scanning — it often felt redundant alongside Google Assistant and Gemini, which both offer a plethora of features and better voice recognition than Bixby ever had.</p><p>But Bixby's big return seems to be inevitable as the teaser for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Samsung Unpacked 2025</a> — which will see the announcement of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a> on January 22, 2025 — all but confirms. In the 16-second video, which you can watch below, a voice speaks to a familiar-looking microphone icon, asking it when Samsung Galaxy Unpacked takes place.</p><p>The invitation notes that we'll see "the next evolution of Galaxy AI," which will be "more natural and intuitive." Traditionally, that's been a code phrase for voice activation, and it lines up perfectly with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-major-gen-ai-bixby-rework-arrives" target="_blank">the new Bixby we saw launch</a> on China's exclusive Galaxy W series in November.</p>

<p>This move is a curious one since Samsung used the Galaxy S24 series to deliver a public show of its strong relationship with Google by including many new Google search and AI features first. Features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> didn't appear on other Android phones for months, and Samsung phones have often been used as launch platforms (along the Pixel series) for Gemini advancements throughout the year.</p><p>While it's possible that Samsung developed a lot of the new Bixby features specifically for the Chinese market — Google services are banned in China, after all — Samsung was among the first smartphone companies to launch a major new AI computing platform with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, and it would make sense for the company to continue developing its ecosystem with a predictive voice assistant for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>.</p><p>Samsung says the new Bixby can "deeply perceive" what a user wants, as well as maintain a sharp understanding through multi-step instructions. This sounds a lot like what Gemini and ChatGPT can do, but it's not clear if Samsung is tapping into either service or if it's Samsung's own Large Language Model (LLM) running the show.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung says the new Bixby can "deeply perceive" what a user wants, as well as maintain a sharp understanding through multi-step instructions.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Samsung is also said to be upgrading Bixby's understanding capabilities so it can "cleverly integrate text and video" into the conversation. The new Bixby also upgrades office document editing and generation, letting users generate entire Word, PowerPoint, and other documents based on their needs.</p><p>OnePlus recently launched something similar with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, allowing users to generate entire documents based on short ideas, but Samsung's Bixby will likely integrate more voice-driven commands into the equation.</p><p>While a lot of this sounds "nice," it's anyone's guess for now as to how often it'll actually be used by Galaxy users on a regular basis. I don't know a single person who enjoyed using Bixby when Samsung pushed it as the default assistant on its devices, and I can't see generative AI changing people's minds and making them want to use it more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZXEqXTh6mbDK3VRNheBtX7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-dbrand-lineup-renders" alt="Galaxy S25 lineup renders with Dbrand skins" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZXEqXTh6mbDK3VRNheBtX7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>I certainly don't think anyone wants a new Bixby and would rather just see it go away forever. That said, I do think Samsung can make the most of this opportunity to further push its edge in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">offline AI computing</a>. The company recently announced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-next-gen-model-gauss-2-ai-model-reveal">new offline AI model</a> that's designed to "integrate into products to deliver higher levels of convenience and personalization.”</p><p>If that doesn't sound like a new voice assistant model, I don't know what does.</p><p>Samsung is one of the few companies that offers users the option to only process AI-related tasks on-device, even if that means some features are slower or unavailable for use. It allows users to prioritize local computing and privacy over more feature-rich cloud processing.</p>
<p>It also presents the possibility of having AI features long term, as cloud-based AI capabilities like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> require users to pay a monthly subscription fee to maintain server costs. If Samsung has any edge in the AI game, it's this offline processing functionality and a more mature backend software stack thanks to how quickly it moved to integrate AI into its phones.</p><p>But Samsung needs to be careful here. Adding another annoying virtual assistant to a phone that's already chock full of confusing and sometimes redundant features is a recipe for frustration. People don't want two gallery apps. They don't want two assistant apps. And they definitely don't want more AI to raise the price of their phones for the third year in a row.</p><p>The question is if Samsung is listening to users or just its investors, and I'm not fully convinced it's the former.</p>

<ul><li>A recent leak revealed that the Samsung S25 Ultra will be able to capture better videos in low-light settings.</li><li>IceUniverse said this feature will be highly reliant on the capabilities of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.</li><li>The device is also rumored to get an upgraded camera system and sensors that would capture smooth shots in low light ambiance.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We're just weeks away from Samsung's yearly Galaxy Unpacked event set for Jan. 22, and it's raining S25 leaks. The most recent one gives us the scoop on the S25 Ultra's video recording abilities.</p><p>Prominent leaker IceUniverse took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/P8w4MdES1" target="_blank">Weibo</a> to reveal that the upcoming Samsung S25 Ultra will boast camera abilities that will help it capture better videos in low-light settings (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-low-light-video-improvements-3514370/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). This could be attributed to two things, one of which is that the new device is said to come with enhanced cameras.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to come with a 200MP main camera, 50MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and the new 50MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom.</p><p>The leaker added a second factor, which is that the low-light upgrade will be highly dependent on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>'s capabilities, as the chip is rumored to power the upcoming phone. Because of this, the leaker says these improvements would not make it to last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1310px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.53%;"><img id="AyCSsK7FTwcCwmmdMnZBQ3" name="IceUniverse-leak-screenshot" alt="Samsung's functionality with low light videos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyCSsK7FTwcCwmmdMnZBQ3.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1310" height="1055" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: IceUniverse/Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ice Universe was the one that also leaked in November 2024 that the S25 series would come with the above chipset, although Samsung has not yet confirmed as much. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-seemingly-confirms-the-galaxy-s25-series-will-have-a-snapdragon-8-elite-chip" target="_blank">Qualcomm seemingly put these rumors to rest</a> this week when it replied to Samsung on the Unpacked tweet, saying, "See you there." This gave us a subtle confirmation about the core of the S25 series.</p><p>That aside, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is expected to bring in higher video quality, and the Ultra model is said to come with 8K HDR at 60fps and 4K at 120fps when compared to a lower 8K HDR at 30fps, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. Higher frame rates mean video movements that are smoother and more fluid in 8K HDR on the new S 25 Ultra— presumably in low-light settings as well. As Samsung continuously touts low-light improvements, it'll be interesting to see how it pushes the envelope this time.</p><p>Of course, we ought to take these leaks with a grain of salt until the official announcement later this month at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Galaxy Unpacked</a> where Samsung will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-release-date">launch the Galaxy S25 series</a>. But with all the other factors falling in place, the Ultra will likely shoot better low-light videos.</p><p>We'll be tuning in to Samsung Unpacked on Jan. 22, but until then, you can check out our<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide"> Galaxy S25 guide</a> for more about what we expect from this year's flagships.</p>

<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25 lineup</a> will be revealed at the company's Galaxy Unpacked event, slated for Jan. 22. However, you don't have to wait for the official unveiling if you want a peek at the Galaxy S25 default wallpapers. A leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1876950194601775585" target="_blank">AllAboutSamsung's Max Jambor on X (formerly Twitter)</a> reveals what are claimed to be the official, high-resolution wallpapers that will ship on Samsung's next-generation flagships.</p><p>The two wallpapers shared by Jambor depict a stylistic "S" pattern, clearly an homage to the Galaxy S brand. The shape of the curves of the S in the wallpaper could also be resembling the material surrounding the Galaxy S25 rear camera lenses. Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, the Galaxy S25 series is expected to feature DSLR-style accents around its back camera sensors.</p><p>Aside from those two callbacks, the rumored Galaxy S25 wallpapers are quite simple in nature. They're shown in blue and gray gradients, but more may be available to match every unique Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra colorway.</p>

<ul><li>Google Home is testing expanded presence sensing support for more smart home devices.</li><li>The feature can now consider the media playback statuses of other devices, like game consoles or smart displays.</li><li>You can try out this feature today in the Google Home app public preview.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's presence sensing features make it possible to set up home and away automations for your smart home devices based on your location. To date, the most reliable way to use presence sensing is to have every household member opt-into geofence location sharing. The way it works is simple — if everyone leaves the house, your away automations can run, and vice versa.</p><p>Now, there's a few new data points presence sensing can consider, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/08/google-home-presence-sensing/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. Beginning as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home app</a> public preview, presence sensing can take into account the status of your smart home devices to detect whether you're home or away, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12494697#zippy=%2Cuse-smart-media-devices-for-presence-sensing" target="_blank">support document</a>.</p><p>"You can now use your smart media devices for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/10000312" target="_blank">presence sensing</a>," the support document for this public preview feature explains. "Your media devices can contribute to presence sensing with media status, such as when they detect media playback or when you turn them on or off."</p>

<p>Google says the following types of smart home devices can be used for this presence sensing test:</p>
<ul><li>Smart speakers and displays</li><li>TVs (including Google streaming devices)</li><li>Game consoles</li><li>Streaming sticks and boxes</li></ul>
<p>You can turn presence sensing on or off for a specific device in the Google Home app. Tap <strong>Settings </strong>><strong> Presence sensing</strong> to view the list of eligible devices, and then press the toggle beside one to turn it on or off. By default, smart speakers and displays will automatically report media playback status if you've already turned on presence sensing for those devices.</p><p>These data points, while not foolproof, can help Google Home figure out if anyone is home or if everyone is away. Chances are, if someone just casted a video to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-review">Google Nest Hub display</a>, there's probably someone at home. Conversely, if nothing is playing, that could be a sign no one is home.</p><p>You can try this presence sensing feature by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-gemini-help-me-create-public-preview">opting-into the Google Home app public preview</a>. To do so, open the Google Home app, then tap <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Public Preview </strong>> <strong>Join Public Preview</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google surprisingly played a significant role in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-wrapped-2024-arrives">Spotify's Wrapped 2024 experience with Audio Overviews</a>, an AI-generated podcast that recapped your year in music leveraging <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">NotebookLM</a>. Now, the company is testing out a Search Labs feature that would let you recap your daily news in a similar way. Instead of revisiting your Spotify playback history, this experimental "Daily Listen" feature sums up your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-personalize-google-discover-feed">Google Discover feed</a> in a five-minute audio podcast.</p><p>Google Discover, a news aggregator that appears in the Google app and Android, has quickly become a popular way for people to find stories. Taking account your Discover and Search history, Daily Listen will pick the articles that are most interesting to you and review them in audio form (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/08/google-discover-daily-listen/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The test is starting as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-labs-english-speaking-practice-ai-experiment">Search Labs feature</a>, which you may be able to participate in by tapping the Labs icon in the top-left corner of the Google app. From there, look for the Daily Listen card to opt-in. It's available to Google app users on iOS and Android in the U.S., but may not show up for everyone immediately.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="fkTHpi4xhV4ETNBLoVAfQm" name="Google-Daily-Listen-lab.jpg" alt="The experimental Daily Listen feature in Discover." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fkTHpi4xhV4ETNBLoVAfQm.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After opting-into Daily Listen, users can expect it to take about a day for the first audio recap to appear in the Google app. When available, it'll show as a block on the Google app homepage, between the Search bar and the Discover feed. Tapping it will start the podcast-like experience, fully featured with playback controls and timestamps.</p><p>The Daily Listen experiment, albeit only a test at the moment, appears to be yet another step by Google toward the so-called "zero-click internet." By summing up Discover posts in audio form, Google app users may have less incentive to navigate to the website providing the information recapped in Daily Listen episodes. This tracks with other Search Labs features, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overview-save-feature-expansion">AI Overviews</a>, which have since been opened up to the public.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, the OnePlus 13 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">was awarded a rare perfect score</a> from senior smartphone expert Nicholas Sutrich yesterday, and that is no small feat. The flagship device boasts a gorgeous 6.8-inch OLED display with an unbelievable 6,000mAh battery and the efficiency of the new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. It&apos;s also the first phone to sport IP69 water/dust resistance, and you get a ton of fun features thanks to Oxygen OS 15. So, yeah, not only is the phone OnePlus&apos; greatest creation, but it&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> ever built, period.</p><p>The only reason I would skip the OnePlus 13 is if you need more than six years of software support or you simply prefer devices from Samsung or Google. You also need to be connected to the internet to use a lot of the phone&apos;s AI features, but these minor weaknesses pale in comparison to the OnePlus 13&apos;s many, many strengths. </p>

<ul><li>Samsung's vice chairman, Han Jong-hee, announced that the company will begin a phone subscription service under its "AI Subscription Club."</li><li>This service pertains to South Korean residents only as Samsung has said whether the U.S. or other markets will see the Club or the phone plan.</li><li>Han Jong-hee also announced that Samsung's robotic companion, Ballie, will arrive in Korea and the U.S. in the "first half" of 2025.</li><li>Samsung's Galaxy S25 series is preparing to debut on January 22.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is reportedly preparing to reveal the details of its proposed smartphone subscription service.</p><p>The report arrives courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.etnews.com/20250108000240">EtNews</a> (Korean), which cites Samsung's vice chairman, Han Jong-hee, from a recent CES 2025 press conference (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338974/samsung-galaxy-subscription-smartphones-ballie">The Verge</a>). According to Han, the company is preparing to bring a smartphone subscription option to its "AI Subscription Club" in South Korea. The vice chairman said, "We will apply the subscription service to Galaxy smartphones starting next month."</p><p>So, it seems consumers in Samsung's home region of South Korea can expect this new phone option to appear sometime in February.</p><p>The publication adds that bringing Samsung's Galaxy phones to its subscription service will surface no possibilities for Korean consumers. In short, consumers will have access to "maintenance services" — for repairs — in an installment plan that works for them.</p><p>Samsung notably launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/%EC%82%BC%EC%84%B1%EC%A0%84%EC%9E%90-ai-%EA%B5%AC%EB%8F%85%ED%81%B4%EB%9F%BD-%EC%8B%9C%EC%9E%91">AI Subscription Club</a> on December 1, letting users engage in AI-powered home appliances for a set period. The plan, which is set to include phones, seems reminiscent of purchasing a contract phone from a cellular provider. This is something the vice chairman noted, as well, as the publication states "It is expected to have a positive effect on improving the sales performance of mobile devices at Samsung Store." Consumers can instead slowly pay off a device in smaller amounts, instead of dropping a chunk of cash at once.</p><p>Han Jong-hee adds that South Korea <em>and </em>the U.S. can soon expect the arrival of its personal robot, Ballie. The bot is expected to arrive in the "first half" of 2025. Those in South Korea will see the bot available via the AI Subscription Club, as well, if consumers would like to avoid a complete purchase.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meet #Ballie, Samsung’s human-centric vision of robots that takes personalized care to the next level. The small rolling robot, “understands you, supports you, and reacts to your needs.” #CES2020 #SamsungCES2020 pic.twitter.com/YzwgZN1Lgw<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1214387430092165120">January 7, 2020</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>With Samsung's South Korean consumers preparing for this phone subscription service, it's unclear if folks anywhere else will see it. Other regions would need Samsung's AI Subscription Club — that's for sure, but Han Jong-hee didn't allude to anything of the sort. So, for right now, it's probably best to not hold your breath about it.</p><p>In other news, Samsung's Ballie was first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-ces-2020">highlighted five years ago</a> during CES 2020. The small, rollable home companion was showcased in a video turning the TV on and cleaning up floor messes. Ballie was also stated to follow its owner around with cute chirps alongside the ability to understand and adhere to voice commands.</p><p>For home security, Ballie was also equipped with a camera, meaning users could check in on their house when away. The first half of 2025 includes January to June, so we have a few months before we see this little bot.</p><p>While U.S. users aren't getting in on this phone subscription, we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25 launch</a> in our immediate future. Samsung's January Unpacked is set to get going on January 22 with the Galaxy S25 series, One UI 7, and more likely on deck.</p>

<p>At the center of it all is a new back-end algorithm OnePlus plainly calls Dual Exposure, where each frame is composed of two instantaneous captures: one long exposure and one short. The combination results in photos that have punchy contrast, incredibly moving object clarity, and extremely wide dynamic range when called for.</p><p>On top of that, OnePlus is using two brand new Sony LYT sensors, helping deliver the best image quality possible on its main and telephoto sensors. This, combined with a tweaked camera UI and improved AI-powered software stack, allows incredible clarity up to 30X zoom, as well as impressive tricks like 4K 60FPS Dolby Vision capture on all four cameras.</p><p>Overall, it's a huge win for the company that fought to prove itself as a contender in mobile photography for years with its Hasselblad branding. Now, OnePlus can stand tall alongside that H on the back of the OnePlus 13 knowing it's got one of the finest mobile cameras available today.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motion-capture"><span>Motion capture</span></h2>
<p>For years, I've weighed motion capture more highly than any other metric when judging a smartphone's camera system. Any camera can take good enough photos in almost any lighting condition now, but only a select few can get the job done when a person or pet isn't willing to hold still.</p><p>OnePlus talked up a big game during the OnePlus 13's announcement, saying it finally solved the motion capture problem. While standard image capture works well for moving objects, action mode, and clear burst are the best solutions for ensuring you capture the moment.</p><p>In standard photo mode, the OnePlus 13 impressed with a complete lack of shutter lag. Very few phones do this well — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> is a great example of getting it right — while phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> have a rather horrible shutter lag that feels like it takes "forever" to capture a photo after pressing the shutter button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="QBEetobWgoaY2uMAhS3yHM" name="oneplus-13-camera-sample-night-motion" alt="A low light camera sample from a OnePlus 13 showcasing excellent motion capture detail (see the bowling ball traveling down the lane)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QBEetobWgoaY2uMAhS3yHM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The above photo is a perfect example of what can be captured by simply opening the camera app and tapping the shutter button. Not only is this a low-light environment, but the bowling ball in the middle of the frame was moving down the lane at the time of capture.</p><p>Because of OnePlus's excellent new dual exposure algorithm, though, the ball has been captured in crisp detail. It even did an excellent job of balancing the exposure throughout the scene, while some phones might underexpose the photo in order to capture the moving object best.</p><p>The improvement over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>'s camera can be seen at times like these, as that bowling ball would be blurrier when captured on last year's OnePlus flagship. This difference even occurs during the day, as you can see in the two images of a moving carousel ride below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:37.49%;"><img id="kRK3hnSbS2btMxgH7QpuWG" name="oneplus-13-camera-motion-capture-versus-1" alt="Comparing motion capture of the OnePlus 13's camera versus the OnePlus 12 by photographing a moving carousel during the day" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kRK3hnSbS2btMxgH7QpuWG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4092" height="1534" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Using Action Mode bumps the camera viewfinder up from 30FPS to 60FPS, making it easier to time the moment when you tap the shutter button. Better yet, rapidly tapping the shutter button or just holding it down will activate "clear burst" mode, which delivers multiple dual exposure captures per second. This works in bright or dim light equally as well.</p><p>It also works on <em>all</em> of the phone's rear cameras, so you can capture action mode shots at any zoom level or even using the ultrawide camera. As evidenced in the comparison below using at 3X zoom in the camera's viewfinder, OnePlus's action mode is particularly effective even when compared to the Google Pixel 9 Pro's very capable cameras.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="850" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=3731bbc4-cd2b-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>The OnePlus 13 nailed the exposure and color temperature of the scene, plus captured every movement in crystal clear detail. Thanks to action mode, it was easier to capture the moment mid-swing, while the Pixel 9 Pro automatically chose the least blurry photo it captured when I tapped the shutter button.</p><p>For reference, Pixel phones are always taking photos even before you tap the shutter button, and they automatically pick the best frame based on AI analysis on the back end. When using action mode and Clear Burst on a OnePlus 13, you can select from a handful of images captured during the image-taking process, giving you far better manual control after taking a photo.</p><p>The OnePlus 13's action mode also holds up well in lower light, as this second example of my son jumping off the top bunk of his bed shows. The OnePlus 13's photo is overexposed around the light source, but the rest of the scene looks excellent. Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro's photo is underexposed throughout the image, even if it nailed the highlights around the light on the ceiling.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="850" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=5bf88500-cd30-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-zoom-detail"><span>Zoom detail</span></h2>
<p>The OnePlus 13 not only uses a huge new Sony LYT-600 50MP 1/1.95-inch sensor, but it packs the sensor behind a new triple-prism lens that's 24% flatter and 30% lighter than the one on the OnePlus 12. Like a lot of companies, OnePlus is baking AI right into the photo capture, ensuring that the 3X lens performs a lot better than it might seem at first.</p><p>I can see this being a controversial decision because there are some fairly obvious "AI-looking" enhancements in regular photos. I don't think it detracts from photos, and OnePlus isn't the only company doing this, but phones like a Pixel 9 Pro will produce a more natural image even if it's of lower quality in some situations.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="470" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=ea71ef56-cdc6-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>The OnePlus 13 shots are almost always of higher contrast than shots from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">competing Android phones</a>, giving them a distinct look. Many of the phone's photos look best on the phone's display because of the enhanced HDR represented by the Pro XDR capture, which is enabled by default. Exporting photos or editing them often removes this Pro XDR layer, making them slightly lower quality than the original capture.</p><p>This is similar to how HDR video captured on the phone will often look better than after it's posted on social media or other platforms. This isn't OnePlus's fault, but it can affect the end result.</p><p>At night, the extra contrast and punchiness of the OnePlus 13's photos really shine. This 20X zoom photo comparison with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra shows that off particularly well, as the OnePlus 13's colors look richer and more accurate than the washed-out ones on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. The OnePlus 13 also nails the exposure, giving the scene more moodiness and keeping the lights from being blown out.</p>

<p>One area OnePlus needs to improve is with direct frame crops which occur at both 2x and 6x. The 2x button crops the main sensor by 50%, while the 6x button does the same with the telephoto sensor. Typically, companies call this an "optical zoom equivalent" because there's no real digital zooming happening, and, instead, the number of binned pixels is just cut in half.</p><p>However, the OnePlus 13 appears to be doing some extra processing at these two zoom levels, which doesn't do it any favors. Compared to the OnePlus 12's 2x photo of the same subject, the OnePlus 13's photo looks heavily digitally processed. This didn't <em>always</em> happen, but I never saw this behavior on the OnePlus 12, so the company needs to tweak the algorithm a bit for these specific zoom levels.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-night-light"><span>Night light</span></h2>
<p>One of the chief complaints about modern smartphone photography is that too many phones make night photos look like daytime photos. Pixels and Galaxy phones are particularly bad about this, and thankfully, OnePlus doesn't seem to suffer from this issue the vast majority of the time.</p><p>I've taken hundreds of low-light photos with these phones and have been supremely impressed with the OnePlus 13's ability to make a nighttime photo actually look like it's <em>nighttime</em>. This photo of a giant Christmas tree in the park taken from the ultrawide angle lens perfectly illustrates that.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="850" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=98fc9574-cd38-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>The OnePlus 13's photo here is the epitome of perfection. Everything is right, from the exposure to the contrast, the color temperature, and even the fine details on the sign at the base of the tree. The Pixel 9 Pro tried to pull out as much shadow detail as possible, which is admirable, but it ended up making the photo look far brighter than it was in real life.</p><p>Since nighttime photography typically ends up requiring longer exposures, the OnePlus 13's new dual exposure algorithm helps the phone capture anything that might be moving during that long exposure. This shot of the moonlight reflecting on the open ocean, taken from the side of a cruise ship, perfectly illustrates that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.43%;"><img id="cdK6PZJyAVoRNPgWy4mum5" name="oneplus-13-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-night-ocean" alt="A photo taken from the deck of a ship at night, looking at the moon reflecting off the ocean, comparing the OnePlus 13 to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cdK6PZJyAVoRNPgWy4mum5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4096" height="1820" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notice how the waves are super crisp and detailed on the OnePlus 13, while the Pixel 9 Pro and Galaxy S24 Ultra's shots exhibit double imaging or blurriness. This kind of motion clarity is consistent with the shot of the bowling ball rolling down the lane in the dimly lit bar at the beginning of this article.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-selfies-and-portraits"><span>Selfies and portraits</span></h2>
<p>OnePlus phones have had a very good portrait mode for quite some time now, but I've called Samsung the king of portrait mode several years in a row. That being said, OnePlus is giving Samsung (and Honor) a run for its money with the OnePlus 13's enhanced Hasselblad portrait mode, which does an even better job of subtly separating the subject from the background.</p><p>In the first shot, I used the widest portrait zoom I could get from each phone to capture myself in a dashing surfer Santa statue. Clearly, Santa needs to work on his beach bod, but there are two standouts in this comparison.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro did a great job of blurring the background in the top half of the picture but the bottom half's blurred background is a bit messy. The cutout between the surfboard and Santa's leg is nonexistent, while lower down the leg, the edge of the cutout is very messy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.43%;"><img id="BDNX2VZA8CDhyYphXgHPtL" name="oneplus-13-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-night-portrait" alt="Comparing the OnePlus 13, Samsung Galaxy S24, and Google Pixel 9 Pro's rear camera portrait modes using a nighttime shot of a surfer Santa" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BDNX2VZA8CDhyYphXgHPtL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4096" height="1820" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13's lighting is considerably better than the other two phones with better colors and highlights all around. It also subtly blurred the background all around Santa and the surfboard and did an excellent job of the cutout all around. The blur depth is configurable in the viewfinder, but this is the default setting. The one issue with this shot is the surfboard pattern, which lacks detail compared to the other two phones' shots.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra's shot is the most detailed but it's also the darkest and has no portrait mode blurring at all. It also exhibits some nasty sensor noise that Samsung's algorithm tried to clean up by my face, in particular, looks extremely digitally processed.</p><p>Samsung's front-facing camera fared much better in this same scenario when I took a selfie in front of the giant Christmas tree right near the surfer Santa. While I like how the OnePlus 13's photo came out, the punchy contrast from the Galaxy S24 Ultra's photo looks better to me.</p>

<p>The next shot on a sunny beach uses the portrait mode from the front-facing camera of the OnePlus 13, Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, and Google Pixel 9 Pro. The Galaxy S24 Ultra's shot is consistently darker than the other two phones in portrait mode and isn't nearly as wide as what's offered by OnePlus or Google. The portrait cutout is extremely nice; however, it is something Samsung has done consistently excellently for years.</p><p>The OnePlus 13's photo is my favorite of the bunch, sporting warmer colors, excellent exposure balance between foreground and background, and an ultra-clean cutout between me and the background with subtle blending between.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro's photo looks crisp but a close inspection at the cutout shows the usual errors Google's portrait mode always exhibits. I also think the Pixel blurred the background far too much — again, something it always does — and made the photo look fake.</p>

<p>For the first time in history, I feel confident carrying around a OnePlus phone for use as my main camera. While I've used the OnePlus 12 as my main phone throughout most of 2024, I almost always carried another phone along with me so I'd have the best camera and my favorite phone with me at all times.</p><p>This year, things are different. The OnePlus 13's camera is magnificent, and, outside of a scant few situations, it meets or beats the competition and gives me the photo I was hoping for. Amazingly enough, this even includes capturing motion, something OnePlus and Samsung have historically been the weakest at.</p><p>It feels like a miracle that OnePlus would finally get its act together and craft a world-class camera, especially considering this is the 5th generation Hasselblad branded camera. A combination of new sensors and a new backend processing algorithm have worked some serious magic, and I'm happy to say that the OnePlus 13 is now my favorite mobile camera.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube Music detailed the start of its new "monthly audience" metric for fans on an artist's page.</li><li>This statistic will involve more than just song listens on YouTube Music as the metric will grab video and Short views, collaboration views, and other content.</li><li>YouTube Music's recent string of tests has involved AI, particularly its latest "restyle" test for 30-second AI-created clips.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube Music is testing an interesting new stat for its artist pages, reminiscent of another platform.</p><p>The company detailed its latest test in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/15621827?hl=en">a support page</a>, stating it's "exploring new ways to show an artist’s presence and reach." YouTube Music explains this new "monthly audience" metric as a "fan-facing, public" statistic that will appear (for some) on an artist's discography page. Interestingly, the number of "unique" listeners won't come from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-underrated-feature-device-files-upload">YouTube Music</a> alone.</p><p>The platform states that its experimental monthly audience stat concerns those who've listened to their music (obviously). However, this metric broadens its reach to the main YouTube video service, too. The explainer states that "non-music" content created by the artist will fall into this monthly metric. Additionally,  views on long-form and short-form videos created/uploaded by the artist "or their label" count toward the "monthly listeners."</p><p>Elsewhere, YouTube states collaborations with an artist featured on other channels and videos/Shorts created by content creators using their music will factor into this number.</p><p>The post extends its reach to the YouTube Kids app, as well, for displaying how far an artist's "reach" goes.</p><p>It seems that YouTube Music will refresh this monthly audience statistic every "28 days."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="GzQNJ8Q6j77Rdsyt2oQSP8" name="youtube-music-create-a-radio.jpg" alt="Create a radio section in Youtube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzQNJ8Q6j77Rdsyt2oQSP8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Users may be familiar with a similar stat as Spotify also prominently features its "monthly listeners" number for artists. There is some overlap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/audience-segments/">as Spotify states</a> it refreshes the number every 28 days, as well. However, the company breaks that number into three "segments:" active audience, previously active, and programmed. The first are those actively listening most days with "previously active" regarding those who haven't in the past 28 days, but may still listen "from programmed sources."</p><p>The final segment involves listeners from "editorial playlists, Discover Weekly, Radio, Autoplay," and more.</p><p>The recently started YouTube Music test seems a little more tame compared to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-song-restyle-ai-remix-test-spotted">trend toward AI</a> via "restyle." With Dream Track access, content creators were given time with an AI-based feature that lets them "restyle" a song and turn it into a 30-second clip. This test lets users describe the feeling (mood) and genre of the new, restyled song they'd like.</p>

<p>More often than not, Samsung flagships use a mix of the company's own Exynos chips and Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. This time around, leaks and rumors heavily pointed to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> being Snapdragon-only.</p><p>With just a few weeks to go until the Galaxy S25 is officially revealed at Galaxy Unpacked, Samsung and Qualcomm's playful banter on social media is as close to a confirmation we'll get that the two companies are working together on the next-generation smartphones.</p><p>Samsung announced that it'll <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">reveal the Galaxy S25 series at a Galaxy Unpacked event on Jan. 22</a> with a post on X (formerly Twitter). That post went live on Monday, Jan. 6, but the interesting part came a day later. The official account for the Snapdragon brand quoted Samsung's post on Jan. 7 with the cryptic message: "See you there."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re just as hyped as you are! 🙌 Mark your calendars — what’s coming at #GalaxyUnpacked will redefine the future of innovation 👀<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1876926152792498629">January 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While not a confirmation in the traditional sense, this post from Qualcomm signals that Snapdragon will be a focal point of the Galaxy S25 series. Right now, there's only one Qualcomm mobile chipset that would fit the bill, and that's the powerhouse Snapdragon 8 Elite platform. Geekbench 6 scores hint that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-use-an-overclocked-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-in-the-galaxy-s25-series">Samsung could be using an overclocked "Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy" chipset</a> for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and perhaps the rest of the lineup.</p><p>Put it all together, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims">prior reports about Samsung's low Exynos yield rates</a>, the Geekbench 6 scores, and now Qualcomm's cryptic post all seemingly confirm that the Galaxy S25 series will be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite platform</a>.</p><p>If existing Snapdragon 8 Elite phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-is-the-best-gaming-phone-and-its-here-in-the-us">Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro</a>, are any indication, the Samsung Galaxy S25 series should be a performance champion — especially if it's overclocked. You can reserve your phone today at no cost and no commitment to save big if you end up buying a Galaxy S25 phone when pre-orders open.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-may-soon-get-gemini">Gemini is likely coming to Wear OS watches</a>, but the details are vague at best. We don't know when it'll arrive, whether tools like Gemini Live and app extensions will work, how Gemini's answers will look on tiny watch screens, and whether all the processing will require your phone on hand.</p><p>With the right answers to these uncertainties, Google could give Wear OS users a real excitement boost with Gemini smarts. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-9-is-a-hit-pixels-earn-double-digit-market-share-for-the-first-time">Major Pixel 9 sales growth</a> proves that Gemini marketing is working on consumers, and getting AI insights with your phone in your pocket will appeal to many.</p><p>But <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> isn't just one service: It's a label applied to different functions and levels of intelligence, varied based on whether it's cloud- or device-based. Wear OS's version of the assistant/chatbot would significantly differ from what your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> or laptop offers, for example.</p><p>So, what will Gemini on Wear OS do differently than Assistant? Or, at least, what do I <em>hope</em> Gemini will do differently, and can Google make Gemini work on such limited hardware? Let's dive in.</p>

<h2 id="what-little-we-know-about-gemini-on-wear-os-2">What little we know about Gemini on Wear OS</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4DStjDLKKkTcnbvQaxXvVN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-google-assistant.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4DStjDLKKkTcnbvQaxXvVN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/06/gemini-wear-os-prep/">9to5Google</a> discovered the Gemini references in Google app beta code, with the language "Easily talk back and forth to get more done with an assistant on your watch, reimagined with Google AI" describing the wearable app.</p><p>The site also found references to Gemini being summonable by the same methods as Assistant: Using the "Hey Google" phrase or holding down the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>'s side button. You can safely assume that Google will keep its always-listening option for Gemini, too, though this will burn through battery life faster.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/307540908">confirmed</a> in November that the Pixel Watch series' next Wear OS update would be in March. Wear OS updates usually arrive monthly with minor changes, so why is the Watch 3 stuck with its September launch software? Perhaps because Google needed six months to get Gemini ready in wearable form, pushing other updates to the back burner.</p><p>If not March, we could see Gemini arrive alongside the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>, both of which should launch with Wear OS 6 in late summer. Google in particular will probably have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new SoC hardware</a> by then; Qualcomm's VP of wearables Dino Bekis told me their 2025 Wear chip will have "more on-device AI capability."</p><p>Gemini Nano, the portable version of Google's AI, still requires a phone's neural processing unit for edge tasks like summarizing an email or transcribing conversations. So it's likely that some Gemini on-watch tools will be exclusive to newer models that <em>add</em> NPUs, while older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> with decade-old Cortex cores will have to rely solely on your phone and cloud computing.</p>
<h2 id="what-gemini-could-bring-to-wear-os-watches-2">What Gemini could bring to Wear OS watches</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p3FVWNhhsQUNpF5xaKUpY6" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-16.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Gemini results" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p3FVWNhhsQUNpF5xaKUpY6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The most obvious Gemini Wear OS application is to enable on-wrist conversations, like you get with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>, or simply more intelligent answers to questions. The leaked language "talk back and forth" sure seems to imply an actual conversation, which gives me hope that you'll be able to have in-depth discussions with remembered context until you have the answer you need.</p><p>The biggest hurdle is that most Gemini answers take about 10–15 seconds if they require pulling up information — compared to 4-ish seconds for simpler questions — and phone-to-watch Bluetooth communication may add an additional delay. Google Assistant has gotten faster at on-device answers, but Gemini will feel like a step backward for speed — even if it's a step forward for clarity.</p><p>The second hurdle is the size of the screen. Gemini spits out a ton of information to any question or prompt to provide enough context (see the photo above). Ask your Wear OS watch the same question, and you'll have to scroll through a lot more tiny text or stand and wait for Gemini to read everything out loud for a couple of minutes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MEypxaySVNEaqavKxefoBf" name="Gemini-Google-Home-Integration.jpg" alt="Google Home integration in the Gemini app for Android." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MEypxaySVNEaqavKxefoBf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The next potential Gemini application on Wear OS is to work with Gemini extensions. Imagine being able to prompt Gemini from your wrist to summarize your unread emails, create a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> playlist based on your mood, or tell you about nearby 4-star lunch spots via Maps. Your phone would do all the work, but it would remain in your pocket.</p><p>Google began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-integrates-gemini-for-smarter-home-automation">integrating Gemini and Google Home</a> last year, and it's hard to say that Gemini is any better than Assistant was at controlling your smart home tech, barring a few minor perks like summarizing who came to your door via Nest Doorbell. But any future innovations will be Gemini-exclusive, so Wear OS owners with smart homes will benefit in the long run.</p><p>Then, of course, you have Gems, or the customizable and specialized versions of Gemini built for specific tasks like playing chess or serving as a "running coach," one Google example that feels especially apt for Wear OS.</p><p>I think specialized Gems you can quick-swap between in a Gemini Tile would be perfect for the format, because no one wants to stand around waiting for generalized answers on your wrist. If you know what topic you're usually curious about while on the go, why not have that Gem quick-loaded on your Pixel Watch?</p><p>Beyond these obvious Gemini applications on Wear OS, I'd be interested to see if the app's image generation tools could be put to use for watch face creation. Imagine if you could use Imagen 3 to create an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">XML-compatible face</a> cropped to your screen's proportions in less than a minute.</p><p>Gemini could also prove useful for finding new Wear OS apps, which can be a pain to find in the on-watch Play Store. You could ask the assistant to recommend a few options for different categories (e.g., fitness, weather, productivity, etc.) and summarize their differences and strengths.</p>
<h2 id="the-most-obvious-gemini-application-is-health-and-fitness-2">The most obvious Gemini application is health and fitness</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fPpvjgpUCN64ZdtqTgkJyP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-and-Android-statue.jpeg" alt="An Android statue wearing a headband and a dummy Pixel Watch 3, standing behind a display of Pixel Watch 3s." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPpvjgpUCN64ZdtqTgkJyP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If it's not apparent from the list above, I'm hopeful about Gemini on Wear OS, but also skeptical that Google can deliver a transformative Gemini assistant experience with lightweight hardware and a tiny screen.  I'm ready to be proved wrong, but I don't know if smartwatches can support enough tokens to provide the context necessary for intelligent answers. So I'm expecting delayed answers and a significant battery drain while using Gemini for long conversations. We'll find out soon!</p><p>I could see Gemini proving more useful in the backend. If Google uses Gemini to analyze your Fitbit results upon request — ideally while preserving your data privacy — that could provide useful insights on your current health, recent fitness or sleep trends, and so on. It could then highlight the key AI insights in your Morning Brief.</p><p>On the fitness side, Google already recommends daily runs to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> users based on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">training load</a>. In theory, a Gemini Coach could take things to the next level and analyze post-run results (like Strava's Athlete Intelligence) or expand beyond running and recommend gym workout routines, for example.</p><p>Google could even provide those insights <em>during</em> an activity; you could say, "Hey Google, how am I doing?" and have it tell you that you're on PR pace or that your heart rate is too elevated over your wireless earbuds."</p>

<ul><li>Rumors from a South Korean publication claim Samsung could utilize COE screen tech on the S26 Ultra, which was previously used on its foldable.</li><li>The tech could deliver a richer color, brighter, and power-conscious experience for future owners of the device.</li><li>Recent rumors claim the Galaxy S26 Ultra could feature Samsung's new 2nm Exynos chip quite "significantly."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While we sit in the Galaxy S25 waiting room, rumors have appeared about what upgrades a member of the S26 series could feature.</p><p>The rumors surface from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=32201">The Elec</a> (Korean), which cites an unnamed source about the alleged enhanced screen functionality for the Galaxy S26 Ultra (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s26_ultras_display_to_be_brighter_and_more_efficient_-news-66012.php">GSMArena</a>). According to the publication, Samsung may seek out COE screen technology, which could positively affect the power consumption of the 2026 Ultra model.</p><p>The post states this is facilitated by swapping the display's underlying polarizer for "color filters," instead. The post notes that the thicker polarizing plates used by OLEDs reflect light, but hampers brightness, thus requiring users to boost up when outside.</p><p>The report states Samsung's adoption of COE technology could improve the richness of color for the S26 Ultra with the proposed color filters. Also, rumors of a "Black PDL" (Pixel Define Layer) could further prevent light from reflecting within the screen, improving its brightness in various situations.</p><p>Another side effect of this supposed new technology is its thinness. The rumors claim that the alleged polarizer swap to color filters with the COE tech could make for a thinner display. We've heard for a while how Samsung is likely entering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-alleged-rendering">its thin phone era</a>, so this doesn't seem too far-fetched.</p><p>The idea of these displays being thinner is likely because, as the publication noted, Samsung has previously featured COE display tech on its foldables (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">think Fold 6</a>). A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.electronicspecifier.com/news/coe-to-dominate-as-the-main-antireflection-technology-for-foldable-oleds">Electronic Specifier</a> states that COE's tech is typically applied "directly onto the panel," which facilitates this thinner design. It also notes how its screen technology can deliver longevity to the lifespan of a device's display.</p>

<p>There's been little about Samsung's 2026 phones — and that's no surprise as we're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-alleged-rendering">weeks away from the S25</a>. However, we've heard rumors about the potential return of the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-curved-edge-display-patent-2024-report">curved-edge</a>" Galaxy phone. Following a recently filed patent, speculation rose about the chance for Samsung to bring back its curved-edge display for future Galaxy Ultra phones. The Korean OEM has slowly moved away from that in its Ultra models, opting for flatter displays like the rest of the cast.</p><p>The patent held information about a boost in durability, which phones with curved displays are prone to.</p><p>What's more, rumors from December claimed Samsung is developing a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-rumors-galaxy-s26-exynos-change">Exynos chip for the Galaxy S26</a> series. It's been purported that the company may feature this Exynos chip (on a new 2nm process) "significantly" on the next-gen series. These very early rumors are worth taking with a grain of salt. It's been alleged that Samsung could still drop the phones with the next Qualcomm chip in the U.S., though.</p>

<p>Google wants you to focus on your Pixel phone's battery as it dictates the device's lifespan. In a detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15738128?s=31" target="_blank">post</a>, the tech giant has laid out steps to maximize your battery life, including the temperature at which it should be charged and when to send it in for a replacement.</p><p>Like most devices, Pixel phones also use rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that get worn out after a set number of complete charging cycles. One full charging cycle is typically when your phone is being charged to 100% after it is completely discharged. Different Pixel devices have varied charging cycle limits before the battery needs to be replaced.</p><p>Per Google:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Pixel 3 through Pixel 8 Pro, including Pixel Fold:</strong> This should retain up to 80% capacity for about 800 charge cycles.</li><li><strong>Pixel 8a and later:</strong> Should retain up to 80% capacity for about 1000 charge cycles.</li></ul>

<p>"Your device’s actual lifespan depends on usage patterns and other factors," the post added.</p><p>These factors include charging the Pixel where the ambient temperature where your Pixel is charging. Ideally, the room/space should be at a temperature of about 25℃ or 78℉, where exposure to direct sunlight or heat is minimal. Or by simply turning off features that could be running in the background/ ones that you don't use.</p><p>Other things that could maximize your battery life are updating the Pixel to the most recent Android version, turning on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7015477?sjid=1193958818943232076-NC" target="_blank">adaptive charging</a>, and storing your phone with at least 50% charge if you plan to store it for more than 30 days without using it. We also have a set of tips to help you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">extend your Android phone's battery health</a> that you may want to check out. Ultimately, this may help if you plan to keep your phone for the remainder of its software support cycle.</p><p>However, there will come a time when users might have to replace their Pixel's battery—the timeline is determined by the device's performance in cold or warm ambient temperatures, if the user sees a decrease in the device's run time, or if the device reaches its maximum cycle charge count. Users who face the above-mentioned issues should have their battery replaced and head to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9004345" target="_blank">Pixel’s support page for available options</a>.</p>

<p>Google also mentions that on the off chance, of a swollen battery, that can cause liquids or dust to enter the device more easily as the battery is more susceptible to accidental damage. Users should follow the steps to factory rest their device, allow the phone to get discharged, and contact Google's customer service. Users shouldn't attempt to remove a swollen battery or repair the phone themselves, as this could be hazardous.</p><p>To check your phone’s cycle count on Pixel 8a and later:</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Settings > About phone > Battery information</strong>, which will give you an in-depth analysis of your daily usage and battery life. Users can also run battery diagnostics on their phones to check for any issues with their devices.</p>

<p>PDFs often contain a wealth of information, but Google is rolling out an AI update that makes them easy to handle.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/07/gemini-ask-about-pdf-rollout/#more-656441">9to5Google</a> spotted the AI model, Gemini, rolling out its "Ask about this PDF" button in beta version 16.0.5 of the Google app. The publication notes that this feature — asking about a PDF — is similar to uploading the document straight to Gemini. To start, users on Android viewing a PDF can surface the Gemini overlay and see a new interactable button to ask about the document.</p><p>When tapped, the name of the PDF in question will appear in the chatting area alongside the option to ask a specific question.</p><p>Since Google's Gemini is deeply involved, users can ask specific questions regarding the document, and the AI will discover and display it promptly. After your question is posed, Gemini will take a brief moment to process it. An "analysis complete" tab will appear, followed by the answer, and a citation for where the AI leveraged its answers — which is the PDF you've asked about.</p><p>The publication notes that this feature with Gemini only pertains to the Files by Google app. Additionally, this beta version should wrap up fairly quickly as it's no different than what Advanced users received late last year. If anything, as 9to5 notes, this is indicative of a wider rollout for all Android users.</p>

<p>Before the holidays, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-ask-about-this-pdf-has-a-wider-rollout">a report by Mishaal Rahman</a> detailed the arrival of "Ask about PDF" for Gemini Advanced users running Android 15. The feature is identical to what Google has brought to its test server for the remainder of its Android users. The goal is to reduce the amount of time users spend reading or sifting through lengthy PDFs for information. Moreover, Gemini's overlay functionality mirrors an extension for the AI involving Drive.</p><p>When given permission, the main Gemini app will scour your Drive documents to find the answers to what you've requested. Similarly, both the "Ask about PDF" and the upload function let users ask follow-up questions to continue their document analysis. This AI update arrived soon after Google gave its Files app a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/files-by-google-has-a-new-pdf-viewer-and-its-ditching-google-drive">new PDF viewer</a>, too.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google is still working on its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">Ask Photos</a>" feature for the Photos app. Unlike the Gemini overlay, this feature will be integrated directly into the Photos app for direct conversations with the AI about your stored memories.</p>

The A9 Plus includes an upgraded chipset with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695, along with an 11-inch LCD display sporting a 1920 x 1200 resolution. The featured discount is for the tablet's 64GB configuration, though it's available in both the Graphite and Silver color options.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab A9 Plus comes with 4GB of RAM, dual speakers, a headphone port, and a USB-C charging port. Plus, it offers two basic cameras: an 8MP camera on the back and a 2MP camera for selfies.</p><p>While it's nothing particularly special in terms of performance when compared to Samsung's higher-end Galaxy Tab options, it's a great pick for those who like a fairly large display but aren't looking to spend much more than $200. With this deal, buyers stand to save $70 on the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus, bringing the price down to just $150.</p>

<h2 id="your-oneplus-13-deserves-a-high-grade-screen-protector-4">Your OnePlus 13 deserves a high-grade screen protector</h2>
<p>The roster isn't as big when it comes to the best OnePlus 13 screen protectors, at least not yet. There aren't many noteworthy brands that have released accessories for the OnePlus 13 yet, but hopefully, we'll see new launches in the coming weeks. For now, you've got to play it smart when selecting a screen guard.</p><p>See, OnePlus opted for an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor this time around. Typical tempered glass screen protectors don't play nice with most ultrasonic fingerprint readers, so you're better off picking a flexible TPU, EPU, PET, or hydrogel film for your OnePlus 13.</p><p>Ringke has the best screen protector to offer for the OnePlus 13 right now. At nearly $17, the brand's two-pack is sort of expensive. However, the price is worth your while considering there aren't many high-quality alternatives out there. The Ringke Dual Easy Film Screen Protector for the OnePlus 13 is made of EPU or elastomeric polyurethane, so it's flexible and capable of self-healing from minor abrasions and nicks. Ringke added an oleophobic layer to each film, so liquids like oil and water roll right off the surface. This also repels little dust particles and fingerprints. To fortify the screen protectors, each film has a hard coating on top so you get impact and scratch-proofing.</p><p>Those of you who insist on having a tempered glass screen protector can try your luck with the zZjoOoj Oneplus 13 Screen Protector with Camera Lens Protector. It might interfere with the OnePlus 13's fingerprint reader though, so think it through before going through with your decision.</p><p>After picking out a decent screen protector, be sure to browse and select one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-oneplus-13-cases">best OnePlus 13 cases</a> for your device. Other parts of the phone can also be damaged by bumps, knocks, or falls, and a phone case thwarts such damage.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> made its global debut, and it is now available for $899 in the U.S. and ₹69,999 ($815) in India. It was always a given that the phone would get a price hike — the Chinese model was costlier by $80 than the OnePlus 12, so it was obvious that the global model would also follow suit. <br><br>This is the second year where OnePlus increased the cost of its device by $100; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-review">OnePlus 11</a> debuted for $699, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> for $799 last year. Even in India — where OnePlus continues to sell a majority of its phones — the device is costlier by ₹5,000 ($58). With the hike comes the inevitable question: do you still buy the OnePlus 13, or pay more and get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> or the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra? That's what I'm here to answer.</p>

<p>Even though the OnePlus 13 costs $100 more than last year, you get considerable upgrades; the phone has much better durability, a bigger battery, better cameras at the back, and the latest Qualcomm silicon. Out of all these changes, the one that I like the most is the design. OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/exclusive-onepluss-head-of-industrial-design-on-delivering-the-best-in-hand-feel-with-the-oneplus-13">overhauled its design</a> language this year, moving to an aesthetic with flatter sides. <br><br>While I'm not usually a fan of this design style, OnePlus added beveled edges to the sides to make holding and using the OnePlus 13 much more comfortable, and it has better in-hand feel than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>. The OnePlus 13 is somehow lighter than last year — and other phones with 6,000mAh batteries — and the weight distribution is about the best of any phone I used recently.</p><p>If you're eyeing the phone, I highly recommend getting the Midnight Ocean variant; the blue color looks fantastic, and the microfiber vegan leather back has a soft texture that's unlike any other leather-backed phone. OnePlus also switched to a Goodix ultrasonic fingerprint module this time, and thankfully, there are no issues with positioning — it is high up on the panel, and I didn't have any problems with authentication or accessing the sensor.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WaYAGooi56AYfBWHTdLGYC" name="oneplus-13-blue-snapdragon-8-elite-01" alt="A blue OnePlus 13 with a Snapdragon 8 Elite placard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WaYAGooi56AYfBWHTdLGYC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the hardware. OnePlus always does a good job in this area, and the OnePlus 13 continues that heritage, delivering the latest hardware coupled with excellent optimization. The interface is noticeably faster than last year, and the fluidity is among the best of any phone today. <br><br>It's still annoying that 120fps gaming is limited to just three games, but in most titles I tested, the phone delivered steady framerates without any overheating issues. I didn't have any problems with the basics — cellular connectivity was great, and it had a strong signal throughout. While I don't use eSIM yet, the phone doesn't miss out on the feature, and that's good to see. <br><br>Another big upgrade is around the battery tech, with the device getting a bigger 6,000mAh battery that lasts a day and a half. The battery uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon tech</a> and has 10% silicon in the anode to deliver better density, and an added bonus is the ability to use the phone in freezing weather without any detriment to battery life.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, OnePlus retained the dual-cell configuration even with a silicon battery, and it is the only manufacturer to do so — OPPO and Vivo switched to a single-cell design this time around. The advantage with a dual-cell design is that you can easily charge both batteries at the same time, and as a result, the OnePlus 13 takes 38 minutes to fully charge via the 80W standard; by contrast, the X200 Pro takes 12 minutes longer.</p><p>Battery life isn't as good as the Find X8 Pro or Vivo X200 Pro, but I still got a day and a half between charges, with SOT hitting over ten hours (I'm addicted to Balatro). What's particularly interesting is the AirVOOC charging puck; this accessory lets you charge the phone at 50W, and it does a terrific job. The caveat is that the OnePlus 13 doesn't have magnets at the back, and you'll instead need to buy a case to use the charging puck.</p>

<p>OnePlus went with new camera modules this time, including a 50MP Sony LYT-808 main camera alongside a 50MP Sony LYT-600 telephoto with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and a 50MP wide-angle lens. The zoom lens uses similar tri prism tech as the Find X8 Pro, so you basically get a smaller module. <br><br>The camera quality is better than last year, and while I still give the edge to the Find X8 Pro and Vivo X200 Pro, the OnePlus 13 effortlessly holds its own against the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL, and that's a sizeable achievement in and of itself. It takes terrific portrait shots, detailed low-light photos, and much better videos.</p>

<p>I can't find much to fault with the software either. The interface is fluid and doesn't have any notable bugs out of the box, and there's a decent amount of AI-backed utilities if that's what you need in a phone. And with four years of updates, the phone will stay relevant a lot longer. <br><br>Even though the OnePlus 13 costs more than last year, you get more than enough upgrades to justify the increase, and it is now my go-to recommendation if you need a new phone in 2025. I like the X200 Pro better because of the cameras and color tuning, but it is costlier by the equivalent of $250, and not available in as many global regions as the OnePlus 13. <br><br>If you need an all-rounder that looks great, has the best hardware, lasts over a day, and takes fabulous photos, the OnePlus 13 is the phone to buy — OnePlus finally delivered a flagship without any noteworthy flaws.</p>

<hr>
<p>Honor, the brand behind the successful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3 foldable</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-silicon-battery-tech-makes-the-magic-7-pro-stand-out-even-more">Honor Magic 7 Pro flagship</a>, is planning an entry into a major market in Southeast Asia this year. The company announced today it will bring 30 products across multiple categories to Indonesia in 2025, with the first crop of offerings set to become available this quarter.</p><p>The "about" 30 products set to debut in Indonesia as part of the expansion include phones, tablets, PCs, and wearables. Additionally, Honor plans to open over 10 "Honor experience stores" during its first year operating in the country.</p>
<p>"We see incredible potential in Indonesia, which is why we view it as one of our key markets," said Justin Li, the president of Honor South Pacific, in a press release. "Honor is committed to growing with the Indonesian market in the long run, collaborating with all our local partners to build a complete, holistic ecosystem of products and services for consumers here."</p><p>Li says that Honor is "perfectly positioned" to serve consumers in the growing Indonesian market.</p>

<p>The announcement comes as Honor reports immense success outside its home country of China. The company says it reported over 50% overseas sales for the first time in December 2024. While Honor didn't specific which product lines would be part of the expansion, the brand could be attacking the midrange market.</p><p>"We are currently one of the fastest-growing brands in Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, especially in the mid-premium segment, and we endeavor to apply all we have learned there as we build our presence here," Li added in the press release.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">Asus ROG Phone 9 and Phone 9 Pro</a> were some of the first smartphones to debut in 2024 with Qualcomm's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>, but only the global versions. Now, the U.S. models of the ROG Phone 9 and Phone 9 Pro are available for purchase from Asus' website and Amazon.</p><p>Although other Snapdragon 8 Elite phones have been announced since the ROG Phone 9 series debuted globally in November 2024, Asus' gaming phones are still arguably the most powerful Android phones you can buy. If you're looking for other phone with Qualcomm's top chip, you'll need to look to the just-announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and likely the eventual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><p>The base-model Asus ROG Phone 9 starts at $999.99 with 12GB RAM and 256GB of storage. It ships with Android 15 and ROG UI, but will only get two years of platform updates. The Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro starts at $1,199.99 and includes 16GB RAM and 512GB of storage. The top-tier Phone 9 Pro configuration includes 24GB RAM and 1TB storage for a whopping $1,499.</p>

<p>We are a few weeks shy of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Galaxy Unpacked 2025</a> event, where the S25 lineup is scheduled to make its debut. Ahead of the launch, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">World Power Consortium (WPC) has all but confirmed</a> what we had all been suspecting for months now. Samsung is very likely going to be one of the first major Android phone brands to adopt the Qi2 spec, and I believe this will play a pivotal role in the industry.</p><p>In mid-December, several rumors and leaks hinted that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25</a> will support Qi2 wireless charging, but not in the way you'd expect. Allegedly, Samsung will use a magnetic case to enable the magnetic aspect of Qi2 instead of adding magnets natively to the S25 series. Based on the WPC's CES 2025 announcement and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13 release</a>, we can assume that this is accurate.</p>

It's free, requires no commitment, and will snag you a $50 credit if and when you do decide to preorder a new Galaxy device.</p></div>
<p>Samsung and the WPC made a joint statement where the Korean phone maker said the following:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You can expect to see Android devices supporting Qi2 from Samsung Galaxy devices in 2025.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Google also made a similar statement under the same press release, but no promises were made of Pixel devices picking up the standard. Instead, the Alphabet-owned tech giant vowed to bring Qi2 to more Android devices this year.</p><p>While HMD Global's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">HMD Skyline</a> is technically the first Qi2 Android phone, it didn't make any waves in the Android space. This is why I feel that the Galaxy S25 coming with Qi2 support — with or without magnets — is what's going to really get the Qi2 ball rolling. After all, Samsung sells more smartphones than any other phone manufacturer in the world and could easily influence the rest to follow suit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QFW7wbQqb4c7uXdQ4wUdRg" name="oneplus-13-wood-case-inside" alt="The inside of the official OnePlus 13 wood case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QFW7wbQqb4c7uXdQ4wUdRg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We have been waiting for Qi2 to take off for nearly two years now. The standard has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">officially been ready since early 2023</a>, but most devices that use it are either iPhones or accessories like power banks and chargers. Both Samsung and Google were expected to take the lead with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> lineups last year, but that didn't happen.</p><p>Now that the OnePlus 13 has adopted magnetic charging (sort of), Samsung will look very bad if it doesn't hop on board the Qi2 train. Just like the rumored S25 magnetic case, OnePlus also chose to rely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-oneplus-13-cases">magnetic cases</a> to bring Qi2-like charging to the OnePlus 13. Based on rumors, Samsung is going to do the same with the S25 series. Even then, this is an important step in the right direction.</p><p>Major changes in the phone industry have never come about overnight or transitioned smoothly. Just look at the headphone jack, for example. People ridiculed the idea at first and were angry once the 3.5mm port was eliminated from popular Android phones. But once bigwigs like Samsung started ditching the audio jack, everyone else followed suit.</p><p>Sure, many brands compensated users with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c">USB-C</a> to audio jack converters at first, but the world eventually adapted to the change. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">Wireless audio accessories</a> are far more popular now and the headphone jack is no longer missed by most users.</p><p>This is exactly why Qi2 adoption on the Galaxy S25 will be so important. When the most prominent Android brand makes bold moves, everyone else will surely feel the need to follow the trend, either to stay relevant or to be more competitive. There are thousands of Qi2 accessories readily available, so the market is primed for the Qi2 revolution that Samsung is likely about to kickstart <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">when the Galaxy S25 launches</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>For the first time, it feels like mixed-reality experiences are truly the future. We're more than a decade past the failed Google Glass experiment that was ridiculed in the early 2010s. Now, Meta and others have helped make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">the public opinion around wearable technology more positive</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Meta Quest 2</a> sold over 20 million units, and the brand's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a> headset is on track to sell even better. That's without considering the Meta Ray-Bans, which aren't an XR product now but certainly could become one in the future. In fact, Meta's own Orion prototype showcases exactly how the Quest and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Ban</a> product lines could be merged in the future to create a seamless wearable experience.</p><p>Starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion reveal and press tour</a> in the fall of 2024, we saw a flurry of mixed or extended-reality prototypes, plans, and the like. There was the Android XR announcement, the cryptic teasing of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung's Project Moohan</a> headset, and the news that Vivo will have a prototype Apple Vision Pro competitor by <em>the end</em> of 2025. That doesn't account for all the startups and smaller brands that have teased XR or MR products or experiences, either.</p><p>However, these recent announcements serve as a good reminder not to fall for teasers and hype. Until a product actually hits the shelves and has a sticker price, it's not real. As flawed as they may be, it's better to focus on the mixed-reality products that actually exist today — like the Meta Quest lineup and Apple Vision Pro — than get caught up in what might be.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XcCDqRySKCcJL7r8rp3Wi5" name="meta-project-orion-ar-glasses-hands-on-01.jpg" alt="Photo of Nick Sutrich wearing and using the Meta Orion AR glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XcCDqRySKCcJL7r8rp3Wi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo's recent announcement was perhaps the most egregious. At an event on Dec. 31, 2024, it shared a cryptic image and said it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vivo-to-try-and-beat-apple-vision-pro-with-a-new-mixed-reality-headset-in-2025">working on a mixed-reality headset that will be revealed in 2025</a>. Specifically, the company said it will offer “high-fidelity prototype experiences" with its headset in select Chinese cities by the end of 2025. That sure sounds like Vivo is in the early stages of development — so early that it isn't even close to committing a release date or price.</p><p>Despite not revealing any details about the mixed-reality headset — we don't even know what the Vivo wearable will look like, outside of a bland and generic silhouette — Vivo is making bold claims about its capabilities. The company wants to make a headset that will beat <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-launch-sales-success">Apple Vision Pro</a>, which is a tall order. Although the Vision Pro may have been a commercial failure, it was a hardware success, and Apple did manage to mass-produce it.</p><p>That's something worth emphasizing because no company has been able to mass-produce a mixed-reality wearable that matches Vision Pro's capabilities. You could argue that the Meta Orion glasses would have been on the same level as Vision Pro, but it is well known that they're firmly a prototype because they would be too expensive to mass produce. Who knows, maybe Samsung's Project Moohan or Vivo's unnamed headset will be the first to challenge Vision Pro at its price point and production level.</p><p>That's the problem: we don't know. And the companies touting all of these prototypes and plans? They don't really know it either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.92%;"><img id="FpPjBXTgsRHgNsVFCE8Uvi" name="Vivo-VR-Headset-Teaser" alt="A teaser for Vivo’s upcoming mixed-reality headset." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FpPjBXTgsRHgNsVFCE8Uvi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="635" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vivo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At a time when nearly every major company is exploring a mixed-reality strategy, it's a good idea to take a pause before falling for the hype. It's easy to get excited about a headset from Apple, Vivo, Meta, Samsung, or any other brand. If you recall, Apple Vision Pro went through the same exact process.</p><p>There were rumors and leaks for years, and then Apple finally revealed the headset and its whopping $3,499 price point. To say that it wasn't what consumers expected would be an understatement. Apple Vision Pro is expensive, heavy, and has a tethered battery pack. Even after its reveal, the release date was a mystery for many months.</p><p>There's a lesson to be learned here: a product is only real when you can walk into a store and buy it. Until there's a price, release date, and spec sheet, it's barely worth paying attention to a prototype product that might never see the light of day. Even then, it probably won't be what was initially expected. If you've been a fan of tech long enough, you probably remember your fair share of products highly touted that were canceled or didn't meet expectations.</p>

<p>Virtual, mixed, and extended-reality experiences are here to stay. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> is a Google and Samsung-made operating system aimed to breathe life into the next generation of XR products. We're only going to see more prototypes, plans, and teasers in 2025 — not less.</p><p>Before you get too excited about any of these possible products, take a pause and remember all the things that haven't come to fruition. Don't avoid buying the products that are in the here and now for those that might be. If you want a Meta Quest headset, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">buy one</a>. If you want an Apple Vision Pro — and you can live with early adopter growing pains — buy it.</p><p>There's no point in waiting because there will always be something newer and better on the horizon. After all, time after time, we're shown that it's a lot harder to get a prototype to a point where it gets a release date and price than companies think.</p>

<hr>
<p>New rumors have surfaced, claiming to have "industry insider" details about Samsung's alleged tri-fold or "double-folding" phone.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sisajournal-e.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=408575">Sisa Journal</a> (Korean) from an unnamed source claims that Samsung could launch its double-folding device in the second half of 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-dual-fold-phone-tablet-launch-h2-2025-report/">SamMobile</a>). To start, rumors claim Samsung will begin "small" with this new foldable form factor with "less than 300,000" units planned.</p><p>The display of a phone like this is important and the publication's source claims Samsung Display — the maker of it — is preparing to debut the new hardware. The post didn't state <em>when</em> consumers could see this, but with CES 2025 going on and MWC coming up, perhaps we have some wiggle room.</p><p>Speaking of the display, rumors add that Samsung will likely forgo a UDC (under-display camera) for the front-facing lens. It purports that "resolution quality" is the reason why Samsung could dodge the UDC for the first iteration of this device.</p><p>The rumors dive into the folding method of the phone, stating it could take on a "G-shape." The publication's sources state this decision should impact/increase the "durability" of the foldable's display. More importantly, we're hearing once more that this folding style will involve an inward mechanic. The post states this is an "in-folding method that folds the inside of the screen inward twice."</p><p>Rumors about this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-phone-development-rumor">alleged double-folding device</a> returned in November as sources speculated Samsung could provide a nine to 10-inch display when open. Of course, Samsung's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-rollable-phone-pursuit-alleged-report">feeling the pressure</a> ever since Huawei debuted the Mate XT, the world's first tri-fold phone. Older rumors claimed the Korean OEM was seeking the first "rollable" phone, but now (for the second time) the double-fold design is back on the table.</p><p>The latest report from South Korea doubles down on what we've heard previously about the inward folding method for screen protection/durability. Additionally, it adds that Samsung could debut this phone alongside the next Flip and Fold.</p><p>Another interesting note is Samsung's supposed unit production outlook of "less than 300,000" units. A report just before Christmas claimed that Samsung was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-unit-shipment-changes-report">slashing its foldable units</a> in 2025 due to a lackluster 2024 with the Flip 6 and Fold 6. It was said that only 5 million units are to be expected for its clamshell and bookstyle foldable. Seeing as the double-folding device has such a low number, perhaps Samsung will play things cautiously.</p>

<ul><li>The January 2025 security patch for Pixels is rolling out to Pixel 6 and newer devices now.</li><li>A support page from Verizon preemptively revealed that the patch would be available today.</li><li>There are bug fixes for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 9 series, but the Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 series only get security improvements.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The first Google Pixel security update of 2025 is rolling out to Pixel 6 and newer phones and tablets now with bug fixes and security improvements. Earlier today, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/support/google-pixel-9-update/" target="_blank">support page</a> from Verizon preemptively revealed that the January 2025 security patch was rolling out for Pixels today, Jan. 7. Now, that update is hitting Pixel phones in all regions, with separate builds for Global, Telstra, and EMEA.</p><p>The over-the-air update is available for the following Pixel phone models, listed beside their corresponding global <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> build numbers:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Google Pixel 6:</strong> AP4A.250105.002</li><li><strong>Google Pixel 6 Pro:</strong> AP4A.250105.002</li><li><strong>Google Pixel 6a: </strong>AP4A.250105.002</li><li><strong>Google Pixel 7: </strong>AP4A.250105.002</li><li><strong>Google Pixel 7 Pro:</strong> AP4A.250105.002</li><li><strong>Google Pixel 7a:</strong> AP4A.250105.002</li><li><strong>Google Pixel Tablet:</strong> AP4A.250105.002</li><li><strong>Google Pixel Fold: </strong>AP4A.250105.002</li><li><strong>Google Pixel 8: </strong>AP4A.250105.002</li><li><strong>Google Pixel 8 Pro: </strong>AP4A.250105.002</li><li><strong>Google Pixel 8a:</strong> AP4A.250105.002</li><li><strong>Google Pixel 9: </strong>AP4A.250105.002</li><li><strong>Google Pixel 9 Pro:</strong> AP4A.250105.002</li><li><strong>Google Pixel 9 Pro XL:</strong> AP4A.250105.002</li><li><strong>Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold: </strong>AP4A.250105.002</li></ul>
<p>The January 2025 update already became available on Android Central's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> with an update size of 92.74 MB. Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-december-2024-feature-drop-announced">Pixel phones and tablets received a feature drop last month</a>, this suggests the current security patch is a minor update.</p><p>For the Pixel 8 and Pixel 9 series, the January 2025 update includes a few bug fixes. The patch "addressed audio delay and stability issues when using certain apps" and "addressed a camera stability issue when switching to a connected camera under certain conditions."</p><p>The update for the Google Pixel 9 series specifically fixed a few display and UX issues, like screens flashing lines in certain conditions and problems with Pixel Launcher theming.</p><p>For all other Pixel devices, including the Pixel 6 series, Pixel 7 series, Fold, and Tablet, the update simply includes the latest security patches. You can download and install the January 2025 update over-the-air by opening the <strong>Settings app</strong>, tapping <strong>System</strong>, and then <strong>Software Update</strong>.</p>

<ul><li>This week, Google is gearing up to release new software update for old Pixel 4a models.</li><li>The Android 13-based update will bring new battery management features to the Pixel 4a handset.</li><li>However, not all Pixel 4a models can handle the update. So, Google is offering some appeasement options for such handsets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The soon-to-be five-year-old Google Pixel 4a phone will receive yet another update from the company as part of the Battery Performance Program.</p><p>It is believed to be an automatic update for Android 13-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4a-review">Pixel 4a</a> phones, which will begin rolling out to the handsets starting January 8, per the recent Pixel Phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15701861">community post</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/06/pixel-4a-battery-update/#more-656137">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The new update aims to “improve the stability” of the Pixel 4a handsets’ battery performance as it includes new battery management features. However, for some handsets, this update is believed to reduce the “available battery capacity” and impact “charging performance.”</p>

<p>Impacted Devices, as the company calls them, will be eligible for appeasement. Google is providing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/workflow/15642495?sjid=15665628939072186487-AP&visit_id=638718678423564863-1884513661&p=pixel4a_battery_help&rd=1">support page</a> to check their devices for appeasement eligibility. If your Pixel 4a falls under the category, you can opt for a free battery replacement by heading to the company’s registration page.</p><p>“Battery replacement is available at walk-in repair centers in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore, and India. Mail-in repair is also available for customers in the United States.” Users must remember that even in these regions, batteries can only be replaced until their supplies last.</p><p>Suppose free replacement isn’t a convenient option for users. In that case, they can either opt for a Google hardware discount code for another Pixel phone purchase or proceed with a $50 payment.</p>
<p>Respective Pixel 4a users are allowed to choose any of these appeasement options starting from the day of roll-out (January 8) to January 6, 2025.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pixel 4a users can manually download the update onto their devices, or the software update will download automatically when the software is released — provided the device is sufficiently charged and connected to the internet.</p><p>It is encouraging to see Google still taking care of the 2020-released Pixel 4a with the new battery performance program. The appeasement benefits also appear to be a plus for users. The software update that is released this week will not impact other Pixel phone models, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4a-5g-review">Pixel 4a 5G</a>, for example.</p>

It's not impregnable, though, so you should invest in the best OnePlus 13 cases.</p><p>An ideal phone cover should be drop-proof, slim, and reasonably priced.

For such a good-looking phone as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, it's also a good idea to opt for something that still allows the phone's design to shine.

<h2 id="choosing-the-right-case-for-your-oneplus-13-is-pretty-straightforward-2">Choosing the right case for your OnePlus 13 is pretty straightforward</h2>
<p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">spectacular Android phone</a> is the second phone in the world to officially support Qi2, but you don't get the Qi2 magnets built-in. This is where OnePlus 13 cases come in. There's a lot to love about the OnePlus 13, and happily, the same applies to the best OnePlus 13 cases. Almost every single case worth its salt comes with a magnetic ring incorporated into it. Plus, most OnePlus 13 covers cost $25 or less.</p><p>First-party accessories are usually a hit or a miss. OnePlus understood the assignment because the brand's official OnePlus 13 Aramid Fiber Magnetic Case is spectacular. Like the phone itself, there's little to nothing to complain about with this case. Our reviewer Nick Sutrich used it and found it to be phenomenal. He was impressed with the soft feel of it and how it is grippy all around, a bit rubbery but sturdy overall. The Aramid Fiber Magnetic Case isn't overly heavy either and it looks really smart. The only complaint that Sutrich had was that the alert slider is harder to use since it doesn't protrude from the phone a lot.</p><p>If the $40 OnePlus case is too rich for your blood, you can get a stellar case for almost half the price without giving up toughness or magnetism. Ringke is a very premium phone case maker and its Fusion-X is really popular. I'm really happy that Ringke released the robust Ringke Fusion-X bumper cover for the OnePlus 13. It costs only $24 and you get a magnetic ring, lanyard holes, a shock-absorbent frame, and a transparent back to show off your OnePlus 13's lovely design.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is struggling with its digital payment app and a notable service to start the week.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12060039">support page</a> for Google Wallet detailed its recently reported issues with "in-store payments" when using PayPal (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/06/google-wallet-paypal-issue/#more-656098">9to5Google</a>). More specifically, it appears that this issue has affected the tap-to-pay experience for any Android users attempting to use their phone in-stores.</p><p>It's no surprise that consumers can attach their bank accounts to PayPal, thus facilitating the usage of it when paying via NFC in a store. Moreover, Google details that users can attach a "PayPal branded card" to their Wallet app and pay via that method, too.</p><p>As 9to5 notes, this issue is hampering Google Wallet and PayPal for every Android device and account. This mainly concerns users in the U.S. and Germany, per Google's page. So, it's likely that users won't find any relief whether they're attempting to pay via their bank account, available money in their PayPal wallet, or branded card.</p><p>Acknowledgement of the issue is the first step with the second step being the fix. Google's notice states that a "fix will be rolled out soon." No official date was given but, hopefully, it's sooner rather than later.</p><p>Google Wallet and PayPal have been a relatively quiet conversation ever since the service's inclusion. However, Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-and-pixel-watch-2-feature-drop">feature drop in June for Wear OS</a> — specifically, the Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 — brought PayPal to the wearables. The company highlighted that users could begin linking their PayPal accounts to their watches as it sought to provide "multiple" payment options.</p><p>Additionally, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12060039#:~:text=Starting%20July%2022%2C%202024%2C">announced</a> that, as of June 22, 2024, users could no longer lean on their PayPal accounts when paying online via the Google Pay option.</p><p>For your security, the company also added a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-verification-settings-to-balance-security-and-convenience">verification setting</a>" for transit payments. If enabled, users would need to verify a transaction when paying for a bus, metro ride, and more before that money can leave any of their accounts or cards. Users can choose to verify payments via a PIN or fingerprint.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Home devices are about to get much faster and more consistent when connecting with or commanding one another. Google and MediaTek collaborated to create the new MediaTek MT7903 chipset, coming in the first half of 2025, in order to "facilitate widespread adoption of Thread."</p><p>This "Filogic-branded chipset" supports tri-band <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wi-fi-6e-router">Wi-Fi 6E</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/bluetooth-6">Bluetooth 6</a>, and IEEE 802.15.4. The latter is a well-known WPAN standard used by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a>, Thread, and other smart home standards where devices communicate.</p><p>The MediaTek MT7903 has a low power feature called "Thread border router offload." If a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> device goes to sleep, the MT7903 will remain awake and connected with other smart home devices, saving energy in standby mode while remaining alert for commands at any moment.</p><p>While this chip may not hit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, the current speediest option, MediaTek says this chip is designed to "make it more affordable and seamless for manufacturers to integrate Thread into their devices." Cutting-edge wireless might price it out of the range of affordable smart home tech, and considering many smart home devices are stuck on 2.4GHz, Wi-Fi 6E with 6GHz support would still be a massive upgrade for many devices.</p><p>Google Home hubs like the Nest Hub or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer 4K</a> are also Matter hubs, interoperable with any recent smart home tech that complies with the latest standards like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-4-upgrade-more-device-support-roll-out">Matter 1.4</a>. The more devices that use chips like the MediaTek MT7903, the easier it'll be for Google Assistant or Gemini commands to trigger automation without frustrating delays.</p><p>Google, which just announced at CES 2025 that it would be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/google-tv-ces-2025/">bringing Gemini commands to Google TV</a>, has been a major proponent of the Matter standard and Thread protocol. It's unsurprising to us that it would team up with MediaTek on this endeavor, laying out what partners will need to connect with its hub products.</p><p>This chip could also appear in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/possible-nest-hub-max-refresh-spotted">leaked Nest Hub Max successor</a>, which we hope will arrive in 2025. Google's smart display also supported 802.15.4 and Thread, but remains stuck on Wi-Fi 5GHz and Bluetooth 5. A new Nest Hub with the MediaTek MT7903 and a faster NPU for Gemini commands could be a smart home game-changer.</p>

<hr>
<p>A report concerning the premium smartphone market's recent performance has arrived and it paints a sour trend for one maker.</p><p>The report details the sales of phones from Q1 2024 to Q3 in the major market of India, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://canalys.com/insights/android-brands-compete-in-india-s-premium-smartphone-segment">per Canalys</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/03/google-pixel-india-premium-smartphone-market-report/#more-655821">9to5Google</a>). The post states that several new "Android offerings" have boosted the "premium share" within the Indian consumer market. Data shows that a few OEMs have grown between Q1 and Q3 2024, such as OPPO, Vivo, and even Samsung (by a slim margin).</p><p>However, the biggest change is the plummeting sales of the Chinese OEM, OnePlus. Compared to 2023, Canalys' data shows that OnePlus went from holding 21% of the sales pie to a measly 6% in 2024. Analytics show that the company did see positive "traction" in the foldable market, but that doesn't seem to have affected its premium share that much.</p><p>On the other hand, sales performances show that Google is on the rise in India. Google grew by 4% in India between (roughly) January to September 2024.</p><p>The post adds that Android phones made up 44% of the premium market share in India last year, shipping 6.5 million units. While Samsung accounted for 67% of that, the post claims that its growth was "modest," likely thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">the S24 series</a>.</p>

<p>The sudden drop in sales for OnePlus — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-sales-ban-india-2024">particularly for India</a> — was a hot topic in April 2024. It was reported that around 4,500 retailers were discontinuing their sales of OnePlus phones across six states in the southern and western areas of India. There were a couple of major catalysts behind this decision: delays in warranty processing and "slender profit margins."</p><p>That sales ban went live on May 1 in India and we're now seeing the extremely adverse result of this for the Chinese OEM.</p><p>At the time, OnePlus stated that it "values all the support" that it's received from its partners in India. The company also told Android Central that it was working with retailers in the country to correct the issues. We'll see what happens as we begin to move into 2025.</p><p>Then we have Google, which reportedly had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-q3-2024-pixel-9-market-share-growth-report">high, record sales</a> in Q3 2024. The company can likely thank its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> for its "highest-ever" market share growth last third quarter. It was initially stated that Pixel sales in Japan, Western Europe, and LATAM were among the standouts for driving its major sales boost. With what we're seeing from India's Canalys data, perhaps another country can make that list.</p>

<ul><li>Google Home APIs and the Home runtime are now available for all Android developers to use in beta.</li><li>These tools streamline app control, smart home device onboarding, and Matter support.</li><li>Eve, Nanoleaf, and LG have already shipped apps on the Google Play Store leveraging these integrations, with more coming soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google announced two new ways for smart home developers to integrate Google Home within their own Android apps at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O</a> last year: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-wants-to-turn-your-tvs-into-a-smart-home-hub">Home APIs</a> and the Home runtime. At the end of 2024, select smart home developers were able to try out these new integrations, and Eve, Nanoleaf and LG have already shipped them in their Google Play Store apps. Now, the Home APIs and runtime are entering public developer beta, meaning any Android developer can use them.</p><p>There are a few types of Google Home APIs that will now become available for use in all Android apps, including <strong>Device and Structure APIs</strong>, <strong>Commissioning API</strong>, and  the <strong>Automation API</strong>. The Device and Structure APIs allow Android apps to manage and control smart home devices in the Google Home and Matter ecosystems. Google says that there are over 600 million smart home products out in the wild that could be controlled by this new API.</p><p>Similarly, the Commissioning API makes it easy to connect new smart home products with select Android devices using Fast Pair. Aside from enabling Fast Pair support on three billion eligible Android devices, this API will also add support for Google Assistant voice control and Matter device onboarding. With the API, third-party developers can let their users set up new smart home hardware in their own app.</p><p>Finally, the Automation API makes it possible to create <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> automation straight from a developer's own app. These tools will become available to Android developers first, and will later arrive on iOS.</p><p>In a blog post, Google described how Eve, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nanoleaf-smart-lights">Nanoleaf</a>, and LG used these new APIs to deliver new features in their smart home apps:</p>
<ul><li>"<a href="https://developers.home.google.com/case-studies/eve" target="_blank"><u>Eve</u></a> was able to unlock advanced features like autonomous heating schedules on Eve Thermo for their users and also expand their reach within the Android ecosystem, establishing a solid foundation for future development.</li><li><a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/newsroom/blogs/6493/" target="_blank"><u>Nanoleaf </u></a>used the Home APIs to make entertainment even more delightful by giving customers simple voice commands to turn on their Nanoleaf 4D screen mirroring light strip.</li><li><a href="https://developers.home.google.com/case-studies/lg" target="_blank"><u>LG</u></a> used the Home APIs to integrate Google Home devices directly into their TV smart home experiences."</li></ul>
<p>Now that the Home APIs and runtime are publicly-available developer tools, you'll start seeing new functionality hit more of your favorite apps. Google says that Aqara, GE, Cync, and Yale are a few more early-access partners that will add cross-platform experience using these tools soon.</p><p>For now, Android devs can test these APIs with up to 100 users. They'll become widely available later this year, when Home APIs exit the beta stage.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="what-are-the-specs-of-the-oneplus-13-2">What are the specs of the OnePlus 13?</h2>
<p>We&apos;ve already begun calling the OnePlus 13 the &apos;perfect Android phone&apos;, and it isn&apos;t hard to see why. The OnePlus 13 triumphs with powerful Snapdragon performance, outstanding battery life, and one of the best-looking OLED displays that we&apos;ve ever seen. You also get a ton of useful features through Oxygen OS 15 alongside six years of guaranteed software updates, the most we&apos;ve ever seen in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phone</a>. Additionally, the 2025 flagship is the first<em> </em>phone to be released with IP69 water/dust resistance, which is a huge achievement in its own right. </p>
<h2 id="how-much-does-the-oneplus-13-cost-xa0-2">How much does the OnePlus 13 cost? </h2>
<p>The OnePlus 13 starts at $899.99 USD/$1,249.99 CAD for the 256GB version, while the 512GB configuration will set you back $999.99 USD/$1,399.99 CAD. That&apos;s $100 more expensive than the phone&apos;s predecessor, which is why the deals listed above are going to be pretty crucial for shoppers. </p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-oneplus-13r-2">What about the OnePlus 13R?</h2>
<p>In addition to the OnePlus 13, the company has announced that the <strong>OnePlus 13R will be released in the United States on January 14th</strong>. Starting at $599.99, the midrange phone comes with a lot of the same great hardware found in the OnePlus 13 at a significantly lower cost. The battery stays the same at a generous 6,000mAh, plus you get Oxygen OS 15 and a sleek, eye-catching design. </p><p>Naturally, you&apos;ll be taking a bit of a hit in the processing department — the OnePlus 13R doesn&apos;t use the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor — but the midrange phone is nevertheless destined to earn the title of "flagship killer" in 2025. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/oneplus-13r"><strong>Preorder the phone today</strong></a> for some enhanced trade-in credit and a free smartwatch. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While I no longer wear Fitbit's products, I still use the app quite regularly, and subscribe to Fitbit Premium for guided workouts. One of my most-used features is the ability to cast content to my Shield TV Pro, but a recent update (build 4.3.2) removes the ability to do that. <br><br>Without this feature, I'm essentially limited to watching Fitbit Premium videos on my phone. There still isn't a native Fitbit app on Android tablets (it just shows content vertically), and you don't get an Android TV client either, which is an egregious omission in 2025. <br><br>This limitation is only with the most recent build of the Fitbit app; I installed the older version on my phone, and was able to cast content without any issues. But there's no way to get the older build without sideloading it to your phone, and I wouldn't recommend doing that. I'm not really sure why Google decided to ditch this feature — particularly when there isn't an alternative to stream videos on Android TV or tablets. I reached out to the brand for a statement, and will update this post once I hear back. <br><br>I used Fitbit's fitness trackers extensively in the past, and there were several features — a fun interface and social challenges — that made its products highly differentiated. However, there isn't anything of that early charm left in today's Fitbit; Google disabled the social features back in 2023, and made considerable changes to the app last year, bringing a new interface that was somehow minimalist and needlessly complex at the same time. <br><br>Google's decision to intentionally disable the cast feature is the clearest proof yet that it doesn't care about the fitness platform. Using the Fitbit app is nothing short of frustrating these days, and I still don't get the rationale behind removing oft-used features. Google justified the deletion of social sharing as a way to roll out exciting updates, and two years later, there isn't anything close to an equivalent feature. And with no ability to cast content to TVs, I don't see myself using the service any longer.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 and 13R have now been officially launched globally, and the company has also introduced its flagship Buds Pro 3 in a new color variant, in addition to some upgrades that they get via OTA.</p><p>Firstly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a> will now be available in the Sapphire Blue color variant, adding to the Midnight Opus and Lunar Radiance colors launched last year. Per the shared release, the new blue shade complements the OnePlus 13's signature blue hue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vHJAuGjiBEZmmSmGiZMchP" name="oneplus-buds-3-pro-blue-05" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 Sapphire Blue" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHJAuGjiBEZmmSmGiZMchP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Buds Pro 3, in addition to the color variant, also includes some notable upgrades like Steady Connect, which promises to enhance Bluetooth connectivity and the audio experience for up to 360 meters. It works seamlessly for listening to music and taking calls, even if the phone is placed in another room.</p><p>In collaboration with the OnePlus 13 series, the Buds Pro 3 also introduces AI Translation for everyday communication. It means a user can utilize the earbuds during bilingual communication scenarios, wherein the other person can have a smoother conversation with the help of the AI Translation app on the handset for seamless conversation.</p>

<p>All the announced features will be rolled out to the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 through an OTA update, and the company notes it will work flawlessly when the buds are paired with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a>.</p><p>For the uninitiated, the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 launched last year already turned out to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">best earbuds</a> that the company has ever made. They were known for their outstanding sound, lightweight design, IP55 ingress protection, and decent battery life.</p><p>Users interested in trying out the new color of the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 will be able to purchase it starting today (January 7) through the company website. Despite the introduction of the new color variant, the company is still keeping the price intact, retailing at $179 in the U.S.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OnePlus has experienced quite a turnaround over the past few years. Once known as the "flagship killer" company, OnePlus eventually lost its original brand identity and went through some tumultuous times, but last year's OnePlus 12 signaled a huge transformation that proved the company could make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> around.</p><p>Now, the company has made the best Android phone I've ever used in my 14 years of reviewing Android phones. I've never given a phone a perfect score in all that time despite phones that have innovated or elevated the playing field, making the OnePlus 13 a particularly special phone.</p><p>It gets quite literally everything right. From the ground-breaking IP69 build quality to the best display ever reviewed by DisplayMate — including important eye care protections for users like me who are sensitive to PWM dimming — and a camera that OnePlus proudly claims "meets and beats the best out there." There's no better Android phone on the market than the OnePlus 13, and you'll find out why in my full review below.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cdmDbAJfRf2Ysbf4NVp5yB" name="oneplus-13-all-colors-back-05" alt="All three colorways of the OnePlus 13 in front of a OnePlus logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cdmDbAJfRf2Ysbf4NVp5yB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 is available globally on January 7, 2025. OnePlus offers several customization options for the phone, including three colorways and two RAM/storage combinations.</p>
<ul><li><strong>OnePlus 13 (12GB / 256GB):</strong> US$899 / CAD$1249 / ₹69,999 / £899. <em>Black Eclipse colorway only.</em></li><li><strong>OnePlus 13 (16GB / 512GB):</strong> US$999 / CAD$1399 / ₹76.999 / £999. <em>Black Eclipse, Midnight Ocean, Arctic Dawn colorways.</em></li><li><strong>OnePlus 13 (24GB / 1TB): </strong>₹89,999. <em>Black Eclipse colorway only.</em></li></ul>
<p>For the first month, Best Buy and OnePlus.com are the best places in the U.S. to buy the OnePlus 13. Best Buy is selling the black model in-store, while the black and white colorways are available online. OnePlus.com has all of the colors and available configurations.</p><p>Best Buy is also offering a free memory upgrade — making the 16GB/512GB model the same price as the 12GB/256GB model — plus a US$100/CAD$150 Best Buy gift card at launch. That makes the OnePlus 13's best SKU effectively US$799/CAD$1149 at launch from Best Buy.</p><p>OnePlus.com is also offering a free memory upgrade at launch plus several trade-in promotions. Customers are able to get a minimum of US$100/CAD$150 on any phone in any condition (yes, that means an old broken phone), or up to US$899/CAD$1249 for something newer, potentially making the phone totally free.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The OnePlus 13 is more expensive than last year's phone, but launch pricing promotions help significantly offset that cost and OnePlus still offers more value at the same price than the competition.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>OnePlus is following in the footsteps of companies like Samsung and Google — and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12's technical price hike</a> last year — by raising the price of each SKU by $100. To keep things in perspective, though, the OnePlus 13 is the same price as the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> and is $100 cheaper than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> but offers more RAM and storage than both of those phones.</p><p>OnePlus says the cost increase is down to a few important factors. First, the company is offering six years of software updates this time around — four OS updates and six years of security patches — as well as significant build quality and material improvements, making it the first phone to launch with IP69 certification.</p>

<p>No other flagship phone to date offers a spec sheet quite like the OnePlus 13, which tops out with the best specs in almost every single category.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13-design-and-hardware"><span>OnePlus 13: Design and Hardware</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qju4xE4VuR7e7L7cNpE2Cj" name="oneplus-13-all-colors-back-01" alt="The camera island on the back of all three colorways of the OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qju4xE4VuR7e7L7cNpE2Cj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 is the perfect mix between classic OnePlus phone design and modern phone design trends. It keeps the trademark alert slider on the side, making it easy to switch between silent, vibrant, and normal volume modes. It features the best haptics I've used on any non-Pixel phone, and the new haptic moments in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">Oxygen OS 15</a> highlight the haptic quality over every other phone on the market.</p><p>Most Android manufacturers have started making flatter phones, and while the OnePlus 13 is the flattest flagship OnePlus has made in quite some time, it's not as flat as a Galaxy S24 or Pixel 9. Instead, OnePlus struck a much nicer balance between its previous design and those totally flat phones, creating something that feels significantly better to hold.</p><p>The side rails are flat, but both the front and back of the phone have a slight "2.5D" curved edge. This makes it easy to slide your finger underneath when it's sitting on a table and makes it far more comfortable to hold and use than Google or Samsung's overly flat designs. Not everyone will agree, but I don't like flat phones and strongly dislike the trend of making everything a flat slab.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WL2xpstsJQhwu2q6MqXBEo" name="oneplus-13-official-case-insert" alt="The insert included in official OnePlus 13 cases for the thinner black and white models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WL2xpstsJQhwu2q6MqXBEo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The blue OnePlus 13 is this much thicker than the white and black models.

<p>Despite having a battery that's 600mAh larger than the OnePlus 12, the OnePlus 13 ends up being a bit thinner — 9.2mm for the OnePlus 12 versus 8.5mm thin for the Arctic and Black colorways, or 8.9mm thin for the blue Midnight Ocean variant.</p><p>The textured glass on the Arctic and Black colorways is quite nice looking, but nothing can beat the vegan leather blue model that I've got for review. Every company's "vegan leather" feels a little different, and the one OnePlus uses here feels like suede, which is particularly fitting since it's blue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="r9kJ4Go62SQeZ2i4MKC834" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-02" alt="A close-up of the textured vegan leather on the back of the Ocean blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r9kJ4Go62SQeZ2i4MKC834.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The blue vegan leather feels like suede and offers a superior level of protection that no other flagship phone on the market offers through IP69 certification.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Visually, the blue OnePlus 13 is the most beautiful phone I've ever used. The silver trim and white camera island look and feel incredibly classy, and the vegan leather both add a layer of grip that glass can't offer. Plus, according to OnePlus, the phone is even more durable since there's no glass at all on the back.</p><p>No matter what colorway you choose, every OnePlus 13 is IP68 and IP69 water and dust-resistant. As Harish Jonnalagadda explained <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/exclusive-onepluss-head-of-industrial-design-on-delivering-the-best-in-hand-feel-with-the-oneplus-13">in his exclusive interview</a> with OnePlus's head of design, both certifications are necessary because they signify different things. IP68 covers water submersion, while IP69 includes the ability to withstand high-pressure jets of water at up to 80 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>To test this out, we ran a blue OnePlus 13 through a dishwasher's sanitizing cycle for four hours. I then took the OnePlus 13 to a 68c/155f sauna and played Minecraft on it for half an hour, all while keeping it in one of the company's own cases. The phone never got above 50c, but I'll cover performance in more detail in a separate section below.</p><p>This is the best-built Android phone on the market, full stop. OnePlus is so confident of the build quality that the company showed off a OnePlus 13 being dropped in hot cooking oil, only to fish it out and use it right after. Funny enough, like every other phone on the market, it's not rated for salt water.</p>

<p>This also marks the first time a OnePlus flagship has received proper IP68 certification. Prior models could technically withstand the same torture tests as other brands, but OnePlus wouldn't necessarily guarantee performance since it wasn't certified. That changes with the OnePlus 13.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>This is the best-built Android phone on the market, full stop. You can even sanitize it in your dishwasher thanks to the IP69 certification.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>OnePlus also introduced a few new communications features on the OnePlus 13, including BeaconLink and extended Bluetooth range. BeaconLink lets you call another OnePlus 13 (when permission is granted) using just Bluetooth. It's sort of a "walkie-talkie" mode that was fun to use during the OnePlus 13's unveiling event and can reach as far as 200 meters away. Whether or not you'll actually use this in real life is its own conversation, though.</p><p>OnePlus is also debuting an expanded Bluetooth range for earbuds in a Q1 update, so you can keep playing music from across the house (or office) without it cutting in and out.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>You'll still need a case to get full Qi2 support with MagSafe magnets.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>My one disappointment with the hardware is the lack of integrated Qi2 support without a case. All of the official OnePlus 13 cases include magnets and full Qi2 support — even the full 15W wireless charging speed — but it's frustrating that no Android company can seem to get magnets in a flagship phone, even in 2025. OnePlus obviously isn't alone here, and, to the company's credit, it is the only brand selling official cases with Qi2 support at the time this review was written.</p><p>Before we leave the topic of cases, if you pick up a OnePlus 13 this year, be sure to check the compatibility with the case you want before you buy it. All of the official OnePlus cases come with a small insert that helps close the gap between the Arctic/Black colorways and the Ocean blue one — remember, the blue OnePlus 13 is a little thicker because of the vegan leather — which means some cases potentially will look a little off.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yWqoRgJkkvcVhuRzagUPE7" name="oneplus-13-display-home-screen-01" alt="The beautiful, eye-friendly display on the OnePlus 13 showing the home screen with a vibrant wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWqoRgJkkvcVhuRzagUPE7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 features the best display of any phone on the market — an award that regularly changes hands every few months but feels more important on this phone than some others. Notably, OnePlus doesn't use a Samsung display. While many consider Samsung AMOLED panels to be "the best" for image quality, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-grainy-mura-problem-reported">has been slipping</a> over the past few years.</p><p>The OnePlus 13's OLED panel has not only achieved the first-ever DisplayMate A++ certification thanks to its new extra-high brightness RadiantView mode, but it also achieved the more important TÜV Rheinland Intelligent Eye Care 4.0 certification. Phones like the Pixel 9 Pro might have a brighter standard output, but they don't achieve that in a way that's safe for your eyes, leading to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming sensitivity</a> in people like me.</p><p>The phone uses a true 10-bit panel and doesn't dither, helping to further seal its eye-friendly certification. Dithering is used when a display tries to show a color it isn't physically capable of, so it flashes a pixel between two colors very quickly to trick your eyes into seeing a color that doesn't exist. Think of it like a spinning color wheel from the elementary school days. Needless to say, this type of flickering hurts some people's eyes and can cause headaches, but the OnePlus 13 is free from such nonsense.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>This is the best smartphone display ever made and it achieves display excellence without sacrificing eye health, unlike Samsung or Pixel phones.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>When you step into the sunlight, the OnePlus 13's RadiantView sunlight display algorithm kicks in to boost brightness beyond what other phones on the market offer. Samsung famously added an anti-glare layer to its screen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> to help with sunlight visibility, but the OnePlus 13 is even easier to see in sunlight despite not sporting this layer.</p><p>I tested this myself on a sunny beach in the Bahamas, so I know it's not just marketing fluff.</p><p>The display itself is fully flat, but the glass surrounding it has a quad-curved edge. That means some tempered glass screen protectors will be fully flat while others add on a tapered edge. I'll be testing several different tempered glass screen protectors as soon as they arrive, but know that the OnePlus 13 comes with a pre-installed film-type screen protector to keep it from getting scratched.</p><p>Even without a screen protector, OnePlus says it chose Ceramic Guard glass over Gorilla Glass because it offers better scratch and drop protection.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The OnePlus 13 has the only ultrasonic fingerprint sensor that's ever worked well for me.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Under the display is a new ultrasonic fingerprint sensor that replaces the optical sensors OnePlus has used since the company's first phone. I typically loathe ultrasonic sensors as they don't work well for me and I've noted this on every phone I've reviewed with an ultrasonic sensor over the past few years. I can thankfully say that the one on the OnePlus 13 doesn't suffer from the same problems.</p><p>Thus far, I've only had one or two instances where dry winter skin affected unlocking performance for me. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S24 and Pixel 9 series regularly have trouble reading my fingerprint even in the warm months. Ultrasonic sensors also have the ability to read your fingerprint when it's wet, so no need to dry your hands when cooking if you need to unlock your phone.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WaYAGooi56AYfBWHTdLGYC" name="oneplus-13-blue-snapdragon-8-elite-01" alt="A blue OnePlus 13 with a Snapdragon 8 Elite placard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WaYAGooi56AYfBWHTdLGYC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the foremost reasons people have chosen OnePlus phones in recent years is because they feature the fastest charging speeds available. Battery anxiety completely disappears with a phone like the OnePlus 13 because you don't need more than 15 minutes to top up your battery thanks to the company's SUPERVOOC 80W charging capability.</p><p>OnePlus still includes a charger in the box, meaning you won't have to spend another $50 on something that'll give you full speed. It's yet another reason OnePlus offers better value than other companies, and it ensures you get the best experience out of the box. I always seem to underestimate just how fast this phone charges and am constantly surprised when I plug it in for 10 or 15 minutes and see that it's already in the 80% range.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>If you've never used a OnePlus phone before, you're going to be absolutely blown away by not only how good the battery life is, but also by how fast it charges.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>To help with battery safety and longevity, OnePlus has not only packed 14 temperature sensors into the phone but has improved its battery by including 10% silicon content. That makes it a 5.5% denser battery than the OnePlus 12, allowing the company to make it 600mAh larger while still reducing the physical size and weight of the battery.</p><p>If you've never used a OnePlus phone before, you're going to be absolutely blown away by not only how good the battery life is but also by how fast it charges. It puts every leading flagship phone to shame, and I can guarantee you'll never want to go back to a Samsung, Apple, or Google phone again after this.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2376px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.45%;"><img id="84sM89pbuHoUopeBs9rbWX" name="oneplus-13-torture-test-after-30-minutes" alt="Even after running Minecraft for 30 minutes while the OnePlus 13 was in a 155f/68c sauna, the phone still performed incredibly well and exhibited no stability issues" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/84sM89pbuHoUopeBs9rbWX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2376" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The OnePlus 13 is more than twice as fast as the Google Pixel 9 series and thermal management makes it the fastest Snapdragon 8 Elite phone available today.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As I noted previously, I took the OnePlus 13 into a 155f/68c sauna for an extreme 30-minute gaming stress test. Even though it was in a case — something that usually hinders thermal management — the phone never got above 50c even though the environment around it was 68c.</p><p>I also have never seen the phone falter once in its impeccable performance, whether that's normal day-to-day scrolling or playing games at 120FPS. Multitasking is the best I've seen among any flagship phone, including a multitasking UI that makes it easy to quickly switch between apps faster than any other phone I've used.</p>

<p>A row of app icons on the bottom of the Recents screen makes it possible to instantly move between 7 apps at a time, feeling more like desktop OS taskbar efficiency rather than the bumbling UI Google typically uses in stock Android and on Pixel phones.</p><p>OnePlus has also added the fantastic Canvas functionality from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> foldable, making it easy to run an app in nearly full screen with a second app "in waiting" for extremely efficient 2-app multitasking. This is better than traditional split-screen multitasking on a phone because the main app takes up most of the display rather than being cut in half.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13-cameras"><span>OnePlus 13: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wzyGkixdxMtsMy5f64jhUU" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-camera-module-hasselblad-logo-02" alt="A close-up of the Hasselblad logo next to the camera island on the OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wzyGkixdxMtsMy5f64jhUU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For ages, OnePlus has lagged behind the pack with its smartphone cameras. That all changes with the OnePlus 13. It's not only the first OnePlus phone I think is worthy of the Hasselblad branding — despite this being the 5th year OnePlus phones have donned the "H" — but it's easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best smartphone cameras</a> I've ever used.</p><p>It's also the first time I could use a OnePlus phone and not feel like I need to take along a second phone to ensure I get the best photo. In fact, most of the photos in this review were taken <em>from</em> a OnePlus 13 using the phone's RAW photo option.</p><p>This phone's camera goes toe-to-toe with the best from Google, Samsung, Apple, Honor, and Vivo in every category, and it's downright incredible to see OnePlus make such a huge jump in quality in a single generation. Some of it is down to the new Sony LYT camera sensors used in the main and telephoto cameras on the back, but a lot of it has to do with software.</p><p>OnePlus is introducing a brand new dual exposure algorithm that is used with every single capture and shines in HDR and motion capture. Considering these were the only two real weak points of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-camera-impressions-why-it-replaced-my-pixel-9">OnePlus 12's camera</a>, it's good to see that OnePlus focused on these areas so much.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>This is the first time I felt like a OnePlus phone was worthy of the Hasselblad camera branding.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Dual exposure powers the upgraded action mode, which can capture moving subjects just as well as a Pixel or Honor phone, both of which hold the crown in moving subject capture. This is a massive step forward for the company and solidifies the feeling that you can finally consider a OnePlus phone if a good camera is the main reason you choose your smartphone.</p><p>OnePlus says it's best to hold down the shutter button to get a burst of photos with the company's new Clear Burst algorithm, but I've found that the AI-based processing model does an excellent job of automatically picking the best photo even when you just tap the shutter button once.</p><p>If you take a picture and tap the preview image fast enough, you'll often be able to see the image processing quickly and choose the best photo for the end result. Holding down the shutter button gives you more manual control and lets you choose from a selection of burst shots if you prefer that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="QBEetobWgoaY2uMAhS3yHM" name="oneplus-13-camera-sample-night-motion" alt="A low light camera sample from a OnePlus 13 showcasing excellent motion capture detail (see the bowling ball traveling down the lane)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QBEetobWgoaY2uMAhS3yHM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Take this example above, which is easily one of the best photos I've ever captured with a smartphone camera. This bowling alley is in a dimly lit bar in downtown Asheville, which is already a tough environment for a smartphone camera. Most phones would overexpose this image and make it look like mid-day. Not the OnePlus 13, which absolutely <em>nails</em> the exposure and captures the mood perfectly.</p><p>Then, there's the bowling ball in the middle of the image. It was traveling down the lane when I captured the shot, but unlike most other smartphones, the ball is perfectly crisp, and the moment is enshrined in the image to utter perfection.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I've been blown away by the camera quality of the OnePlus 13, which now tops the best Android camera experiences available.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But it's not just moving image capture that has improved. Both the main and telephoto cameras deliver an exceptional experience that has delighted me constantly over the past few weeks as I've taken this phone to the Bahamas, on snowy hikes, and to several different Christmas light shows and events.</p><p>Telephoto performance is truly exceptional using the new Sony LYT-600 sensor and OnePlus's new flat Triprism lens. This lens is 24% smaller and 30% lighter than the OnePlus 12's design, all while delivering better results. As is the case with most phones, 30X zoom is where you should stop if you're concerned about the best quality, but OnePlus offers up to 120X zoom if you're feeling really lucky.</p><p>There wasn't a single category where I saw the OnePlus 13's camera falter. Whether I was taking a wide-angle low-light photo of a twinkling downtown Asheville intersection, a portrait shot of the fancy mermaid Santa glass I got at a tiki bar, or selfies of my wife and me on a Royal Caribbean cruise, I was amazed at the quality on display from this phone.</p><p>I'll have a more detailed camera review that breaks down every nook and cranny of the phone's camera performance, but for the time being, here are some of my favorite shots taken with the phone in the past three weeks.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Motion capture is top-notch, going toe-to-toe with Pixel and Honor phones for the first time ever.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 also offers OnePlus the opportunity to further improve its camera software and UI. A new scene selection mode lets you choose from Stage, Silhouette, and Fireworks scenes to best optimize the shot you're going for. It's not exactly an extensive list, but these quick selections do come in handy if you're at a concert or trying to take specific types of photos.</p><p>Action mode and motion photos are also improved, with action mode sporting a 60FPS viewfinder and improved capture time that's twice the speed of the OnePlus 12 in my tests.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 is one of the only phones that still offers 480FPS slow motion video, while most "flagships" stop at 240FPS. Even Samsung abandoned its 960FPS modes last year and hasn't bothered offering anything better, although the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-instant-slow-mo-galaxy-ai-pure-magic">instant slow-mo feature</a> (powered by AI) is a ton of fun to use.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>All four cameras support 4K Dolby Vision HDR capture, and a new flat telephoto lens delivers better quality at a reduced footprint.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>You'll find 4K Dolby Vision HDR video capture on all of the phone's cameras, including the front camera. That makes it possible to select the quality <em>you want </em>without having to worry about which camera can make use of it. Many phones still only offer specific quality selections for the main camera, and this can be confusing.</p><p>OnePlus has also drastically improved its real-time zoom algorithm and now sports virtually no pop-in when zooming between cameras. I've found that if you zoom in or out too quickly between cameras after starting a video, you'll see a brief transition between lenses, but that goes away after a few seconds. Most phones still struggle to offer truly smooth transitions between lenses like this, and again, it's great to see OnePlus work on an annoying weak point like this.</p>

<p>OnePlus didn't spend too much time talking about AI in its presentation for the phone, but it did (rightfully) highlight the AI features found in the phone's gallery app. As Android Central's Accessories Editor, Namerah Saud-Fatmi, found out last October when she pitted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-ai-eraser-versus-magic-eraser">OnePlus's new AI features against Google's famous Magic Eraser</a>, OnePlus doesn't just hold its own — it actually does things better than the competition.</p><p>Not only that, but OnePlus does a better job of surfacing these features than Samsung, matching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>' clever methods by adding a dynamic button for recommended AI features when scrolling through photos. Features like AI unblur are suggested on photos that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-just-made-2024s-best-phone-even-better">have obvious blurring</a>.</p><p>Thankfully, because of the excellent motion capture, you won't have to do this very often, but you can always touch up old photos with OnePlus' excellent AI solutions.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 launches with the Android 15-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a>, which sports an identical feature set to Oppo's Color OS found on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">OPPO Find X8 Pro</a>. Oxygen OS 15 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-releases-android-15-based-oxygenos-15-heres-when-your-phone-will-get-the-update">has been available</a> on the OnePlus 12, OnePlus 12R, OnePlus Open, and several other OnePlus phones for around 2 months now, so most of the feature set isn't anything new.</p><p>In summary, you'll get one of the best Android UIs available today, including tons of customization options, cleverly designed UI elements and buttons that make it easy to find what you need quickly, and unique elements like the OnePlus Shelf on the home screen that you may or may not use (I don't).</p><p>OnePlus also introduced many AI features with Oxygen OS 15, like AI writing help, photography enhancement tools — not generative AI stuff like Samsung and Google have done — and handy tools like Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search" target="_blank">Circle to Search</a>. Most of these things are expected in modern phones, but I'm happy that OnePlus isn't constantly pushing them in our faces like some other companies have.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Oxygen OS 15 is the epitome of an excellent version of Android, but I want to see more AI features with offline capabilities.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>My biggest critique of these tools isn't their functionality. They actually work incredibly well and often better than on other phones. The issue is that nothing is done locally; instead, all of these AI tools run via cloud computing. That means there's no way to run them without an internet connection and no guarantee they'll still be available six years down the road when OnePlus ends software support for the phone.</p><p>OnePlus says it will likely move the most popular features to local computing down the road once it identifies the ones people enjoy using often. I'd rather see the company go local first and offer cloud services for better speed or accuracy, but OnePlus says it went this route because it makes it easier to scale functionality at a better cost.</p><p>Regardless of where AI computing is done, OxygenOS 15 remains my favorite Android flavor on the market today. It's packed with incredible features, has the best UI and multitasking, and somehow feels both fast <em>and </em>light despite being feature-rich.</p>

<p>OnePlus's most direct competition in the U.S. is the Google Pixel 9 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus</a>. Both phones retail for the same price but offer less RAM and less storage. Additionally, both are slower — significantly more so in the Pixel's case — both offer worse displays that are harsher on your eyes, and Samsung's haptics feel downright pitiful compared to Google or OnePlus's.</p><p>Charging speed is also embarrassingly slow on Samsung and Google phones compared to OnePlus, and battery life is better on the OnePlus 13 than either of these devices. The only real advantage of going either to Samsung or Google is that you'll get three more OS updates before you may want to buy a new phone. I'm not sure how many people actually hold on to phones for more than five years, but it's still an advantage Google and Samsung have for now.</p><p>Internationally, brands like Vivo offer a similar UI on <em>some</em> phones and may also offer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/replacing-my-dslr-with-vivo-x100-pro">slightly better cameras</a> depending on what you like photographing. Overall, the camera improvements OnePlus made with the OnePlus 13 mean that even phones like the Vivo X100 Pro are outclassed in things like motion capture or video recording quality.</p><p>If price is the biggest concern, a OnePlus 12 can be had for a few hundred dollars less and offers many of the best features of the OnePlus 13. It isn't IP69 rated, its camera isn't quite as good, and the curved display certainly irritates some people, but it's blazing fast, offers incredible haptics, and sports all the best Oxygen OS 15 features the OnePlus 13 has.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a unique-looking phone that's built better than you thought a phone could be.</li><li>You need an excellent camera experience that can capture kids and pets without blur.</li><li>You're a power user who loves peak performance, multitasking, and thermal management.</li><li>You're tired of battery anxiety on phones and want a phone that'll charge in just a few minutes.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want to use AI tools with offline functionality.</li><li>You want to keep using your phone for more than 6 years with updates.</li></ul>
<p>The OnePlus 13 is the best Android phone ever made. It's the only phone I've ever given a perfect review score because there's no area where the phone falters or needs real improvement. The hardware is as good as it gets, offering the best haptics, superior build quality, top-notch design, and unique features like the alert slider. It also has a display that's both best-in-class and safe for your eyes in the long term, unlike the competition in North America.</p><p>The value for the money still eclipses everything else in its class despite the $100 price increase over last year's OnePlus 12. More RAM and storage than the competition means it'll feel newer for longer than other phones, and the top-tier performance and multitasking will make any power user happy. Plus, there's simply nothing like the OnePlus 13's battery life or charging speeds.</p><p>The OxygenOS 15 software experience is the cream-of-the-crop Android experience, providing an intelligently designed UI with tons of features you'll actually want to use because they're easy to find — not hidden in tons of sub-menus or requiring additional downloads like some other brands. It's also not overly packed with useless AI bloat that you'd probably use once and forget about.</p><p>And let's not forget about the camera, which somehow meets and even sometimes beats the best on the market. It's a position I never thought I'd see a OnePlus phone in, yet the OnePlus 13 sports a camera that everyone will love to use all day. The OnePlus 13 is a triumph of a phone that everyone should consider, and it's almost certainly the 2025 phone of the year despite launching in the first two weeks of January.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus has launched the OnePlus 13 and 13R globally today (Jan. 7). The company said these devices will come packed with more AI capabilities than its previous models and a fully upgraded camera system.</p><p>Both devices will come with enhanced connectivity and 5.5G support, and a unique Bluetooth connectivity called 'Beacon Link' that will allow devices up to 200 meters apart to operate as a walkie-talkie.</p><p>In a press release, OnePlus said that these devices are set to deliver "powerful, reliable performances " that will create a next-gen experience for its users.</p><p>Let's get into what's in store for us with the OnePlus 13 and 13R.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-2">OnePlus 13</h2>
<p>To start, the OnePlus 13 is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, a bump from the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC featured in its previous model. The device has a clear 6.82-inch QHD+ screen with a 120Hz refresh rate that can display 4500 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>This device is said to feature a range of OnePlus AI tools backed by OxygenOS 15, the latest version of OnePlus' operating system. As well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and Intelligent Search. It also packs a wide range of image editing tools, like AI Unblur, AI Detail Boost, and AI Reflection Eraser, that make photos look seamless.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 carries a new technology designed to protect your eyes from excessive brightness, TÜV Rheinland Eye Care 4.0 certification, and an Aqua Touch 2.0, which senses touch even if the user has oily hands or is using gloves.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8001px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="QtNqU2P26omj5WBvBpHVz4" name="OnePlus-13-white-lifestyle" alt="A woman setting the OnePlus 13 down on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QtNqU2P26omj5WBvBpHVz4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8001" height="4501" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 gets a larger OnePlus 6,000mAh (Dual-cell 3,000 mAh, non-removable) Silicon NanoStack battery that is cooled down by Dual Cryo-Velocity vapor chambers, giving it a long-lasting life. OnePlus includes an 80W charger and is compatible with the 50W AIRVOOC (wireless charging). You also get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-oneplus-13-support-magsafe-qi2-wireless-charging">Qi2 magnetic charging</a> via external cases, one of the first Android phones to bring such functionality.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:13180px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bunm8LqHdGVLPnccbAkw95" name="OnePlus-13-underwater" alt="Two OnePlus 13 phones underwater" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bunm8LqHdGVLPnccbAkw95.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="13180" height="7414" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to dust and water protection, the new device comes with IP68 <em>and</em> a higher IP69, which protects the phone from high-pressure water jets and steam cleaning. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13 review</a>, Android Central's Nick Sutrich put the phone through a dishwashing cycle, and the phone came out unscathed.</p><p>According to OnePlus's Marcel Campos, Director of integrated marketing campaigns, this was extremely difficult to achieve since the materials degrade over time when stressed or exposed to harsh environments.</p><p>Talking about camera systems, OnePlus has co-developed with 5-Gen Hasselblad and has a powerful triple camera system: a 50MP Sony LYT-808 main camera, a 50MP Ultra-Wide camera, and a 50MP 3X Triprism Telephoto camera, which is equipped to capture shots at more than 10X zoom. These cameras are equipped to shoot in a Dual Exposure Algorithm with burst and action modes that help take photos in fast-moving spaces. On the front, it has stuck to the same 32 MP selfie camera for this year's model as well.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 comes in three colorways: Midnight Ocean, Arctic Dawn, and Black Eclipse. The Midnight Ocean colorway is the first phone to feature microfiber vegan leather. For storage, consumers will find the following RAM/internal storage variants: 12/256GB and 16/512GB. Users can start <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/launch/13" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">pre-ordering</a> the device starting at US $899.99 in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="oneplus-13r-2">OnePlus 13R</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hsSZGjH78VGUUKLWj6xAUD" name="OnePlus-13R-Zoomed" alt="A close-up of the OnePlus 13R's camera bump." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hsSZGjH78VGUUKLWj6xAUD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the budget flagship model, the OnePlus 13R shares the same design as the OnePlus 13 and gets the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC with a 6.78-inch 1.5K ProXDR flat display. The 13R, like the OnePlus 13, is also equipped with the Eye Care 4.0 certification and an Aqua Touch 2.0. For the first time, the OnePlus 13R features Corning's Gorilla Glass 7i, which provides scratch resistance and durability.</p><p>The camera system has taken a step further when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>. Its main 50MP camera, equipped with the Sony LYT-700 sensor and OIS, helps shoot in low-light conditions. The camera can also capture swift moments like the OnePlus 13, with a 50MP telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom for sharp, detailed portraits and an 8MP ultra-wide camera for capturing "expansive scenes."</p>

<h2 id="battery-life-and-charging-on-the-oneplus-13-2">Battery life and charging on the OnePlus 13</h2>
<p>Qi2, a wireless charging standard that pairs 15W speeds with magnetic connection for cases, chargers, and accessories, became available for Android OEMs last year. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> does not fully support the Qi2 charging specification the same way iPhones do because it lacks internal magnets, it will work with Qi2 chargers at the full 15W speeds. Additionally, using an official OnePlus 13 Magnetic Case will provide the full MagSafe/Qi2 experience.</p><p>The Wireless Power Consortium, which manages the Qi2 standard, says that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-does-not-require-magnets">magnets are required for a phone to be Qi2 branded</a>. However, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">just announced a "Qi2 Ready" branding</a> that is meant for phones like the OnePlus 13. These phones technically support Qi2's 15W wireless charging specification and work with accessories that add magnetic connection separately. In "approved combinations," the WPC says these Qi2 Ready devices and accessories will deliver the full Qi2 user experience.</p><p>Although the OnePlus 13 isn't officially branded as Qi2 Ready, the phone will effectively offer the same experience as a Qi2 phone when paired with a Magnetic Case.</p>

<p>On top of that, the OnePlus 13 supports OnePlus's own wireless charging technology. This enables up to 50W fast wireless charging when used with the AIRVOOC 50W Magnetic Charger. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship smartphone</a> has a 6,000mAh battery capacity, so it'll last a while between charges. Alternatively, you can use a USB-C cable for 80W wired charging.</p><p>OnePlus told Android Central that it didn't include inbuilt Qi2/MagSafe magnets in the OnePlus 13 because they can interfere with other components and lose strength over time. By using a case for the magnets, you can easily swap out a case if the magnets lose strength.</p><p>To sum up, you can get 15W charging speeds by using the OnePlus 13 with any Qi2-enabled charger or accessory out of the box, but you will need to add magnets by using an official or third-party magnetic case for secure connection with chargers and accessories.</p>

<ul><li>The Lenovo Tab, Idea Tab Pro, and Yoga Tab Plus have been officially announced at CES 2025.</li><li>The Lenovo Tab is aimed at the budget market, while the Idea Tab Pro and Yoga Tab Plus are mid-range and flagship alternatives.</li><li>These tablets will begin arriving later this month with the Lenovo Tab coming in June.</li></ul>
<p>CES 2025 is underway, and while there aren't very many Android-centric releases, Lenovo has a few surprises. The company is announcing a wide number of new devices, including a few new tablets with the Lenovo Tab, Idea Tab Pro, and Yoga Tab Plus.</p><p>Starting with the Lenovo Tab, this is the company's budget option with its 10.1-inch display and a 1920 x 1200 resolution. Under the hood, we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mediatek-announces-gaming-focused-helio-g85-chipset-budget-phones">MediaTek Helio G85</a> paired with 4GB of RAM and either 64GB or 128GB of onboard storage. Battery life should be pretty solid with the 5,100mAh cell, but with just 15W Quick Charge speeds, getting it back to 100% will definitely take a bit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3148px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="NuZECybATXbsJfAom3oNm4" name="lenovo-tab-polar-blue-vertical-stand-render" alt="Lenovo Tab in Polar Blue propped vertically using first-party case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NuZECybATXbsJfAom3oNm4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3148" height="1771" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of the other specs found on the Tab include a 5MP Fixed Focus selfie camera, an 8MP rear camera, and dual Dolby Atmos-tuned speakers. Lenovo is also planning to offer a few different cases, including a Clear Case with stand, Folio Case, and a "Play Suite case for the young kids at home."</p>

<p>Moving up a tier, the Idea Tab Pro looks to offer a compelling option for those who want a mid-range productivity tablet. It features the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-8300-announced">MediaTek Dimensity 8300</a> chipset with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The cameras also offer an upgrade, courtesy of the 8GB selfie camera and a 13MP lens on the back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="65jZvcEzpymnPZH6L7fJsg" name="lenovo-idea-tab-pro-with-keyboard-press-render" alt="Lenovo Idea Tab Pro render with keyboard and stylus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/65jZvcEzpymnPZH6L7fJsg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The star of the show here is the display, as Lenovo is utilizing a 12.7-inch IPS LCD panel with a 2944 x 1840 resolution. Thankfully, the Idea Tab Pro also features a 144Hz refresh rate, which is a surprising, yet welcome, inclusion. Battery life should also be pretty impressive thanks to the 10,200mAh battery which includes support for up to 45W fast charging.</p><p>While the Dimensity 8300 might not be the most exciting chip, Lenovo claims it "delivers 60% more power than the previous model." That's already pretty enticing, but those who want to get work done, will also enjoy the fact that Lenovo is offering bundles with a 2-in-1 keyboard case and the Tab Pen Plus.</p><p>Last, but certainly not least is the Yoga Tab Plus, which is easily the flagship option of this trio. It shares the same 12.7-inch display as the Idea Tab Pro, complete with the 144Hz refresh rate and the 10,200mAh battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hvSKgnffvJfJdPuxenTVmg" name="lenovo-yoga-tab-plus-press-render" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tab Plus render with colors, keyboard, and stylus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvSKgnffvJfJdPuxenTVmg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, that's where the similarities come to an end as it ditches the Dimensity 8300 in favor of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. This is paired with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, making it a true competitor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-is-here-but-one-major-thing-is-missing">Galaxy Tab S10 Plus</a> in the battle for most powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>.</p><p>It shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, but Lenovo is also packing some AI into the Yoga Tab Plus, courtesy of Lenovo AI Now. The company claims the Tab Plus offers "built-in large language models," while also providing "local data processing."</p><p>The Tab Plus can also be used with Lenovo's 2-in-1 keyboard case and Tab Pen Pro, making it a productivity powerhouse. It has the added benefit of featuring Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.3, which is the only tablet of this trio to include this combination.</p><p>All three tablets will be released within the first six months of 2025, starting with the Yoga Tab Plus later this month, which is priced at $699. The Idea Tab Pro is slated to arrive sometime in April with a retail price of $349.99, and the Lenovo Tab will land in June, priced at $159.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-117">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>In addition to a trio of more traditional Android tablets, the Lenovo Legion Tab was also announced.</li><li>This is geared towards mobile gamers with its 8.8-inch 165Hz display and the Legion Coldfront Vapor Chamber.</li><li>The Legion Tab is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and will arrive later this month.</li></ul>
<p>As someone who has been hoping to see a powerful tablet in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/we-need-smaller-flagship-android-tablets">smaller form factor</a>, the new Lenovo Legion Tab looks to check almost all of the boxes. This is actually the fourth tablet that Lenovo has announced at CES 2025, but is the only one that falls under Lenovo's "Legion" gaming brand.</p><p>Out of the gate, the Legion Tab features an 8.8-inch display with a 165Hz refresh rate, HDR10 support, and a 2560 x 1600 (QHD+) resolution. Although we're a bit surprised to see Lenovo opt for an IPS panel over OLED, all of your games and media are expected to still look incredible.</p><p>That's rather important, as the Legion Tab is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and will be available with up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Unfortunately, Lenovo decided against including a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot, which is rather disappointing if you were hoping to use this as an all-in-one gaming device.</p>

<p>As this is a gaming-focused device, Lenovo understands the higher-concern for potential heating problems. However, the Legion Coldfront Vapor Chamber "handles the heat," so you can play games for longer without worrying about thermal throttling.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1792px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aVUxavmXrx9GnMzmwdTyw3" name="lenovo-legion-tablet-angled-view-render" alt="Lenovo Legion Tab angled view press render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aVUxavmXrx9GnMzmwdTyw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1792" height="1008" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only tablet that we've seen come close to offering this level of power is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmagic-nova-gaming-tablet-international-launch-details">RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet</a>. And while the Nova provides an excellent gaming experience, the 11-inch display might still be a bit too big for some.</p><p>In addition to the premium performance and display, Lenovo isn't skimping out on the build quality. The Legion Tab features a "full-metal design," while being 7.79mm thin and weighing just 350 grams. By comparison, the Nova Gaming Tablet comes in at 530 grams, making it rather unwieldy for longer gaming sessions.</p><p>Out of the box, the Legion Tab runs Android 15, and Lenovo states that it's hitting the market sometime this month. Pricing for Lenovo's latest gaming-focused tablet starts at $499, putting it right in line with the competition.</p>

<ul><li>The Ultrahuman Rare Desert Collection was announced at CES 2025, available in Desert Rose, Dune, and Desert Snow.</li><li>It uses similar components to the Ultrahuman Ring Air, including sleep, movement, and health tracking.</li><li>They start at £1,499, well above the normal cost for smart rings, with premium gold or platinum materials.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Smart rings have always struck a balance between smarts and style. The Ultrahuman Rare will lean heavily towards the latter, with truly premium materials and a "handcrafted" design that'll blend in more as traditional jewelry. And I suspect it'll be the first smart ring of many to go all in on luxury.</p><p>Announced at CES 2025, the Ultrahuman Rare "Desert Collection" will come in Desert Rose, Dune, and Desert Snow. The first two use 18K gold sourced from "approved refineries" and cost £1,499, while Rare Desert Snow uses PT950 Platinum (meaning it's 95% platinum) and jumps to £1,799.</p><p>All three luxury smart rings will have a brushed texture on the outer shell that's meant to reflect light in distinct ways, standing out from the typical matte or glossy appearance of normal titanium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a>.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qEbllFkk0Ws" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>On the inside, of course, Ultrahuman Rare rings <em>are</em> normal. Like the £329 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>, the Rare series has 6-axis motion sensors, PPG, and skin temp sensors that track sleep quality, recovery, and activity. Ultrahuman says that "what sets the Rare apart...is the complex engineering that goes into making a robust yet aesthetic form factor out of gold, platinum, and rose gold."</p><p>Anyone who buys the extravagant Ultrahuman Rare will get a lifetime subscription to UltrahumanX — meaning the company would theoretically replace your Rare if it's stolen — and access to all current and future <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-adds-afib-new-app-store-of-powerplugs">PowerPlugs</a> like AFib detection and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-dont-more-smartwatches-use-this-smart-rings-seemingly-obvious-trick">smart alarms</a>, without having to pay for access.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eAmJ9piccGiGtzpJfwn3tb" name="Ultrahuman-Rare-Desert-Collection-renders" alt="Renders of the Ultrahuman Rare Desert Rose, Desert Snow, and Dune smart rings at various angles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eAmJ9piccGiGtzpJfwn3tb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, the Ultrahuman Rare will be darn expensive when it launches in mid-January; the priciest rival smart ring at the moment is the $499 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> in Gold or Rose Gold. Plus, it'll be exclusively available in two department stores: Selfridges in London and Printemps in Paris.</p><p>I doubt if the Ultrahuman Rare will sell anywhere near the scale of traditional smart rings at that price, but I've heard stories of people using smart rings as wedding bands, and I'm curious if tech-savvy folks would want to pay a premium for better materials, while still getting normal sleep tracking.</p><p>The big question, in my mind, will be longevity. Ultrahuman says in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/ring/faq/">FAQ page</a> that "a gradual reduction in battery life can be expected after 1 to 2 years" for any smart ring. So what happens when your expensive Ultrahuman Rare starts requiring frequent charges to keep working? I doubt Ultrahuman can dissemble its luxury rings to replace the battery and send it back, though I'd love to be surprised.</p><p>Whatever happens with the Ultrahuman Rare Desert Collection, I'm sure we'll see more partnerships like this in the future, across brands. Imagine if you could find a premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> in a Macy's, or an Oura Ring Luxe with a limited-edition run partnered with Tiffany & Co.</p><p>No doubt there'll be a market for luxury smart rings, with people paying extra for style without as much focus on exclusive smarts. And the same could easily apply to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>, with more premium styles paired with speakers, cameras, and AI.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google TV is about to get a major upgrade with the addition of the advanced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a>, making it way easier to talk to your TV and get the information you need when you need it.</p><p>At CES 2025, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/google-tv-ces-2025/" target="_blank">announced</a> that big changes are coming to how we interact with TVs later this year. The search giant revealed plans to bring its advanced Gemini AI to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a>. As Mishaal Rahman wrote on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-tv-getting-gemini/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>, this upgrade will let users give voice commands naturally, without needing to say the usual "Hey Google."</p><p>The new features go beyond just content search. You'll also be able to ask general questions, and Google TV will pull up answers, even from YouTube.</p><p>Furthermore, it’ll work seamlessly with your smart home devices, so you can check your video doorbell or adjust the lights, among others.</p><p>While this upgrade might make the old Google Assistant features feel outdated, it brings in a much smarter voice assistant. This new version will understand your requests better and provide a much more helpful experience.</p><p>One of Gemini’s standout features, according to Google, is its ability to understand and respond to human language in a super natural way.</p><p>Unlike the older Google Assistant, which requires exact phrasing and struggles with complex queries, Gemini shines by allowing smooth, natural conversations. It’s much better at understanding and responding to more detailed questions.</p><p>By the end of 2025, next-gen Google TV devices are set to blend smart software with innovative hardware to create a truly aware, ambient environment.</p><p>A big part of this will be proximity sensors in the new TVs. These sensors will let the TV automatically start a photo slideshow when you walk into the room and switch to a personalized dashboard when you get closer, for example.</p><p>Google has been all about getting Gemini into everything since launching the AI in 2023. It’s already on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, laptops, and tablets, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-gemini-ai-is-swooping-into-gmail-on-the-web-to-supercharge-your-email">works smoothly with apps like Calendar and Gmail</a>. Next year, the company is focusing on expanding Gemini even more, pushing it across all their products and making it even better.</p>

These laptops take a big leap forward with Intel Core Ultra (Lunar Lake) processors featuring built-in NPUs, leaving their Lunar Lake-powered predecessors in the dust.</p><p>The Galaxy Book 5 Pro and Book 5 360 may feel like a natural next step for Samsung, but they still pack a punch. With Intel’s latest Core Ultra Series 2 processors (up to 8 cores and 8 threads), Intel Arc 140V graphics, and an NPU hitting up to 47 TOPS, these laptops are ready to handle advanced features like Copilot+ without breaking a sweat.</p><p>Both sizes come with a 2.8K Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, offering a 120Hz refresh rate. The Pro models also kick it up a notch with "Vision Booster" tech, automatically tweaking contrast and colors for easy viewing, even in bright outdoor light.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy Book 5 360 stands out with a 15-inch Full HD AMOLED display in a 16:9 aspect ratio. It keeps the rich AMOLED colors but limits the refresh rate to 60Hz.</p><p>Both Galaxy Book models come with a bunch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features. There's AI Select, similar to Circle to Search on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a>. Plus, Samsung highlights Photo Remaster, an AI tool that restores and enhances even the most worn-out images.</p>

<p>Beyond AI, these laptops shine with smooth cross-device connectivity within the Samsung ecosystem. Thanks to the Microsoft Phone Link app, users can access more Galaxy AI features on their PCs, like Live Translate and Transcript Assist.</p><p>These laptops also make multitasking a breeze, letting you easily switch between menus and transfer content smoothly across your Samsung devices—smartphones, tablets, TVs, and Smart monitors.</p><p>With One UI 7, your Galaxy phone or tablet lets you control your PC settings in one spot using the Nearby devices feature. Plus, you can quickly access files from other Samsung devices without the hassle of downloading them one by one.</p><p>The Galaxy Book 5 Pro and Book 5 360 will first launch in select markets like Canada, France, Germany, the UK, and the U.S. starting in February, with plans for a wider release down the road.</p><p>Samsung hasn't revealed the exact prices yet, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsungs-new-galaxy-book-5-pro-brings-together-ai-smarts-and-premium-hardware">since the Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360 is priced at $1,700</a>, we can expect these new models to come in at a more budget-friendly price.</p>

<ul><li>Amazfit announced the Active 2 Round fitness watch at CES 2025, starting at $99 (or $129 for the premium version).</li><li>The Active 2 has a new rounded design, superior brightness, and new sensors compared to the original squircle Active.</li><li>Key features include 160 sports modes, offline maps, Zepp Coach AI, a daily readiness score, and NFC payments (Europe only).</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Amazfit Active 2 smartwatch is the brand's latest budget option for fitness watch fans who find the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-balance-review">Amazfit Balance</a> a bit too expensive. Announced at CES 2025, the Active 2 has a traditional rounded display, eschewing the 2023 Amazfit Active's squircle look and the Active Edge's rugged design.</p><p>Among several key upgrades over the original Active, the Active 2 has a 1.32-inch, 2,000-nit display, matching the brightness of leading <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> at triple the price and actually beating most for resolution density with 353 pixels per inch.</p><p>The new HR sensor has five photodiodes and two LEDs, which is short of the Balance's eight PDs but matches the recent T-Rex 3 and is well above the last generation for accuracy. The Active 2 also adds a gyroscope, an altimeter for elevation data, and an ambient light sensor for adaptive brightness.</p><p>These new sensors enable "nearly 40 new sports modes" that rely on elevation data (i.e., stair climbing, skiing) and the gyro's more accurate movement data (i.e., 25 auto-detected strength exercises, golf swing tracking).</p>

<p>Amazfit says the Active 2 will last up to 10 days, though this is only with "typical use," not what the brand calls "heavy use." Among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch">best Amazfit watches</a>, most are rated to last two weeks per charge, so the Active 2 may be a little more short-lived. Still, it's well above a traditional smartwatch for longevity.</p><p>The Active 2 will ship in two versions, with the "premium" model adding a "black genuine leather strap and a resilient sapphire glass screen covering," plus a spare silicone band in the box, for $129. This version will also be the only one to support NFC payments, though Amazfit says this will only be available in Europe. The standard version will only have 2.5D tempered glass.</p><p>Like the original Amazfit Active, the Active 2 has a mic and speaker for Bluetooth calling or speaking to the Zepp Flow AI. Similarly, it has five GNSSs for location tracking but only offers standard GPS, not the dual-band GPS you get on pricier models.</p><p>If the best possible accuracy matters, you may want to upgrade. At the very least, you'll be able to download offline maps and route files with turn-by-turn navigation, something the original Active didn't offer.</p><p>You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.amazfit.com/products/active-2-round">preorder the Amazfit Active 2</a> today, with shipping beginning on January 13 in the United States or in February worldwide. It's a good time for budget fitness watch fans in the States, with Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-fit-3-tracker-finally-comes-to-us">releasing the Galaxy Fit 3</a> here after a year-long wait.</p>

You can even get up to $1,250 off the phones when you process a trade-in alongside your preorder. We don&apos;t know much else about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">preordering the Galaxy S25</a> just yet, but this seems like a pretty great start. </p>

<p>The next Galaxy is coming, and Samsung is marking the occasion by giving out $50 credits to everyone who signs up for the Galaxy Reserve program before January 22nd. All you need is your name and email address, and there's no obligation to preorder if you change your mind later. You'll also be eligible for up to $1,250 of trade-in credit if you send Samsung your old phone. There's no such thing as free money, but this comes pretty darn close. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="45098d52-8749-477b-b7c6-af4c3e4611ec" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Reserve: sign up and get $50 credit, plus get entered to win $5,000 at Samsung" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Reserve: sign up and get $50 credit, plus get entered to win $5,000 at Samsung">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>We don&apos;t have a ton of <em>official</em> information just yet, but leaks and rumors over the past six months have suggested that the flagship series will include the base model Galaxy S25, the super-balanced Galaxy S25 Plus, and a newly-designed Galaxy S25 Ultra. There have also been rumors that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-slim-early-database-listing-appearance">Galaxy S25 "Slim" variant</a> will be revealed at some point.</p><p>All the phones in the lineup are expected to come packed with the laptop-quality <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen Elite</a> chipset, plus seven years of software support and Android 15 straight out of the box.

<hr>
<p>After months of anticipation, Samsung today announced the official date of this year's Galaxy Unpacked event, where it will reveal the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> and more. Galaxy Unpacked will be held Jan. 22, 2025 at 1 p.m. EST in San Jose, California. It'll be live-streamed on Samsung's website and YouTube so Galaxy fans can watch along from anywhere as the Galaxy S25 series is uncovered for the first time.</p><p>Aside from the next-generation of Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>, the company also confirmed new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features will be showcased at the upcoming Unpacked event.</p><p>"Get ready for AI that is more natural and intuitive," the official invitation teases. "The next evolution of Galaxy AI is coming and it’s going to change the way you interact with the world every day. The new Galaxy S series is about to set the bar once again for mobile AI experiences now and into the future."</p>

<p>While Samsung didn't reveal any details about the Galaxy S25 series, it did share how you can already save some money on Galaxy products and accessories. By reserving a Galaxy S25 now, you can get a $50 credit towards accessories and other Galaxy products when you pre-order. There's no commitment — you don't have to pay anything to reserve your $50 Samsung credit, and you'll only get it if you end up pre-ordering a Galaxy S25 device.</p><p>However, the $50 offer will expire after Jan. 22, so reserving your credit is a no-brainer if you're even slightly considering purchasing a new Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, or Galaxy S25 Ultra. Additionally, those who reserve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">can get up to $1,250 off the price of a new Galaxy phone</a> when you factor in boosted trade-in values and instant credits.</p><p>You can watch the Galaxy Unpacked event starting at 1 p.m. EST on Jan. 22 at Samsung's website or YouTube channel.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung confirms the first Galaxy phones with Qi2 support will launch in 2025.</li><li>Google is working with the Wireless Power Consortium to develop Qi v.2.2 with its own fast-charging technology.</li><li>The WPC is also introducing a "Qi2 Ready" branding that enables phones and accessories to deliver the Qi2 experience when paired together.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android fans have long waited for more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> to support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-will-stifle-innovation">Qi2</a>, the wireless charging specification based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-used-dockcases-new-magsafe-ssd-enclosure-with-my-pixel-9-pro-xl-and-it-was-great">MagSafe</a>. Now, the Wireless Power Consortium says that we can expect an "acceleration in Android devices with Qi2 built in during 2025," according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250106397777/en/Qi2’s-Wireless-Charging-Benefits-Spurring-Continued-Expansion">press release</a>. Two of the most impactful Android brands, Samsung and Google, are buying into the Qi2 spec, which adds 15W wireless charging speeds and magnetic alignment.</p><p>"The exceptional Qi2 growth story will continue in 2025," Samsung said in the press release. "You can expect to see Android devices supporting Qi2 from Samsung Galaxy devices in 2025."</p><p>This statement hints that the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> could be the first set of Galaxy phones to support Qi2 wireless charging and accessories. Previously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-qi2-wireless-charging-support-rumors">Qi2 support on the Galaxy S25 was rumored</a>, and didn't make the cut on the current Galaxy S24 series. Samsung isn't the only phone brand helping bring Qi2 to more Android phones — Google is doing the same, in its own way.</p><p>"Google is committed to the Qi2 wireless charging standard and increasing the penetration of Qi2 into Android handsets and other devices," the company said in the press release. "Google is helping to achieve this goal by playing a leading role in the development of the upcoming Qi v2.2 standard, which includes Google's contribution of its own high-power wireless charging technology to WPC."</p><p>Notably, Google didn't pledge that future Pixel devices would support Qi2. It merely said that it is committed to the standard and will help develop the next revision of Qi2, known as Qi v2.2. This is quite the reversal from August 2024, when Google told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9-no-qi2-charging-3468035/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> (paraphrased) that it saw no tangible benefits to adding Qi2 to the Pixel 9 series compared to Qi.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-does-not-require-magnets">Magnets are required for a phone to support Qi2</a>, which enables precise alignment and connection with Qi2 and MagSafe accessories. This seems to have been a sticking point for Android OEMs, and that's why the Wireless Power Consortium is now offering an alternative. "Qi2 Ready" phones will support Qi2 tech on the inside (like 15W wireless charging) and work with accessories that add magnetic connection on the outside. In approved combinations, the WPC says these Qi2 Ready devices and accessories will deliver the full Qi2 user experience.</p><p>To date, most of the 1.5 billion Qi2 devices in the wild are iPhones. However, if Samsung and Google's pledges are any indication, we could see the number of Qi2 Android phones grow in 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google seems to be working on its AI promises to integrate Gemini into everyday life as it slowly replaces Google Assistant on your phone altogether.</p><p>Now, it looks like Google is preparing to take it a step further. According to a recent APK teardown of the Google App's latest beta, <strong>version 16.0.5</strong>, it looks like the tech giant is bringing Gemini's capabilities to your wrist via Wear OS. This would help users to “easily talk back and forth to get more done with an assistant on your watch, reimagined with Google AI,” according to code discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/06/gemini-wear-os-prep/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>What this essentially means is that you wouldn't have to pull out your phone, and you could have a natural flow of conversation with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> through what we assume is Gemini (although it's unclear if this will include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>). Any time you need to look up restaurants nearby, check on the weather, or navigate through heavy traffic, users can simply say, "Hey, Google," and Gemini would respond.</p><p>However, it also remains unclear if the watch will give users visual feedback for their queries. But the strings on this beta update definitely give us hope that "easier" times are ahead.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen when users will get this Wear OS update — presumably through an update to the Google app sometime in the near future or via a major platform update. Android Central has contacted Google about the possibility of Gemini Live on Wear OS and will update this article once we have more information.</p><p>Meanwhile, other updates that you might see from the Google app beta on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> include (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-search/google-search-16-0-5-release/">per APKMirror</a>) using voice commands while navigating, even when there's no network on your device. It will also be easier to access privacy settings from the home screen by tapping your Google Account profile picture.</p>

<ul><li>Google Chrome's popular Link to Highlight feature might work with PDFs soon.</li><li>The latest findings reveal that this new feature might probably be in the works.</li><li>If it turns out to be live, users would be able to highlight some text from a PDF and create a shareable link.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is likely testing new ways to use its Text Fragment/ Link to Highlight feature on its Chrome browser, which allows users to highlight text even in PDFs.</p><p>The feature in the works was spotted by Leopeva64 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24335910/chromes-link-to-highlight-feature-could-work-for-pdfs-soon">The Verge</a>), which is believed to be in the testing phase, per the latest Chromium Gerrit's findings. For the uninitiated, the Text Fragment feature on Chrome allows users to select some text — like from an article from a website or any text in general from a page — and create a shareable link.</p><p>The recipient who gets the link, clicking on it, would open up the specific text in highlighted format, allowing readers to quickly glance at it.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google is working on making the “Text fragment” feature work in the PDF viewer, this feature allows you to highlight some text and then create a link that takes you directly to that highlighted text, currently this feature doesn't work in PDF files:https://t.co/XEAmgthE1e. pic.twitter.com/nAIY11zGYC<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1873463154652701109">December 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While the feature has been around for a while for websites, PDFs viewed in Chrome don't support it. The latest findings, however, indicate Chrome might have plans to introduce it sometime later.</p><p>This feature would allow users to Text Fragment prominent text from a PDF and create a shareable link that can be opened directly by the recipient on their Chrome browser. It can be a handy feature for users to glance at essential points from otherwise large PDF documents. We could know more about the feature on how smoothly it works whenever it goes live.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this is not the only feature currently in the works on Google Chrome. In December 2024, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-scam-detection-canary-flag">Leopeva64 shared</a> a new discovery from the Canary flag, which highlights Google working on an AI-powered scam detection feature on the browser. It will potentially use on-device LLM to further scan a website for scams or possible data theft from a particular page.</p><p>Also early last month, another generative AI feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-store-reviews-blurb-spotted">dubbed Store Reviews</a> was also tipped to be coming to Chrome browser. This feature would summarize reviews from traditional websites like TrustPilot, ScamAdvisor, and several others.</p><p>All in all, even while most of the features under test seem promising, we still have to wait to see how many will be implemented on the Chrome browser through future updates.</p>

<hr>
<p>TCL may not be a big name in the U.S., but that isn't stopping the company from launching new affordable phones, and the latest model comes with some rather intriguing tech.</p><p>The new TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER 5G is a phone exclusive to North America and is also the first time TCL is bringing its new NXTPAPER Key to the region after it launched with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl-is-bringing-its-innovative-nxtpaper-tech-to-more-phones-and-tablets">TCL NXTPAPER series</a> at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ifa">IFA 2024</a>. With the flip of a switch, the 120Hz 6.8-inch FHD+ display will change to a more comfortable mode that reduces harmful blue light.</p><p>The TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER 5G also features a Max Ink mode that emulates the look of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">E Ink device</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">BOOX Palma</a>, which should be ideal for reading. Basically, TCL wants you to have two devices in one.</p><p>Android Central Phones editor Nick Sutrich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/testing-three-eye-friendly-display-technologies">tested TCL's NXTPAPER technology</a> against other display tech, saying that viewing an LCD panel is "very pleasant thanks to the characteristic soft diffused light."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4511px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="3FLbzYwirpJmaBcbaeg4UA" name="TCL-NXTPAPER-60-XE-5G" alt="TCL NXTPAPER 60 XE 5G camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3FLbzYwirpJmaBcbaeg4UA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4511" height="2538" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TCL)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone features a 50MP primary camera on the back with a 32MP front-facing shooter. And while TCL didn't immediately divulge the chipset for the phone, the device features 8GB of RAM and 256GB of expandable storage, which should be enough for most people in this price range (about $199).</p><p>The phone will also feature new AI capabilities that TCL says "optimizes task management and efficiency, adapting seamlessly to user needs for a smoother and more responsive experience."</p><p>In addition to the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER 5G, the company is also bringing the budget-friendly TCL K32 to North America for under $100. Unfortunately, TCL isn't providing exact release dates for either device, but they will arrive in the U.S. later this year while launching in Canada in May.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WWobgGTTav7LPL2SoK5oGB" name="TCL-NXTPAPER-11-Plus-display" alt="TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWobgGTTav7LPL2SoK5oGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TCL)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, TCL is announcing the new NXTPAPER 11 Plus, a tablet with the company's latest NXTPAPER 4.0 technology. With it, the tablet should feature improved display clarity and color display accuracy while also benefitting from the NXPAPER Key so users can switch to their preferred display mode at a whim.</p><p>The tablet features an 11.5-inch 2.2K display with a 120Hz refresh rate. TCL says the 550 nit peak brightness should help with outdoor visibility, something that Sutrich noted the previous model struggled with.</p><p>Aside from the display, the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus will come with AI features like Text Assist, which can rewrite, summarize, and translate text. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> will also be available on the tablet, and users can draw circles with their fingers or the T-Pen to search content on their displays.</p><p>Pricing and availability were not immediately available for the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus, but we will keep an eye out on this device and the rest of TCL's 2025 lineup as the year progresses.</p>
