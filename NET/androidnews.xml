<ul><li>Google’s Gemini AI on Android is getting a stylish makeover with a floating panel that features a sleek glowing animation.</li><li>The new panel’s glow is eye-catching but doesn’t dominate your screen, and instead smartly integrates with your current app.</li><li>The update also introduces a new “Ask about this video” chip on YouTube, replacing the old prompt.</li></ul>

<p>Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> assistant is getting a sleek new look on Android, featuring a floating panel with a glowing animation.</p><p>The new interface on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> is rolling out now, featuring a glowing animation that lights up around the panel when Gemini is summoned, first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/17/gemini-glow-floating-overlay/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>The animation looks fantastic and doesn’t crowd your screen. It offers a smart overlay that knows what you’re doing in the background, letting Gemini work seamlessly with your current app instead of taking over your entire screen.</p><p>First shown at Google’s developer conference in May, this panel is designed to help you keep working smoothly while giving you useful information from the AI assistant.</p><p>If you want a more immersive experience, just tap the upper-right corner of the overlay to expand it to full screen. Plus, the panel works smoothly with Gemini’s image generation features, letting you drag and drop images right into Gmail or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a>.</p>

<p>The update also brings a new "Ask about this video" chip for YouTube videos, replacing the old "Ask about this screen" prompt. This upgrade lets users easily get summaries or ask questions about video content, making it super handy for educational videos and cutting down on note-taking and comprehension work.</p><p>In summary, the new Gemini features for Android are a big upgrade. The floating panel, in particular, is a smart addition that enhances the user experience, making it easy to use Gemini while on the go.</p><p>This update comes right after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">launch of Google’s Gemini Live</a>, which rolled out a more natural, chat-like interface for talking to the chatbot.</p><p>While the new Gemini overlay offers a smoother user experience, it doesn’t match the advanced conversational features of Gemini Live. The good news is, unlike Gemini Live—which needs a Gemini Advanced subscription—the overlay is available to all Gemini users.</p><p>Right now, these new features are available to just a few users. But Google plans to roll them out to a wider audience in the coming weeks.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out Pixel Camera version 9.5.118, which brings manual Astrophotography activation to users.</li><li>After updating, users can find the mode in Night Sight's duration slider without waiting for their device to produce it automatically.</li><li>The company also started rolling out "Zoom Enhance" to the Pixel 8 Pro last week alongside details of its availability on the Pixel 9 series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is starting to roll out a Pixel Camera update that gives users reliable control over a unique nighttime setting.</p><p>As Google News (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/google_nws/4208">Telegram</a>) spotted, the company is pushing a Pixel Camera update marked as version 9.5.118 for manual Astrophotography (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/enable-astrophotography-mode-manually-pixel-phone/">Android Police</a>). The feature has previously played off the Pixel&apos;s "Night Sight" camera mode, which is where Google has placed its manual control.</p><p>The post suggests that users should notice a pop-up in the Pixel Camera app when switching to Night Sight <em>after </em>updating. The company has included a new crescent moon icon to represent Astrophotography within Night Sight&apos;s duration slider. </p><p>Tapping the shutter button will produce a five-second timer and it&apos;s encouraged that users remain still to capture the best quality photo. However, the post adds that users can turn this timer off if they&apos;re already stable and want to take pictures without delay.</p><p>The publication states that capturing and processing Astrophotography mode content may take longer "depending on your Pixel&apos;s age." So, it&apos;s likely that the newly announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> has the quickest draw.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:729px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.30%;"><img id="han2ahzUEY7vFHd9rXJqyn" name="pixel-camera-manual-astrophotography-update.jpg" alt="Google is pushing an update for the Pixel Camera that brings manual Astrophotography control." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/han2ahzUEY7vFHd9rXJqyn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="729" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google News / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has started rolling this update out to Pixel devices, but it doesn&apos;t seem widespread yet. More devices should see it as the week progresses. For the daring, the publication states you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/camera/camera-9-5-118-660615940-21-release/pixel-camera-9-5-118-660615940-21-android-apk-download/">manually sideload the update</a> through APKMirror.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography mode</a> has been a good way for interested parties to capture low-light or night shots, though its preference for the "perfect scenario" could hitch you up. It&apos;s always been activated through Night Sight; however, users were previously required to keep their devices still. The mode was automatic, meaning users (ideally) needed a tripod to meet the feature&apos;s demands and let it activate.</p><p>Moreover, users can hop into the <strong>camera app > Go to Night Sight > Settings </strong>to tinker with those shutter timer settings. Google&apos;s advanced settings for the mode include resolution sizes, a time-lapse option, and if you&apos;d like to shoot in JPEG or RAW.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google started rolling out "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-zoom-enhance-pixel-8-pro-pixel-9-rollout">Zoom Enhance</a>" for the Pixel 8 Pro with details about the feature&apos;s release on the Pixel 9. The feature leverages its AI software to "intelligently" fill in those gaps and faults when zooming into a photo to keep its high quality. This was a feature Google teased in 2023 and it seems its longer-than-expected development holds a slight drawback.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-imagen-3-is-now-open-to-everyone-in-the-us">opened up its ImageFX tool</a> to the general public with revamped safeguards and restrictions. The AI image generation tool has been available in a limited capacity <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-imagen-2-vertex-ai-debut">for a while</a> and has had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-gemini-ai-image-generation-faults">its share of controversy</a>. Now everyone can see what all the fuss is about.</p><p>And you should. Especially if you&apos;ve never used this type of tool before.</p><p>AI is the buzzword of the year but there are real tools out there that are using it effectively. Trying to ignore it may be understandable, but sometimes it&apos;s worthwhile to face a thing head-on and see what it&apos;s really about.</p><p>There are plenty of AI tools that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-could-soon-let-users-create-ai-images-of-themselves">do the same thing</a>, and some of them might be better at it than Google&apos;s. It&apos;s not like this is anything new or groundbreaking. I&apos;m not suggesting you try it out because it&apos;s something different.</p>
<p>It is something <em>really</em> cool, though. How these things work is you tell it what type of image to create, submit your idea, and wait for a bit. 10-30 seconds later (Imagen 3 is pretty fast) it tosses out a sample image or two. This is how most of these tools work.</p><p>What makes Google&apos;s offering different is that you already have a login to use it and, as of now, there&apos;s no sort of waiting list or charges involved. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/image-fx">Visit Google&apos;s AI Test Kitchen website</a>, sign into the Google account you already have, and start telling ImageFX to make art. It works on both a computer and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">a phone</a> so it&apos;s easy to use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1246px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.31%;"><img id="3chHGczqNthZ2gjS78sejN" name="ImageFX.png" alt="Google ImageFX" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3chHGczqNthZ2gjS78sejN.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1246" height="602" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s fun. And if you&apos;ve never used this type of tool, it&apos;s pretty amazing. Google has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Imagen-Team-Google">set of rules</a> about what images can be created and if you get too wild you might get a message that denies your request. Even so, Google does warn you that "AI outputs may sometimes be offensive or inaccurate" because they can. AI is often easy to fool.</p>
<p>There&apos;s another good reason to check out a tool like ImageFX. In 2024, especially since it&apos;s an election year, you&apos;re going to be inundated with fake AI-generated images. You&apos;re also going to see false claims that images were generated by AI. It is the nature of the beast.</p><p>The best way to better understand what can and can&apos;t be done using AI is to play with it yourself. It&apos;s shockingly easy to create a potentially embarrassing or compromising image of anyone using AI tools and you&apos;ve seen at least one. You might not have known it was AI-generated.</p>
<p>Becoming familiar with AI image-generating tools is the best way to understand and try to discern if a "photo" is the real deal or a fake. Since not every company&apos;s offering has the types of restrictions Google does when it comes to acceptable use some of this stuff can cause harm.</p><p>While professionals and pro-level tools for AI imagery exist, tools like ImageFX make it easy for everyone to try their hand at it. And a lot of people are doing it. Spending some time having fun and becoming familiar with tools like this can help you sort the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<ul><li>A Google representative has shared some exciting details on what's coming to Chromecast with Google TV.</li><li>The streaming device's older 4K and HD models will eventually get Android 14, though some new features available on the Google TV Streamer might be absent.</li><li>While the timeline still needs to be determined, it is a major update from the current Android 12 version.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently stepped up its streaming game with the new Google TV Streamer, replacing Chromecast. But that doesn’t mean the company is ignoring updates for older Chromecast devices.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chromecast-with-google-tv-android-14-3472136/">Android Authority</a>, the Chromecast with Google TV will receive the Android 14 update, even though it’s been discontinued. The publication received this affirmation from a Google product manager at the Made by Google event last week, where the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> models, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, and the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a> were also showcased.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="YqvofrXuNURUshdjSfRpX4" name="hazel-remote-google-tv-streamer-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Hazel Google TV Streamer remote lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YqvofrXuNURUshdjSfRpX4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The latest development comes after the recent launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">Google TV Streamer</a>, which runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, making it the first TV device to do so. However, it&apos;s important to note that older Chromecast models won’t get all the new software features available on the TV Streamer.</p><p>According to the publication, one feature of the Google TV Streamer that won’t be available on older Chromecast devices, even with the Android 14 update, is the ability to connect to the Thread border router. This tech lets you quickly and securely link smart home devices like locks and motion sensors.</p>
<p>The Android 14 for TV upgrade marks the second major upgrade for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast-google-tv-review">Chromecast with Google TV (4K)</a> when it eventually rolls out as it shipped with Android 10 and later got Android 12. </p><p>On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">HD version</a> launched later and shipped with Android 12. Besides, the 4K model is set to get security updates until September 2025, while the HD model will receive updates until September 2027.</p><p>While Android Authority has learned that Chromecast with Google TV will indeed receive the Android 14 update, it’s still unclear when exactly it will arrive. Hopefully, it’ll be sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><em><strong>Anonymous asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Can I use an Android phone without signing into a Google account? Does everything work?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Hey, there anon! That&apos;s a great question that I&apos;ve seen people ask from time to time because whenever you turn on a new (or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-refurbished-phones">new to you</a>) phone the first thing you&apos;ll see is a tech company asking you to sign in. Apple and Google do this, and if you bought a phone from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">a company like Samsung</a>, it too may ask you to create or log into an account.</p><p>The good news is that you don&apos;t have to do any of it. But you might want to anyway.</p>
<p>I like to give a concise answer at the beginning of an article for people who want quick info, so as mentioned above no you <strong>do not have to sign into a Google account to use an Android phone</strong>. Not everything is going to work as expected though, including some really important features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4031px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="PVU2GQWBiotMUnrPj3KbfS" name="google-find-my-device-app-on-oneplus-12r-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Find My Device app on a OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PVU2GQWBiotMUnrPj3KbfS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4031" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Any app or service from Google is, of course, not going to work properly without access to a Google account. Chrome, for example, will browse the web just fine but you won&apos;t have any syncing tools for access to saved bookmarks or across devices.</p><p>Other apps like Google Calendar or Google&apos;s Contacts app won&apos;t work at all because they depend on information sorted in the cloud under a Google account. The most important feature that isn&apos;t going to work correctly is the tool used to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">find a lost phone</a>. It requires you to sign into the same account as used on the phone to work to "prove" that you are the actual owner. Without access, you can&apos;t locate — or more importantly — lock and erase — a lost or stolen phone.</p>
<p>The same goes for things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-download-and-update-galaxy-apps-samsung-store">Samsung&apos;s apps</a>. You need a Samsung account to properly use them, just like you need a Microsoft or Apple account to use their services. </p><p>The good news is that the basics will work just fine. You can use the phone for calling and texting, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources">apps can be installed</a> and used as long as they don&apos;t need any of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-services">Google&apos;s underlying services</a>, and millions of people use phones like this every day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7" name="Google-Play-Store-home-page.jpg" alt="Google Play Store home page on Android and Chrome OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2293" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For most people, I wouldn&apos;t recommend it. I can understand if you&apos;re not keen on sharing your personal life with a faceless giant tech company, but I suggest you read <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Google&apos;s terms of service</a> and understand the privacy and data deletion tools at your disposal before you make any decisions.</p><p>Besides, it&apos;s easy to make a "fake" Google account and manage it in a way that most of the data isn&apos;t really about you.</p>

I was hoping that the tablet would answer one of Google’s biggest issues: a cohesive and unified smart home strategy. </p>

<p>Many people had high hopes for the tablet being the device that integrated all of Google’s smart home products into one cohesive and versatile unit. However, the device functions more or less like a regular tablet with a dock and some smart home features tacked on. To top it off, the experience doesn’t lead it to be the Nest Hub replacement many had hoped for. </p><p>So when Google didn’t announce a new tablet iteration <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/made-by-google-event-2024-live-blog-pixel-9-pro-fold-watch-3-gemini-and-everything-else-we-expect-to-see">during its Pixel event</a>, I wondered if it was either because the company was taking its time by trying to combine its smart home strategy with its new Gemini efforts or if the tablet was maybe just a one-off effort.</p>
<h2 id="focusing-on-gemini-and-flagship-phones-xa0-2">Focusing on Gemini and flagship phones </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8bCUGcKHwkrXYYYUozT6G4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-gemini-live-01.jpg" alt="Talking to Gemini Live on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8bCUGcKHwkrXYYYUozT6G4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s evident that Google wanted to focus on its Android software and the integration of Gemini with its latest lineup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on" target="_blank">Pixel 9 devices</a>. Before even announcing its devices, Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of platforms & devices at Google, began his presentation by explaining how the company has integrated Gemini into its operating system. </p><p>Osterloh announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">Gemini Live will let users engage</a> in a “mobile conversational experience” to discuss “whatever’s on your mind.” The company also detailed how users can now overlay Gemini’s UI on top of any app and that this new feature will work for videos on YouTube, which lets users ask questions about what they’re watching. </p><p>It’s obvious that Google cares a lot more about its software than its hardware. In fact, I’d argue that Google’s hardware has been chiefly designed and created as a base point for its hardware and for other Android-based companies to model off of.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="o8Fi9zLSCe2rep8yKdQKuN" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-9-side-by-side-1.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8Fi9zLSCe2rep8yKdQKuN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And here’s why I think the company didn’t launch a Pixel Tablet 2: Right now, it doesn’t really care about a large-screen tablet and wants to focus on perfecting its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> strategy. By solidifying this, it will then be able to reinvent its smart home strategy around the experience, which should be integrated with Gemini, something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-to-become-smarter-with-gemini-help">we’ve already started seeing with Google Home</a>.</p><p>Gerrit Schneemann, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, added that launching Gemini Live and integrating it with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">new Nest Thermostat</a> was key and, in my opinion, likely the first thing the company needed to do to kick off this strategy. However, he adds that instead of a mobile hub, perhaps having a dedicated smart home device to combine all of Google’s smart home devices is necessary; an app could be enough. </p><p>“Especially with Gemini Live, voice becomes an even more prominent part of the user experience. And again, having a duplicate mobile screen in the home along with smartphones, doesn’t seem to add much to the value proposition,” he said. “A tablet that moves around maybe amongst users as well could easily not be where it is needed most (kitchen, side table, etc.) because someone removed it.”</p>
<h2 id="do-we-even-need-a-pixel-tablet-xa0-2">Do we even need a Pixel Tablet? </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bi7MhZGQa4eW7r5ZWBEvcF" name="google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max.jpg" alt="Nest Hub Max next to Pixel Tablet on countertop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bi7MhZGQa4eW7r5ZWBEvcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Schneemann makes a very valid point: Why would someone want to keep moving their main hub around? And the more I think about it, the more I ask myself: Does Google even need a tablet to double as a dedicated point of service for all of your smart home devices?</p><p>At the time of writing this article, all of my smart home devices are on Google. We have a thermostat, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/nest-wifi-pro-review-honestly-its-a-bit-disappointing">Nest Wi-Fi</a> system, doorbell, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-assistant-speakers">speakers</a>. Everyone in my household uses the dedicated Google Home app to control everything. </p><p>For some reason, when I got the Pixel Tablet last year, I pictured myself using it similarly to how I used the Nest Hub Max, but in almost a more futuristic way. At the end of the night, I pictured myself taking the tablet to the bedroom, shutting things down, fixing the temperature of the home, and settling into bed. That was far from the case. </p><p>Instead, the tablet replaced our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-max-review">Nest Hub Max</a> and was barely touched. I used it as a speaker occasionally while I cooked. However, I didn’t think the connection to the tablet was that great, and every time I tried to set a timer, it never worked. It came to a point where I was considering switching back to the Hub Max.</p><p>In his comparison piece, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max-kitchen-test">Tshaka Armstrong also points out</a> similar limitations to the Pixel Tablet’s Hub mode that seemingly fall short of the five-year-old Nest Hub Max. He also notes that his family isn’t big on tablets and that the Pixel Tablet will often be used to watch the occasional show in bed, although even this comes secondary to just using an actual TV. </p><p>However, that’s not to say there aren’t some who find the Pixel Tablet genuinely helpful. As noted by Armstrong, “the [Nest Hub] Max is going to be a stationary device, while you’re going to get so much more flexibility, and ultimately usability, out of the Pixel Tablet,” even if it takes time for Google to improve the experience.</p>
<h2 id="xa0-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-the-new-tablet-xa0-2"> The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the new Tablet </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="nUKPM7ujJtYLrUqaRYPByE" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-gemini-window.jpg" alt="Gemini window prompt on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nUKPM7ujJtYLrUqaRYPByE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I would argue this further by adding that perhaps Google may not even continue launching tablets because it has designed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> device to act more like the tablet you need. </p><p>Schneemann notes that with the larger 8-inch internal display, the company is basically reaching tablet size. </p><p>“Of course, this is a super-premium device with limited global availability. It’s even less likely to be a dedicated [smart home] device. But it shows that Google is thinking about the larger screen form factor — just hasn’t found the right positioning for its tablets after years of underdevelopment in the platform.” </p><p>There&apos;s also another side of that argument: is there even a market for tablets right now? </p><p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC&apos;s Worldwide Device Trackers, says that the current model of the Tablet isn’t a bestseller and “demand for traditional tablets ahs been wanning for some time.”</p><p>“While it would be great to align the launch of a new tablet with their other devices, tablets are often one of the least used compute devices for consumers and their refresh cycle has been growing, making them a lower priority for both consumers and device makers.”</p>
<h2 id="it-x2019-s-time-for-a-nest-revamp-xa0-2">It’s time for a Nest revamp </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fsxSwZiBnHnu9SoXgsVkMb" name="google-nest-learning-thermostat-gen-4-06.jpg" alt="The shiny Google Nest Learning Thermostat (Gen 4)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fsxSwZiBnHnu9SoXgsVkMb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, while a tablet may not be exactly necessary, I still think Google needs to develop a much more unified smart home strategy, and we definitely need new Nest hardware.</p><p>Of course, I asked our senior editor and resident tablet expert—as well as smart home aficionado—Andrew Myrick, his thoughts. He told me that it was odd to see Google announce an unprecedented number of devices within a two-week span and even more confusing that it’s been years since the Nest Hub has been refreshed. </p><p>He thinks this either means that we are in store for an overhauled Nest lineup sometime in the near future and that the company is “likely using the Pixel Tablet and dock design as the centerpiece.”</p><p>“Or Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/you-should-buy-google-pixel-tablet">abandoning the Tablet again</a>, and we’ll only see remedial improvements to its smart home speakers,” he said. However, like my own assumption, Myrick also believes that none of this will happen until Google has further advanced Gemini. </p><p>I love Google’s smart home devices. They’ve never failed me and have brought a lot of seamless integration into my home. However, I would love a better strategy here, one that is a bit more elevated, includes more of Gemini, and maybe has a single point-of-service hardware device akin to the Nest Hub Max, but with the kind of upgrades we’d expect in 2024.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Ring is a great starting point for Samsung, and the smart ring is available in a variety of sizes and colors. It is light and comfortable to use, and you barely even notice it. The battery life is better than the Ring Air, and you don't need a subscription to access all the features. That said, fitness and sleep monitoring are nowhere as good as the most basic smartwatches, the Ring is missing a boatload of features that are standard on its rivals, and the worst part is that gestures and select insights are limited to Galaxy phones.</p></p>

<p>I used the Ring Air throughout 2024, and it has been terrific. The smart ring is so unobtrusive that I don't notice it most of the time, and it has titanium bands. The app has a ton of useful metrics, and it does automatic workout detection and a whole slate of cool extras. That said, fitness monitoring has been inconsistent in my usage, but that has gotten better with subsequent updates. I didn't think I would like the Ring Air as much as I do, and if you're mulling a smart ring, it gets my recommendation.</p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZtjXAXwFn6goRn2b9MmGXj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-10.jpg" alt="Using gestures with the gold Samsung Galaxy Ring on my index finger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZtjXAXwFn6goRn2b9MmGXj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s only so much you can do with the design of a smart ring, and as a result both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman&apos;s Ring Air</a> end up looking largely identical. The Galaxy Ring is made out of titanium and is available in a multitude of colors, and it is light enough that you don&apos;t notice it. While Samsung says it uses a scratch-resistant coating, that hasn&apos;t been the case on my colleague Nick Sutrich&apos;s unit, which picked up visible scratches in just a week of use.</p><p>The Ring Air is also made out of titanium, and it has matte and glossy colors that contrast the design well. it is a smidgen lighter than the Galaxy Ring, and it is extremely comfortable in daily use; I barely even notice that I&apos;m wearing a smart ring these days. It has its share of scratches as well, so I&apos;d recommend getting a lighter color.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="s2JMLAg9gfcFFFs72AYoqY" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-held-in-fingertips.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air held in fingertips to show the Ultrahuman logo engraved inside." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s2JMLAg9gfcFFFs72AYoqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both rings have a similar set of sensors, and they&apos;re recommended to be used on your index or middle fingers. Samsung and Ultrahuman send out sizing kits so you can accurately determine your ring size, and as both brands use custom sizing, it&apos;s recommend you try out the designs in the sizing kit to gauge the fit.</p><p>Both smart rings have ridges on the underside where the sensors come into contact with your finger, and while I thought it would be uncomfortable, that hasn&apos;t been the case at all. The only difference to a regular ring is that smart rings are noticeably bigger, but they&apos;re lighter than they look, and at least with the Ring Air, there wasn&apos;t any issue with the design or fit.</p>

<p>Smart rings offer a significantly easier way to monitor fitness and health data, and while they don&apos;t have an extensive feature-set like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a>, they&apos;re great at the basics. Both rings measure 24/7 heart rate, heart rate variability, and skin temperature, and they monitor stress levels throughout the day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="J639EEm5a9rtBGZunsB9uf" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-on-pointing-finger.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air worn on an index finger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J639EEm5a9rtBGZunsB9uf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to activity monitoring, the Ring Air has been inconsistent in my usage, and the data isn&apos;t as reliable as a regular smartwatch. That said, subsequent updates have made a difference, and the key point is that it does a better job than the Galaxy Ring.</p>
<p>The Ring Air didn&apos;t have automatic workout detection, and it was a point of contention when I started using the smart ring earlier in the year. Thankfully, Ultrahuman added the feature via a software update, and while it is buggy at times, it is a great new addition. So even if you don&apos;t manually start an activity before working out, it will start tracking your activity levels and vitals, and give you a notification within the app to log the activity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ibuzM2msdM3tr56zQPNZfj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-find-my-ring-lights.jpg" alt="The gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ibuzM2msdM3tr56zQPNZfj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Ring also has this feature, but it only does so with two activities: running and walking. That limits its ability to measure workouts on its own, and the Ring Air has the edge in this regard. Another area where the smart ring outshines Samsung is sleep monitoring; I got useful metrics out of the Ring Air, but the Galaxy Ring still has a long way to do in this area — it just doesn&apos;t provide reliable details.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-ring-vs-ultrahuman-ring-air-battery-and-connectivity-2">Samsung Galaxy Ring vs. Ultrahuman Ring Air: Battery and connectivity</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3sGWcko3E7aG2PnDTK5TxW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-battery-life-01.jpg" alt="The gold Samsung Galaxy Ring alongside the Samsung Wearables app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3sGWcko3E7aG2PnDTK5TxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both smart rings connect via Bluetooth, and they have decent battery life. I got four days of usage out of the Ring Air between charges, and while that&apos;s good enough in its own right, the Galaxy Ring does better. Samsung&apos;s smart ring manages to last a day longer than the Ring Air, so that should give you at least five days of usage. Samsung&apos;s charging dock looks pretty cool too, and although the Galaxy Ring has a smaller battery, it has better longevity.</p><p>Where the Ring Air has a distinct advantage is connectivity; it doesn&apos;t lock any features to a platform, and you get the same feature-set on all Android phones and iPhones. You don&apos;t need to pay any monthly fees to use all the features, although Ultrahuman is rolling out custom additions that cost extra — they&apos;re not necessary if you just want a smart ring to monitor activity and health data.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="GANrGVbUgtMvUjSiHHfDtk" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-08.jpg" alt="The gold Samsung Galaxy Ring in a puddle of water" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GANrGVbUgtMvUjSiHHfDtk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Annoyingly, Samsung restricts the usability of the Galaxy Ring in several ways; find my device is exclusive to Galaxy phones, so if you use another Android device, you can&apos;t use the feature to locate your Galaxy Ring. There&apos;s no way to use the smart ring with an iPhone — unlike the Ring Air — and the most egregious feature limitation is gestures; the Galaxy Ring has a few gestures to control your phone, but you need a Samsung phone.</p>

<p>If you have a Samsung phone and want a smart ring to go with the device, the Galaxy Ring should be a decent choice. It isn&apos;t available in all regions just yet, and it costs more than its rivals, and it just doesn&apos;t have the same robust feature-set as the Ring Air. That&apos;s obviously going to change over the coming months as Samsung adds features to the smart ring, but if you need something that&apos;s fleshed-out now, the Galaxy Ring isn&apos;t it.</p><p>The Ring Air is a much better alternative. It has better automatic workout detection, has usable metrics that work on all platforms, and does a good job with sleep monitoring. It also costs less, and although the battery doesn&apos;t last as long as the Galaxy Ring, I consistently got four days of use between charges, and that&apos;s decent enough. If I had to recommend a smart ring, it&apos;d have to be the Ring Air.</p>

<p>Apple’s AirDrop is hard to beat for file sharing, but Microsoft is closing in with a new feature designed to make transferring files between PCs and Android devices a breeze.</p><p>Microsoft has launched a new feature in Windows 10 and 11 that mimics Apple’s AirDrop for Android, first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/this-new-feature-is-basically-airdrop-but-for-windows-pcs-and-android" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>. It’s built into the Phone Link app, so you can easily share files between your PC and phone. Just update Phone Link and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-your-phone-android-what-it-and-how-does-it-work">Link to Windows</a> app, and you’ll be set to swap files effortlessly.</p><p>The new file-sharing feature boosts the Phone Link and Link to Windows apps, which already handle calls, screen mirroring, and syncing notifications and messages. Microsoft details this new addition in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/seamlessly-transfer-content-between-your-devices-8a0ead3c-2f15-1338-66ca-70cf4ae81fcb" target="_blank">support document</a>.</p><p>Before this update, Phone Link mainly handled notification mirroring, app use, and call management.</p><p>To share files from a Windows PC to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, just pick Phone Link as the destination in File Explorer. For the reverse, use the regular Android sharing menu and select Link to Windows as the sharing method.</p><p>Whatever direction the file is moving, the receiving device will get a heads-up with a notification about the incoming transfer.</p><p>For smooth file sharing between your Windows PC and Android device, make sure your PC has the Phone Link app version 1.24032.156.0 or later and your phone has the Link to Windows app version 1.24032.518.0 or higher.</p><p>To send a file from Windows, open File Explorer, right-click the file, and choose Share from the menu. In the Share window, pick Phone Link as the vehicle.</p><p>On the flip side, to share a file from your Android device, tap on any file and hit the Share icon. Choose Link to Windows from the sharing options, then select your PC’s name.</p><p>While Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-airdrop-rival-nearby-share-finally-starts-rolling-out-today">Nearby Share</a> already lets you transfer files between Windows and Android devices, Microsoft’s new feature promises to make the process even smoother and more efficient.</p><p>As per Windows Central, this AirDrop-like feature is currently only available to those in the Windows Insider Program’s Release Preview Channel, which tests near-final updates. But it&apos;s a safe bet that a wider release for everyone is on the way.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Underwhelming</strong></em></p>
<p>I'll be upfront in my dislike of the Galaxy Z Fold 6; Samsung just didn't enough to differentiate the device against its predecessor, or even the Z Fold 4. It has the same basic design, the battery life hasn't received any meaningful attention, it charges at 25W, and the cameras are the same as last year. There is IP48 ingress protection, a lighter chassis, and the phone will get seven Android OS updates, but given what it costs, I'm not convinced you should actually buy the Z Fold 6 — if you're interested in a foldable and won't consider another brand, you should just get the Z Fold 5 instead.</p></p>

<p>The Open launched nearly a year ago, but unlike Samsung, OnePlus didn't see the need to roll out a new model just for the sake of it. The phone still has a lot to offer; the design is one of the best in this segment, the hinge has a better articulation, and the crease isn't as noticeable as the Z Fold 6. You also get a cover screen that's better to use, bigger battery that lasts longer, better cameras at the back, 67W charging, and a slate of custom software features that make multitasking a breeze. The foldable has its own set of issues; the foldable only has IPX4 water resistance, and it will receive just three Android updates. But as an overall device, the Open has the definite edge over the Z Fold 6.</p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LTzjwGG5PGftdiscbRafVh" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-vs-oneplus-open-4.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. OnePlus Open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LTzjwGG5PGftdiscbRafVh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has proven that it doesn&apos;t like changing the designs of its flagships, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> looks nearly identical to its predecessor. Samsung increased the width of the cover panel to make it less annoying to use, but it still ends up being too narrow.</p><p>Outside of that tweak, the Z Fold 6 doesn&apos;t have any meaningful design changes. Samsung was able to bring down the weight by 14g, and coming in at 239g, the foldable is easier to hold and use. That said, the hinge isn&apos;t as smooth as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables</a>, and the crease is still immediately noticeable. There are areas that Samsung needed to address, but it decided to not bother.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hZwTA5cfMLgqciRjF7wEjR" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-16.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and OnePlus Open crease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hZwTA5cfMLgqciRjF7wEjR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">Open</a>, OnePlus managed to deliver one of the best-looking designs in this segment, and the leather back looks elegant next to the oversized camera housing. The foldable has ideal dimensions, and the cover panel is much better to use — most of the time, I don&apos;t feel the need to unfold the device at all.</p>
<p>While I like the design of the Open a lot better, the foldable misses out on water resistance; with just an IPX4 rating, it can only withstand splashes of water. The Z Fold 6, meanwhile, has IP48 dust and water resistance, and it can be easily submerged in up to a meter of water without any issues.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="KiGYuph4f4JDjUtXAqvJVN" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-17.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and OnePlus Open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KiGYuph4f4JDjUtXAqvJVN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the Open takes the lead is the displays; the 6.31-inch OLED cover screen has exquisite colors and gets bright enough in outdoor use, and the sizing is just right. The 7.82-inch inner AMOLED panel is noticeably larger than what Samsung is offering, and it also has standout colors. Both panels get 120Hz dynamic refresh, and get a smidgen brighter than the Z Fold 6 in HDR content.</p><p>Samsung has a 6.3-inch cover panel and 7.6-inch inner screen, and both have 120Hz dynamic refresh and good visibility outdoors. My main issue is that the cover panel is still too limiting to use, and that inhibits the device&apos;s potential.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-vs-oneplus-open-hardware-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. OnePlus Open: Hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AQxSSYtjCKrE74bFidfA8U" name="oneplus-open-2024-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AQxSSYtjCKrE74bFidfA8U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, while the Open comes with last year&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. Having used dozens of devices powered by both chipsets, the only difference that&apos;s noticeable in daily use is efficiency; the 8 Gen 3 is able to deliver equivalent levels of performance as the 8 Gen 2 while consuming less power.</p><p>That said, that&apos;s nullified in this scenario as the Open has a larger battery. The 4805mAh battery on the foldable easily lasts a day, and even with heavy use, I wasn&apos;t anxious about the battery running out. The Z Fold 6 also manages to last a day consistently, but if you push the device too much, you will need to plug it in before the day&apos;s out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kcpfK8EvvjWbLbwPqfyKgY" name="oneplus-open-2024-19.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kcpfK8EvvjWbLbwPqfyKgY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, Samsung is still sticking to 25W charging tech, and that just isn&apos;t enough in 2024. In a similar vein, you don&apos;t get a charger in the box. The Open doesn&apos;t have these shortcomings; it charges at 67W, and the battery takes 44 minutes to fully charge. And unlike Samsung, OnePlus bundles a 67W charger in the box.</p><p>Just like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 comes with 256GB of storage on the base model, and you&apos;ll need to shell out an additional $120 to get the 512GB model. The Open has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage on the base version, and there&apos;s a new 2024 edition of the device that has 1TB of storage.</p><p>Both phones are fluid in daily use, and they hold up just as well in demanding games. They tend to throttle earlier than regular flagships, but you don&apos;t notice any visible jitter, and there isn&apos;t much in the way of overheating.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="A3iePL45GuS8bkhXuYCiNU" name="oneplus-open-2024-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A3iePL45GuS8bkhXuYCiNU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching over to the cameras, Samsung hasn&apos;t made any changes to the hardware, and as such the Z Fold 6 has the same sensors as last year: a 50MP main camera, 10MP 3x zoom lens, and 12MP wide-angle lens. Samsung is instead turning to tweaks in its camera algorithms to deliver better photos, and the foldable manages to do a marginally better job than its predecessor in this regard.</p>

<p>That said, it still doesn&apos;t measure up to what the Open is offering. The foldable has a 48MP main camera, 64MP 3x zoom lens, and another 48MP wide-angle lens, and outside of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it takes the best photos and videos in this category.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XKDTTyRwiSSteTZzDkjoq6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-6.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 in Flex Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XKDTTyRwiSSteTZzDkjoq6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has a distinct edge on the software, and that&apos;s purely because it offers seven Android OS updates to the Z Fold 6. By contrast, the Open will pick up just three OS updates, and that isn&apos;t anywhere close to being enough. I&apos;d say that OnePlus needs to change its stance, but the Chinese manufacturer made it abundantly clear that long-term updates just isn&apos;t something it is interested in offering.</p><p>And when it comes to the software itself, the Z Fold 6 runs One UI 6.1.1 based on Android 14 out of the box, and just like the Galaxy S24 devices, it comes with Galaxy AI, a suite of utilities that rely on AI to streamline daily tasks. My issue with Galaxy AI is that it is predominantly limited to Samsung&apos;s own apps; I don&apos;t use Samsung Internet or Samsung Keyboard, and outside of the image-editing features, I don&apos;t get much utility out of Galaxy AI.</p><p>The Open also has AI-assisted utilities, but they&apos;re not as extensive as what Samsung is offering — that&apos;s a good thing. The image editing feature is similar to Google&apos;s offering on the Pixels, and audio transcribing gets a decent amount of usage. What I actually like is the multitasking-focused software features; the Open makes it effortlessly easy to pull up windows side-by-side to maximize real estate, and it gets a lot right in this regard.</p>

<p>The biggest thing that changed with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is the price; the foldable costs $100 more than its predecessor, and I&apos;m not really sure why that is the case. Samsung isn&apos;t really offering any meaningful upgrades, and while the Z Fold 6 is lighter and has a marginally wider cover panel, there isn&apos;t a good enough reason to pick it up over last year&apos;s Z Fold 5.</p><p>The Open, on the other hand, is an easier recommendation. It has a better design, two screens that you&apos;ll actually end up using, better software features, and it lasts longer in daily use. You also get one of the best camera packages on a foldable, and there&apos;s 67W charging.</p><p>The best part is that the Open doesn&apos;t cost anywhere as much as the Z Fold 6; the 16GB/512GB edition costs $1,399 in the U.S., and the new 1TB model can be bought for as low as $1,599, and you get the terrific Keyboard 81 Pro bundled with the package. The Z Fold 6, meanwhile, costs an absurd $2,019, and it just isn&apos;t worth it.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>According to a research paper by Google, Imagen 3 is a top performer, creating high-quality images from text and beating other models in tests.</li><li>Imagen 3 has improved understanding of user prompts and includes safeguards against generating offensive or illegal content, unlike xAI’s more controversial Grok-2.</li><li>Feedback suggests Imagen 3 has stricter restrictions compared to previous models, likely as a response to issues with Google's earlier Gemini model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google just rolled out Imagen 3, its updated AI-powered image generator, but instead of its usual big reveal, the tech giant chose to slip the advanced model into everyone&apos;s hands in the U.S. without much fanfare.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07009" target="_blank">research paper</a> from Google, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-quietly-opens-imagen-3-access-to-all-u-s-users/" target="_blank">VentureBeat</a>, describes Imagen 3 as a latent diffusion model that excels at creating high-quality images from text prompts. The paper also claims that Imagen 3 outperformed other models in tests.</p><p>Google first introduced its advanced image generator at its I/O conference in May. But it wasn’t until later this month that the company made it widely available through its Vertex AI platform.</p><p>The tech giant claimed major improvements in how well Imagen 3 understands user prompts. Like other AI image generators, it can create detailed visuals from text descriptions but has limits on generating offensive or illegal content. To prevent misuse, the model won’t produce images of public figures or any weapon-related visuals.</p><p>This is in contrast to xAI’s Grok-2, which has fewer restrictions and has become a hotspot for controversial images on the web.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1eo3ge9/comment/lhgrw57/" target="_blank">User feedback</a> reveals that Imagen 3 comes with tighter restrictions compared to earlier versions, reflecting the larger challenges surrounding AI image generators. These tools have sparked ongoing debates, with new AI-generated content frequently grabbing attention, stirring controversy, or dividing opinions online.</p><p>Google seems to be taking a cautious approach with Imagen 3’s rollout. It’s still unclear if it&apos;ll keep this conservative stance as the model evolves.</p><p>Google’s cautious approach with Imagen 3 might be a reaction to the backlash against its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> model earlier this year. After Gemini produced historically inaccurate images that distorted racial representation, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-ai-image-generation-disabled">paused its image generation to fix the problems</a>.</p><p>The Mountain View-based company also mentioned that Imagen 3 will come in different versions tailored for various uses, like quick sketching or high-resolution image creation.</p><p>Users can also tweak images by choosing specific areas and giving detailed instructions. To check it out, head to Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/image-fx" target="_blank">AI Test Kitchen website</a>, sign in with your Google account, and dive into the platform.</p>
