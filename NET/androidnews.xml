                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>For the past decade, Meta has been investing billions into figuring out what the next big thing is going to look like. Whether that&apos;s a VR headset, a pair of AR glasses, or an AI companion that you wear, Meta has been working on it, and Caitlin Kalinowski has almost certainly been at the center of it.</p><p>I had the privilege of chatting with Kalinowski—CK, as she likes to go by—who previously led product design and integration for the Oculus Rift, Oculus Go, and Oculus Quest headset lines. She has two decades of product design experience, including the original Unibody MacBook Pro team and every Oculus hardware product released since the original Touch controllers for the Oculus Rift.</p><p>But while those chops are impressive, someone like Kalinowski is always looking toward the horizon for the next big thing. Now, she is working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-wants-iphone-moment-when-meta-launches-ar-glasses">Project Nazare</a>, Meta&apos;s first pair of true AR glasses that is set to redefine how we think of smart glasses.</p><p>And while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> have been a huge hit, Kalinowski tells me that what her team has been working on goes above and beyond the expectations set by existing products. Yes, that even includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">new video calling and AI features</a> just launched on Ray-Ban Metas. They&apos;re so impressive, she told me that they provide the "same degree of &apos;oh my God, WOW! I can&apos;t believe this!&apos; that the original Rift was" for her.</p>

<p>Six years ago, Meta went all-in on the standalone concept as it launched the Oculus Quest. Since then, we&apos;ve seen two new generations of headsets, recently culminating in the launch of Meta Horizon OS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">Meta&apos;s own Android for VR</a>. Kalinowski told me that there was "a huge debate internally early on" whether to focus on tethered headsets like the Rift or to go fully standalone with the Quest concept.</p><p>But well after the dust from those conversations has settled, Meta&apos;s next big product is said to have the same degree of "Oh my God, wow! I can&apos;t believe this!" that the original Rift had.</p><p>In my experience, most people who try a modern VR headset are usually immediately impressed. It&apos;s one of those experiences that&apos;s hard to put into words until you&apos;ve tried it for yourself, as the virtual becomes <em>actual </em>reality to your eyes and mind.</p><p>Kalinowski told me that she thrives on "giving customers a new experience they haven&apos;t had before," something that Project Nazare should be able to deliver if what I&apos;m being told rings true to the final product.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Mxa23399ApcQFXJPCLHNjB" name="Meta-RayBan-Smart-Glasses-New-Options.jpg" alt="New colorways for Meta Ray-Ban." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mxa23399ApcQFXJPCLHNjB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Kalinowski says she thrives on "giving customers a new experience they haven't had before."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>"The next big technology that I&apos;m working on now is a full pair of AR glasses," she says. That means not just a pair of glasses that can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/rokid-ar-lite-rokid-max-2-announcement">mirror your smartphone</a> or something like Ray-Ban Metas that can take pictures or play music but one that completely augments the world you see by way of projected imagery.</p><p>Meta is working on a version of this for Quest 3 headsets this Fall — a feature appropriately called "Augments" — but it should pale in comparison to what a proper pair of AR glasses can deliver because of the quality degradation that comes with passthrough vision on a VR headset.</p><p>Kalinowski explained that "customers are going to be able to see both the original photons of the real world in addition to what overlay you effectively want to have." In plain terms, that means your view of the real world through these glasses isn&apos;t any different from how you would see them through a pair of sunglasses. The light isn&apos;t being fed through cameras and then reprojected in a "passthrough" fashion as it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-v64-update-improves-passthrough-casting-and-microphones">on the Meta Quest 3</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AQXTULoBw6ansa2HZDzci5" name="meta-quest-3-augments-official-lifestyle-01.jpg" alt="Official lifestyle imagery of the Augments feature coming to Meta Quest 3 headsets in Fall 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AQXTULoBw6ansa2HZDzci5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>"Nothing prepares you for the high field of view immersion" of Project Nazare.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Instead, the micro OLED projectors — going on previous spec leaks of Project Nazare — will overlay virtual objects convincingly onto the world you see. However, current AR glasses that attempt to do this, like Snap Spectacles 4 or Magic Leap 2, have an extremely small field of view. That means the virtual object overlay is only in a tiny square in your field of view, which immediately breaks immersion.</p><p>As Kalinowski notes, "Nothing prepares you for the high field of view immersion" of Project Nazare. In other words, it&apos;s the game-changer AR glasses have needed because they can provide an immersive experience more like a VR headset while still maintaining a truly comfortable, wearable form factor.</p>
<h2 id="ai-and-availability-2">AI and availability</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kwkbZr7YpEWoEJNZFPnriL" name="Ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai.jpg" alt="Multimodal AI on the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwkbZr7YpEWoEJNZFPnriL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1536" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Throughout the interview, Kalinowski was very careful to keep from revealing too much about products like Project Nazare "until they&apos;re ready." There&apos;s an important expectation to be set and Meta can&apos;t afford to release something too early, especially if the company plans to present it as the "iPhone moment" that CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants.</p><p>But the excitement in Kalinowski&apos;s voice is unmistakable. The company has clearly made a breakthrough in several important areas and is, undoubtedly, closer to fruition than possibly any company before it has been.</p><p>Some of the major breakthroughs have been because of the recent advancements in AI, but it&apos;s not just the generative AI like ChatGPT that you might think of when you hear the term. The company has been able to shrink its camera sensors because of AI, which can denoise imagery in real-time. That frees up more space for things like processors and batteries.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>There's an important expectation to be set and Meta can't afford to release something too early, especially if the company plans to present it as the "iPhone moment" that CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Additionally, Kalinowski said that AI can now be used to further enhance SLAM — short for Simultaneous Location and Mapping — and it&apos;s how smart robot vacuums know where they are in your home, for example. In this way, AI can be used to compress important data so that it can be processed more quickly, lowering the power requirements of the glasses.</p><p>Maybe more excitingly, she admitted that "we don&apos;t don&apos;t even know what they will all be yet" when referring to all the ways AI can be used to virtually increase the processing power and capabilities of low-power devices like AR glasses.</p><p>"We have looked at what&apos;s happening in AI and intentionally looked at our roadmap and made changes to take advantage of this AI revolution." In other words, how we thought AR glasses would work is completely different now that modern AI systems exist. "The exciting thing is AI is changing every week," she adds, which would certainly make designing a product as big as Project Nazare a challenge.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>"We have looked at what's happening in AI and intentionally looked at our roadmap and made changes to take advantage of this AI revolution."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Without using any examples that might reveal too much, Kalinowski described a scenario that would help illustrate AI&apos;s visual learning capabilities and how it can start to understand context in surprising ways. The AI might "understand that you&apos;re skateboarding" and present different contextual ways of providing input or even help quickly record a video when you pull off a sick trick — that last part is my own example based on the conversation.</p><p>But, as Kalinowski points out, sometimes we have to wait to see what&apos;s going to happen even when we have all the technology in place. "When GPS first came out, few would have guessed it would be used to call an Uber from anywhere," she noted. It&apos;s the clever combination of hardware and software ideas that really helps give these products that "must have" feeling.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The success of Ray-Ban Metas was "unusually awesome," which bodes well for future AR glasses that will do even more.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Realistically, though, that still means consumers likely won&apos;t get their hands (or heads) on Meta&apos;s AR glasses breakthrough <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ar-glasses-woes-push-release-to-2027">for another three years</a>. The success of Ray-Ban Metas was "unusually awesome," as Kalinowski said, and the product seems to have caught on in the same way the Oculus Quest 2 did when it launched in 2020.</p><p>Those good sales bode well for future AR glasses that will do even more and, yet, still look good doing it. The AI component of Ray-Ban Metas "wasn&apos;t even originally the core" of the product, yet it seems to be one of the most interesting reasons to buy a pair and use them daily.</p><p>As Meta continues to push the "open ecosystem" mantra, openness and other areas of transparency will ultimately help it gain the trust needed for people to use a pair of true AR glasses every day. It&apos;s an important piece of the puzzle that shouldn&apos;t be overlooked, and it&apos;s one that teams like Kalinowski&apos;s seem to have on their minds daily.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>As Meta continues to push the "open ecosystem" mantra, openness and other areas of transparency will ultimately help it gain the trust needed for people to use a pair of true AR glasses every day.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Kalinowski says her team has been watching the Ray-Ban Meta release closely and has been integrating lessons learned into the next big product. Things like privacy LEDs on the front and other similar features have made people more comfortable with having cameras on (and in) their faces throughout the day.</p><p>And while everyone won&apos;t be comfortable wearing them all the time, I can certainly foresee a future where most people are walking around with some form of reality-augmenting technology on their bodies. Whether that looks more like Ray-Ban Metas or the Humane AI Pin, it&apos;s entirely likely that the current app-based world we live in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-ai-could-make-app-based-smartphones-a-thing-of-the-past">will become a thing of the past</a>.</p>

New customers who use the code <strong>MOOLAH </strong>during checkout <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visible.com/10-off-promo"><strong>will save $10 per month</strong></a> on their first three months of wireless service at Visible, regardless of the plan. That discount drops the price of the Visible Basic plan down to only <em>$15 per month</em> for three months (taxes and fees included), while the top-rated Visible Plus plan descends to just $35 monthly for the first three months. </p>

<p>If you're finally ready to make the switch to Visible, use the code <strong>MOOLAH</strong> when you're checking out to save $10 per month on your first three months of coverage. The deal works for both the Basic and Plus plan at Visible, and you still get all of the stellar perks included therein, such as free coverage in Mexico and Canada, an unlimited mobile hotspot, and unlimited talk, text, and 5G/4G LTE data powered by Verizon. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.visible.com/10-off-promo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6475afb3-54c3-41c4-9577-b3384d14fc65" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="New Customer offer: get $10 off your first three months of wireless when you use the code MOOLAH at Visible" data-dimension48="New Customer offer: get $10 off your first three months of wireless when you use the code MOOLAH at Visible">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;ve been thinking about switching wireless carriers; you get good Verizon coverage in your area. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a family plan; you&apos;re already a Visible user or you&apos;re happy with your current phone bill. </p><p>This new customer deal comes on the tail of a few other recent updates from the Verizon-owned wireless carrier. Last month, for example, Visible improved its popular Plus plan by boosting the speed of its mobile hotspot and throwing in one free Global Pass day every month. They&apos;ve also added a way for your to pay your phone bill annually, thereby saving some serious cash in the process (I&apos;m talking 26% off yearly when you sign up for Visible Plus). </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-buyers-guide">Visible deals</a> like this are fascinating because there&apos;s so little fine print involved. Taxes and fees are included in every price you see on the site, and you can cancel at any time with zero hassle. There&apos;s even a 15-day free trial if you want to explore service before you commit. It&apos;s for these reasons that Visible ranked as one of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carriers</a> long before the recent updates — even though they aren&apos;t <em>technically</em> an MVNO — but these new offers might send the carrier straight to the top.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">Visible Wireless</a> is a full-stack carrier owned and operated by Verizon. They offer two simple data plans that include unlimited talk, text, data, a mobile hotspot, and free talk and text in Mexico and Canada. They also work with many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> on the market. The slightly more-expensive Visible Plus plan comes with everything above, plus 50GB of premium data every month, unlimited talk and text in over 30 countries worldwide, and much more. Starting at only $45 per month (without this deal), it&apos;s no wonder we called the Visible Plus plan the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">unlimited data plan</a> that money can buy.</p>

<ul><li>The COROS VERTIX 2S is an adventurer's watch announced on April 25 and shipping on April 27 for $699. </li><li>Replacing the original VERTIX 2, it has a redesigned GPS antenna, revamped HR sensor, and a slightly lighter case, but slightly shorter battery life.</li><li>Its epic battery life, MIP display, and bulky-but-rugged design make this device best suited for people spending days (or weeks) in nature at a time. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The COROS VERTIX 2S has arrived nearly three years after the VERTIX 2, and not much has changed on the surface. It&apos;s another "Adventure Watch" for climbers, XC skiers, and mountaineers with epic battery life and dual-frequency tracking, with the same price, ruggedness, and MIP display. The differences between them are subtle, but potentially significant. </p><p>While the 2021 VERTIX 2 had dual-band and multi-GNSS tracking, COROS says that the VERTIX 2S has a "redesigned" antenna built to "improve positioning accuracy in dense city/ mountain environments." They also claim to have developed an "optimized GPS algorithm" to combat issues with outdoor climbing maps on steep slopes with the original VERTIX 2. </p><p>In addition, the COROS VERTIX 2S receives the same optical heart rate monitor as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a>, with five LEDs and four photodetectors. While it draws more battery life, it does better accuracy-wise — the PACE 3 did quite well in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">recent HR and fitness test</a> — and will handle stats like daily stress better.</p><p>Because of these improvements, the original VERTIX 2 beats the 2S battery in days (43 vs. 36 days with sleep tracking), GPS hours (127 vs. 118), and dual-frequency GPS hours (49 vs. 43). </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="X6Zqp6cR9tTM9gXjitpxdg" name="COROS-VERTIX-2S-carabiner.jpg" alt="The COROS VERTIX 2S sitting on top of a pile of carabiners." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X6Zqp6cR9tTM9gXjitpxdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: COROS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While that might seem like a downgrade, the VERTIX 2S still matches or beats many of the best MIP watches out there for longevity. The Fenix 7X Pro Solar, for example, lasts 37 days or 122 GPS hours, only equaling the VERTIX 2S if it has a steady source of sunlight.</p>

<p>The VERTIX 2 and 2S largely share the same specs, except that the 2S is 2g lighter with the nylon band, and comes in new colors. COROS will only sell the 2S from now on, deprecating the VERTIX 2.</p><p>Having only briefly tested the VERTIX 2S, I can&apos;t speak to its hardcore adventuring features yet. Keep an eye out here this Sunday for a GPS and heart rate accuracy test against some other smartwatch flagships. I can still give some early info and impressions, however.</p><p>The COROS VERTIX 2S comes in a recyclable container — it&apos;s made of recycled materials, but is also designed to be reused as storage — and ships with both nylon and silicone straps, with a Quick Fit connector. </p><p>Given how heavy the VERTIX 2S is, you&apos;ll want to default to the nylon option, which makes it feel <em>somewhat</em> manageable, on par with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> despite being significantly thicker. That&apos;s probably thanks to the polymer materials, whereas most all-steel or titanium watches take more getting used to.</p><p>Shipping in Space (black), Moon (white), and Earth (blue), the VERTIX 2S is pre-installed with a watch face inspired by your chosen color. Our review unit, for example, has a spinning Earth viewed from the moon&apos;s surface, and it&apos;s a cute touch — though light on actual data.  </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="WuXTUdRcFVEPxhaq2GRWoN" name="COROS-VERTIX-2S-side-view.jpeg" alt="Side view of the COROS VERTIX 2S buttons and thickness" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WuXTUdRcFVEPxhaq2GRWoN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As with most COROS watches, your experience will depend on your perspective on digital crowns. I&apos;m used to most "serious" fitness watches having up/down buttons, but COROS has the center dial for rotating and selecting, with the top button for the backlight and bottom button for backing out and settings.</p><p>The VERTIX 2S is a niche device, as the price suggests. For a couple hundred extra compared to, say, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Garmin Instinct 2X Solar</a>, you get a full-sized display for offline mapping, waypoints with turn-by-turn navigation, and proper widgets during activities. Mountaineers will be able to check their altitude performance or real-time storm alerts, while climbers will appreciate features like fall detection or auto pitch-type detection.</p><p>That&apos;s all vitally useful for a certain class of athlete, but an everyday runner like me is better suited towards the PACE 3 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-pro-review">APEX 2 Pro</a>. I can&apos;t necessarily put these VERTIX 2S features through their paces unless I drive hours to a ski slope or (die trying to) scale a sheer cliff face or boulder.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7nGbbpVYSKckZXpNX9AGpQ" name="COROS-VERTIX-2S-close-up.jpeg" alt="Close-up of the Earth watch face on the COROS VERTIX 2S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7nGbbpVYSKckZXpNX9AGpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you prefer MIP displays to AMOLED to get that insane battery life, then the VERTIX 2S will fall right in your wheelhouse. I&apos;m <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue"><em>not</em> an MIP fan</a>, personally, but this display is high-res enough to be comfortably readable, and it looks great outdoors. Indoors, I had to dive into the settings to activate the all-day gesture backlight, just so I could see what time it was without having to press a button.</p><p>Overall, if you already own the VERTIX 2 and like it, then I can&apos;t say for certain if you&apos;ll want to upgrade for another $699 / €699 / £599. Better heart rate accuracy and GPS maps make a real day-to-day difference, in theory; I&apos;ll report back soon once I know whether it&apos;s especially accurate in real-life testing. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google's plan to eliminate third-party cookie trackers has been postponed until next year.</li><li>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has raised concerns about Google's new technology, Privacy Sandbox, potentially favoring Google and disrupting competition.</li><li>This isn't the first time Google has postponed its cookie removal plan; it's the third delay since initially announcing the two-year timeline in January 2020.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s plan to get rid of third-party cookie trackers is on hold until next year.</p><p>Google has been pushing back on ditching third-party cookies several times now. This time, the search giant blames it on the industry and regulatory backlash. Google needs to get approval from the UK&apos;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) first, making sure its new tech called Privacy Sandbox isn&apos;t messing with competition.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-disable-third-party-cookies-some-chrome-users-2024">originally planned to ditch third-party cookies in Chrome by the end of this year</a>, but now it&apos;s aiming for early 2025. But it&apos;s not set in stone yet. Google is crossing its fingers that it can strike a deal with both the CMA and the Information Commissioner&apos;s Office (ICO) before it can really kick things off.</p><p>The CMA, in particular, is worried about what the deprecation will mean for Google&apos;s rivals and the industry as a whole.</p><p>Google has also been catching some flak from advertisers who are sweating over the idea of losing third-party cookies on the world&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">favorite browser</a>. They&apos;re concerned about what this could mean for their wallets.</p><p>The news about the delay arrives just before Google and the CMA drop their quarterly reports.</p><p>“We recognize that there are ongoing challenges related to reconciling divergent feedback from the industry, regulators and developers, and will continue to engage closely with the entire ecosystem,” Google said in a statement on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/update-on-the-plan-for-phase-out-of-third-party-cookies-on-chrome/" target="_blank">website</a> for the Privacy Sandbox. "It&apos;s also critical that the CMA has sufficient time to review all evidence including results from industry tests, which the CMA has asked market participants to provide by the end of June."</p><p>This isn&apos;t the first time Google has hit the pause button on its original plan. Back in January 2020, the company said it would ditch third-party cookies "within two years" to make web surfing safer for everyone. But this is the third time it has delayed it.</p><p>In 2022, the CMA said that axing those third-party cookies in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> would throw the competition off balance, giving Google an unfair edge. The regulators told the company to come up with a new plan that doesn&apos;t tip the scales in its favor.</p><p>Google has been trying to play nice and meet all the CMA&apos;s demands, but truth be told, it hasn&apos;t quite managed to iron out all the wrinkles yet.</p><p>With the vague promise of a 2025 launch, there&apos;s a ton of uncertainty swirling around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-to-test-restricting-third-party-cookies-soon-before-ditching-them-for-good">Google&apos;s effort to deprecate third-party cookies</a>. And honestly, it feels like we&apos;re all just waiting for the other shoe to drop.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Messages introduced Screen Effects in February, adding over 15 visual effects triggered by specific keywords in messages.</li><li>An option to disable these animations seems to have surfaced in the latest version of the Messages app with a toggle in the settings called "Show expressive animations".</li><li>Previously, the only way to disable animations in Google Messages was to do it for all apps on the device.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you&apos;re tired of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-gain-one-billion-active-rcs-users">flashy new animations in Google Messages</a>, the platform might be adding a way to turn them off soon.</p><p>In February, Google Messages <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-starts-rolling-out-screen-effects">introduced Screen Effects to more users globally</a>. It was a neat little feature that added over 15 visual effects to your messages, triggered by certain keywords. So, if you texted "I Love You" to your loved one, you might see a big heart pop up on your screen.</p><p>However, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/24/google-messages-animations-off/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, many users were asking for a way to turn off these animations. Well, it looks like their wish might have been granted with the latest version of the Messages app (v20240422_01_RC00).</p><p>In the app&apos;s settings, there&apos;s a toggle called "Show expressive animations" that controls both <em>Reaction </em>and <em>Screen Effects</em>. Until now, the only option to disable animations in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> was to do it for all apps on your device, which could be a hassle if you only wanted to disable them in Messages.</p><p>For some users, it&apos;s essential to turn off animations, specifically in Messages. Given how often those reactions and screen effects pop up and take over your screen when you&apos;re typing certain phrases or using specific emojis, it can get pretty distracting.</p><p>The big problem with these animations is that the words triggering them are everyday language we use a lot. Who wants a bunch of colorful thumbs-up fingers popping up every time you say or get a "Sounds Good" message? It&apos;s a bit too much.</p><p>Google might have gone a bit overboard with those animations, though the new way to opt out should be welcome news for users who find the current animations too distracting or just not their thing. Having more control over the app&apos;s user experience is always a welcome change.</p><p>That said, this feature is still a work in progress, so it might take a while before it&apos;s available to everyone. Also, we&apos;re not sure if this toggle will also impact animated emojis, which are a different feature altogether.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While most of the exciting innovation in the storage industry is focused on SSDs, mechanical hard drives aren&apos;t left behind — far from it. Seagate in particular has consistently delivered HDDs with ever-increasing capacities, and the Exos X24 sits at the top of the summit. The drive debuted at the end of last year, and is the flagship offering in the Exos X24 series, which goes from 12TB to 24TB.</p><p>All the drives in the Exos X24 series are based on conventional magnetic recording (CMR) tech, and Seagate also has custom models that use shingled magnetic recording (SMR), with these going up to 28TB. But Seagate isn&apos;t selling those drives to retail customers, and is instead making them available to its enterprise clients.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jubWPN9jqKeLdZDnVh3aum" name="seagate-exos-x24-2.jpg" alt="Seagate Exos X24 24TB HDD review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jubWPN9jqKeLdZDnVh3aum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the consumer Exos series, the 12TB version of the Exos X24 starts off at $318, the 16TB drive retails for $360, the 20TB is $409, and the 24TB HDD that I&apos;m reviewing (ST24000NM002H) is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Exos-Enterprise-Internal-Drive/dp/B0CM293XCL">available for $479 on Amazon</a>. I&apos;m using the variant with the standard 6Gbps SATA interface, and Seagate also has a dual-port 12Gbps SAS option available.</p><p>Having <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/seagate-exos-x20-20tb-nas-hdd-review">used the 20TB Exos X20</a> extensively over the course of the last year, the main difference with the X24 is that it has a 512MB cache buffer (up from 256GB). The 24TB drive has 10 2.4TB platters, and only the heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR)-based Exos Mozaic 3+ has a better density in Seagate&apos;s portfolio, offering 3TB platters.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PbgtgGahVXaUVo8dFGb8rn" name="seagate-exos-x24-7.jpg" alt="Seagate Exos X24 24TB HDD review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PbgtgGahVXaUVo8dFGb8rn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rest of the numbers are in line with the X20 series; the 24TB Exos X24 spins at 7200RPM, has a 550TB/year workload rating, 2.5 million hour MTBF (mean time between failures), sustained transfers of 285MB/s, and 168/550 random read/write IOPS. And like other Exos models, the X24 comes with an extended warranty that covers any issues up to five years.</p>

<p>The Exos X24 drives are helium-filled, and this allows better density as the platters can be thinner; this is how Seagate was able to fit 10 platters into the Exos X24 — regular HDDs feature up to six platters. These drives generate less noise and heat, and they withstand vibrations a little better than traditional HDDs. That&apos;s why most high-density HDDs these days use a helium-sealed enclosure.</p>

<p>I used the Exos X24 24TB for just over two months now in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/i-set-up-the-ultimate-home-nas-with-over-100tb-of-storage">DiskStation DS1823xs+</a>, and it has been terrific. The drive is technically designed for data center use, but if you&apos;re running an enthusiast server and need to store a lot of data, it is one of the best options right now. I ran the Exos X24 alongside the 20TB Exos X20 and a 22TB IronWolf Pro, and it runs a little cooler under load. I managed transfers of 254MB/s on average, and that is more than what the 20TB and 22TB drives delivered.</p><p>Seagate also makes a 24TB version of the IronWolf Pro, and while these continue to be among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-long-lasting-hard-drives-nas-synology-qnap">best NAS HDDs</a> available, the Exos X24 is a better choice. It tends to be noisier during sustained reads and writes, but it isn&apos;t considerably more so than the IronWolf Pro, and in daily usage scenarios, the drive isn&apos;t audible.</p>

<p>Coming in at $479 for the 24TB drive, the Exos X24 costs $19.95 per terabyte, and while this is higher than the $16.6/TB that the 18TB Exos X18 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-ST18000NM000J-Internal-Surveillance-Supported/dp/B08K98VFXT">retailing for as of writing</a>, you are getting much better storage density.</p><p>Ultimately, the 24TB Exos X24 is your best option if you want an HDD with a large capacity and outstanding performance. With Seagate switching gears to HAMR tech and focusing on drives like the Mozaic 3+, the Exos X24 is the default choice if you want a CMR drive with high storage potential and proven reliability.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Calendar's Android app now includes a dropdown menu beneath the current month's view, offering quick access to navigation chips for seamless month switching.</li><li>Users can preview up to four months ahead and easily scroll left or right to select a desired month.</li><li>Despite being part of a specific app version, the update is likely rolled out server-side, ensuring widespread availability.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Calendar just ironed out a pesky little annoyance we&apos;ve often faced when planning months ahead. The Android app now makes switching between months a breeze with new navigation chips.</p><p>On one of our devices with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-calendar">Google Calendar</a> (version 2024.13.1-624115131-release) installed, there&apos;s a new dropdown below the current month&apos;s view. Tapping on it brings up a row of chips that allow you to jump between months on the go.</p><p>You can check out about four months ahead (but it might vary based on how big your screen is), and you can scroll left or right to pick a month quickly, whether it&apos;s in the future or the past.</p><p>The change was first spotted by former Android Police editor Manuel Vonau, who noticed these chips in the Schedule view on the app (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/24/google-calendar-months-chips-android-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). You can find them snugly nestled between the monthly calendar and the agenda list. The same is true for the <em>Day </em>and <em>Week </em>views.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Calendar just added month chips for me below the month section in the agenda view 👀 I bet it's server-side, but I'm on version 2024.13.1-624115131-release pic.twitter.com/xbZ1hYKxlw<a href="https://twitter.com/ManuelVonau/status/1783200919208812982">April 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>As you can see in the screenshots below, the chips do take up a bit of space in those views, but it&apos;s not really a big deal given how small they are. Meanwhile, the chips are located right above the dates in the <em>Month </em>view.</p>

<p>This new bar seems to let you scroll all the way ahead, so you can zoom into the future by years, or even decades, in a flash.</p><p>While the feature is present in version 2024.13.1-624115131-release, Vonau points out that it&apos;s likely a server-side update.</p><p>The Calendar app already lets you swipe left and right to move through the months, but these new chips make it way easier to hop to a particular month.</p><p>Chips <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-unveils-update-to-ai-chip">play a big role in the Android experience</a>. Some, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-material-design-smart-chips">smart chips on Sheets</a> and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> apps, pack a punch. Then there are search chips, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive-search-chips-beta-testing">landed on apps like Google Drive not too long ago</a>, helping users find their files in a flash.</p><p>With these fresh chips popping up in Calendar, it&apos;s clear Google has a ton of options for using chips in its ecosystem.</p>

<hr>
<p>After a rather exciting week for the company, Meta announced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx">Q1 2024 financial earnings</a> on Wednesday, revealing rather impressive numbers despite a worrying forecast. Revenue was up year over year to $36.45 billion, led mostly by Meta&apos;s Family of Apps and increased ad spend. However, VR also played a role, thanks to improved Quest sales.</p><p>Reality Labs, Meta&apos;s division focused on VR and AR, was up by 30% as a result of sales of its VR headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a>, despite continuing to bleed cash. The division lost more than $3.8 billion during the quarter as the company continues to invest in its platform. Just this past week, Meta announced that it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">expanding the Meta Horizon OS</a> to third-party headsets, which should not only expand the company&apos;s offerings but open it up to more types of headsets.</p><p>We expect to see headsets from companies like Lenovo and ASUS ROG, and there will even be an Xbox-inspired headset.</p><p>"I think that our first-party Quest devices will continue to be the most popular headsets, as we see today," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the earnings call. "And we&apos;ll continue focusing on advancing the state-of-the-art tech and then making it accessible to everyone, but I also think that opening our ecosystem and opening our operating system will help the overall mixed reality ecosystem grow even faster."</p><p>But beyond VR, Meta has also increased its investments in AI, which is an area the company hopes will expand throughout its products. Recently, Meta announced its improved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Llama 3 model</a>, which can now be accessed via Meta AI on apps such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.</p><p>"We are also starting to see our AI initiatives increasingly overlap with our Reality Labs," Zuckerberg added, highlighting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">new AI capabilities</a> rolling out on the well-received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>. With this update, users will be able to make video calls and perform multimodal searches, which incorporate voice and visuals to help users learn about what&apos;s around them.</p><p>This essentially means Meta has two major investments going forward as it looks to bolster its VR platform and its position in the ongoing AI race. As a result, and adding in other factors like an upcoming trial over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/paxton-sues-facebook-using-unauthorized-biometric-data">facial recognition tech</a>, the company expects a more modest Q2 as we begin to see these strategies take shape.</p><p>Despite this, Meta says it will "invest significantly more in infrastructure over the coming years" to support its AI ambitions, which will be crucial as companies like Google and Microsoft continue to inject their AI models across their products and services.</p>

<p>HMD Global announces the launch of its "first original" trio of devices dubbed the Pulse series.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_int/press/hmd-pulse-press-release">press release</a>, HMD states the new Pulse series is the beginning of its commitment to bring self-repairable devices to consumers. Under the "Gen 1 repairability" title, the company adds its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_us/self-repair">partnership with iFixit</a> should help users quickly find the parts they need if anything goes wrong.</p>

<p>The HMD Pulse Pro leads the trio with a 6.6-inch HD+ display. The back of the phone contains a vertical dual camera array featuring a 50 MP AF Dual camera and a 2MP depth sensor. HMD states consumers will find a Super Night and Tripod mode alongside Flash Shot and AI HDR.</p><p>The company adds that the Pulse Pro&apos;s AI Super Portrait mode should help reduce any blurring found during nighttime shots. The front of the device offers a 50MP selfie camera, as well.</p><p>Powering the device is the Unisoc T606 CPU. Additionally, consumers can grab 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. The phone supports microSD expansion of up to 256GB.</p><p>HMD packed a 5,000mAh battery into the Pulse Pro, which is estimated to last up to 59 hours and is capable of 20W fast charging. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> will greet users out of the box. HMD states it has committed to providing the device, and the rest of the series, with two years of OS updates.</p><p>The HMD Pulse Pro will be available soon in international markets in Glacier Green, Twilight Purple, and Black Ocean.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1785px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.97%;"><img id="yDvSDvHs3ALGiq8DfPKiRm" name="hmd-pulse-plus-model-blue.jpg" alt="The HMD Pulse Plus in a blue colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yDvSDvHs3ALGiq8DfPKiRm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1785" height="767" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HMD)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the HMD Pulse Plus, consumers will see the same 6.6-inch HD Plus display with a 90Hz refresh rate as the Pulse Pro. However, the Pulse Plus comes with a lower 8MP front-facing selfie camera. The device&apos;s sleek back panel contains a vertical dual camera array with a 50MP AF Dual Camera and a depth sensor to help "snap quality pictures with ease."</p><p>Interestingly, HMD has kept the same Unisoc T606 CPU for the Pulse Plus, like its Pro sibling. Internally, the device will offer 4GB of RAM, 128GB of internal storage, and up to 256GB of expandable storage via microSD.</p><p>Those interested in the HMD Pulse Plus will find the same 5,000mAh battery inside, though it features slower 10W charging capabilities.</p><p>This model is available now in Apricot Crush, Midnight Blue, and Glacier Green.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1791px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.96%;"><img id="F8XwFccGgXyXyJvk8PgdcX" name="hmd-pulse-vanilla-model-pink.jpg" alt="The HMD Pulse model in Dreamy Pink." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F8XwFccGgXyXyJvk8PgdcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1791" height="859" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HMD)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The last of the trio, the HMD Pulse, remains the same in terms of CPU and display capabilities. The smallest sibling differs with its dual camera array as the device offers a 13 MP AF Dual camera. The front selfie camera remains the same at 8MP.</p><p>HMD has packed the same battery as the Pulse Plus inside the vanilla model with 10W charging and an estimated 59-hour runtime.</p><p>The base model drops slightly for memory and storage as HMD puts it up with 4GB of RAM and only 64GB of internal storage. The device still retains its microSD slot, capable of holding up to 256GB of extra storage.</p><p>Much like the Plus model, the HMD Pulse is available now for international markets. Consumers can find it in Dreamy Pink, Meteor Black, and Atmos Blue colorways.</p><p>While HMD&apos;s initial trio of devices are only for overseas countries, the company informed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/hmd-pulse-pro/">Android Police</a> that it will bring one to the U.S. While specifics weren&apos;t given, it was stated that U.S. consumers will receive the "HMD Vibe," a play-off the HMD Pulse and Pulse Plus models. The device will reportedly go for $149 whenever it finally arrives.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google-backed Indian startup Glance is preparing to finally make its U.S. debut, bringing a unique lock screen experience to Android.</p><p>Unnamed sources reportedly told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/23/india-glance-pilots-android-lockscreen-platform-in-us/">TechCrunch</a> that Glance has started a "pilot program" with Motorola and Verizon in the U.S. Glance works to deliver recommendations to users like ads, news articles, and more on the lock screen. Sources state the company&apos;s platform does not collect or use user data.</p><p>Instead, Glance operates off a user&apos;s "patterns" in order for the software to operate.</p><p>Moreover, the platform is supposedly discussing ways to build an AI-backed lock screen experience with Qualcomm. Such a move would help Glance reduce the amount of data it requires to function while also moving to on-device processing.</p><p>With Glance moving into the U.S. from India, there are plans to collaborate with telecom operators, CNN, and the NBA. The lock screen experience will reportedly arrive "later this year."</p><p>A statement from Glance to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/lock-screen-ads-coming-to-android-phone/#update-2024-04-24-08-09-est-by-rajesh-pandey">Android Authority</a> says the company "does not intend" to ads on consumer devices in the U.S. Glance will side with offering a subscription service where users can pay for "premium news" on their lock screens every month.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that users will have the ability to disable Glance on their device once it officially arrives.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Glance regarding more information surrounding its subscription service. We did not hear back in time for publication but will update this article once we hear back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3971px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="QM6XmV8aWcztyKhotvLXnU" name="Moto-G-Power-5G-2024-review-10.jpg" alt="The Moto G Power 5G 2024 backside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QM6XmV8aWcztyKhotvLXnU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3971" height="2234" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The pilot program source alluded to for Glance in the U.S. has already arrived on some devices, including the Moto G Power 5G. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G Power 5G 2024 review</a>, Glance&apos;s appearance on the device was questionable at best, and it felt a little intrusive. What&apos;s more, the platform tosses news recommendations at you, which seems a little redundant, considering Google&apos;s Discovery page is a swipe away from your home screen.</p><p>Fortunately, you can disable Glance on the phone, but we found that the service would occasionally produce a full-screen prompt on the lock screen, encouraging you to re-enable the feature.</p><p>We first heard about Glance in 2022, and it&apos;s not entirely clear what&apos;s taken the company so long to arrive in the U.S. It was stated two years ago that the company amassed 400 million users before it set eyes on the U.S. market.</p><p>Glance will seek to make a profit through the aforementioned subscription and if users interact with its "product of the day."</p>
