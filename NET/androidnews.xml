<ul><li>Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 have appeared in the 3C Certification database, sporting the same 25W charging as last year.</li><li>Speculation claims that the devices could offer more speed, as regulators notably default to a 25W charger when inspecting Galaxy devices.</li><li>The Flip 6 has been rumored to feature a better cover display and more RAM, while rumors continue about a budget Fold 6.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new rumor suggests, consumers interested in Samsung&apos;s upcoming foldables may be in for the same old, same old.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/yabhishekhd/status/1772799264336605632">Abhishek Yadav</a> on X, Samsung&apos;s upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 were spotted on the 3C Certification website with the charger model number EP-TA800. More importantly, their listing suggests Samsung will continue to feature 25W charging on both of its foldables this year.</p>

<p>However, there may be a bit of hope as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-6-z-flip-6-certified-with-25w-charger/">SamMobile</a> notes that both foldables could arrive sporting swifter charging speeds. The publication states that a 25W charger is the default choice for regulator authorities when inspecting all of Samsung&apos;s Galaxy phones — tablets, too. Devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> were reportedly tested with a 25W charger but the device launched with support for 45W fast charging.</p><p>Only time will tell which way Samsung is interested in going.</p><p>For now, there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-larger-dual-batteries-rumor">other rumors</a> regarding the clamshell and book-style foldable&apos;s battery, which state an increase in size could occur. In January, the Korean OEM was rumored to have started testing a Flip 6 with a 1,097mAh and 2,790mAh pairing, bringing its total to nearly 4,000mAh. This would bring the clamshell to a battery capacity akin to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p><p>A capacity boost like this would give the Flip 6 a 300mAh advantage over last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>.</p><p>Most recently, the Flip 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-display-memory-rumors">was rumored</a> to feature a smoother cover display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a higher RAM option. Speculation continues to swirl about a budget "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-fe-may-drop-this-key-feature-to-bring-the-price-down">Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE</a>" that may drop its stylus to keep the price low. More concrete information will likely be revealed later this summer as speculation states Samsung could host its Unpacked event <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">even sooner</a> on July 10.</p>

<ul><li>The Walt Disney Company announced the rollout of "Hulu on Disney Plus," available for all U.S.-based Disney Bundle subscribers.</li><li>The merge brings all of Hulu's content onto the Disney Plus app so users won't have to switch apps to find the shows/movies they're looking for.</li><li>The company states standalone Disney Plus/Hulu users will find the option to upgrade to a Bundle, which starts at $2 extra per month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Today (Mar. 27), it was announced that Disney Bundle subscribers in the U.S. will now find "Hulu on Disney Plus" as its rollout begins.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.disneyplus.com/hulu-on-disney-plus-launches-today-in-the-us-for-bundle-subscribers">press release</a>, Hulu on Disney Plus merges both platforms&apos; streaming content libraries in one place. The company states subscribers will begin noticing Hulu titles, recommendations, sets, and collections on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a> without switching apps. Disney hopes this brings a more customizable and personal experience for users viewing content on their platform.</p><p>Additionally, standalone Disney Plus subscribers will find Hulu&apos;s content available via "upsell options" across multiple devices. This means users will find a "convenient" way to upgrade their plans to the Disney Bundle, starting at $2 more monthly.</p><p>The post reiterates that Disney Bundle plans begin at $9.99 per month. It&apos;s worth mentioning that Hulu on Disney changes nothing; both services are still available on their own if consumers desire.</p><p>Disney urges users to create profiles for those who will be watching and to check their settings to ensure they&apos;re finding the content they care for most.</p><p>Joe Earley, president of direct-to-consumer at Disney Entertainment, said, "[the] official launch of Hulu on Disney+ gives viewers even more opportunities to easily discover and enjoy thousands of titles all in one place, underscoring the extraordinary value of the Disney Bundle."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Disney Plus is launching a new campaign to commemorate Hulu&apos;s inclusion, beginning with a brand-new logo. The company states the rollout will include a new Disney Plus intro color palette that mixes Hulu&apos;s green with the former&apos;s legacy blue.</p><p>Moreover, the orchestral mnemonic (the sound during its animation) was reimagined by Ludwig Göransson, an Academy Award-winning composer.</p><p>Disney is also launching campaigns across social media platforms, digital spots during broadcasts, and more for on-site locations at the Disneyland Resort.</p><p>Disney Plus and Hulu have been running this merger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-and-hulu-merger-app-rolling-out">in beta since November</a>, and its rollout today makes it official. Users should begin noticing the availability of Hulu content on the Disney Plus app with the option to upgrade to a Bundle as the day progresses.</p>

<p>It&apos;s no secret that Visible is one of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">wireless carriers</a>, but we just learned that the Verizon-owned company has permanently improved its best plan to be an even better deal for customers. </p><p>Starting today, the Visible Plus plan will include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visible.com/plans"><strong>some new features</strong></a> to enhance your wireless experience, such as free smartwatch coverage (Apple Watch only, unfortunately) and one free Global Pass day every month.

<p>Here is everything that the March 2024 update adds to the Visible Plus plan:</p>
<h2 id="1-one-global-pass-day-per-month-2">1. One Global Pass day per month</h2>
<p>Powered by Verizon, the Global Pass can be activated in the Visible app at any time and gives users unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of data across 140 countries worldwide. The 2024 update gives you one free Global Pass day per month, beyond which you can add more coverage by paying $10 per day. </p><p>The existing international features included in the Visible Plus plan — free calling in over 30 countries and texting in over 200 countries — will remain unchanged. </p>
<h2 id="2-increased-mobile-hotspot-speeds-2">2. Increased mobile hotspot speeds</h2>
<p>The Visible Plus plan already came with an unlimited mobile hotspot, but this update increases the data speeds from 5Mbps to 10Mbps at no additional cost.</p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring</a> (for example) looks great and is a great health tracker. They&apos;re miniaturized health trackers that pack a surprising amount of functionality. But how exactly do these compact devices work their magic? They can offer many of the same features of a smartwatch or fitness tracker but only a fraction of the size.</p><p>Let&apos;s have a look at the bits and bobs that make a smart ring work, transforming it from a simple piece of jewelry into a window for your health.</p>
<h2 id="tiny-sensors-big-data-2">Tiny sensors, big data</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3659px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZzZ9w48Ygxh6RbrNi64DRH" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-in-hand.jpg" alt="Oura Ring (Gen 3) in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZzZ9w48Ygxh6RbrNi64DRH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3659" height="2058" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A lineup of very small sensors is at the heart of a smart ring. These miniaturized circuits and components gather a wealth of data about your body and surroundings. </p><p>You&apos;ll find the same sensors as you would in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a>, but often smaller versions are used. Like other tech, these sensors can be more advanced and more accurate than their older, larger counterparts. They can also be more comfortable to wear, making them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">the ultimate sleep-tracking device</a>. Here are just some of the sensors you can find in a typical smart ring:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor:</strong> This shines a light through your skin to measure blood flow variations, allowing the ring to track your heart rate and blood oxygen levels.</li><li><strong>Accelerometer:</strong> Tracks your movement, counting steps, distance covered, and estimating calorie burn.</li><li><strong>Gyroscope:</strong> Works in tandem with the accelerometer for more precise motion detection, enhancing activity tracking.</li><li><strong>Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensor:</strong> Measures sweat production, providing insight into your stress level and emotional state.</li><li><strong>Peripheral Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) sensor:</strong> Estimates the amount of oxygen carried in your red blood cells.</li><li><strong>NTC thermistor sensor:</strong> Tracks changes in your body temperature.</li></ul>
<p>The type and number of sensors will vary depending on the ring&apos;s specific features, but this is a basic list you&apos;ll find in most wearables — smart rings included. Because of their small size, we might not see the same features found in other wearables, like GPS. Without a display of its own, this might not matter for certain features.</p><p>The collected data is no good on its own. That&apos;s where a microprocessor comes in. This tiny brain of the ring interprets the sensor readings, translating them into meaningful information. It also provides smart power management for the ring&apos;s battery and can power additional features like a haptic feedback motor that you may find on some models, which lets your ring vibrate on your finger.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-to-the-world-2">Connecting to the world</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3838px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WSjLDjSo2z7e4ATafr2yWE" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-updating.jpg" alt="Updating the Oura Ring (Gen 3)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WSjLDjSo2z7e4ATafr2yWE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3838" height="2159" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart rings wouldn&apos;t be very smart without a way to communicate. Here&apos;s where wireless technologies come into play.</p><p>The most common type of connection allowing your ring to pair with your phone is Bluetooth. Data is transferred so you can access your health data, receive notifications, and even control some features of your phone.</p><p>NFC is a short-range technology that can provide several extremely useful features on some smart ring models, including tap-to-pay and digital access control. Having a ring replace debit or credit cards and things like keycards or transit passcards is mighty convenient. </p>
<p>Communicating and interacting with a smart ring is where things are different from other wearables, like a smartwatch, that have a display.</p><p>While you might find LED lights for visual cues, haptic feedback for sensory interaction, and even gesture control along the ring&apos;s outer body, a good smartphone is a requirement for the best experience.</p><p>An app is the primary interface for a smart ring, allowing you to view detailed health data, set health goals, and configure things like notifications through haptics and all the settings needed to make it work.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3614px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T7GEEF4n6dD6LENm85Ca8F" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-charger.jpg" alt="Oura Ring (Gen 3) charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T7GEEF4n6dD6LENm85Ca8F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3614" height="2033" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart rings are powered by the same type of battery as your phone or other wearable devices — like everything else, it&apos;s been miniaturized.</p><p>Their battery life — and lifespan — depend on the model and how you&apos;re using your device. An always-on connection and continuous health monitoring will drain the battery more than doing either intermittently, but they also have the benefit of not having to power a display, which means they can last a bit longer than a typical Android smartwatch, for example. Ideally, your ring&apos;s battery will last for several days or even more than a week, and you typically charge it using a wireless pad or connection included with the device.</p>
<h2 id="what-apos-s-next-for-smart-rings-2">What&apos;s next for smart rings?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MBUFKrUfBvXCDw7oCAbjcL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-MWC-silver-close.jpg" alt="Eyes on with the Samsung Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBUFKrUfBvXCDw7oCAbjcL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart ring technology is still evolving, with exciting possibilities on the horizon. We might see some enhancement and refining of existing features alongside new ones.</p><p>I can see a future where smart rings better track your sleep, and your blood pressure and even monitor blood sugar levels. Because they usually offer a better fit than a watch and have full contact along the inner side a smart ring can be much more accurate than other wearables.</p><p>I also think we&apos;ll see more sophisticated gesture controls and smart home controls. Fine-tuned gesture control paired with NFC means controlling your lights or thermostat could be just a tap away.</p>
<p>Today, smart rings come in a variety of styles and functionalities. With Samsung ready to enter the market with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, expect to see plenty more smart rings offered from a wide array of tech companies.</p><p>They can do almost everything your smartwatch can and have the potential to do so much more. It feels like the smart ring might be the wearable tech of the future.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new batch of leaked renders claims to be the base Pixel 9 device, and there are rumors of Google&apos;s return to the "XL" category.</p><p>Together with OnLeaks on X, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-9-renders-design-exclusive/">91Mobiles</a> has posted several alleged renderings of the true base Pixel 9 device. The imaging purports that the Pixel 9 will sport a smaller 6.03-inch display. The device could launch with the following dimensions: 152.8 x 71.9 x 8.5mm with a potential 12mm bump due to its camera housing.</p><p>Speaking of its cameras, the Pixel 9&apos;s renderings show a housing change we&apos;ve seen previously. The upcoming series drops its full horizontal camera array for a pill-shaped look, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. The Pixel 9&apos;s imaging also suggests it will arrive with two cameras like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">its predecessor</a>.</p><p>The post adds the Pixel 9 may offer a completely flat display with four rounded corners around its frame. Consumers may find its physical buttons (power button and volume slider) on the right side of its body.</p><p>Additionally, it looks like Google will continue to offer a centered punch-hole selfie camera.</p>

<p>The publication and X-leaker OnLeaks have backtracked some previously leaked renders of the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro. In January, a batch of images leaked and were touted as the base Pixel 9, but information now suggests that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-renders-leak">it was the Pixel 9 Pro</a> with a 6.1-inch flat display. Another round of images surfaced in January, which were said to be the Pixel 9 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-render-leak">but OnLeaks claims</a> those were of a third model: the "Pixel 9 XL."</p><p>If the rumors are true, consumers will experience a smaller Pixel series in 2024. The Pixel 9 Pro will drop by 0.6 inches, moving from a 6.7-inch display to 6.1 inches. This supposed Pixel 9 XL would take the top spot with a 6.5-inch display, but it&apos;s still smaller than 2023&apos;s Pro model. Much of this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-display-rumor">goes against rumors</a> that claimed Google would go bigger in 2024.</p><p>In their respective leaked renderings, both the Pixel 9 Pro and the newly rumored Pixel 9 XL featured a triple camera array. The end of March is approaching, meaning we should take these rumors with a pinch of salt until Google&apos;s teasers later this year.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Google Pixel 9 series was recently rumored to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-could-bring-adaptive-touch-feature">enhanced touch sensitivity</a>. The feature would arrive as "Adaptive Touch" and enable the devices to automatically adjust their touch screen sensitivity based on environmental conditions like rain.</p>

<ul><li>Last year's rollout of the webcam feature for Pixel phones with Android 14 QPR1 fell short in image quality, but Google seems to be addressing this shortcoming for the next Android version.</li><li>The latest Android 15 Developer Preview introduces a High-Quality mode for the webcam.</li><li>While the HQ mode may impact battery life, the noticeable improvement in video quality could make it worthwhile for tasks like video streaming.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seems to be working on beefing up Android&apos;s built-in webcam feature to match Apple&apos;s <em>Continuity Camera</em> quality.</p><p>Last year, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr-beta-webcam-feature-video-quality">rolled out a webcam feature for Pixel phones</a>, kicking off with Android 14 QPR1. Though it sounded promising, the actual image quality when using it on an Android device often fell short. However, Google appears to have listened to user feedback and is working on improving it for the next Android version.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">latest Android 15 Developer Preview release</a>, Google has thrown in a fresh HQ button for the webcam, as spotted by Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-webcam-high-quality-mode-3427591/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. It&apos;s located in the top-left corner of the viewfinder, and tapping that button brings up <em>High Quality</em> mode, ramping up the video quality big time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:332px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.89%;"><img id="DapMMSiJBDvaaQA944ztqm" name="Android-webcam-HQ-mode.jpg" alt="HQ button in Android's built-in webcam interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DapMMSiJBDvaaQA944ztqm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="332" height="740" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The feature does that by flicking off Google&apos;s power optimizations behind the scenes. According to Rahman&apos;s experiments, the Pixel phone seems to be pumping out video streams in Full HD at 30 frames per second.</p><p>Based on his testing, the video quality doesn&apos;t seem to be munching away at the phone&apos;s battery life. Plus, even after a solid 2.5-hour grind, Rahman didn&apos;t notice his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> breaking a sweat and overheating.</p><p>Of course, diving into HQ Mode is bound to nibble on your battery life, so if you&apos;re planning a marathon video session, it might be wise to leave it off to save juice. But Rahman suggests that for specific tasks like streaming video, it could be worth flipping the switch because the boost in video quality is pretty darn noticeable.</p><p>This could be a game changer for users keen on capturing higher-quality video content without breaking the bank. Instead of shelling out for a pricey webcam, you can tap into your phone&apos;s potential and save yourself some cash.</p><p>It&apos;s nice to see Google fixing a big issue with Pixel phone webcams. But remember, this feature is only in the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> developer preview. While we&apos;re hopeful it&apos;ll stick around for the final build, there&apos;s always a chance it could pull a disappearing act, as we&apos;ve seen happen before with Android beta features.</p><p>Once Android 15 hits the stable channel, we&apos;ll have to wait and see if this stays for the long haul.</p>

<ul><li>Google has announced three updates to Google Maps that promise to make planning your next trip easier than ever.</li><li>These introduce three major new features – curated recommendations, customized lists, and AI that can help you on the go.</li><li>The updates will start rolling out over the next few weeks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>When you’re planning a vacation, deciding where to stay, what to eat, and which sites to see can be hard work. And while guidebooks can be incredibly helpful, they aren’t always up to date with the latest information. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-popularity-united-states-study">Google Maps is already the most popular navigation app</a> that helps people find their way. Today, Google has announced three updates to Maps that promise to make planning where to go a lot easier.</p><p>When visiting a new destination, it’s normal to look for recommendations from other travelers or locals to help decide what to do. The first Maps update promises to make this easier by providing curated lists of recommendations “from people who know the city well.” In addition, Maps will give you lists from well-respected expert sites, such as Lonely Planet and OpenTable. </p>
<p>This update will roll out in the US and Canada this week, providing lists for more than 40 cities in these two countries. If you’re visiting any of those cities, you can search for it in Maps and swipe up to see the list of recommendations.</p><p>There are also three types of curated restaurant lists being prepped: The “Trending” list, which includes “places that have recently seen a spike in popularity on Maps.” The &apos;top&apos; list identifies places that are consistently popular with the Maps community. Finally, the &apos;gems&apos; list helps you find great restaurants that perhaps aren’t as well known. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hyUdeUHaQVABZe6dzNcqGG" name="Google-Maps-recommendations-and-customized-lists.jpg" alt="Screenshots of recommendations, customised lists and AI updates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hyUdeUHaQVABZe6dzNcqGG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another Maps update allows users to create lists by tapping the<em><strong> new list</strong></em> button under the <em><strong>saved</strong></em> tab. This will allow users to compile a list of places they want to go and places they’ve been. </p><p>Users can then move destinations up and down on their list to rank them. According to Google, “you can choose the order places to appear in your lists to make them even more useful. So if you’re planning a trip and compiling recommendations, you can organize them chronologically — like an itinerary.” You’ll also be able to link your lists to content from your social media. This update is due to roll out globally later this month on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android</a> and iOS.</p>
<p>Finally, Google is bringing AI to Maps to help users with real-time decision-making. This appears to be an advancement on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-details-gen-ai-search-maps">update from February</a>, which introduced generative AI to select Local Guides. </p><p>According to Google: “When you’re checking out a restaurant and scrolling through photos of the food, we’ll use AI to help you identify what a dish is called (perfect if you’re in a new city and not familiar with the cuisine), and show you helpful information based on the menu — like what it costs, if it’s popular, and even if it’s vegetarian or vegan.” You’ll also receive reviews to help you decide if it’s the right place for you. This builds on Maps’ ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-now-identifies-the-menu-items-in-restaurant-food-photos">identify menu items based on restaurant food photos</a>, which was spotted in January.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a> is also planning a design refresh over the coming months. This includes reducing the number of home screen tabs and new pin colors that help you find places on the map more easily. Having recently rolled out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-directions-ui-redesign-rollout">redesign for the Maps UI</a>, Google is working hard to make Maps as helpful and user-friendly as possible.  </p>

<hr>
<p>Google released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> alongside the Samsung Galaxy S24 series in January, and it quickly became one of the best software features shipped this year. While it was initially limited to Google and Samsung&apos;s most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>, Google today announced Circle to Search will start rolling out to more Android phones, foldables, and tablets beginning this week. Additionally, Circle to Search will soon gain the ability to translate the contents of your screen in an instant. </p><p>The availability of the Circle to Search feature was a point of contention for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> owners. The Pixel 8 series was the first Google phone to receive the feature, but Circle to Search later expanded to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. For weeks, owners of Google&apos;s $1,800 foldable were left in the dark as to whether their smartphone would eventually get Circle to Search. Starting today (Mar. 27), Google confirms that Circle to Search is "coming soon" to both the Pixel Fold and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>. </p><p>The last three years of Google phones will support Circle to Search, as will the 2023 lineup of Samsung Galaxy devices. You can view the full list of newly supported devices below, which will gain Circle to Search as early as this week. </p>
<ul><li>Google Pixel 6</li><li>Google Pixel 6 Pro</li><li>Google Pixel 6a</li><li>Google Pixel 7a</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S23 series</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 series</li><li>Google Pixel Fold (coming soon)</li><li>Google Pixel Tablet (coming soon)</li></ul>
<p>In the coming weeks, Circle to Search will get more powerful with new translation features. To start using it, users can activate Circle to Search by either long pressing the home button or the navigation bar. Besides the Google Search bar, there will be a new translate icon. Tapping it will translate your screen&apos;s contents in an instant. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="cW2wdcdU5qY2mGXWxivHG9" name="Circle-to-Search-Translate.jpg" alt="Google Translate in Circle to Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cW2wdcdU5qY2mGXWxivHG9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google expects this feature to be great for traveling when people navigate content in foreign languages on their smartphones. Users can also translate things in their real-world environment with Google Lens in the Google Search app. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="M7FggtTeFEk9emnE6vGiiF" name="Google-SGE-Trip-Planning.jpg" alt="An example search with SGE." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M7FggtTeFEk9emnE6vGiiF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As people start to plan their summer vacations, Google wants to help beyond translation in Circle to Search. Users who opt in to Search Generative Experience via Search Labs can create a custom travel itinerary using generative AI. Simply entering something like "plan a four-day trip to Washington, D.C." in Google Search can result in a unique travel plan for your summer trip.</p><p>This new functionality comes just in time for travel season and as Google expands its Search Generative Experience. Starting this week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overviews-test-expansion">SGE began appearing to users</a> who were not enrolled in the Search Labs test. </p><p>To recap, Circle to Search will be available on more devices starting this week. Translate functionality will debut in the coming weeks, and custom travel plans using Search Generative Experience will be available in Search Labs starting today (Mar. 27). </p>

<ul><li>Users in the U.S. can now have a personalized shopping experience — thanks to Google.</li><li>The search giant is bringing nifty new features to Google Search on mobile, desktop, and the app.</li><li>It will include style recommendations, an AI-powered image generation tool, and a virtual try-on option.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google wants to make your shopping experience more personalized by introducing new tools, the search giant announced today (Mar.27).</p><p>Users in the U.S. who usually use mobile browsers or the Google app to shop for apparel or accessories will now see a new section dubbed "style recommendations."</p><p>It will have various options to choose from and rate with a thumbs up or thumbs down button. Users can further swipe right or left to see their personalized results. Google says more options will be provided when users don&apos;t find what they are looking for, and they can keep on the search.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:292px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:205.48%;"><img id="XSZ84GHToJkfBhiXaMhRZR" name="Google-Shopping-Style-Picking-Tool.gif" alt="Google Shopping Style Pick tool" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XSZ84GHToJkfBhiXaMhRZR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="292" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google will remember these preferences, and the next time users search for the same set of accessories/apparel, they will get personalized results based on the saved preferences. If  any accidental taps occur, users can tap on three dots next to the Search result and "look for personalization options in the "About this result" panel."</p><p>Additionally, Google allows U.S. shoppers to specify brands they like when choosing apparel, shoes, or accessories on mobile, desktop, and the Google app. Once they choose their brands, the subsequent search results will showcase products from those brands first. As mentioned, they can still change their preferences in the aforementioned process.</p><p>Users in the U.S. who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/google-search-generative-ai-holiday-gifts/#:~:text=Shop%20what%E2%80%99s%20(literally)%20on%20your%20mind">opted for</a> Search Generative Experience (SGE) via Search Labs will have access to a new experimental feature on the Google app and mobile browsers. It is an AI-powered image generation for shopping tool that allows users to find their favorite products based on their search query. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1227px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.90%;"><img id="jUko56SQrmahFNLgchXXMT" name="google-shopping-ai-tool.jpg" alt="Google Shopping AI tool" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jUko56SQrmahFNLgchXXMT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1227" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google cites examples like the "colorful quilted spring jacket" search query, which showcases photorealistic images that match users&apos; ideas. Once the images are generated, they can select and view suitable options by scrolling through them. </p><p>After finding the right one, the search giant is offering shoppers a virtual try-on (VTO) tool. The tool was first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-clothes-virtual-try-on">introduced</a> last year for U.S. users shopping on desktop, mobile, or the Google app. The tool provides a diverse set of models, including sizes ranging from XXS to 4XL. Users can look for the "try-on" icon in shopping results to check out the men&apos;s or women&apos;s tops.</p>

<p>Onyx unveiled the Boox Note Air 3 in October 2023, and the e-reader is now available in all global markets where the brand has an official presence. The standard variant of the Boox Note Air 3 comes with a stylus and magnetic case (which is really good), and it costs $399. There&apos;s a stylus bundle that includes a better-quality stylus in addition to the standard one, and this variant is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/products/noteair3">available for $447 at Boox&apos;s website</a>.</p><p>Onyx makes a variant of the Boox Note Air 3 with a color screen, and this is called the Boox Note Air 3C.

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-onyx-boox-note-air-3-design"><span>Onyx Boox Note Air 3: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cPLiKmsZWhGm9Qkd2dCETc" name="onyx-boox-note-air-3-20.jpg" alt="Onyx Boox Note Air 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cPLiKmsZWhGm9Qkd2dCETc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Boox Note Air 3 looks every bit as premium as its price tag suggests, with the e-reader featuring an aluminum chassis that&apos;s great to hold and use. The brushed metal design is elegant, the rounded edges make it comfortable to hold the e-reader, and while it is quite heavy at 450g, the weight is balanced well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wXLmJmFmPozLKq6RmzhPHZ" name="onyx-boox-note-air-3-6.jpg" alt="Onyx Boox Note Air 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wXLmJmFmPozLKq6RmzhPHZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the orange accents at the back and around the USB-C charging port, and this adds some vibrancy. The Boox Note Air 3 has an asymmetrical design — similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/kindle-oasis-2019-long-term-review">Kindle Oasis</a> — and this makes a big difference in daily use. That said, there are no physical page turn buttons, and that lack of tactility when turning pages makes reading books on the e-reader a little less fun.</p>

<p>Another feature that&apos;s missing is ingress protection; the Boox Note Air 3 isn&apos;t resistant to dust or water, and that limits its versatility to a great extent. That said, the sheer size of the e-reader means it isn&apos;t exactly practical to carry it to the pool — like you would a Kindle — but it is still a letdown.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hDec28qZu7wcD49NfXCFta" name="onyx-boox-note-air-3-13.jpg" alt="Onyx Boox Note Air 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hDec28qZu7wcD49NfXCFta.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get sizeable bezels around the 10.3-inch screen, and while it is more than double the weight of the Kindle Oasis, you get a considerably larger screen. The USB-C port is mounted on the left, along with two speakers. While they have large drivers, the sound quality isn&apos;t particularly detailed, and they don&apos;t get loud. They&apos;re serviceable for podcasts, but if you want to listen to music, you should really use earbuds.</p>

<p>What I particularly like is that there&apos;s a case bundled in the package, and it is of a good quality. It attaches magnetically to the e-reader, folds into two different configurations, and offers adequate protection when the Boox Note Air 3 isn&apos;t in use.</p>

<p>I used over a dozen e-readers up to this point, but they&apos;ve all had medium-sized screens. The Boox Note Air 3, on the other hand, has a 10.3-inch panel, and the difference was absolutely evident from the moment I started using the e-reader.</p><p>The panel itself is an E Ink Carta 1200, and with a resolution of 1872 x 1404, you get an effective pixel density of 227PPI. That&apos;s more than adequate for an e-reader, and in the two months I used the Boox Note Air 3, I didn&apos;t notice any issues with the panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uEbxcPHdnuXXcPb4dmai4b" name="onyx-boox-note-air-3-14.jpg" alt="Onyx Boox Note Air 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uEbxcPHdnuXXcPb4dmai4b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching over to the hardware, the Boox Note Air 3 is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 680, and while you won&apos;t find it on any phone, it does a good job on the e-reader. You also get 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, Wi-Fi ac, and Bluetooth 5.0. There&apos;s an accelerometer that switches the orientation of the screen based on what hand you&apos;re holding the e-reader, but it isn&apos;t as smooth as the Kindle Oasis. You also get a MicroSD slot if you want to extend the storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fVgPnBwW9bB99avqwf88YZ" name="onyx-boox-note-air-3-7.jpg" alt="Onyx Boox Note Air 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fVgPnBwW9bB99avqwf88YZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Boox Note Air 3 has a 3,700mAh battery, and the e-reader lasts a week between charges even with heavy use. I read two books over the course of a week and took notes daily, and the battery was still a very reasonable 30%. The e-reader charges at 15W, and it takes well over 90 minutes to charge the battery.</p>

<p>Reading on the Boox Note Air 3 is an absolute joy; the large 10.3-inch screen is terrific in this regard. It doesn&apos;t have the same pixel density as the Kindle Oasis, but that doesn&apos;t really make a huge difference in daily use, and text is clear. There is some ghosting at times, but it isn&apos;t noticeable, and this is an issue with all e-readers that use E Ink panels anyway.</p><p>The e-reader has a built-in NeoReader utility that works with all major formats — including EPUB, MOBI, PDF, AZW3, CBR, and so on — and you can change the font size, choose from a selection of fonts or install your own, and so much more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Utfs6TFQKDSkJZrxA7u77c" name="onyx-boox-note-air-3-18.jpg" alt="Onyx Boox Note Air 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Utfs6TFQKDSkJZrxA7u77c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>NeoReader has a tabbed interface that&apos;s ideal if you&apos;re switching between documents, and you can easily annotate via the bundled stylus. On that note, the stylus has 4,096 level of pressure sensitivity, and it is outstanding at taking notes. I normally use a Lamy Safari and Leuchtturm1917 notebooks to journal and take notes, and while the e-reader doesn&apos;t quite match the feeling of a fountain pen, it comes mighty close.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kBoRcKFEQmVvsTppAWgFaa" name="onyx-boox-note-air-3-12.jpg" alt="Onyx Boox Note Air 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kBoRcKFEQmVvsTppAWgFaa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s also particularly good at sketching. My wife is an artist, and she uses an iPad Air along with an Apple Pencil to paint digitally. She mentioned that the Boox Note Air 3&apos;s stylus has a slight delay when creating strokes, and that there&apos;s no way to duplicate a layer of copy large drawings.</p><p>On the whole, the Boox Note Air 3 is a great choice if you&apos;re looking for a large e-reader that doubles as a note-taking device.</p>

<p>Onyx offers a custom version of Android on the Boox Note Air 3, and while Android 12 is outdated at this point, the device will get three platform updates. While it&apos;s great that the e-reader runs Android, you can&apos;t do much with it outside of reading, note-taking, and sketching. The E Ink tech just doesn&apos;t play well with video content, and even scrolling through web pages, you can make out distinct afterimages.</p>

<p>You get 10GB of cloud storage as standard with an Onyx account, giving you plenty of storage for all of your books and notes. Onyx has a lot of pre-installed utilities — including a clock, recorder, calculator, and so on — but the fact that you get the Play Store means you can install just about anything you want.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">Kindle Scribe</a> is a great alternative if you need a large e-reader to take notes. It gives you easy access to Amazon&apos;s ecosystem, comes with plenty of useful features, and at $255, it is affordable.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/remarkable-2-review">reMarkable 2</a>. It is the definitive note-taking device, and while it is costlier, it is lighter, has a sleeker design, and does an even better job at taking notes.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a large e-reader that's great for reading and taking notes</li><li>You need the extensibility of Android</li><li>You want an e-reader that lasts a week between charges</li><li>You need a bundled stylus</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want physical page turn buttons</li><li>You need ingress protection</li></ul>
<p>Other than the lack of ingress protection and physical page turn buttons, I can&apos;t really find any faults. Onyx clearly knows what it&apos;s doing, and the Boox Note Air 3 is one of the best e-readers currently available. The large 10.3-inch screen is great for reading e-books and browsing, and it doubles as a fantastic digital note-taking device— all thanks to that bundled stylus.</p><p>The fact that you have full access to the Play Store is an added bonus; you just don&apos;t get that versatility with many other e-readers. Battery life is outstanding, the metallic chassis is durable, and there&apos;s plenty of customizability — much more so than what you get with other e-readers.</p>
