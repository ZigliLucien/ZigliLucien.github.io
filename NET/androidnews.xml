<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google wants to enhance the video conferencing experience by integrating Project Starline with popular platforms like Google Meet and Zoom.</li><li>Teaming up with HP, Google plans to launch its 3D video call platform in 2025.</li><li>Project Starline introduces a teleconferencing solution that projects lifelike 3D models of participants, replicating gestures and expressions, thus simulating an in-person experience.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is working on bringing its Project Starline solution to everyday platforms like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-10-google-meet-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Meet</a> and Zoom for a more lifelike video conferencing experience.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-project-starline-hp-partnership/" target="_blank">announced</a> that it is partnering with HP to bring the 3D video call platform to market in 2025. Plus, it is working on making it compatible with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-video-conference-software">favorite video conferencing services</a> so you can ditch the flat screen.</p><p>In 2021, Google started working on Project Starline, a teleconferencing setup where you see a 3D model of the person you&apos;re talking to, complete with all their gestures and expressions, making it feel like you&apos;re actually in the same room. It&apos;s designed for businesses for now, but it&apos;s definitely a glimpse into the future of video chat.</p><p>At last year&apos;s I/O conference, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-project-starline-new-prototype-2023">revealed a prototype that&apos;s way smaller and sleeker</a> compared to the original bulky booth-like design. Instead of a booth, the new version is more like a digital whiteboard. It&apos;s got just a few cameras around the screen, but it used AI to work out the depth, giving it that 3D feel.</p>

<p>After years of tinkering, Google is finally bringing Project Starline out of the lab and into the real world.</p><p>Google mentioned that after clocking in thousands of hours of testing across Google offices and with business partners, it discovered that meetings in Starline feel more like being physically together than just your usual video calls.</p><p>The Mountain View-based company points out that this results in people paying better attention, remembering things easier, and feeling more like they&apos;re in the same room, not miles apart. In Starline, folks behave as if they&apos;re right there in the same room, not separated by thousands of miles, according to the company.</p><p>No pricing details are available yet, but it&apos;s likely that bigger companies with the cash and room to spare will be the first to dive in. Google has promised to make Project Starline cheaper and easier to get hold of eventually, but for now, it&apos;s not really meant for personal use.</p>

Most major music services offer some form of hi-res or lossless, so it&apos;s time you stepped up your gear game to get the most out of the service you&apos;re paying for! Even Spotify is still threatening to offer Hi-Res Audio to its subscribers. We&apos;ll believe that when it finally happens though.</p><p>You&apos;ll need more than your $8 USB-C to 3.5mm Apple dongle (though audiophiles praise it for its cost-to-quality benefit) to fully realize the highs and lows of that high-resolution digital data flow. To that end, we&apos;ve compiled this list of the best digital audio players (DAPs) that support high-resolution audio playback. From affordable, entry-level options to over-the-top aspirational enthusiast favorites, this collection rounds up the best of the best.</p>

<p>FiiO has mastered the art of fine-tuning sound as proven by the superb audio gear made by the brand. The FiiO M11 Plus ESS is top-tier, supporting all the things. You get Android 10 and a 5.5-inch touchscreen interface. It has dual DACs, dual-band WiFi, expandable storage up to 2TB, and 3.5mm/2.5mm/4.4mm outputs. Look forward to lossless audio support, along with LDAC, LHDC, and aptX-HD. The M11 Plus ESS has enough power on tap to drive some of the hungriest headphones.</p></p>

<p>If you're not in need of a specialized, uber-expensive MP3 player, then SanDisk is there to save the day. The Clip Jam is an adorable audio player with a tiny footprint. You won't find any fancy codecs and file formats here, but the physical navigational buttons are easy to use while working out and you get 8GB of on-device storage.</p></p>

<p>The HiBy R3 II fills in the gap without skimping on high-quality sound. This touchscreen MP3 player delivers balanced audio and supports advanced codecs such as UAT and LDAC. You even get Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, letting you play music from any platform. When you don’t have WiFi, simply place the R3 II into DAC/AMP mode, connect it to your phone, and use it as an external DAC/AMP via USB or Bluetooth.</p></p>

<p>The Astell&Kern KANN Ultra is ultra aspirational with its four-figure price tag. While audiophiles will argue about what you get here versus a slightly less expensive kit, there seems to be no argument about the high-resolution, lossless audio that makes your mouth water and your eyes sparkle. It has all the ports and technical goodies under the hood to please sound engineers and audiophiles alike.</p></p>

<p>The HIFI WALKER H2 costs half as much as the mid-range HiBy player, and we couldn't be happier about it. HIFI trades a touch screen for satisfying physical buttons, a wide assortment of supported audio file formats, DSD playback, and a built-in DAC from Burr-Brown.</p></p>

<p>The words "Sony" and "Walkman" sure trigger heavy nostalgia. Sony's cassette-tape days may be gone, but the Sony NW-A306 Walkman high-res music player sports impressive features at an amicable cost. It features extensive high-res file support, up to 32-bit/384kHz PCM, MQA, and DSD256 file formats. You also get aptX HD and LDAC codec support. There's only 32GB of storage, and half of that is taken up by Android, but it's expandable up to 2TB via a microSD card.</p></p>

<p>Mighty's adorable little music player is shaped like a cube and has a clip on the back. For the “mature” among you, this is reminiscent of the 6th generation iPod Nano, but without the touchscreen. You can set up the Mighty Vibe 3 in a jiffy using your phone and attach it to your armband for easy access. It can store around a thousand songs and you can sync your Spotify (family or premium only) or Amazon Music libraries with it then enjoy those tunes for up to eight hours on a charge.</p></p>

<p>Missing the iPod Nano's small form factor coupled with a touch display? The Shanling M0 Pro is the perfect modern alternative. But its size belies its power! Dual ESS DACs for better sound and power than its predecessor, a new 3.5mm connector, and bi-directional Bluetooth are just some of its many features! It's hard to believe such a tiny device can produce such high-quality audio. Our <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/harish-jonnalagadda">Harish Jonnalagadda</a> reviewed it and calls the M0 Pro, "<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shanling-m0-pro-review">a terrific choice.</a>" 'Nuff said?</p></p>

<p>Those of you who don't want to separate your MP3 player and smartphone needs can grab the LG V60 ThinQ 5G. LG's foray into phone making was good while it lasted, giving us gems like the V60 ThinQ that has a DAC built-in. You can plug in a standout pair of wired headphones into the audio port and enjoy high-end sound quality. There's no shortage of storage or music playing platforms it can access. Sadly, you'll be stuck with renewed versions when looking to buy one.</p></p>

<p>Unlike picking the right <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-music-players-android">music player apps for Android,</a> looking for a dedicated digital audio player is a complicated process. A lot of thought goes into the search, especially if you have exposed your ears to high-end audio before. Nonetheless, the devices that we have gathered in this roundup have all the best features that you need. There&apos;s a little something for everyone, in every color, and every price bracket.</p><p>For audiophiles with a keen sense of hearing, the Astell&Kern KANN Ultra is the absolute best audio player. It is powered by the ES9039MPRO Dual DAC chip, it supports a vast range of file formats, and it can deliver hi-res audio for both wired and wireless sound delivery methods. The KANN Ultra features a custom-built OS, so no additional apps or notifications disturb your music-listening bliss. The 128GB of onboard storage is plenty, but you can expand it to 1TB if needed. The one caveat here is the eye-watering asking price - this DAP will cost you as much as a flagship foldable phone, or mid-level gaming laptop. If you can afford it, pair it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fa19-review">Fiio FA19 wired in-ear monitor (IEM) earphones</a> and you&apos;ll experience total auditory bliss.</p><p>For lower budgets, the HiBy R3 II and HIFI WALKER H2 are decent options. They both manage to produce similar levels of sound that sound exceptionally good. You&apos;ll enjoy top-notch audio playback without spending smartphone money on either one. On the other hand, if audio codecs, file formats, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-my-phone-have-dac-explaining-dacs-and-amps-smartphones-today">DAC & amps</a>, and lossless audio mean nothing to you, then you should stick with basic portable music players such as the Mighty 3 or the SanDisk Clip Jam. If you want even more versatility, grab the LG V60 ThinQ 5G to serve as a phone as well as an MP3 player. It&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phone-headphone-jack">best Android phones with a headphone jack</a> and it has a solid DAC built-in.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 8a vs. Samsung Galaxy S23 FE mid-range battle is here. After comparing the specifications of both phones, you may get a clearer picture of which phone is right for you. The Samsung Galaxy S23 FE has been out for a while, but it still wins in some areas compared to the new Pixel 8a.</p><p>Both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> have a lot to offer, but what matters most to you will determine which one you go with. For example, some users will only consider a phone if the camera specifications are good, while others care more about the software. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro-deals-of-the-month">Pixel phones</a> get the latest Google features first, but is that a solid reason to get the Pixel 8a? We&apos;ll give you a detailed comparison to see where each phone loses and wins, and which is best for your tech needs.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-8a-vs-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-design-2">Google Pixel 8a vs. Samsung Galaxy S23 FE: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SafYZGr6gUDGsM4VsQ7ooe" name="samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-white-with-mint-case-2.jpg" alt="White Galaxy S23 FE with Mint case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SafYZGr6gUDGsM4VsQ7ooe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can identify which phone is which by looking at the design. The Google Pixel 8a stands out because the aluminum camera bar runs along the back and has more rounded corners than the previous model, giving it a more elegant look. With this new design, the Pixel 8a looks practically identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>. The Google Pixel 8a is available in Aloe, Bay, Obsidian, and Porcelain. It also has a matte finish on the back that matches the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro style.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S23 FE has three camera modules in the upper left-hand corner without the border that the S21 FE has. It is available in Mint, Purple, Cream, Graphite, Indigo, and Tangerine finishes. Unlike past models, the back of the phone has a glass finish. You also get lovely silver accents in the form of separate camera rings. The aluminum frames have a matte finish and are 30 grams heavier than the previous model, and the bezels are a little thick.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-8a-vs-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-display-2">Google Pixel 8a vs. Samsung Galaxy S23 FE: Display</h2>

<p>The Google Pixel 8a has an improved display this time, but the size is still the same, with a 6.1-inch panel. You can also count on a 120hz OLED panel with a 1080 x 2400 resolution and a middle-hole punch cutout for the selfie camera.</p><p>The display has an optical fingerprint reader and has been bumped to the same Actua display featured on the Pixel 8. The Pixel 8a&apos;s peak brightness is 40% higher than the previous model at 2,000 nits in HDR mode. The layer of Gorilla Glass 3 for protection isn&apos;t as good as its Galaxy competitor. You enjoy features like an Always-on mode and widgets like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-enable-the-new-google-at-a-glance-widget-features">At A Glance</a> and Now Playing on the lock screen.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S23 FE features a 6.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with a 1080 x 2340 resolution that offers decent sharpness and color accuracy. It also has a 120Hz refresh rate (60Hz when idling) and Gorilla Glass 5, not Victus, like the previous model. The Galaxy S23 FE supports HDR10+ video content, and the brightness is better in this model than the S21 FE. The Galaxy S23 FE isn&apos;t as bright as its Pixel 8a competitor, with a peak brightness of 1,450 nits.</p>

<p>How long can the Google Pixel 8a last in terms of battery life? With a 4,492mAh battery that supports 18W wired charging and 7.5W wireless charging, the Pixel can last a day. You can stretch that to as long as 72 hours on the extreme battery-saver mode. It has a slightly inferior battery than the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE but a better Tensor G3 chip than last year&apos;s flagships. The cores are new, and they have improved performance. There is no information on the thermal management at this point. It also has a USB Type-C 3.2 port.</p><p>There is no change regarding RAM, you still get the same 8GB memory from last year. You also get UFS 3.1 storage instead of the faster UFS 4.0 storage, which is a shame. The Pixel 8a offers two storage options: 128GB and 256GB, the latter being a first for the Pixel A series. The Pixel 8a shares the exact RAM and storage capacity as its Galaxy S23 FE competitor.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S23 FE</a> has a 4,500mAh battery that supports 25W wired and 15W wireless charging. Unfortunately, battery life is middling with about half a day&apos;s worth of usage resulting from a single charge. The phone has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor that is slightly less powerful than its Pixel competitor. The Samsung model sold outside the United States has an Exynos 2200 processor. Both the Pixel 8a and the Galaxy S23 FE feature stereo speakers.</p>

<p>Google promises seven years of software and security updates with the Pixel 8a and Android 14 out of the box, so you&apos;re sure to get monthly Feature Drops as well as major OS upgrades for quite a while. With this mid-range Pixel, you get a lot of the smart AI features you would see on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>. You get Call Assist, Pixel VPN, Magic Eraser Audio, Speech-to-Text, and Gemini.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S23 FE comes with Android 13 based on One UI 5.1 but can be upgraded to Android 14 based on One UI 6.1 right away. However, this model doesn&apos;t offer as many updates, as Samsung promises only four years of system updates and five security updates. You also get the same AI experience you would on higher-end models (when updated to One UI 6.1), such as DeX support, Photo Remaster which fixes blurry pictures, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-transcribe-and-summarize-using-samsung-notes-on-the-galaxy-s24">Summarize feature</a> which gives a summary of long articles when using the Samsung browser.</p><p>This model also includes Interpreter Mode, which is very helpful whenever you need something translated. Other included features are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, Auto format, Correct spelling, and Translate in Samsung Notes.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S23 FE is available now for a starting price of $599, and the Google Pixel 8a starts at $499 in the US. The Pixel 8a is cheaper and has fun AI features you won&apos;t find on the Galaxy S23 FE, so if you&apos;re a selfie enthusiast and always want the latest system updates, the Pixel 8a might sound more appealing.</p><p>But if you&apos;ve always wanted to have the AI features you would see on Samsung&apos;s higher-end Galaxy S models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, and want to flaunt a more elegant-looking phone, then the S23 FE could be your choice.

<hr>
<p>Vivo is preparing for a new launch in the Chinese region on May 13, when we will see the Vivo X100 Ultra next to the Vivo X100s series. Ahead of the release, new information appears, revealing interesting specs of the upcoming flagship.</p><p>Prolific leaker Evan Blass has managed to grab the user manual of the upcoming Vivo X100 Ultra and has shared some of it on X (formerly Twitter). The images reveal the flagship phone&apos;s specs following a blueprint showing the device&apos;s prominent sensors.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">From the Vivo X100 Ultra user manual: pic.twitter.com/nyt6LNlxWD<a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1788926648441508165">May 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Per the shared manual, the Ultra will feature a 50MP selfie shooter and a triple rear camera system comprising a 200MP lens aided by two 50MP sensors. Besides, these rear cameras are also ZEISS-powered. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-x100s-series-launch-confirmed">Earlier reports</a> have indicated that one of the 50MP sensors will act as the primary lens, and the 200MP sensor is likely projected as the periscopic lens.</p><p>Furthermore, the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phone</a> will measure 9.23mm in thickness and sport a 6.78-inch WQHD+ display featuring 3200 x 1440 resolution. It is also tipped to have a curved display along the edges. Other parameters from the manual include the device&apos;s 5G connectivity and support for GPS.</p><p>The aforementioned report has also indicated that the device will have a glossier finish at the rear, equip a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> underneath, and likely sport Black, Titanium, and White color options. The storage variants are believed to be 12GB+256GB, 16GB+512GB, and a whopping 16GB+1TB. The larger variant has its own set of unique parameters like satellite connectivity and is also tipped to be priced at CNY 8499 (~$1,180).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the X100s series from Vivo, which is launching next to the Ultra on May 13, will sport flat edges and a flat display measuring 6.7 inches. These devices are expected to be powered by MediaTek&apos;s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">Dimensity 9300 Plus</a> chipset with higher clock speeds. </p><p>The Vivo X100 Ultra appears to be a promising successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro</a>, which launched in November 2023, followed by a global debut in December 2023.

This year, the Pixel 8a improves on nearly every negative point of last year&apos;s Pixel 7a, and it even makes changes I didn&apos;t expect from a $500 phone.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, Google rounded the corners and put a matte texture on the back, making for a comfortable phone that consistently looks nice. The Pixel 8a has adopted these same changes and even rounded the corners just a bit more for an almost Galaxy S3-esque "smooth pebble" design. My gosh, if it isn&apos;t the most comfortable phone I&apos;ve held in a long time because of it!</p><p>In addition to that, we&apos;re looking at the same processor in the Pixel 8, the same display as that phone, the same amount and speed of RAM, the same storage speed, the same water resistance rating, and the same powerful AI-driven Tensor G3 processor. It certainly makes you wonder why you would ever need a more expensive Pixel phone, doesn&apos;t it?</p><p>This initial review was conducted after using the phone as my primary phone over the duration of four full days. I&apos;m using the Pixel 8a on T-Mobile&apos;s 5G network, and it runs the latest version of Android 14, which the phone will ship to customers.</p>

<p>Of all the Pixel phone designs over the years, the Google Pixel 8a is my new favorite. It melds the unique camera bar design from the more expensive Pixel 8 series with further rounded corners, and a matte finish back that feels heavenly.</p><p>This is a phone that&apos;s built for human hands and it feels wonderful to use it one-handed, even if the display is a bit big to reach all the edges with one thumb without shifting the phone around. Round corners do a lot for long-term usability and comfort. Sharp corners on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> are just plain uncomfortable, made even worse because it&apos;s a super heavy phone.</p><p>The Pixel 8a isn&apos;t shockingly light by any measure but it does come in at around 5 grams lighter than last year&apos;s Pixel 7a. At 188g, you&apos;ll feel it in your pocket but it&apos;s not heavy enough to cause finger fatigue if you find yourself holding it for a long time. As actor Chris Evans <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://collider.com/chris-evans-misses-his-iphone-6s-video/">once pointed out</a>, heavy phones often cause pinky finger fatigue.</p>

<p>Beyond the weight and shape, Google is using surprisingly premium materials for most of the phone. The back is still plastic, but it feels less like plastic than ever, thanks to a beautiful, fingerprint-resistant matte finish. I praised Google&apos;s use of a matte finish in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro review</a>, and this phone feels nearly identical to that.</p><p>There&apos;s a slight hollow feeling if you tap the back when compared to a glass-backed phone like the more expensive Pixel 8 models have, but it doesn&apos;t come off feeling cheap.</p><p>Likewise, the "satin aluminum" frame looks extremely premium, particularly on the Bay blue model I have for review. This part, too, has a matte finish that won&apos;t attract fingerprints and will leave your Pixel 8a looking clean and shiny even after using it for hours.</p>

<p>The display has been upgraded yet again this year. The display is spec-for-spec identical to the Pixel 8 in all but one way: it&apos;s not LTPO. That means this 120Hz panel shifts between 60Hz and 120Hz depending on what&apos;s happening on screen, while the  Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro&apos;s displays can smoothly shift between 1Hz and 120Hz. In plain language, the Pixel 8a&apos;s display is slightly less battery-efficient.</p><p>But the rest of the panel is right on the money in most measurements. Google calls it the "Actua display" in reference to its color accuracy, which helps highlight the quality of the camera. It also gets incredibly bright, with a peak brightness of 2000 nits and a peak HDR brightness of 1400 nits.</p>

<p>The downside is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive folks</a> are going to find this display incredibly uncomfortable. Like the mainline Pixel series, this uses 240Hz PWM flickering at all brightness levels, quickly turning the display on and off to fool your eyes into thinking it&apos;s bright or dim instead of adjusting voltage like traditional displays and lights.</p><p>This PWM rate is the lowest of any major phone series and is truly awful for any flicker-sensitive person. Google doesn&apos;t offer an anti-flicker or flicker-reduction mode like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> or any OLED-donning Motorola phone, which makes those phone much better options if you&apos;re PWM-sensitive.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 8a sports the exact same Google Tensor G3 processor that&apos;s found in the more expensive Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro phones. That means Google was able to pack in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-8a-packs-just-as-much-ai-punch-as-the-standard-pixel-8">the same AI features</a> as those more expensive phones.</p><p>A huge part of that capability is in the Tensor G3&apos;s upgraded NPU capabilities which, according to benchmarks we ran, is nearly 3x faster than the NPU in the Pixel 7a. That NPU, or Neural Processing Unit, is what&apos;s responsible for efficiently running AI routines on-device and ensuring that the phone quickly processes AI-based tasks and also keeps them from needing to be uploaded to a cloud server for privacy reasons.</p><p>Overall performance of the phone, based on benchmarks, is also better than both the Pixel 7a and even the more expensive Pixel 8 Pro. Google said it was able to concoct a new thermal management method, and while the phone still throttles heavily at around 40 degrees Celsius, it takes longer to hit that thermal limit.</p>

<p>However, when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, our current favorite mid-range phone, the Pixel 8a&apos;s performance is quite lacking. Not only that, but the Pixel 8a&apos;s performance-per-watt is substantially worse than the OnePlus 12R. In plain terms, your battery life is going to drain more quickly on a Pixel 8a than a OnePlus 12R when doing anything that taxes the processor.</p><p>So far, battery life hasn&apos;t been particularly impressive for me. Granted, I have to run the display at 100% brightness all the time to keep headaches at bay, otherwise, the phone&apos;s PWM-laden flickering display makes my head hurt something fierce.</p><p>Our parent company runs lab tests via the Future Labs department, and those test results show that the Pixel 8a gets one hour of <em>better</em> battery life than the Pixel 8 Pro in the battery rundown test at the default 60Hz refresh rate. In other words, if you&apos;re using default settings — 60Hz display, auto brightness — then battery life will be quite excellent.</p><p>I&apos;ll be putting the phone through the rigors over the next few days and weeks to better determine what it&apos;s best at but, for now, early tests show that Google has made important improvements to some of Tensor&apos;s biggest weak points, even if the processor is still slower and less efficient than the competition.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s Pixel software has really come into its own over the years, particularly in the past six months, as Google has added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> features to the platform. The Pixel 8a sports all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-8a-packs-just-as-much-ai-punch-as-the-standard-pixel-8">same AI features as the regular Pixel 8</a>, including Magic Eraser, Zoom Enhance, Best Take, Audio Magic Eraser, Circle to Search, and more.</p><p>Not only that but the Pixel 8a is set to receive <strong>seven years</strong> of Android updates, meaning it&apos;ll see Android 21 before the end of its shelf life. It also has a <em>free VPN</em> built-in, something only Pixel phones provide.</p><p>That&apos;s a huge value add for a phone in the $500 price range, as these devices normally don&apos;t have the processing capabilities to be able to pull off impressive AI features like this. It&apos;s a huge win for anyone not wanting to spend flagship money but still get flagship features.</p><p>Of course, this means there&apos;s almost nothing <em>new</em> on the Pixel 8a when compared to the Pixel 8 series. The lone exceptions are the upgraded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-guided-frame-pixel-7">Guided Frame</a> utility and the improved Family Link parental controls setup.</p><p>Initially, Guided Frame was just used as a way to help vision-impaired users take better photos and selfies. Now, Guided Frame can utilize both front and rear-facing cameras to describe what your phone&apos;s camera is seeing.</p>

<p>Google also improved Family Link by making the setup process easier and clearer, which goes nicely with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-preps-school-time-mode-play-services-update">recent Pixel Watch update</a> that adds School Time and other important parental control functions.</p><p>But under the shiny exterior of AI features and update promises lingers an underlying distrust built up from years of screw-ups on Google&apos;s part. As I said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">last week</a>, the Pixel series has become known for its buggy updates and weird problems.</p><p>Things have slightly improved since the Pixel 6 days, but over the past year alone, we&apos;ve seen monthly updates cause <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro-battery-drain-and-network-issues">battery drain issues</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-second-april-patch-cell-service-rollout">cellular connectivity issues</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-6-battery-overheating-issues">overheating issues</a>, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-6-storage-bug-android-14">a crucial storage bug</a> that made it impossible to use many apps.</p><p>These are just a handful of issues Pixel owners have had to deal with to some degree over the past few years, and it makes me wonder if monthly updates are really worth the issues they seem to create.</p><p>Of course, the flip side to all this is that Pixel phones nearly always get updates before any other phone on the market.</p>

<p>Comparing the Pixel 8a to the OnePlus 12R — another excellent $499 phone — shows that there&apos;s not a <em>huge</em> gap between the two in most shots, but the Pixel 8a definitely wins more often than not. In many cases, the Pixel often gets the exposure mostly correct and ends up pulling out more detail, resulting in a better-looking picture because of it.</p><p>Photos taken on the Pixel 8a exhibit the classic high contrast, color-accurate imagery that Google&apos;s Pixel phones are known for. Pixels are also the best when trying to capture objects in motion — like pets or kids — which means the Pixel 8a is automatically the better choice for parents or folks who love to take lots of photos of their pets.</p>

<p>For the price, it&apos;s hard to turn down the Pixel 7a. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-pixel-7a-deals">best Pixel 7a deals</a> will get you the phone for $350. Considering that the Pixel 7a is still due for four more Android updates (up to Android 19), this one has quite a bit of life left in it. You&apos;ll also be getting a camera with identical quality capture as the Pixel 8a, although battery life and performance are worse than Google&apos;s latest can provide.</p><p>But if battery life and performance are your chief concern, the OnePlus 12R is the best buy at $500. It has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, which is roughly twice as fast as the Tensor G3 in the Pixel 8a for gaming and other graphics-intensive applications. OnePlus doesn&apos;t offer the same level of long-term support or some of the Pixel-exclusive AI features, though, and the camera is not as good as a Pixel.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KEN4R38CamszXthY34ubY4" name="google-pixel-8a-back-bay-09.jpg" alt="The back of the Bay blue Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KEN4R38CamszXthY34ubY4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You plan to hold on to your phone for years.</li><li>You want the best camera in its class.</li><li>You love Google AI features and Pixel features.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're sensitive to flickering lights or PWM-dimmed displays.</li><li>You need the best performance for the price.</li><li>You need fast charging and/or more than 24-hour battery life.</li></ul>
<p>As the price of the Pixel A-series continues to climb in many regions, its value continues to encroach on full flagship-tier phones. There&apos;s also something to be said when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro-deals-of-the-month">best Pixel 8 deals</a> can get you a better phone — the regular Pixel 8 — for the same price as the 8a. Not only that, but the OnePlus 12R also retails for $499 and packs a significantly faster and more efficient processor onboard, plus a better display that&apos;s also more eye-friendly.</p><p>But there&apos;s no guarantee that you can snag a Pixel 8 for $499, which means the Pixel 8a is the best buy at the price if long-term updates and camera quality are your top features. Google&apos;s update quality has been a little shaky over the past few years, though, which hangs a cloud over an otherwise impeccable record of update speed.</p><p>For now, I&apos;d personally pick a Pixel 7a over Google&apos;s latest. Sure, it&apos;s only got four more years of Android updates, but I&apos;m not convinced that current Tensor processors will be fast enough to feel snappy for longer than that. At $350, the 7a is an unbeatable deal with camera quality that matches the 8a, even if it doesn&apos;t have as many AI features.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Vivo's X100 Ultra is now official in China, with the phone featuring a 1-inch main camera and 200MP telephoto that goes up to 3.7x optical zoom.</li><li>The phone is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and has a new thermal management solution.</li><li>The device will be limited to China, and won't debut globally.</li></ul>
<p>Samsung has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, Xiaomi has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">14 Ultra</a>, and with OPPO launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a> this year, it was only a matter of time before Vivo followed suit. The Chinese manufacturer unveiled the X100 Ultra in its home country, and while the device shares a lot of the same features as the X100 Pro, it has upgraded cameras.</p><p>The 1-inch Sony LYT-900 camera is the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a>, but the Ultra gets a new telephoto lens — a 200MP f/2.7 sensor with OIS that goes up to 3.7x. Vivo says the sensor will deliver usable shots up to 20x zoom, and although the device doesn&apos;t have two telephoto lenses — like the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Find X7 Ultra — Vivo is rolling out the ability to shoot images and videos at similar focal lengths.</p><p>Vivo is using the same 6.78-inch AMOLED panel, and it goes up to 3,000 nits when viewing HDR content. The X100 Ultra is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, with Vivo eschewing MediaTek hardware. There&apos;s 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage on the base model, with configuration options going up to 16GB/1TB.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aXzEYtVkV7Wawy9kosktxm" name="vivo-x100-ultra-2.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aXzEYtVkV7Wawy9kosktxm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vivo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a larger 5500mAh battery, and like the Magic 6 Pro, it uses a silicon carbon design that should allow better longevity. Vivo is rolling out a new 50MP camera at the front as well, and its integration with Zeiss means you get a lot of the same shooting modes.</p>
<p>There isn&apos;t much in the way of design changes, but the X100 Ultra is available in titanium, grey, and white color variants. </p><p>The X100 Pro has terrific cameras in its own right, and I&apos;m interested in seeing how the X100 Ultra holds up against the Xiaomi 14 Ultra. Annoyingly, the X100 Ultra won&apos;t be launching globally, with Vivo limiting the device to China.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>New code references to Spatial Audio have appeared in an official ChromeOS code change. </li><li>Though the feature is currently non-functional, the code change previews how Spatial Audio will become an option in ChromeOS settings.</li><li>However, it looks like Chromebooks will eventually have the same Spatial Audio support as Android phones and tablets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Spatial Audio is the latest fad to hit mobile audio, and it allows users to experience a virtual surround field of sound, mimicking hardware surround sound setups. Google added support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-android-users-need-know-about-spatial-audio">Spatial Audio in Android 13</a> early last year, but the company may be prepping it on a new operating system: ChromeOS. Recent code changes to ChromeOS that include references to Spatial Audio suggest that the feature will eventually make its way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>. </p><p>The mention of Spatial Audio was included in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5527513" target="_blank">official ChromeOS code change</a>, which was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/10/chromeos-spatial-audio/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. Though this doesn&apos;t guarantee Spatial Audio will come to Chromebooks, it is a good sign. The Chromium Review page outlines the new code, which would "add a spatial audio toggle on the audio settings page" in ChromeOS. This toggle, when added, would allow users to choose whether their Chromebook plays content in Spatial Audio. </p><p>Spatial Audio will likely appear in a ChromeOS Canary build first, or behind a developer flag. In the Chromium Review page, it was revealed that the flag will be called <strong>ShowSpatialAudioToggle</strong>. Eventually, users will be able to find that developer flag under <strong>chrome://flags</strong> to force-enable Spatial Audio. </p><p>Generally, the future Spatial Audio toggle for ChromeOS seems nearly identical to the one that exists in Android. As of January 2023, Android phones and tablets running Android 13 or later have access to Spatial Audio. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-spatial-audio-earbuds">supported earbuds and headphones</a>, you can use Spatial Audio with head tracking for a more immersive experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="KCXWN2krHsAtoBSQVSGM3o" name="oneplus-buds-pro-2-spatial-audio.jpg" alt="Spatial Audio toggle on Pixel 7 Pro for OnePlus Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KCXWN2krHsAtoBSQVSGM3o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new Spatial Audio option for Chromebooks is expected to appear in the ChromeOS settings app under the <strong>Device</strong> and <strong>Audio</strong> sections. It looks like a simple toggle for now, but that could change before the feature&apos;s release. There&apos;s still a lot we don&apos;t know about how Spatial Audio will work on ChromeOS, like whether it will only be supported with certain apps or throughout the entire system.</p><p>Still, the future inclusion of Spatial Audio on Chromebooks will further add continuity throughout Google&apos;s ecosystem. Whether you&apos;re using an Android phone, tablet, or Chromebook, you&apos;ll have Spatial Audio as an option. It&apos;s unclear when Spatial Audio might ship on Chromebooks, but the feature will have to at least appear in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromeos-lacros-coming-soon">ChromeOS Canary</a> or as a developer flag before that happens. </p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp changes the app to make it "feel more fresh and modern."</li><li>The changes include a design overhaul and new features for iOS and Android devices.</li><li>The primary ones, however, include chat filters, darker dark mode, and the inclusion of a Meta AI chatbot, which is yet to be launched.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp has had a significant design revamp over the past few weeks, and Idit Yaniv, VP, Head of WhatsApp Design, Meta, indicates that these changes to the product are to "feel more fresh and modern" while keeping the messaging platform&apos;s core functionality.</p><p>While some design changes have been rolling out to WhatsApp for some time now, Yaniv explains the three principles on which these changes were built in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://design.facebook.com/stories/whatsapp-user-interface-update/">accompanying blog post</a>:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1324px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.32%;"><img id="ETiGcHvHiNr7m32MkPv6Gh" name="whatsapp-over-the-years.jpg" alt="WhatsApp overhaul 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ETiGcHvHiNr7m32MkPv6Gh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1324" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li>Fresh: WhatsApp should feel fresh, fun, and yours with a look familiar and native to your device.</li><li>Approachable: Everyone should feel comfortable using WhatsApp. It's accessible at home within the OS and feels unmistakably WhatsApp—friendly and slightly quirky.</li><li>Simple: The new design should enhance simplicity, be scalable, and be future-proof.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1309px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.84%;"><img id="r6X3qnNqFRTdEkiG3JWUam" name="whatsapp-navigation-bar-redesign.gif" alt="WhatsApp overhaul 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6X3qnNqFRTdEkiG3JWUam.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1309" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The primary design changes have included shifting the navigation bar comprising Chats, Status, and Calls tabs from top to bottom. This should help people who use bigger, at least 6-inch screens (and above) on Android phones navigate more quickly as it is closer to the thumb. </p><p>The change also means the addition of chat filters at the top that should help people to set apart between "All," "Unread," and "Group" chats — these were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-moves-navigation-tools-to-bottom">introduced</a> very recently on the messaging platform.</p><p>The popular green shade at the top has also been replaced with a much cleaner look. Besides, WhatsApp has also chosen a new consistent green palate that should be visible across the app and its menus and settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="amssXmwswh3PjrDpi5xhsg" name="whatsapp-darker-dark-mode.jpg" alt="WhatsApp overhaul 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/amssXmwswh3PjrDpi5xhsg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yaniv also notes that users have been requesting a darker dark mode. WhatsApp has made relevant changes with higher contrast and deeper tones, which promises to reduce strain when using the app in darker environments.</p><p>While the intended changes are for both iOS and Android platforms, iOS users have also seen a new attachment layout: an expandable tray replacing a full-screen menu that should allow people to send photos and videos effortlessly. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="zWXZwnEAsPShCB82Z2HaSh" name="whatsapp-overhaul-2024-01.jpg" alt="WhatsApp overhaul 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zWXZwnEAsPShCB82Z2HaSh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned, most of these changes have already been made through WhatsApp app updates and server-side updates. The other prominent changes on the messaging platform are the overall icons on the app, next to refreshing doodles for background on WhatsApp chats.</p><p>One common thing to note across the changes and accompanying images is the inclusion of a new Meta AI chatbot in the messaging app&apos;s search pane. </p><p>While the blog post does not mention it or its launch time frame, we expect it to roll out in the coming days or weeks,</p>
<p> as the wider rollout was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-starts-testing-meta-ai-on-whatsapp">recently seen</a> for users across regions.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The second-generation OnePlus Open may not be released in 2024, possibly due to the delay in the launch of the OPPO Find N5.</li><li>Given that OnePlus and OPPO are sister companies, their product launches are often interconnected.</li><li>It is also possible that the OnePlus Open 2 might feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset instead of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a> turned heads as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">fan-favorite foldable phone</a> last year, and many thought OnePlus would quickly follow up with a sequel this year. But it looks like we&apos;ll have to wait a bit longer for its successor.</p><p>As per a post by Kartikey Singh on X (formerly Twitter), it looks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> might not be launched in 2024, supposedly because the OPPO Find N5 is also taking a rain check on its launch for this year (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-Open-2-Second-gen-OnePlus-foldable-will-not-be-released-this-year.835460.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's basically confirmed that Oppo will not release the Oppo Find N5 Series this year thus no OnePlus Open 2 as well!<a href="https://twitter.com/That_Kartikey/status/1788815412882272698">May 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Both OnePlus and OPPO are sister companies under the same parent organization, so their product launches can sometimes be interrelated. If the Find N5 is delayed, it&apos;s possible that the Open 2 might face a similar fate.</p><p>The OnePlus Open 2 is hyped up as the eagerly awaited follow-up to its well-loved predecessor. It&apos;s widely speculated that the Open 2 will probably follow the same path as its predecessor, being essentially a revamped version of the upcoming OPPO foldable device, just as the first OnePlus Open was pretty much a clone of the OPPO Find N3.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/chunvn8888/status/1789148176378974628" target="_blank">reply from another X user</a> seems to confirm the delay. Adding fuel to the fire, the post suggests that the OnePlus Open 2 could be powered by the Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> chipset.</p><p>With the original Open having debuted in late 2023, skipping a year feels like a missed opportunity. Typically, companies refresh their phone lineup annually, so it&apos;s a letdown to consider that the OnePlus Open 2 might not make its debut this year.</p><p>In addition to the OnePlus Open 2, there have been rumors swirling about OnePlus venturing into the clamshell foldable segment. The mysterious OnePlus Flip device has been whispered about, but details are scarce. Speculation suggests it could be a rebranded version of the Oppo Find N5 Flip, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_find_n5_flip_is_canceled_according_to_purported_2024_foldable_launch_lineup-news-61896.php" target="_blank">which has reportedly been canceled</a>.</p><p>OnePlus did seem to take its sweet time before jumping on the foldable phone trend. But if the company is holding off on launching the second model to fine-tune or beef up its features, it&apos;s probably worth the wait.</p>

<p>Google I/O 2024 arrives this Tuesday, and we expect a Wear OS 5 announcement. The last three I/Os gave us a massive Wear OS 3 overhaul (2021), a Pixel Watch reveal (2022), and a Wear OS 4 preview (2023). After two bombshells, last year&apos;s wearable news was more perfunctory, so I&apos;m crossing my fingers for a bounce-back year with a long-overdue fitness fix to Wear OS. </p><p>We know that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">Wear OS 5</a> is on the I/O schedule, with a talk on "Building for the Future of Wear OS." Google might bring up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">new Hybrid Interface</a> that gives Wear OS watches longer battery life, or perhaps it&apos;ll announce plans to bring Wear OS watches into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">new Find My network</a>. </p><p>We might see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> coming to Pixel and Galaxy Watches, given I/O&apos;s likely AI focus. And perhaps we&apos;ll get a glimpse of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, even if it won&apos;t arrive until the fall.</p><p>Those all seem like fair bets for your Google I/O bingo card. What&apos;s less likely, but still important, is that the Wear OS team announces a proper OS-wide replacement for the dying Google Fit. Maybe that&apos;s Fitbit, maybe not; it just needs to be <em>something</em>. </p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-has-set-a-deadline-to-shut-down-the-google-fit-api">Google Fit API shuts down next year</a> in favor of "Android Health," a new API with universal data categories like steps, distance, and calories. Designed to work with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a>, it&apos;ll seamlessly transfer data between apps, with the ability to export niche data like blood glucose or pressure once watches start tracking them.</p><p>Sounds great, in theory! In practice, it still creates a vacuum where Google Fit used to sit as an agnostic option. You can transfer data, but you still need an end destination, and most fitness apps are designed to trap you in their ecosystem and charge you a fee. Yes, the Google Fit app is still available, but the writing is on the wall for the app to get the boot now that Google has turned its attention to Fitbit. Samsung Health is the closest "universal" and unpaid alternative, though that app is only available on Samsung smartwatches.</p><p>One could argue that health and fitness apps are a key way <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> differentiate themselves from one another these days, as it seems to be the big draw for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch</a>. Also, these companies sell your health and fitness data to advertisers, and a universal app might prevent smaller brands from profiting. So, with a universal fitness app experience, how would Wear OS watches stand out from each other?</p>

<p>When Samsung joined Wear OS, Google didn&apos;t insist that it abandon its own apps, UI, and unique approach; leaving Samsung Health as the default option is part of that. As for other brands, they might not want their apps to have to compete with Fitbit or Samsung Health. </p><p>That doesn&apos;t change the fact that the Wear OS <strong>brand</strong> suffers from this fragmentation. Every non-Samsung/Google watch has a proprietary app that&apos;s usually stripped down compared to what dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> offer, such as workout recommendations and recovery times. The same goes with Apple Fitness Plus, with its popular workout videos.</p><p>Instead, we saw how OnePlus&apos; first Wear OS offering — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> — had issues with health sampling, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-wear-os-exit-shows-platform-improvements-less-competitive">Fossil abandoned Wear OS</a> for good because it couldn&apos;t keep up on the software front with its woefully lackluster Wellness app. Without more support from Google, I&apos;m not certain how many third-party brands will break out of their small niches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TBQVmTKxkHmcGoHtRtu5eP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-Fitbit-readiness-score-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch next to an Android phone showing a Fitbit Daily Readiness Score." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TBQVmTKxkHmcGoHtRtu5eP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What&apos;s the solution? My first plan is simple enough and would make for a splashy Google I/O announcement: Say Fitbit is coming to all Wear OS watches with Wear OS 5, either via the Play Store or as an alternative "default" option — the same way you can choose between Bixby or Google Assistant on a Galaxy Watch. </p><p>Yes, this makes Wear OS watches more uniform. However, health data is just as vital for a good smartwatch experience as Google Assistant or apps; Samsung prefers its users to use the Galaxy Store or Bixby, but at least there are reliable Google alternatives. </p><p>As far as how Wear OS watches would stand out, there are still other ways to differentiate between different models in their design, displays, UI, and so forth, without leaving health and fitness as this Wild West marketplace.</p><p>This move would also give the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-confining-fitbit-makes-financial-sense-but-missed-opportunity">struggling Fitbit brand</a> a bigger profile with Android users. I&apos;d even suggest that Google compensate partners like Mobvoi or OnePlus by cutting them in on the profits for any Fitbit subscriptions bought on their watches after the trial period ends. </p>

<p>My other solution would play into Google&apos;s love of renaming services that fulfill the same purpose: Just make "Android Health" an app like Google Fit. Give it some basic goals and coaching, make it free, and let people use it as a waystation between their Wear OS watch and whichever proprietary fitness app they prefer.</p><p>Eventually, I expect Google to offer something like "Gemini Coach AI," which looks at your health data and gives you recommendations on sleep, training, and recovery. But unless that&apos;s another Fitbit exclusive to sell Pixel Watches, then it will still need a uniform Wear OS fitness experience. </p><p>We&apos;ll see if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024">Google I/O 2024</a> has a fitness surprise in store for us this year, Fitbit-related or otherwise. All I know is that, at some point, Google&apos;s choice to leave its Wear OS partners to fend for themselves on health and fitness — the first priority for a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watch</a> buyers — could backfire on them.</p>
