<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A loophole in Android TV could allow unauthorized access to Gmail and other linked services if someone gains physical access to the device.</li><li>Through an Android TV box, individuals can potentially hack into the Google account of the last user, compromising Gmail and Google Drive.</li><li>Initially, Google implied the behavior was expected, but later acknowledged the security flaw and claimed to have fixed it on newer Google TV devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A security loophole in Android TV could allow anyone to snoop on your Gmail and other linked services if they get their hands on your device, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.404media.co/android-tvs-can-expose-user-email-inboxes/" target="_blank">404 Media</a>.</p><p>As per a video posted on YouTube by Cameron Gray earlier this year, if someone gets their hands on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-tv">Android TV</a> box, they can pretty much hack into the Google account of whoever last logged in, including their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gmail-android-how-to">Gmail</a> and Google Drive (via Mishaal Rahman).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PSA: Do not sign into your personal Google Account on any Android TV device you don't own! https://t.co/l0FScUVT4M<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1783552498218758184">April 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>If <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> spots a Google account on the device it&apos;s installed on, it automatically signs you in to any Google services you visit. Now, since Android TV is basically Android in essence, it treats the owner&apos;s Google account sign-in like it&apos;s permanent, so they automatically get logged in to approved apps from the Play Store.</p><p>Even though Google doesn&apos;t officially let you install Chrome on Android TV, you can still sideload it to sneak it on there. And once it&apos;s on, you&apos;ve got access to Gmail, Drive, and all the other services, as demonstrated by the video.</p><p>In the video, Gray installs a third-party web browser called "TV Bro" that you can grab from the Play Store for Android TV. He uses it to dig up an APK for Chrome from some online archive and installs it without any trouble. But the app doesn&apos;t play nice with TV remotes, so you will need a keyboard and mouse.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QiyBXXO8QpA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Once Chrome is up and running, it&apos;s as easy as pie to hop over to Gmail&apos;s website and you&apos;re in—no password needed, no PIN, or biometrics required to prove you&apos;re the TV&apos;s owner.</p><p>Based on what Gray found, Android TV&apos;s weak security makes it a prime target for peeking into signed-in email accounts. If you&apos;re only using Android TV at home, you&apos;re probably in the clear. But if you&apos;re logging into Android TV from some device outside your crib, that&apos;s when you&apos;re asking for trouble.</p><p>Google&apos;s initial stance suggested that&apos;s how this is supposed to work, which technically is true. But it&apos;s still a big security goof. Recently, Google said it fixed the problem on newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/here-are-all-android-tv-devices-google-tv">Google TV devices</a>.</p><p>The search giant told 404 Media that most of its Google TV devices with the latest software updates no longer allow this shady behavior to happen anymore. But for the rest of the devices, Google is working on pushing out a fix soon.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google for clarification on how exactly it plans to resolve the issue, and we&apos;ll update this article once we hear back.</p>

It&apos;s not that difficult once you know how, but you&apos;ll need a guide to start you off. </p><p>Your first step will also vary based on which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> you own, specifically how many buttons your model has. Unlike most smartwatches, you can&apos;t simply hold down on the main watch face to start customizing. </p><p>Below, we&apos;ll explain how to change your Garmin watch face, the best data fields we recommend using, and some of our favorite Connect IQ custom watch faces. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-change-your-garmin-watch-face-2">How to change your Garmin watch face</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings menu</strong>: On a 5-button watch like a Forerunner or Instinct, hold the middle-left button, aka the <strong>Up/Menu button</strong>.</p><p>1a. On a two or three-button watch like a Venu or Vívoactive, hold down the bottom-right button or the <strong>Back/Lap button</strong>.</p><p>1b. On a <strong>single-button model</strong> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-vivosmart-5-review">Vivosmart 5</a>, tap the <strong>main button</strong>, then <strong>tap the clock icon</strong> on the touch display.</p>

<p>2. Your first option in this menu should be <strong>Watch Face</strong>; select it with the top-right <strong>Start</strong> button. </p><p>3. Use the <strong>Page Up/Down buttons</strong> or swipe on your touchscreen to choose one of the pre-installed watch faces. Hit <strong>Start</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="P48onza2dbiJLakA4dKve9" name="Garmin-watch-watch-face-edit-screen.jpeg" alt="Installing a custom watch face on a Garmin watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P48onza2dbiJLakA4dKve9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>4. You should see three options: Apply, Customize, and Delete. Choose <strong>Apply</strong> to use the watch face as is, or <strong>Customize</strong> to change the layout and types of <strong>data fields</strong>, as well as the <strong>Accent Color</strong>. </p><p>5. Once you&apos;re finished, select <strong>Done</strong> to apply these changes. </p>

<p>As you can see, changing your Garmin watch face only requires a few button presses or taps once you know where to start. But <em>customizing</em> a watch face is a bit more complicated because Garmin assumes you know what its data fields — and their vague, unlabeled icons — mean.</p><p>In lieu of a drawn-out list, we&apos;ll link to this Garmin Support page showing key examples for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=agZJiZRjhX2adgWkBVOHI9&identifier=886725&tab=topics" target="_blank"><strong>Garmin Forerunner 965 icons</strong></a>, covering most of the main options available. </p><p>A full-sized Garmin watch face can fit about six data fields, plus the main clock field. It&apos;s subjective which data fields pertain to your training or preferences, but we&apos;ll point you to our personal favorites:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Steps (footsteps icon): </strong>An obvious choice for anyone trying to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">walk 10,000 steps a day</a>.</li><li><strong>Acute Load (target icon with a triangle) or Earned Intensity Minutes (zooming stopwatch):</strong> For active athletes, it's a great way to confirm quickly how much activity you've completed this week, and if you're on track. You could also do <strong>calories burned (fire icon)</strong> if you prefer a daily number. </li><li><strong>Remaining recovery time: (+ sign surrounded by circular arrow): </strong>Quickly check pre-workout whether Garmin's algorithm thinks you're ready (or how long to wait).</li><li><strong>Heart rate (heart icon) </strong>or <strong>Stress (Bolt in figure's head):</strong> If you want a real-time look at your health metrics, elevated data can help you catch moments to do breathing exercises.</li><li><strong>Body Battery (Blue person next to circle with bolt): </strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-body-battery">Body Battery</a> is one of Garmin's most popular features for measuring your energy level for the day, making it clear how your sleep or activities are affecting you. </li><li>You can also choose <strong>Battery level</strong>, but that data is the first thing you see if you scroll down towards the widgets. I prefer seeing the <strong>weather</strong> (<strong>clouds icon</strong>) or the <strong>sunrise/sunset times</strong> (<strong>an arrow pointing at sun</strong>).</li></ul>

<p>Besides the pre-installed watch faces and default data fields, the Garmin Connect IQ app gives you access to community-made watch faces, new data fields, and an option to use personal photos as your watch face. </p><p>1. <strong>Install the Connect IQ app</strong> from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.garmin.connectiq&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank">Play Store</a> (Android) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/connect-iq-store/id1317652970" target="_blank">App Store</a> (iOS).</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Search</strong>, then <strong>Watch Faces</strong> to see all the most popular options.</p><p>3. Choose your favorites, then tap <strong>Install > Allow permissions</strong>. You can check the download progress and remaining watch face space available in the <strong>My Device</strong> tab.</p>
<p>4. Next, if you want, tap the<strong> Face It tab</strong> to create a custom watch face using a personal photo.</p><p>5. Tap the <strong>+ button</strong>, then <strong>Photos </strong>or <strong>Camera</strong>. Choose <strong>Limit Access</strong> and select the individual photo or photos you&apos;d like to see on your watch. </p><p>6. Choose a <strong>Layout</strong>, then tap <strong>+Add </strong>under Complications to add specific data fields besides the default options. You can then <strong>drag</strong> these data fields anywhere on the watch face. </p><p>7. Hit <strong>Save</strong>, name the watch face if you want, then hit <strong>Install</strong>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BHzsZaBRjNgGrAoHRHKkqi" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-showing-core-temperature-sensor-data.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 965 showing data from the CORE Body Temperature Sensor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHzsZaBRjNgGrAoHRHKkqi.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A custom data field (body temp) from Connect IQ. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While this article is about Garmin watch faces, take some time in the Connect IQ app to look at any custom, community-made apps or data fields that you may want on your watch. You&apos;ll find them in the <strong>Search </strong>tab as well. </p><p>For example, when we tested this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/core-body-temperature-sensor-thermal-load">CORE temperature sensor</a> for thermal training, you could install an "official" Connect IQ data field to show your body temp on the watch during a workout. </p><p>Once you&apos;re done, look back at your Garmin watch. You&apos;ll find your newly installed watch faces at the bottom when scrolling past the pre-installed options. As for new data fields, you can add them by going back to the <strong>Settings menu</strong>, then scrolling to <strong>Activities & Apps > Sport > Sport settings > Data screens</strong>, then finding it under <strong>Connect IQ fields</strong> when adding a new screen. </p>
<hr>
<p>Now that you know how to change your Garmin watch face, you can see how Garmin makes a bunch of data available for you to see at a glance. We do wish you could tap the data fields on your watch face to pull up a more detailed widget, as you can with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>, though. </p><p>Newer watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a> introduced a slightly revamped Garmin UI, and we can hope that more traditional smartwatch features will make their way to newer models over time now that more and more are adding AMOLED touch displays. </p>

<ul><li>After shutting down Google Podcasts for good, Google shared an interview with YouTube's chief product officer to discuss the future of podcasts on YouTube Music.</li><li>YouTube Music wants to become the "ultimate destination" for podcasts, both for creators and listeners. </li><li>Unfortunately, the interview did not include much to address concerns podcast users have with YouTube Music, such as the absence of core features like new episode notifications. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Whether we like it or not, YouTube Music is the future of podcast hosting at Google. With the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-podcasts-shuts-down">shutting down Google Podcasts</a> once and for all earlier this month, YouTube Music is Google&apos;s focus moving forward. In an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/shaping-the-future-of-podcasts/" target="_blank">interview</a> published by YouTube, the platform&apos;s Chief Product Officer Johanna Voolich explained the plan "to make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> the ultimate destination for podcasters and fans alike."</p><p>Despite podcasts being an audio-first medium, YouTube wants to lean into what it does best: video. YouTube says it has made changes to the YouTube Music app to better support audio-centric content, but it adds that video can provide extra value to a podcast. "The second way we think about podcasts is [as an] eyes-optional experience," Voolich said. "So, stuff that&apos;s great to hear and listen to, but also can be great to watch as well."</p><p>Voolich emphasized the possibility for users to start listening to a podcast and finish it by watching the video version or vice versa.</p><p>Again, leaning into its strengths, YouTube thinks the platform&apos;s experience in building algorithms will come in handy when serving suggested podcasts to users. "YouTube&apos;s secret sauce is our recommendations," said YouTube Creator Liaison Rene Ritchie in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/shaping-the-future-of-podcasts/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. "They help people discover something new or go deeper on what they love, while helping podcasters reach new audiences only found on YouTube."</p><p>Aside from the typical features offered by YouTube, Voolich emphasized the changes that have been made to YouTube Music specifically for the benefit of podcasters and listeners. "We&apos;ve rolled out several new features including support for third-party RSS podcasts, updates to the Android Auto experience for easy in-car listening, enhanced download options, and customizable playlist sorting," the blog post added.</p>

<p>However, the interview didn&apos;t address some of the major concerns that YouTube Music users have had with enjoying podcasts on the platform. There were few clear mentions of the platform&apos;s future plans, with the only notable one being that YouTube Music is not planning to support RSS out feeds anytime soon.</p><p>"Over the past year, we&apos;ve been working to build in all of the traditional podcasting features to YouTube Music," Voolich said. "The first thing we did was actually just pull in podcast content, but then also traditional things like being able to play in a series, continue watching, [and] have a shelf for discovery."</p><p>There appears to still be a long way to go for YouTube Music. The platform still lacks essential podcast features, such as new episode notifications and mark-as-played indicators. Presumably, those features are coming, but this interview doesn&apos;t give us much in terms of a concrete roadmap as to when we can expect them.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Nothing rolls out Nothing OS 2.5.5 and OS 2.5.5.a to Phone 1 and Phone 2a, respectively.</li><li>Both bring ChatGPT integration to the devices, which require Ear and Ear a products to use new gestures.</li><li>The integration also brings new ChatGPT widgets for the home screen.</li><li>Several new features, improvements, and bug fixes come with these new firmware releases.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing rolled out a new update to the Phone 2 last week, bringing ChatGPT integration to the device. This week, the company&apos;s other two phones received the same update with Nothing OS 2.5.5.</p><p>The integration on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Phone 1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> is similar to what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-chatgpt-integration-camera-update">we have seen</a> on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a>. Users still have to install ChatGPT from the Google Play Store, after which Phone 1 and 2a users would then head to the Nothing X app to find the new gesture option to start a voice conversation with ChatGPT. The feature currently works with the Nothing Ear and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-a-review">Ear (a)</a> that were recently launched. </p><p>In the accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/9447-nothing-os-255-rolling-out-for-phone-1">community post</a>, Nothing indicates that previous audio products from the company would also incorporate the functionality soon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ykJkoWbJqk4wvouwFsrDJR" name="Nothing-phone-1-display-01.jpg" alt="The front of the Nothing phone (1)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ykJkoWbJqk4wvouwFsrDJR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Moreover, new ChatGPT widgets can be added to the home screen for easier access to the AI assistant. Nothing is further adding a new button on the screenshot and clipboard pop-up that allows users to paste content to start a conversation in the ChatGPT directly.</p><p>Aside from the ChatGPT integration, the <strong>Nothing OS 2.5.5</strong> update for the Phone 1 is significant as it brings several new features, improvements, and general fixes. The features comprise a new option to apply the Nothing Icon pack only to the Home Screen "to improve accessibility in the App Drawer." </p><p>Further, users can hold app icons while scrolling through pages on the Home Screen if they choose to reorganize icons. Phone 1 users also choose to allow Quick Settings to show up on the Lock Screen. Additionally, they can customize icons on the status bar through Display settings.</p><p>The company is also adding a RAM booster feature, although our Jerry Hildenbrand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">doesn&apos;t recommend using these</a>.</p>
<p>The other improvements with the <strong>Nothing OS 2.5.5</strong> update on the Phone 1 include the integration of an AI-powered algorithm for auto brightness. Quick Settings tiles have also been reordered as part of accessibility improvements, and the Bluetooth and volume settings experience have also been optimized for a smoother experience.</p><p>The other general fixes, per the changelog on the Phone 1 include:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed an issue where Wi-Fi would automatically disconnect.</li><li>Resolved a problem causing earbud volume to not sync with the phone's volume.</li><li>Resolved an issue where audio would not switch to a connected watch during calls when also connected to an earbud.</li><li>Fixed an issue where screenshots did not display the frame or allow entry into the editor.</li><li>Resolved a rare problem causing a lack of vibration feedback when swiping sideways to go back on the screen.</li></ul>

<p>The Phone 2a, on the other hand, receives an incremental <strong>Nothing OS 2.5.5.a</strong> build, which follows the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-phone-2a-receives-april-2024-security-patch">OS 2.5.5 update</a> that was rolled out last week. </p><p>Next to the aforementioned ChatGPT integration, the latest update brings improvements to the camera, including color consistency for the primary wide-angle camera and portrait brightness in HDR scenes that are based on user skin tones. </p><p>An abnormal noise issue in portrait mode has been fixed, and the camera app&apos;s starting performance also sees improvements, as Nothing says it had adjusted CPU scheduling strategies.</p>
<p>The other notable changes with the update to Phone 2a comprise optimizations to the visual display of battery levels in the Battery widget for the home screen. There is an enhanced power-saving mode that will keep vibrations for calls and notifications active. The AI-powered algorithm for auto-brightness is also seen on the Phone 2a.</p><p>You can read the full details about the Nothing Phone 2a update on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/9497-nothing-os-255a-rolling-out-for-phone-2a">Nothing&apos;s community forum</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Ayaneo has finally shared more details regarding its next Android gaming handheld. </li><li>The Pocket S is powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, featuring up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. </li><li>There are two versions available, with the Pocket S 1080P Edition and 1440P Advance Edition.</li><li>Ayaneo's Indiegogo campaign is underway, with "Early Bird" prices starting at either $399 or $439.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Before the calendar flipped into 2024, Qualcomm and Ayaneo surprised us all with the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-reveal-teaser">Pocket S</a>. After a few teasers here and there, but nothing substantial being shared, that&apos;s all changed. Ayaneo has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ayaneo.com/article/828">officially shared</a> the full spec sheet, along with pricing.</p><p>Nothing has changed in that the Pocket S will still be powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2. However, it turns out that there Ayaneo is planning to launch two versions, the 1080P Edition and 1440P Advance Edition. The only difference between the two will be the screen resolution, but everything else remains the same.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="khd8uAnLAYQKaxjAr8smTh" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-breakdown.jpeg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket S highlighted specs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/khd8uAnLAYQKaxjAr8smTh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ayaneo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you might suspect, the 1080P Edition features a 6-inch "Borderless" IPS display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. The Advance Edition includes the same screen size but with an increased resolution of 2560 x 1440 for a higher pixel density and clearer picture. Surprisingly, there was no mention made of whether either model will offer refresh rates above 60Hz. </p>

<p>Paired with the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, Ayaneo is offering either 12GB or 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of expandable storage. If you opt for the 512GB or 1TB model, the Pocket S utilizes UFS 4.0, while the 128GB version relies on the older UFS 3.1 standard. </p>

<p>What all this means in terms of performance is kind of subjective. According to Ayaneo, the G3x Gen 2 offers 30% more CPU performance, while "GPU performance is doubled" compared to the G3x Gen 1. Ayaneo also claims that this chip will allow the Pocket S to "achieve a maximum continuous performance output of 15W."</p><p>Moving onto the design, it&apos;s about what you might expect, basically offering an Android-powered Nintendo Switch without removable controllers. The Pocket S has a few extra features that might surprise you, as it includes Hall Sensing Joysticks and Linear Hall Triggers. These are preferred amongst <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handheld</a> owners, as they are magnetic and reduce the likelihood of dealing with stick drift.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FLYBgxvcTJzSgqWFncizni" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-white-product-render.jpeg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket S product lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FLYBgxvcTJzSgqWFncizni.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ayaneo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s pretty obvious that Ayaneo is going for elegance with the Pocket S, a far cry from the "retro" theme that was offered with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocked-air-android-handheld-gaming">Pocket AIR</a>. Instead of relying on a plastic shell on the front and back, the Pocket S is made from a "CNC aluminum alloy mid-frame" along with 2.5D glass on the front panel.  </p><p>Ergonomics might be a concern for some, and Ayaneo has also thought of that. The company includes a "protective shell ... incorporating ergonomic grips." And when your gaming session is done, there&apos;s a Magnetic Detachable Flip Cover that keeps the screen looking nice. </p>

<p>Now for the big question — price. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-s-snapdragon-g3x-gen2-new-android-handheld#/">Indiegogo campaign</a> is already underway, with IGG Early Bird pricing starting at either $399 for the 1080P Edition or $439 for the 1440P Advance Edition. This is for the base configuration, which includes 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. And if you want the "best of the best," you&apos;re looking at either $559 or $589, respectively.</p><p>Once the Indiegogo campaign comes to a conclusion, the retail price jumps up quite a bit for both models. With the same base configuration, the Pocket S 1080P Edition will set you back $559, while the 1440P Advance Edition comes in at $589. At the time of this writing, Ayaneo has already blown past its Indiegogo goal, and you can still get your hands on those Early Bird models. </p>

<p>Lastly, we will have to wait just a little bit longer before the Pocket S makes its way to the masses. According to Ayaneo, the 1440P Advance Edition will begin shipping sometime in the "middle of May." Meanwhile, the 1080P Edition arrives at the "end of June." </p>

<ul><li>Google's upcoming "Cubes" feature was spotted early on the Play Store and its highlight card spills what users can expect on its full arrival.</li><li>The card suggests Cubes will be the "one place" for users to interact with shows, shopping apps, food, music, and more.</li><li>The background of the card showcases its potential UI alongside "continue watching" and "continue playing" so users can get back into their activities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seemed to accidentally show off its upcoming "Cubes" feature on the Play Store, giving us a good idea of what to expect.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/25/google-play-store-cubes/">9to5Google</a>, heading into the Apps tab of the Play Store held an interesting animated card with a "continue watching" banner. Its early appearance is furthered by a paw icon, which Google typically uses to represent features in testing, and it has shown up on at least one of our devices.</p><p>The card is described as "a shortcut to what matters," alluding to a place users could enter to "watch, shop, and more in one place."</p><p>Curiously, tapping the card sends users to a page dedicated to the coming Cubes feature. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/editorial?id=mc_apps_cube_launch_fcp_updated">it&apos;s completely blank</a>. It&apos;s speculated that the page could hold Google&apos;s official reveal and details about Cubes whenever the feature rolls out.</p><p>The card cycled through examples of where users could "watch" and "shop" in Cubes. The former highlighted streaming services like Hulu, Max, and Amazon Prime, while the latter showcased shopping sites and restaurants like McDonald&apos;s.</p><p>You can see the card at the top of the screenshots below:</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:259px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:231.66%;"><img id="88jYxyMAn82NvkNeTz7aij" name="google-play-store-cubes-early-appearance.jpg" alt="A snapshot of Google's "Cubes" card making an early appearance on the Play Store." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/88jYxyMAn82NvkNeTz7aij.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="259" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:259px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:231.66%;"><img id="VD4sJNotUMo8mrjqg4LFB3" name="google-play-store-cubes-early-appearance-shoppinng-teaser.jpg" alt="The "Cubes" card on the Play Store showing food and shopping examples." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VD4sJNotUMo8mrjqg4LFB3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="259" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Further examination of the card&apos;s background revealed what the Cubes UI will likely look like upon launch. Users may find a row of options along the top, such as "Watch, Listen, Read, Games, and Shop." Imaging suggests "Listen" will throw users into podcast recommendations and even some info pulled from Spotify&apos;s "New Music Friday."</p><p>"Continue watching" and "continue playing" sections were spotted in their respective tabs, which should help users get back into what they were doing previously.</p><p>Aside from the slip-up, it&apos;s unclear when Google plans to debut Cubes officially on the Play Store.</p><p>One thing this early preview of Cubes seems to suggest is that it may not remove users from the Play Store as originally theorized. Cubes was first spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-cubes-app-play-store-code">last November</a>, and it seemed like a new app provided by the Play Store rather than an experience within the app store. While it looks like users may be able to decide which apps cooperate with Cubes for content recommendations, Google might also include a selection of "pre-selected" ones just as an introduction.</p><p>That early preview also seemingly teased the possibility of a "Social" and a more specific "Food" tab. For now, it&apos;s not clear when Cubes will officially launch, but its appearance suggests it may not be long.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube TV is offering a new deal for new users who bundle it with the NFL Sunday Ticker.</li><li>Users can save $170 on the Sunday Ticket and see their monthly bill drop by $15 for the first three months.</li><li>The NFL Sunday Ticket rewarded subscribers with unlimited simultaneous streams while at home in 2023 and introduced a monthly payment option for "most states."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube TV is kickstarting a new deal (until May 16) for those interested in grabbing an NFL Sunday Ticket subscription before the 2024 season begins.</p><p>The streaming service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/YouTubeTV/status/1783556636671414605">announced</a> its "lowest price of the year" via the YouTube TV account on X. In celebration of the NFL Draft, the company states new users can bundle the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tv.youtube.com/learn/nflsundayticket/?utm_campaign=ytnflst_social_nflst_amplification_q1_2024&utm_source=social&utm_medium=twitter&utm_content=cta">NFL Sunday Ticket</a> <em>with </em>YouTube TV to save up to $215 until May 16.</p><p>Bundling the NFL Sunday Ticket will save new users $170. After purchasing, YouTube states users&apos; monthly payments will be reduced by $15. The monthly reduction will last for the first three months.</p><p>This means users will pay around $57 for three months before YouTube TV kicks it back up to its standard $72 per month.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our best offer of the year! Save $215 when you bundle @NFL Sunday Ticket and @YouTubeTV https://t.co/Aan8KBV5XX<a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1783556636671414605">April 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The YouTube team took to X to answer some user questions regarding how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1783581748841808344">last year&apos;s subscribers could get in</a> on the deal. The post states NFL Sunday Ticket holders from 2023, who also enabled auto-renew, must cancel the auto-renewed purchase. After, users must re-purchase the subscription to take part in the deal before the May 16 cut-off.</p><p>YouTube&apos;s deal card reiterates that the Sunday Ticket is what gives users access to over 160 out-of-market games "per season." The YouTube TV side is how football lovers can get locally televised games every Sunday. Moreover, viewers can watch every Sunday and Monday night game, the 2024 preseason, playoffs, and Super Bowl.</p><p>Before 2023&apos;s kickoff, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-unlimited-nfl-streaming">YouTube highlighted</a> the addition of unlimited simultaneous streams for NFL Sunday Ticket holders. The ability to do so pertained to those watching games from home. However, those on the go gained two additional streams to tack onto their Sunday content.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth remembering that, due to user feedback, YouTube TV subscribers can set up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-teases-nfl-sunday-ticket-features">monthly payment plan</a> for the NFL subscription. This allows folks to pay at their own cadence and hop out if the price becomes overbearing. Unfortunately, the company rolled out support for monthly payments in "most states," which left a few others out of the useful option.</p>

<hr>
<p>There&apos;s a chance Samsung could pack another key health monitoring feature into the Galaxy Watch 7 later this year.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2024&no=308917">PulseNews</a> (Korean), Samsung&apos;s vice president and head of digital healthcare, Hon Pak, met with board members to discuss the future of its wearable health capabilities (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-7-may-finally-bring-blood-sugar-monitoring/">SamMobile</a>). It was reported that Pak mentioned ambitions toward plugging diabetes and blood sugar monitoring into Samsung Health.</p><p>It was also discussed that arrhythmia and hypertension could be involved.</p><p>Rumors now state Samsung could look to apply such health monitoring capabilities for blood sugar, diabetes, and more into the Galaxy Watch 7. Additionally, the publication states the Korean OEM could tout the device as an "electronic device" instead of a "medical device." SamMobile notes this could be due to a multitude of regulatory factors.</p><p>Elsewhere, Pak wants to focus more on implementing Samsung&apos;s AI technology into its Health scope, although he did not state in what ways AI could improve a user&apos;s experience with Samsung Health or wearables moving forward.</p>

<p>Current rumors seemingly go against things we&apos;ve heard previously, which suggested blood sugar monitoring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-explores-non-invasive-glucose-monitor">wouldn&apos;t arrive for a few years</a>. Hon Pak spoke about the feature earlier this year in January, stating Samsung was interested in bringing "non-invasive" glucose monitoring to its Galaxy Watch lineup. Such a method would remove the necessity of users puncturing themselves.</p><p>Pak originally stated that there was hope that the feature would arrive in the next five years. While this (obviously) puts glucose monitoring far from the Galaxy Watch 7, the latest rumors suggest it&apos;s back on the table.</p><p>For now, take this rumor with a pinch of salt until Samsung says officially.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-bluetooth-certification">specifications for the upcoming</a> Galaxy Watch 7 leaked earlier this month. Appearing for its Bluetooth SIG certification, the watch may feature Bluetooth 5.3 support like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">its predecessor</a>. Consumers might have three models to choose from for the Galaxy Watch 7 alongside the possibility of an on-device storage boost to around 32GB.</p><p>Rumors purport Samsung could hold its Unpacked event even earlier this year on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">July 10 in Pairs, France</a>. We&apos;ll likely see the brand unravel the Watch 7 series there alongside other devices.</p>

<ul><li>New promotional images of the Pixel 8a leak ahead of Google I/O event.</li><li>It confirms the device’s Tensor G3 chipset, IP67 rating, and other notable AI features.</li><li>The Pixel 8a is also confirmed to come with a seven-year security update promise, just like the Pixel 8 series.</li><li>In addition to images, a promo video has also been leaked.</li></ul>

<p>The Pixel 8a launch is likely just around the corner as we approach Google I/O 2024, and a new leak spills the beans on what we can expect from the device.</p><p>The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-8a-renders-leak-features">Android Headlines</a>, which shares additional new renders of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> in all colors — the Obsidian, Porcelain, Mint, and Bay — along with the accompanying cases and some promotional images of the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range Android phone</a> from Google. </p>

<p>Some of the popular Pixel’s signature AI features can be seen on the upcoming Pixel 8a, including “Best Take,” which combines similar photos into one. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a>, which can extract sounds from videos, is also coming to the upcoming handset. Other features include Night Sight, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a>, and more.</p><p>Per the promotional images, the other notable things to expect from the Pixel 8a include the incorporation of Google Tensor G3 and fast charging support up to 30W.</p>

<p>Additionally, the phone will include an IP67 rating, the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, meaning it should be relatively safe from slips, spills, and dust. Like the Pixel 8 series, the Pixel 8a also appears to have seven years of security updates, per the promotional images, which is quite impressive for a mid-range phone.</p><p>To corroborate the images, reliable leaker @Onleaks has also provided a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/google-pixel-8a-promo-video-exclusive/">promotional video</a> of the Pixel 8a that showcases the aforementioned features as well as the phone&apos;s design.</p>
<p>Lastly, while we expect the device to be unveiled at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O 2024</a>, Android Headlines hints at the sale to take place on May 16, citing the date showcased on the home screen of the Pixel 8a on the shared marketing material.</p><p>The latest promotional material leak follows the live <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-live-images-show-mint-and-bay-colors">hands-on video</a> from early this week, showcasing the Pixel 8a in striking Blue and Mint hues.</p>

This has been my first experience with such a device — as I decided against the Humane AI Pin and have yet to grab the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review" target="_blank">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> — and I have a few thoughts on my first day with it.</p><p>That&apos;s not to say that I haven&apos;t dabbled with AI as I continue to tinker with a combination of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-one-year-later">ChatGPT</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>, and Perplexity. But the Rabbit R1 intrigued me for a few reasons, namely the much lower price compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/humanes-ai-pin-will-work-with-google-photos-and-contacts">AI Pin</a>, along with the idea of having a smart device without relying on apps.</p>
<h2 id="the-rabbit-r1-is-incredibly-sleek-2">The Rabbit R1 is incredibly sleek</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CZinrVGKGjbA9DrGS3SV9M" name="close-up-rabbit-r1-logo.jpg" alt="Close-up on the Rabbit R1 logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CZinrVGKGjbA9DrGS3SV9M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By now, you&apos;ve probably seen at least an unboxing or two, but I have to point out how sleek and elegant it really is. It&apos;s about as minimal as it gets. Seriously, all you&apos;ll find inside the cardboard box is the R1 being held in place by a transparent carrying case. Rabbit doesn&apos;t even include a charging cable, although that probably won&apos;t be much of an issue for many.</p><p>Okay, with the R1 out of the box, I have to admit that despite the plastic build, it&apos;s an extremely elegant design. Outside of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, the only other device to invoke a sense of appreciation was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a>, which Teenage Engineering also had a hand in designing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Emsedp6BXudknccS482YEN" name="rabbit-r1-nothing-phone-2-2.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 next to Nothing Phone 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Emsedp6BXudknccS482YEN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the outside of the clear case is a QR code that you&apos;ll need to scan to get the R1 set up. Unlike some other R1 owners I know, I didn&apos;t have any issues creating a Rabbit account and attaching it to my R1. After connecting it to my home Wi-Fi network, there was a day-one update, and it immediately started to download.</p><p>In the meantime, I perused the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hole.rabbit.tech/journal/details">rabbithole</a>," a web portal for connecting the likes of Spotify, Uber, DoorDash, and Midjourney to the R1. It&apos;s also home for your "journal," where your various interactions will appear. This is actually a pretty cool concept, although I do wish there was an accompanying app.</p>
<h2 id="putting-the-r1-to-the-test-2">Putting the R1 to the test</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PyFrrdb6Rjkajnucyd5BCR" name="rabbit-r1-miyoo-mini-plus-game-boy-advance-sp.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 next to Miyoo Mini Plus and Game Boy Advance SP" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PyFrrdb6Rjkajnucyd5BCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Enough of all of the mundane stuff. Now for the "fun" stuff. Although I watched the initial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22wlLy7hKP4">announcement keynote</a>, I haven&apos;t paid much attention to the R1 otherwise. I didn&apos;t even watch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDTXzrEMEQQ">Live Unboxing</a> from a special event in NYC, meaning I&apos;ve gone into this thing somewhat blind.</p><p>After the update was finished, the first thing I did was ask the R1 a few basic questions.</p>
<ul><li>Who won the Orioles game yesterday?</li><li>When is the next Capitals game?</li><li>What's the weather going to be tomorrow?</li></ul>
<p>A few moments later, the R1 responded, answering the first two questions correctly, complete with the score of the Orioles game and the time of the Capitals game. When asked about the weather, I was surprised to see the screen light up with an hourly forecast. I expected a three or five-day overview, but I was okay with the hourly breakdown as it was another excuse to make use of the scroll wheel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="M6zxwkWkqnruE2zyF5GpVC" name="weather-forecast-rabbit-r1.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 weather forecast" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M6zxwkWkqnruE2zyF5GpVC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Those are menial questions that I could&apos;ve asked Siri or Gemini about, so we can say that the R1 succeeds in the mundane. But this thing has a camera and its "Vision" mode can essentially act as a standalone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-google-lens-google-photos">Google Lens</a> device.</p><p>I double-clicked the side button, pointed it at the back my iPhone 15 Pro Max, and asked "What model iPhone is this?" I chuckled to myself as the R1 told me that it&apos;s "an iPhone 13 Pro based on the camera layout and design of the device shown in the image."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The R1 mistaking the iPhone 15 Pro Max for an iPhone 13 Pro is genuinely hilarious. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>From there, I wanted to see if I could actually use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.midjourney.com/explore">Midjourney</a> integration. Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to get the R1 to actually take advantage of this feature. Instead, I&apos;ve been met with messages such as "Apologies, there was an error generating an image. It may be due to maintenance or login issues." I&apos;ve seen that others have been able to use Midjourney on the R1, so I&apos;m not really sure what&apos;s going on here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="vx3szA693pWtxFHKPmofqP" name="rabbit-r1-vision.jpg" alt="Vision mode on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vx3szA693pWtxFHKPmofqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the bright side, I have been able to take advantage of another integration, using the Rabbit R1 as a Spotify controller. First, I just asked it to play some John Mayer, and within a few moments, it started playing "Gravity" from Mayer&apos;s "Continuum" album.</p><p>It shouldn&apos;t come as too much of a surprise, but the speakers aren&apos;t exactly going to fill the room. However, since the R1 includes Bluetooth, I decided to pair a set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> with it so I could walk around listening to music. It works pretty well, as long as you don&apos;t want to adjust the volume or skip tracks from the R1.</p>

<p>That&apos;s because you can only change the volume on the R1 itself from the Settings menu. I assumed that just using the scroll wheel would work, but I found that nothing happened. I couldn&apos;t even adjust the volume from my earbuds while the music was playing. Hopefully, this is just an oversight and something that Rabbit solves.</p><p>In terms of just pairing your earbuds to the R1, the process is pretty easy. Shake the R1 a couple of times in your hand to open the Settings panel, scroll down and open the Bluetooth menu, enable Bluetooth, and then select your earbuds from the list. </p>

<p>Part of me keeps asking myself why I bothered to spend money on such a device when the smartphone in my pocket can already do everything this does and more. Part of it has to do with the idea of the Rabbit R1 being part of a new product category. While being on the "ground floor" has its benefits, it&apos;s clear that the R1 isn&apos;t quite as polished as it was initially shown to be.</p><p>For instance, I asked the R1 to set a timer for me to get my son&apos;s bottle off of the warmer. The R1 told me it couldn&apos;t do that. I then asked the R1 to remind me to take the trash out. It told me that it couldn&apos;t do that either. So, while it&apos;s cool that you can order DoorDash or use it as a cloud-based MP3 player, I kind of hoped that the "basics" would have been covered.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You can't even set a timer with the Rabbit R1, which is just mind-boggling.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s the battery life, and man oh man, is it abysmal. Supposedly, there&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/jessechenglyu/status/1783623002258649236" target="_blank">already an update planned</a> that will "make further improvements." But, even with a 95% charge out of the box, I had to recharge the R1 twice on the first day. Then, I went to bed, leaving the R1 on my desk in another room with about 75% battery, came back the next morning, and it was completely out of juice. Mind you, that&apos;s just with it being connected to Wi-Fi, as I&apos;ve yet to put a spare SIM card in it.</p>

<p>I&apos;ll save my thoughts on product launches and updates for another day, but I&apos;m <em>really, really</em> hoping that Rabbit can stay on top of software updates to expand its usefulness. I have a vague idea of where the R1 will fit into my daily lifestyle, but it&apos;s just not there yet.</p><p>Speaking of which, the company already has a slew of features it plans to add, as I noticed in a tweet from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/HyanRaines/status/1782935825489023078/photo/1" target="_blank">Ryan Haines of Android Authority</a>. The list includes obvious features such as alarms, calendars, and contacts, but there&apos;s much more on the roadmap. I just have to keep my fingers crossed that Rabbit follows through and doesn&apos;t just abandon the R1 in favor of whatever it wants to build next.</p>
