                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While I prefer using Android phones, I turn to the iPad whenever I need a bigger screen. I used most models released in the last ten years, and while my go-to has been the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/ipad-pro-2022-productivity">iPad Pro 12.9</a> over the last 12 months, I switched to the 13-inch iPad Pro M4 two months ago, and it is nothing short of incredible.</p><p>I&apos;ve always wanted an iPad with an OLED panel, and the iPad Pro M4 delivers on that front. Thanks to a tandem OLED — where two OLED panels are sandwiched together — you get the best of both worlds: outstanding color fidelity, and increased brightness levels. If you&apos;re using an iPad and are mulling an upgrade, the iPad Pro M4 is the ideal choice, and thanks to Black Friday, it&apos;s finally on sale — the 11-inch model is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC">down to $849 on Amazon</a> (by using a $50 coupon), and the 13-inch variant is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J98W75">available for $1,099</a>, a $200 discount.</p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2fe86bc3-feeb-4f5d-815d-043cc5ca78a1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$849 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$849 at Amazon" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="8x6oWanY7Dn7CcoPRohR5b" name="apple ipad pro m4.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8x6oWanY7Dn7CcoPRohR5b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Apple iPad Pro M4 11-inch: </strong><del><strong>$999</strong></del><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC" data-dimension112="2fe86bc3-feeb-4f5d-815d-043cc5ca78a1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$849 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$849 at Amazon"><strong>$849 at Amazon</strong></a></p>
<p>The iPad Pro M4 isn't just the best iPad ever made — it's also one of the best Apple products I've used. You'll need to hold the tablet to understand just how sleek the design is, and the M4 hardware runs rings around any other tablet available today. Obviously, the OLED panel is the biggest reason to get the iPad Pro M4, and even from the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the difference is startling. And with a $150 discount, now is the best time to make the switch.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2fe86bc3-feeb-4f5d-815d-043cc5ca78a1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$849 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$849 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>The 11-inch model is great by itself, but I got used to a bigger screen, so I went with the 13-inch iPad Pro M4. It has the distinction of being even thinner than the 11-inch model, and it is a joy to hold and use. Honestly, this is the best iPad you can get right now, and while it still costs a sizeable amount of cash, a $200 discount makes it a smidgen more accessible.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J98W75" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="25faf878-a378-4545-8e01-104111d0f422" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$1,099 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You&apos;ve been waiting to switch to an OLED iPad. The iPad Pro M4 has a lot of other upgrades, but the OLED screen is the headlining addition this year, and it makes using the tablet that much more enjoyable.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don&apos;t need an OLED panel. If you&apos;re just looking for a reliable iPad, I&apos;d suggest going with the iPad Air — that model is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J617D7">down to $499</a> now for the 11-inch version and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J6RTCT">$699 for the 13-inch option</a>.</p>

<p>The OLED panel makes the iPad Pro M4 that much more enticing; it&apos;s a definite visual upgrade, and I found my usage increasing after switching to this model. The M2 is plenty fast, but the latest M4 silicon is in a league of its own, and it does a fantastic job with gaming in general. You get other niceties; the front camera&apos;s positioning is much better, you get 256GB of storage as standard on the base model, and it has great battery life.</p><p>I like the 13-inch model as it has greater screen real estate and doesn&apos;t take up too much room, and it is even thinner. The sleek design is a big differentiator this year, and the new Pencil Pro (now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J71RM7">down to $94</a>) makes sketching on the device an absolute joy. You can also get the tablet with an anti-glare coating, and as always, there&apos;s cellular connectivity that costs an additional $200. Oh, and Apple Intelligence is going live shortly, so you&apos;ll get a whole suite of exciting AI-backed features on the tablet.</p><p>Switching to the 13-inch iPad Pro M4 from the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with the M2, the three biggest differences are the OLED panel, location of the front camera, and thinner design. If you&apos;re using an older iPad and considering an upgrade, the iPad Pro M4 is an instant recommendation — particularly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC">now that it is down to $849</a>.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want one of the best Chromebooks that money can buy, even if you could care less about the RGB and gaming-centric design.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a Chromebook with a touchscreen or a convertible design.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-516-ge-review">Chromebook 516 GE</a> is powered by the Intel Core i5-1240P, paired with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. This makes for an impressive combination, especially when you remember that you can actually install Steam on here.</p><p>Only having 256GB of storage limits the number of games that you can install, but that's where cloud gaming comes in. This is one area that the Chromebook 516 GE excels, as you can enjoy the likes of NVIDIA GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://luna.amazon.com/home">Amazon Luna</a>, and other services.</p><p>Although Acer has released the Chromebook Plus 516 GE, it's more of an iterative update than anything else. Plus, it's not currently on sale, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Chromebook-2560x1600-i5-1240P-LPDDR4X-CBG516-1H-53TD/dp/B0CV61RWHF">making this an easy recommendation</a> for Black Friday.</p>

It went from an incredibly complicated mess of expensive PCs, wires everywhere, and hours of configuration to the simplicity of a console in that timespan, and now VR is finally in a place where anyone can pick up and play anytime they want.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">AC thVRsday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC" name="ac-thvrsday-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="AC thVRsday logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">weekly column</a>, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more.</p></div></div>
<p>Of course, I'm talking about a system like the Meta Quest 3S or the Meta Quest 3, both of which offer next-gen mobile computing in an easy-to-use package. If you weren't already aware, these systems are identical to a console like a Nintendo Switch, letting you pick up and play at any time without needing an IT degree.</p><p>Heck, it's even easier and cheaper than a PlayStation 5 since you don't need to hook it up to a TV or PC. Plus, this has been the single greatest year for VR gaming releases in the history of the medium, with big names like Metro, Batman, Alien, Skydance's Behemoth, Assassin's Creed, and plenty more.</p><p>Value-wise, there's simply no better holiday shopping deal than picking up a Meta Quest 3S during Black Friday week. In addition to retailers like Amazon including a $75 gift card — let's face it, an Amazon gift card is basically cash in 2024 — you also get Batman Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta Quest+ for free. As Patrick pointed out, that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/heads-up-this-black-friday-meta-quest-3s-deal-gives-you-over-usd140-worth-of-free-stuff-im-not-kidding"><strong>over $140 worth of free stuff</strong></a>.</p><p>Good console hardware is only as good as the games that are on it, but,  thankfully, the Quest has most of the all-time best VR games and many of the best games of the generation. Better yet, lots of these are games you probably didn't know existed, and what's more fun than trying something <em>completely</em> new, especially in the land of gaming where so many things are derivative? Nothing, that's what.</p>

<p>Some people play games to escape their problems. Some play them to experience a good story or to do things they can't in real life. Others play games just to have fun or to unwind. The Meta Quest offers all of these things and does them in new ways that feel tangibly different from traditional gaming.</p><p>You've probably heard of the immersion factor of VR by now and while it seems like a trope, it really isn't. There's a reason you see those videos on the news of people jumping into TVs when they try Richie's Plank Experience for the first time. VR transports you into the game, and that's something unique you won't get by sitting on a couch.</p><p>But that angle has been overplayed because it's simply not something you can understand unless you experience it, so instead of focusing on that, let's go the best VR games released in the last year.</p>

<p>At the tail-end of 2023, Assasin's Creed Nexus debuted as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review">the best Assassin's Creed game</a> in over a decade. It channels everything that's great about the series: great stealth mechanics, plenty of scenario variety with three playable characters over three timelines, and an intriguing story that weaves everything together.</p><p>It's a masterpiece, and the series' trademark mechanics work <em>perfectly</em> from a first-person perspective, including a brilliant parkour engine that makes it easy to feel like a master assassin.</p><p>Right afterward, we got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/asgards-wrath-2-review">Asgard's Wrath 2</a>, a game that channels classic 3D Zelda games in a 100+ hour-long adventure that gets new content every few months. It's the sequel to one of the highest-rated PCVR games of all time and delivers a world that's bigger, better, and bolder than the original in every way. Combat is visceral, the clever puzzles make you feel smart when you solve them, and the world is constantly interesting as you move between playable characters and realms of existence.</p>

<p>This year we've had even more to play, but the most recent titles are among the very best you'll find on any system in 2024. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> is the first true Arkham game in a decade, letting you play through the eyes of Batman in a story that takes place between Arkham Origins and Arkham Asylum.</p><p>After an epically gripping four-chapter prologue filled with emotion, action, and detective work, players are thrust into the Metroidvania-style Blackgate Prison to unravel the mystery of the Rat King and stop the Day of Destruction. You'll switch between Batman himself and a new prisoner of Blackgate, lending plenty of variety in a 12+ hour campaign. New Game+ is coming in January, too, so finding all those secrets will be even better.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metro-awakening-review">Metro Awakening</a> is the first built-for-VR game in the Metro universe by the makers of the excellent Arizona Sunshine series. As with any good Metro game, this one's as much a horror game as it is a first-person shooter. You'll play as a doctor trying to help his wife overcome the pain of losing a child, only to uncover the horrors that lie within the depths of the metro and become something totally unexpected.</p>

<p>Every week, I meet up with a group of friends to hang out and play some games together. Usually, we're facing off in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/breachers-is-the-best-multiplayer-quest-game-ive-ever-played">Breachers</a>, a 5v5 Rainbow Six-like shooter that pits Enforcers against Revolters with traps, destructible walls, rappelling, and plenty of fun. It's a joy to join the crew every week and it feels like we're there in the same room together even though none of us live anywhere near each other.</p><p>It goes back to that whole "immersion" thing I mentioned earlier, and it's part of what makes multiplayer gaming in VR so special.</p><p>I also occasionally jump back into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/developer-post/1548271679142026/">Population: One</a>, the free-to-play battle royale that feels amazing in VR thanks to its VR-centric mechanics. You can climb anything, glide anywhere, and generally feel like a superhero because of it. The game just launched a fun seasonal Turkeys vs Pilgrims event and always does something special for the holiday season, so stay tuned for that if you're a player.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LmZETihvWesXXkaMvvQaH9" name="dungeons-of-eternity-official-screenshot-04.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of Dungeons of Eternity for Meta Quest" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LmZETihvWesXXkaMvvQaH9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Othergate)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Closer to home, I regularly play games like Dungeons of Eternity <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/you-should-play-more-video-games-with-your-kids">with my son</a> in between bouts of Minecraft on the Switch or Steam Deck. It's fun to delve into new worlds in Minecraft but there's something special about diving into a dungeon with a more physical persona.</p><p>I've written about the joy of Dungeons of Eternity several times and named it my favorite multiplayer game of 2023, and the game has seen some notable updates this year, keeping it fresh and enjoyable. This year's best multiplayer game is, undoutedbly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/contractors-showdown-meta-quest-3">Contractors: Showdown</a> for me. It's a full-fledged Call of Duty Warzone or PUBG competitor, all with the unique movement and gun handling that's only possible in VR.</p><p>And then there's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/one-year-later-mixed-reality-games-are-booming">bevy of mixed reality games</a> that have come out this year. Mixed reality is a new concept that only makes sense with a headset like the Quest 3 or Quest 3S because of its color cameras which let you still see the room around you even with the headset on. It's straight up amazing, especially now that developers have figured out new types of games to make with the new medium.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2DpFoYBAeymaDcqF4FQZUQ" name="contractors-showdown-screenshot-01.jpg" alt="An official screenshot of the island in Contractors Showdown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2DpFoYBAeymaDcqF4FQZUQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Caveman Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lots of people flock to titles like Resonite, VR Chat, and even Horizon Worlds as well, which are more social-first hubs with gaming worlds inside. Meta even rebranded the Quest app on phones to the "Meta Horizon" app to further promote its Roblox-like title (Horizon Worlds), but I'm not super keen on these experiences.</p><p>Still, these games are some of the biggest primary traffic drivers of VR content and get people to come back regularly every day. The most successful VR game to date is arguably Gorilla Tag with over $100 million in revenue, and the group that made it is already hard at work on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gorilla-tag-creator-talks-new-game-orion-drift">next generation of social VR games</a>.</p>

<p>If you've been playing games for a few decades like me, you'll probably remember when games went from 2D to 3D and changed everything. The Meta Quest feels exactly like that and delivers both virtual reality AND mixed reality in one headset, opening up two worlds that you probably haven't properly experienced before, even if you've used an older VR headset.</p><p>There's something for everyone here, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oculus-quest-2-games">best Meta Quest games</a> show the depth and variety of the thousands of games that are available on the platform.

<p>The biggest appeal of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is pretty obvious. It sports a massive 14.6-inch AMOLED display, making it a great laptop replacement, portable gaming machine, or just a way to lay back and watch your favorite movies.</p><p>Samsung did throw everyone for a bit of a loop, as the company's flagship tablet lineup is now powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 9300+ chip. This is a major deviation from the norm, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-vs-tab-s9-ultra">Samsung has previously relied on</a> the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon processor.</p><p>As a result, Samsung claims that the Dimensity 9300 Plus offers an 18% boost in CPU performance and a 28% jump in GPU performance over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. It also helps that the Tab S10 Ultra is paired with either 12GB or 16GB of RAM, while also being available with up to 1TB of expandable storage.</p><p>While some might be put off by the sheer size of the Tab S10 Ultra's display, we highly recommend at least checking it out first. When paired with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-cases">Samsung's Book Cover Keyboard</a> it transforms this tablet into quite an impressive laptop replacement, especially with Samsung DeX just a button press away.</p>

Unfortunately, it came at a price that was a bit too high for me to recommend. Thankfully, Black Friday is bringing the price to new lows, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D18MZ48T">slashing more than $300 off the Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> in a deal that is hard for me not to recommend.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> retails for $1099, which is actually $100 more than its predecessor. That's a tough pill to swallow when other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> cost less and are just as good. However, with this Black Friday discount, you can grab Samsung's best flip phone for just $799, which is the cheapest we've seen since the phone launched in July.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You like Samsung phones and are interested in getting a modern flip phone with access to Galaxy AI features.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a telephoto camera or would prefer the Motorola Razr Plus 2024.</p>
<p>I'll be honest; the Galaxy Z Flip 6 isn't my <em>favorite</em> flip phone of the year. That crown goes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, which is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hurry-the-motorola-razr-plus-crashes-to-its-lowest-price-ever-again-during-best-buys-black-friday-sale">on sale for Black Friday</a>. However, as much as I prefer the Razr, the Z Flip 6 is my <em>second</em> favorite, and it has a lot going for it that you might prefer over Motorola's flip phone. For example, it has a more powerful and capable Snapdragon chip, the camera system includes a more versatile ultrawide sensor (as opposed to telephoto), and Samsung handles software much better, with plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">AI features</a> and timely updates for the next seven years.</p><p>You also get a wider and better selection of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cases">Galaxy Z Flip 6 cases</a> to help give your phone some style.</p><p>If you're new to modern flip phones, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a great phone to buy at this price. The cover screen makes it easy to take selfies, respond to notifications, or even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">use apps without opening your phone</a>. And who doesn't miss the feeling of dramatically closing your phone shut to end a conversation? The Razr Plus 2024 may be the better buy on any regular day, but now that these phones are roughly the same price, you might wanna pull the trigger on the more powerful Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p>

<p>Whether you're upgrading to a new Android phone from an older device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-from-iphone-to-pixel-after-12-years">or an iPhone</a>, these are the top things to do to make this new device your own. While every Android manufacturer offers slightly different options and settings, the items included here should apply to most (if not all) devices. Let's get started.</p>

<h2 id="1-uninstall-unwanted-apps-2">1. Uninstall unwanted apps</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.75%;"><img id="iqHK4F6MXn4hhPuf62aLj7" name="samsung-galaxy-a50-bloat.jpg" alt="Galaxy A50 bloatware" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iqHK4F6MXn4hhPuf62aLj7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="534" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>An unfortunate part of owning an Android phone is dealing with bloatware, which is simply a term use to refer to all the unwanted or unneeded apps that are pre-installed on your smartphone. Your phone manufacturer may include bloatware apps; Samsung phones often ship with duplicate apps (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wants-you-to-move-to-google-messages-and-its-for-the-best">like Samsung Messages and Google Messages</a>) and mobile games pre-installed. Additionally, your cellular carrier may pre-install apps on your phone, usually all in their own folder — AT&T is notorious for doing this.</p><p>Unnecessary apps can slow down your phone and take up valuable storage space. Some of them are glorified advertisements, plain and simple. To remove them all, open the <strong>Settings app</strong> on your Android phone and tap the <strong>Apps</strong> tab. This will bring up your entire apps list, and you can select each one to <strong>Delete</strong> or <strong>Disable </strong>them individually. Note that some apps can't be deleted, and can only be disabled.</p>
<h2 id="2-customize-your-quick-settings-2">2. Customize your Quick Settings</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uwSYtRtFWLwH6LYYF8SGvX" name="oneplus-12-oxygenos-15-split-notification-quick-toggles" alt="The new split quick toggle option in OxygenOS 15 on a OnePlus 12" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uwSYtRtFWLwH6LYYF8SGvX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you want to excel at using your new Android phone, you'll need to know how to use <strong>Quick Settings</strong>. That's the name for the collection of quick toggles and shortcuts that become available when you swipe down from the top of your screen. These toggles are arranged in a default order and span two pages, but it's a good idea to reorder them to match your specific needs. To do so, open the Quick Settings page and tap the <strong>pencil icon</strong>. Here, you can edit your Quick Settings to make it more useful to you.</p>
<h2 id="3-choose-between-gesture-or-button-navigation-2">3. Choose between gesture or button navigation</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3911px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dijTVbuGxaiJWEtY2xkPFD" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-gesture-navigation-bar.jpg" alt="The gesture navigation bar on the Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dijTVbuGxaiJWEtY2xkPFD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3911" height="2200" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new Android debate: three-button navigation or gesture navigation? Though many longtime Android fans still have an affinity with three-button navigation, which adds a persistent back button, home button, and app switcher button, most people have moved to gesture navigation. This makes it a popular choice, as you can swipe to control your phone without sacrificing screen real estate. Whichever you prefer, you can select it by navigating to <strong>Settings > Display > Navigation mode</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="4-choose-a-custom-launcher-or-stick-with-the-default-2">4. Choose a custom launcher (or stick with the default)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.07%;"><img id="k3vyKFL2s5ooSugzRFpYUY" name="how-to-change-app-icon-with-nova-launcher-1.jpg" alt="How to change an app icon with Nova Launcher" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k3vyKFL2s5ooSugzRFpYUY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2400" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that stock Android skins are mature, third-party launchers aren't as popular as they once were. However, one of the perks of using an Android phone is the ability to replace or tweak your launcher. To do so, download a launcher from the Google Play store and make it your default launcher app in settings. Or, you can modify your default launcher, like by tweaking the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-at-a-glance-widget-could-help-you-follow-sports-scores-on-your-pixel">At a Glance widget in Pixel Launcher</a>.</p>
<h2 id="5-get-started-with-digital-wellbeing-2">5. Get started with Digital Wellbeing</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1386px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="3JQmZw9ZHVFSncz9Hf2wEL" name="Digital Wellbeing-2.jpg" alt="Digital Wellbeing widget on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3JQmZw9ZHVFSncz9Hf2wEL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1386" height="780" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking to curb your screen time? Give <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-will-tell-you-just-how-long-youve-been-scrolling-with-new-screen-time-reminders">Digital Wellbeing</a> a try. It's a suite of Android features that will help you stay in the moment and improve your mindfulness. You can set up a Focus mode to tune out unwanted notifications, set screen time limits or get "nudges" when you're using an app for too long, or use Heads Up to be reminded about safety when using your phone while walking. However you use Digital Wellbeing, it's a good idea to explore its features before letting your Android phone's screen time get out of hand.</p>
<h2 id="6-customize-your-always-on-display-settings-2">6. Customize your always-on display settings</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="fL4JHpkEMBqwgeppX4AHag" name="oxygenos-11-3.jpg" alt="OxygenOS 11 Always-on Display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fL4JHpkEMBqwgeppX4AHag.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many of the best Android phones include an always-on display mode, which shows key information — like time, date, and notification badges — on the lock screen when it's turned off. The exact options available will depend on your phone's OEM, but there are usually ways to tweak your always-on display. For starters, all Android phone makers with an AOD option will let you turn it off, which will help save battery. Otherwise, you can set AOD schedules and determine what appears on your lock screen in your display settings menu.</p>
<h2 id="7-set-up-auto-deletion-for-otps-2">7. Set up auto-deletion for OTPs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZFY5hHi5rtkBtfrzn8qAtn" name="pixel-google-messages-oops.jpg" alt="Pixel Google Messages Oops" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZFY5hHi5rtkBtfrzn8qAtn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If your Android phone has Google Message set as its default SMS app, there's a useful feature you should enable. (If Google Messages isn't the default, you can install it manually from the Google Play Store and set it as the default SMS app in Settings).

That's right — you can link your new Android phone to your computer to send and receive texts from your PC, make calls, share photos and files, mirror and remotely control your phone, and much more. It's all done via the Microsoft Phone Link app on Windows 11 and the Link to Windows app on Android. It's certainly worth taking a few minutes to set up, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-your-phone-android-what-it-and-how-does-it-work">we have a full guide explaining how here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-black-friday-2">When is Black Friday?</h2>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday-2024">Black Friday 2024</a> falls on the day after Thanksgiving, November 29th, but that doesn't mean you need to wait to find great deals. Many retailers have launched their Black Friday sales early, so we're gathering all of the best early deals so you can beat the crowds and take it easy when the big day arrives.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-shop-on-black-friday-or-cyber-monday-2">Should I shop on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? </h2>
<p>The biggest discounts on devices such as smartphones, TVs, and video game consoles usually go live on Black Friday, while Cyber Monday is typically a better time to purchase smaller items like accessories and smart home tech. With that being said, some devices will sell out before Monday hits, so don't wait to buy if something catches your eye.</p>
<h2 id="what-samsung-deals-can-i-expect-during-black-friday-2">What Samsung deals can I expect during Black Friday? </h2>
<p>If Amazon's recent Prime Day sale (aka Big Deal Days) is any indication, you can expect the return of record-breaking discounts on the Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6, and the latest lineup of Samsung smartwatches. Samsung smart TVs are also likely to receive some major discounts, and if we're lucky, we might see the first batch of price drops on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> and Galaxy Tab S10 series of tablets.</p>

<h2 id="which-retailer-has-the-best-black-friday-samsung-deals-2">Which retailer has the best Black Friday Samsung deals?</h2>
<p>It depends on what you're looking for! Pretty much every retailer under the sun will be launching holiday sales as we approach Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend, so you'll want to be vigilant and look around before committing to one retailer (or you could simply bookmark Androidcentral.com for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">comprehensive deal coverage</a>).</p><p>That being said, if you are hoping to buy unlocked Samsung devices, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart will probably be your best bet. If you're willing to make a trade-in or update your wireless service, consider checking with your phone carrier or Samsung itself to see what offers are available.</p>

<p>One of the biggest surprises we've seen this holiday shopping season has been the absolutely outrageous discounts on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch Ultra. These two top-rated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> have only been out since July and yet they've already received historic discounts during Amazon's early Black Friday sale.</p><p>Will the price drop even further as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday? Only time will tell, but I certainly wouldn't wait to place your order if you're interested.</p>
<h2 id="when-will-black-friday-sales-start-2">When will Black Friday sales start?</h2>
<p>The Black Friday sales have pretty much already begun. In the coming days, you'll see retailers across the web launching sales to get shoppers ready for the holiday season — the big question is whether these offers will improve as we near November 29th. Needless to say, if you're looking for a Samsung deal this holiday season, bookmark this page: I'll keep updating this guide with new offers as they go live.</p>

<h2 id="should-you-buy-galaxy-devices-directly-from-samsung-2">Should you buy Galaxy devices directly from Samsung?</h2>
<p>Samsung typically runs a big sale during Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend, but the offers on display usually involve a lot of fine print to get the max savings.</p><p>It seems like the site has learned its lesson this year, however, as Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/"><strong>Black Friday deals</strong></a> have never been as good as this.</p><p>The offers I've seen so far from the Korean OEM easily rival retailers like Best Buy and Amazon. For example, you can currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-512gb-unlocked-sm-f956udbexaa/"><strong>score $800 off the Galaxy Z Fold 6</strong></a> when you buy the phone unlocked in select colors, while the unlocked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24-ultra/buy/galaxy-s24-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s928ulbfxaa/"><strong>Galaxy S24 Ultra comes with a $300 no-strings discount</strong></a> AND a free storage upgrade with select color variants. Neither of these deals require a trade-in or carrier activation, which is honestly pretty remarkable for Samsung.</p>

<p>Samsung's midrange <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> just hit store shelves last month, so I was pretty surprised to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-128gb-unlocked-graphite/6599405.p"><strong>Best Buy's Black Friday sale carve a whopping $175 off</strong></a> the unlocked phone. That's a huge discount for such a new phone, and it's extremely unlikely that the price will drop even further next week.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 FE boasts a lovely 6.7-inch AMOLED display with seven years of guaranteed OS updates, plus you get Galaxy AI features and 8GB of RAM straight out of the box.</p><p>If you want to save even more, Best Buy will hook you up with $100 of additional savings when you activate the phone today, resulting in a total discount of $275 off. Thanks to this no-hassle deal, the midrange masterpiece just got way more midrange.</p>

<h2 id="to-wait-or-not-to-wait-that-really-is-the-question-2">To wait or not to wait, that really IS the question</h2>
<p>It's the major dilemma every year: should you trust the early Black Friday sales or wait until the big day to officially place your order? It's hard to know for sure. When writing up the deals for our shopping guides, I always try to be very clear if a deal is <em>truly </em>one-of-a-kind or if it is likely to get even better when Black Friday arrives.</p><p>Needless to say, if you see a deal on our site and it disappears before you can make your move, don't worry: many retailers will test the waters with a new deal and then end it before Black Friday weekend, only to resurrect it at the last minute. I'll try to make that known whenever I see it occur, but if you want to keep an eye on discounts yourself, it's worth checking out a price history tool like Camelcamelcamel to see what's really going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> is sure to be one of the most sought-after items this holiday season, and for good reason. The phone is an absolute powerhouse of Android technology, with a gorgeous 6.8-inch AMOLED display (with accompanying built-in stylus!), a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, and all of the cutting-edge Galaxy AI features you could ever want. Like the rest of the S24 series, the phone is also slated to receive seven years of OS and security upgrades.</p><p>The only real gripe I have with the S24 Ultra is its price. Fortunately, the early Black Friday sales have already begun to chip away at the super-premium smartphone, with Best Buy carving a straight $350 off the device when you buy unlocked.</p><p>If you have an old or broken device to ditch, Samsung is also offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24-ultra/buy/galaxy-s24-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s928ulbfxaa/"><strong>up to $800 of instant trade-in</strong></a> credit, plus a free storage upgrade!

Skip the trade-in hassle altogether and you'll get a straight $200 knocked off the price.</p><p>That being said, if I were going to buy an unlocked Galaxy Z Flip 6 this Black Friday, I'd ditch Samsung altogether and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0D195JKYD/"><strong>grab this 26% off discount from Amazon</strong></a>.</p>

After all, the S24 series is slated to get OS and security updates for seven more years, so it's not like the phones are going to feel dated very soon.</p><p>Here's my advice: if you're an Android enthusiast who's passionate about using the latest and greatest Samsung devices, go ahead and wait for the Galaxy S25 to arrive. If you're using a phone like the Galaxy S23 Ultra, you might also want to wait to see what trade-in deals become available for the S25 series.</p><p>If you simply want a great device for a record low price ASAP, however, consider one of the Galaxy S24 deals of Black Friday 2024.</p>

<p>Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 series of Android tablets was just unveiled a little over a month ago, but the Black Friday sales have already given the devices their first-ever discounts!</p><p>If you've had your eye on the super-premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>, the best move would probably be to buy the tablet directly from the source. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10/buy/galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-256gb-platinum-silver-wi-fi-sm-x920nzsaxar/"><strong>Samsung is currently slashing $200 off</strong></a> the tablet AND throwing in up to $800 of trade-in credit when you send in an old or broken device. Play your cards right and you can get your tablet for as little as $199.99. Not too shabby for a brand new device that's powerful enough to replace your laptop!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> get the reputation of being a little overpriced, but that's not a problem with the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus.

You also get expandable storage using microSD.</p><p>The Tab A9 Plus doesn't have S Pen support, which is a bummer, but Amazon's Black Friday sale is making up for any drawbacks with a huge 32% discount! That knocks the price of the tablet back down to an all-time low.</p>
<h2 id="wait-when-is-black-friday-again-2">Wait, WHEN is Black Friday again?</h2>
<p>Something interesting happened yesterday. Millions of folks outside of the United States thought yesterday, November 22nd, was Black Friday, as that has been closer to the usual date from past years. In the eComm industry, we've begun to refer to this as "Fake Black Friday". But fear not, the REAL Black Friday will be held on the day after Thanksgiving, November 29th.</p><p>In the meantime, there is no shortage of great early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday-2024">Black Friday deals</a> to hold you over.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-up-with-the-verizon-bundle-deal-2">What's up with the Verizon bundle deal?</h2>
<p>Verizon's Black Friday sale has officially kicked off, and one of the most interesting deals on display is this offer that gets you a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus/"><strong>free Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus, a free Galaxy Watch 7, AND a free Galaxy Tab S9 FE tablet</strong></a> if you can meet the eligibility requirements. That's over $1,500 worth of free Samsung tech!</p><p>Like most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a>, this holiday offer comes with a lot of fine print, but if you can make it work for you, the rewards can be HUGE. For starters, you'll need to purchase the Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus while adding a line with the Unlimited Ultimate plan. Then you'll need to process a trade-in through Verizon. Once that's said and done, the carrier will hook you up with enough promo credit to make all three devices completely free. You'll still be paying for the admittedly expensive Unlimited Ultimate plan, but that's where your obligation ends.</p><p>Verizon is also being pretty generous with its trade-in process for this deal — even old phones will get you the full amount of credit.</p>
<h2 id="pro-tip-score-another-50-off-when-you-use-the-shop-samsung-app-2">Pro tip: score another $50 off when you use the Shop Samsung app</h2>
<p>If you like buying devices directly from Samsung, consider downloading the Shop Samsung app. You'll get a straight $50 off your first purchase through the app if you spend $500 or more (or $100 off when you spend $1,500 or more), plus Samsung will occasionally offer exclusive discounts on certain devices when you shop via the app (right now you can get additional savings on the Galaxy S24 Ultra).</p><p>You don't have to go through any annoying hassle or sign over your first born when using the app, either, just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.ecomm&hl=en_US&pli=1"><strong>download it through the Google Play store</strong></a> and start shopping.

They're <em>great</em> for airplane trips and last hours upon hours on a single charge.</p><p>This deal is live for both the black and Bora Purple colorways, so you can choose between the two without feeling like you have to sacrifice on style. I've loved using these for years and still prefer the way they look and feel compared to the new Galaxy Buds 3 Pro earbuds.</p>

<p>Samsung makes the best Android phones, but the brand does so much more, and it is a leader in storage and memory products. The 990 Pro NVMe SSD is among the best available today, and and it is back down to its lowest pricing ahead of Black Friday.</p><p>The 990 Pro uses TLC cache, and it comes in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB storage sizes, with all three getting enticing discounts. Built on the PCIe 4.0 standard, you get outstanding transfers of up to 7450MB/s, and it is among the fastest in this regard. There isn't much else to say about the 990 Pro — it has consistently been one of the best choices in this category, and if you need to increase the storage on your PS5 or gaming machine, this is the best time to do so.</p>

<p>If you're stuck comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-galaxy-s23-fe">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE vs. Galaxy S23 FE</a>, let me provide a little helpful context.</p><p>For starters, it's worth noting that both devices are straightforward and reliable, with particularly great-for-the-price displays, large batteries, and years of guaranteed software support. Both phones also share the same camera hardware and most of the same AI-powered software features. Simply put, if you already own the Galaxy S23 FE, you don't need to rush and upgrade to the newer phone right away.</p><p>That being said, if you're planning to <em>buy </em>one of the two phones, let me be clear: <strong>the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is absolutely the better device, and it's currently cheaper than its predecessor during the Black Friday sales. </strong></p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCLQWJ65"><strong>Currently just $474.99 unlocked at Amazon</strong></a>, the Galaxy S24 FE is one of the best midrange phones you can buy 2024, totally smashing the S23 FE with a better processor, more software support, and the entire suite of Galaxy AI software features. The phone also boasts a larger display and an upgrade in battery life over its processor. In other words, there's no reason to consider buying the S23 FE during Black Friday when the S24 FE is this good.</p>

<p>Lots of cases look the same, but a Thinborne aramid fiber case will not only make your device stand out, it'll add some much-needed grip to modern slippery phones. The Galaxy S24 Ultra's titanium frame is certainly strong but it's not grippy by any means, and dropping it can still mean the glass breaks even if the metal holds strong.</p><p>I have historically preferred to use phones without a case but, as phones continue to get more and more expensive, it's just not economical to keep doing this. That's why I love Thinborne cases! They make the phone <em>super</em> grippy, add some fun style, and even toss in MagSafe compatibility so you can use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">best MagSafe accessories</a>. It's a win-win, especially when you can get a rare 21% discount during Black Friday week!</p>

The laptop can even read and summarize all your text messages and notifications, meaning you can focus more on work and less getting distracted by social media on your phone.</p><p>This <strong>$500 off </strong>deal is seriously incredible and makes the best version of the GalaxyBook 4 $100 less than the mid-range entry.

<p>Samsung has one of the best deals around if you're looking to pick up a curved OLED gaming monitor. The Odyssey OLED G9 has a massive 49-inch panel, and the vibrant OLED panel combined with the sheer size makes this the ultimate gaming upgrade.</p><p>The monitor has a QHD resolution, and as it is an ultrawide, you get increased horizontal density of 5120 x 1440. The curved design makes it that much more immersive, and 144Hz refresh means you can unlock high framerates in demanding games provided you have a decent video card. It has HDMI 2.1, Micro HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C connectivity, and honestly, there isn't much missing on this panel.</p><p>As an added bonus, Samsung is throwing in a 2TB 990 Pro M.2 drive with the package, and that's a $159 value on its own. So if you're mulling a monitor upgrade and haven't picked up anything yet, the OLED G9 is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/oled-monitor/49-odyssey-oled-g9-g91sd-dual-qhd-144hz-0-03ms-curved-gaming-monitor-ls49dg910snxza/">fantastic choice at $899</a>.</p>

<p>If you haven't made the switch to an OLED TV just yet, now is the time to do so. Samsung has exciting discounts on all of its OLED TVs, with sizes starting at 55 inches and going up to 77 inches.</p><p>The 55-inch S85D is a great starting point, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/oled-tvs/55-class-oled-s85d-qn55s85daexza/">coming in at $999</a>, it isn't too costly. If you've got a bigger budget, the 65-inch S95D would be my pick; the S95D is Samsung's latest range, and it has increased brightness, better color vibrancy, no glare, and goes up to 144Hz — making it a great choice with gaming consoles. While it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/oled-tvs/65-class-oled-s95d-qn65s95dafxza/">still costly at $2,299</a>, you're getting a $1,100 discount on its usual retail price, and that's a terrific deal.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a new Android phone, you might be considering Samsung Galaxy. The S series models come in different variants, the Ultra being the high-end option. The latest model is the Samsung Galaxy S24, but you can save by going with an older model or, conversely, get the best of the best if you decide to wait for the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>How does the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. Galaxy S23 Ultra fare? We can only speculate based on rumors and leaks, but if you’re wondering if it’s worth going older or waiting and paying more, we’re here to help. Before you choose, check out all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024" target="_blank">great Black Friday sales</a>, including ones on existing Samsung Galaxy phones, which could sway your decision.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RquzHm7hsoPHEMJFTuALSJ" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-renders-leak.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RquzHm7hsoPHEMJFTuALSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> looks, this is all speculation. Based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">leaked renders</a>, it appears to have a larger screen that some think could hover around 6.9 inches, a smidge larger than the 6.8-inch screen of the Galaxy S23 Ultra (and S24 Ultra, for that matter). It may also be lighter in weight with curved edges for easier handling, along with flat sides and front and skinnier bezels.</p><p>It's likely that the phone will have the same armor aluminum frame with a titanium option that the current generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> has combined with Gorilla Glass Victus 2. As with the other Galaxy Ultra models, the expectation is that it will come with an S Pen as well.</p><p>The screen will probably be the same M13 OLED, with a brightness comparable to the Samsung Galaxy S24, given this. Cameras will likely be vertically stacked, as has been the case with Galaxy devices.</p><p>Sources indicate the phone will come in Titanium Black, Blue, and Green, with possible Samsung-exclusive colors being Jade, Blue/Black, and Pink.</p><p>No basic specs have been confirmed for the device, but it would make sense that they at least match the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, if not surpass it. This would mean a display with an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate, multiple storage options with no microSD card slot, and an IP68 rating.</p><p>The expectation is that the battery will be the same 5,000mAh battery as the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra with 45W fast charging, but that a more efficient GPU could result in it lasting longer. It will likely support wireless charging as well, possibly at just 15W, unless there’s some improvement in that respect. Since many other phones support faster wireless charging, it would be a great move for Samsung to up the ante here with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>Now comes the big question: when will it be available? While Samsung has only confirmed early 2025, many suspect that the Galaxy S25 Ultra and its sister models will launch on January 23, 2025, at the Galaxy Unpacked event. By the time you can actually get your hands on one, it will likely be early February.</p>

<p>Now, let’s look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>. It comes with a polished metal armor aluminum frame with repurposed glass and PET film. Finished in Earth tones like Green, Phantom Black, Lavender, Cream, and Samsung exclusives Lime, Sky Blue, Graphite, and Red, you’ll get lots of fun color options with this phone.</p><p>The 6.8-inch 3,088 x 1,440 screen is Gorilla Glass Victus 2 as well, so it’s just as durable in this respect. It also boasts a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. Since we don’t know the resolution or screen rate of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, we can only assume it will be just as good, if not better. The same goes for the IP68 rating.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">his review</a>, Android Central’s Nicholas Sutrich says the Galaxy S23 Ultra screen is “super bright and ultra-crisp” and loves features like Vision Booster that help boost it in direct sunlight. He does notice, however, that the raised camera lenses are dust magnets.</p><p>Equipped with a 5,000mAh battery, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra supports 45W fast charging, 15W wireless charging, and 5W reverse charging via Wireless Powershare. Sutrich said at the time of his review that battery life was the best he’d seen among flagship phones to date, easily getting two days per charge. However, the phone charges at a snail’s pace, which is the trade-off.</p><p>Available with a Samsung S Pen for doodling, taking notes, and highlighting, Sutrich likes that the edges are less curved than the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, so it’s easier to write close to the side with the S Pen. You’ll get 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB storage with no memory card slot for expansion. There’s also Bluetooth 5.3, stereo speakers, NFC, support for up to Android 17, and security updates through 2028.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="X65GexZdyC98NmHwvCEFNJ" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-renders-leak-01.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X65GexZdyC98NmHwvCEFNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here’s where things get interesting. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is rumored to be coming loaded with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, which would mark a significant jump in performance and battery efficiency. This chipset would also be able to better support AI features.</p><p>Speaking of which, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will certainly come with all the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features as the Galaxy S24 Ultra, with the potential for more. We don’t yet, however, know what those additional features could be. One rumored feature is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">new parental controls</a>, while another is the possibility of a version of the Bixby voice assistant with generative AI. Both would be pretty cool additions if they pan out.</p><p>If the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra has the same 5,000mAh battery, it could mean shorter battery life or slower charging. There are rumors, however, of a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-flagship-phones-might-get-a-battery-boosting-ai-feature">AI battery feature</a> that could work in the background to help conserve battery life. This could at least ensure that the Galaxy S25 Ultra runs for as long as the Galaxy S24 Ultra per charge.</p><p>Launching with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> and Samsung’s<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024"> One UI 7</a>, this new version of One UI is suspected to include some significant upgrades. This may include a new visual style, more customization options, and new icons. Some sources also speculate that there could be new animations similar to what’s found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OnePlus Oxygen OS 15</a>. This new OS could launch before the end of 2024 and will likely be available as an upgrade for the Samsung Galaxy S24 as well, though it’s unclear if it will work with the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.</p><p>There are suspicions that Samsung could increase the RAM from 12GB to a whopping 16GB, further affording a fast, efficient, and seamless experience. It’s also expected that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will continue Samsung’s trend of offering seven years of OS and security updates, which means it will be relevant for years to come.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rT9Njn3Nj7XCSzxzFMkYsC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S23-Ultra-front-home-screen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra on a tea tray with its screen on and the home screen visible" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rT9Njn3Nj7XCSzxzFMkYsC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparatively, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra arrived loaded with Android 13, but it is updateable to Android 15 and beyond (once the update rolls out), supported through Android 17 and up to 2028 with security updates.</p><p>It’s powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, which is fairly powerful already but won’t be as powerful as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra if the rumors hold true. It comes loaded with all the usual Samsung AI goodies, so you’ll still get a wonderful AI experience with this phone. However, some of the newer AI features, whatever they may be, may not be supported by this device.</p><p>The phone has either 8GB or 12GB RAM, so if the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra does increase this to 16GB, it might be the reason to upgrade for better overall performance and responsiveness. This is especially true for multitaskers and mobile gamers.</p><p>With that said, Sutrich was pleased with the performance of the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra for gaming, joking that it doesn’t “turn into molten lava” when he tries to play a game for more than 20 minutes. He lauds the chipset for doing a better job of cooling the phone, even when pushing mobile graphics to the limit.</p><p>Sutrich loves features like Bixby Text Call, which works like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> call screening on Pixel phones but allows you to actually type messages to the person and have Bixby read them back. The transcription on both ends, he says, is “phenomenal.” However, it didn’t effectively filter our spam callers.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s23-ultra-how-good-are-the-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. Galaxy S23 Ultra: How good are the cameras?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="n6PXaFPNmcpnShZH3pGRHJ" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-renders-leak-03.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n6PXaFPNmcpnShZH3pGRHJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, we don’t yet know the details of the cameras in the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, but there is some chatter around this already. Some believe there may be a shift to Sony sensors, but the resolution and options may be comparable to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>But there are rumors about major camera improvements, including a potential upgraded ultra-wide-angle lens from 12MP to 50MP, a major difference. There is also talk of a variable telephoto lens, but what that means is unclear. It could reference the ability to adjust focal length, which would allow for smoother zooming when shooting videos.</p><p>Some suspect the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra may only have three cameras total, forgoing a telephoto lens altogether, and offering a 3x crop zoom instead. That said, leaked renders refute these rumors, showing the device with more than three rear camera sensors. We won’t know more, however, until the phone officially launches.</p><p>What we can be sure of is that you’ll be able to use all the same Galaxy AI features and photo and video capturing and editing functions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qWZPPcUcx9vzAhBet2TVxf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S23-Ultra-green-back-hold-01.jpg" alt="The back of the green Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qWZPPcUcx9vzAhBet2TVxf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>As for the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, it comes equipped with a pro-grade camera system including a 200MP wide-angle lens, 12MP ultra-wide, 12MP selfie, and a 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and 10MP telephoto lens with 10x optical zoom.</p><p>It has features like nightography for better low light photos, night portrait, astro hyperlapse, expert RAW mode, and multiple exposures. It’s expected that all these same features will carry over to the new phone as well.</p><p>You can read all about Sutrich’s experience with the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra camera in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-camera-review-more-megapixels-isnt-always-better">dedicated camera review</a> for the phone. But to sum it up, he finds that the 200MP main camera yields photos with “exquisite detail” but the shutter is slow to respond. And you’ll get inconsistent results, which might sometimes include a loss of detail or something blown out in a photo.</p><p>He does, however, love the front-facing camera, portrait mode, and macro camera, calling them the best in this respect of any Android phone he had tested to date (when the review was originally written back in 2023).</p>

<p>When it comes to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. Galaxy S23 Ultra, the decision is an interesting one. If you can wait, you’re better off doing so because you’ll certainly get a better phone with more powerful specs in the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. We’re not far off from its launch date, so you can start counting the days on the calendar. However, you will pay a lot more for it.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra may be available for a good deal. If you’re on a budget and you find it for a great price, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024">especially during Black Friday</a>, it’s a worthwhile upgrade from a much older phone. But you’re better off going with the current model, Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, instead, which you may also find on sale. Chances are, you might find it for a deal that brings the price down to even less than the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, in which case, it’s a no-brainer.</p><p>If you want the most powerful Samsung Galaxy phone available, waiting a short time will pay off because there are big expectations for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. Chief among these is the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, which is almost a certainty for this model. If that combines with better cameras, more RAM, new AI features, more efficient and/or faster charging battery, and a sleeker design, it makes sense to wait.</p><p>With that said, if you need something yesterday, go with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. It’s the best option available right now for a relatively decent price. Even if you decide on this phone, waiting might be ideal because the price will probably come down with this model once the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is released. If you want to widen your options, consider our picks for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a>, which include both Samsung Galaxy models and ones from other brands as well.</p>

With Black Friday upon us, there's never been a better time to save big on one of these beasts. For example, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, my current daily driver, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-5g-256gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587911.p?skuId=6587911"><strong>down to its lowest price ever! </strong></a></p><p>Normally, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold costs about $1,800, but that price has been slashed by $300, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-5g-256gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587911.p?skuId=6587911">bringing it down to $1,499</a>. While that's for the 256GB model, if you need more storage, you'll be able to save $300 on the 512GB version too!</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want one of the most complete foldable phone experiences while saving some money at the same time.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want or need a bit more software flexibility in a foldable phone.</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> takes a completely different approach compared to its predecessor. Google ditched the passport-style from the original Pixel Fold in favor of one that's a bit more intuitive.</p><p>It starts with the outer screen, which is the same size as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-amazon-black-friday-sale-has-finally-fixed-the-google-pixel-9s-price-problem">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. This provides a more traditional smartphone experience while the phone is folded, which has been a sticking point for some.</p><p>When you unfold the phone, you're presented with a beautiful 8-inch Super Actua Flex display. Combined with the redesign, the inner screen makes for a more comfortable multi-tasking experience, as you can have a full-size app on either side of the screen.</p><p>Even if the Pixel 9 Pro Fold isn't the phone for you, it's not the only foldable phone on sale for Black Friday. We're also tracking deals for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/surprise-grab-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-for-as-low-as-usd499-99-during-samsungs-black-friday-sale">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and OnePlus Open, not to mention the variety of deals for flip phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hurry-the-motorola-razr-plus-crashes-to-its-lowest-price-ever-again-during-best-buys-black-friday-sale">Moto Razr Plus</a>.</p>
