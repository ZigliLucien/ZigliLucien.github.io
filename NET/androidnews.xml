Music plus fitness tracking is usually reserved for other wearables, but this integration is an innovation that could lead to more like it down the line.</p>

<p>The Sennheiser Momentum Sport launched in April 2024, and are available at a wide range of retail and online outlets. They start out at $329, and it may be some time before Sennheiser (or retailers) begin dropping the price for a better deal. They come in polar black, metallic graphite, and burned olive.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MvBUZRJFivz99QngMwosYW" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Sport-wearing.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Sport earbuds side view in ear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MvBUZRJFivz99QngMwosYW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking back at the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/sennheiser-sport-true-wireless-review">Sennheiser Sport True Wireless</a>, the company clearly went in a different direction with the Momentum Sport. A svelte build coupled with a reasonably custom take on fit and placement make these buds better suited to staying active. They come with three pairs of ear tips and four pairs of wings to help find the most stable fit. You can take that further with the Fit Test in the Sennheiser Smart Control app to figure out which tip gives you the tightest seal. As is always the case with earbuds, the tighter the seal, the thicker the bass.</p><p>Much of the actual surface is matte, covered with the rubberized trim of the wing. This combination proves very effective in holding the Momentum Sport buds in place at all times. While there were moments when I had to adjust them, they weren&apos;t common. If anything, the sensitivity of the touch controls made the adjustments somewhat frustrating.</p><p>What&apos;s easier to appreciate is that a good fit matches great sound, not least because Sennheiser gives you different ways to get there in the Smart Control app. The equalizer is a solid option for using presets or creating your own, while Sound Check is well worth going through to tweak the audio profile to your ears. It&apos;s a non-invasive process where you listen to tones at varying volume levels to set a benchmark EQ preset that differs from the default one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.58%;"><img id="CJpGiKwtTiJ8QEgPk2Nx8V" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Sports-screenshots-1.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Sport screenshots from Smart Control app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJpGiKwtTiJ8QEgPk2Nx8V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1466" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart Control is critical to managing everything the Momentum Sport buds can do. Sound Zones are another option where you can have audio and active noise cancelation (ANC) or Transparency applied based on where you are. It&apos;s a geolocation feature that requires the app to track where you are in order to apply the changes so that music and ANC sound different, say, in the gym, compared to in a quiet office. </p><p>You can&apos;t control noise cancelation the same way you can with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-review">Momentum True Wireless 4</a>, but you do have some flexibility in how Transparency and Anti-Wind work. Given the sound leans more toward bass response, the earbuds are ideally suited to the kind of tunes you might listen to while working out or running. Even if you prefer podcasts, there&apos;s a preset made for that in the app. </p><p>Either way, Sennheiser gives these earbuds the right sonic treatment. Music sounds great — even better when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">listening to hi-res tunes</a> using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">aptX HD Bluetooth codec</a>. You don&apos;t have to subscribe to a hi-res audio <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming service</a> to hear the goods here, but it is a bonus if you have that option. If the bass is too heavy, it&apos;s a simple thing to tweak in the app&apos;s EQ. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sA2TpN4jRky3LG3wS36TsT" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Sport-loose-hand.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Sport earbuds loose in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sA2TpN4jRky3LG3wS36TsT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The bigger deal may be the fact that Sennheiser squeezes heart rate and temperature sensors into the left earbud, letting you keep track of heartbeat and body temperature metrics in real-time. You might think it odd to do it this way, given <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a>, fitness trackers, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">chest straps</a> already cover those features, but in-ear tracking is arguably more precise because nothing moves in the ear. There are no muscles or tendons contracting like those in the wrist that could potentially delay or throw off tracking. Here, it feels instant and continuous, which is a cool thing to have.</p><p>Sennheiser isn&apos;t doing it alone; it is partnering with Polar to make the earbuds tracker compatible with the Polar Flow app. While Sennheiser&apos;s app can always show you the basics, Flow tracks your actual activity, so you can go for a run or hike and glean more from the data the in-ear sensors help deliver. Polar Flow offers dozens of exercises to choose from, making things interesting if you ever want to compare the accuracy of the earbuds with that of a smartwatch or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness tracker</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.58%;"><img id="F5us6B2weFBQiGNf5b9SqU" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Sports-screenshots-2.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Sport screenshots showing integration with Polar.." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F5us6B2weFBQiGNf5b9SqU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1466" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The setup isn&apos;t all that hard when you have both apps installed on your phone, though you will need a Polar account to get it done (subscription not required). Tracking is quite accurate when the fit is nice and snug, adding confidence to any metrics you&apos;re keenly tracking throughout a day or workout. </p><p>As for sound control while staying active, don&apos;t expect ANC to match the best in the business, such as Sony or Bose. I would even argue Sennheiser&apos;s Momentum True Wireless 4 are better at blocking out background noise, but the Momentum Sport are still close. They dampen the clinks and clangs of the gym, as well as street noise, though aren&apos;t quite as effective with droning sounds like those on a subway train. </p><p>Transparency and Anti-Wind are solid, letting you control the effect you want. Anti-Wind is very good at cutting back gusts enough to make podcasts and phone calls sound clearer. You won&apos;t need it in quieter spaces, but it&apos;s nonetheless good to have when you have to take a call outside. Onboard wear sensors also automatically pause playback when you remove either earbud.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e3C3rJmnwoJaXf5mHhyoCU" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Sport-case-closed.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Sport earbuds in case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e3C3rJmnwoJaXf5mHhyoCU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Multipoint connections mean you can use the Momentum Sport with two devices simultaneously, perfect if you plan to utilize them for work or to watch something on one device while taking calls on another. I also like that you can accept an incoming call by simply taking either earbud out of the case, where it instantly connects and takes the call. Doing this ends up being a battery-saving move and negates having to wear the earbuds all the time in case calls come in.</p><p>Call quality is good, too. Sennheiser has long been good at this sort of thing, though I noticed callers felt it was obvious I wasn&apos;t talking through a phone.  </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sennheiser-momentum-sport-what-s-not-good"><span>Sennheiser Momentum Sport: What's not good</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1307px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cthDMb4cY8giQqhYxLuJXU" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Sport-close-up.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Sport earbud close up in ear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cthDMb4cY8giQqhYxLuJXU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1307" height="735" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve tested a ton of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>, and the Momentum Sport may be one of the most sensitive pairs I&apos;ve tried as far as onboard controls go. Anytime I had to adjust the fit, I ran the risk of inadvertently resuming play, skipping a track, or worse yet, hanging up on a call. The default sensitivity is set to Medium, which only makes the High setting feel like tapping on eggshells. Low isn&apos;t bad, but even there, you may end up with unintended consequences. Non-responsive controls are often a problem for wireless earbuds, but these somehow take that to the other extreme.</p><p>Battery life is another one that will require compromise and patience on your part. Sennheiser claims up to six hours per charge, but you&apos;re not likely to get that far if you factor in ANC, volume levels, and fitness tracking. There is a Battery Eco mode to help squeeze more life out per charge at the expense of the aptX codec. I get between four and five hours per charge, which is more than enough for workouts and runs but not quite as high as I would like to see for the price. </p><p>That also goes for durability. The IP55 protection for the buds themselves is pretty good, though I would think "sport" earbuds costing this much would ramp that up a bit. The case itself is IP54, and has a nice rubberized coating, only the lid isn&apos;t as secure as it should be. Hence, I would be wary of using the included lanyard to hang them. These are always better off in a pocket.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">Sporty earbuds</a> aren&apos;t that hard to find these days, and you could make an argument certain pairs among the best wireless earbud<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">s</a> are worthy. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-review">Jabra Elite 8 Active</a> truly stand out as competitors in the search for sweaty earbuds, especially given their impressive IP68 protection, physical button controls, superior battery life, and cheaper cost. They&apos;re also almost entirely rubberized and offer a snug fit for a wide variety of ears.</p><p>You could also consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a> as an option, though their IPX7 rating isn&apos;t as good for dust resistance. They also don&apos;t offer a custom EQ but are otherwise resilient and packed with a range of other features. If you want more basic features yet desire an even more secure fit with ear hooks, you could also try the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/jlab-epic-air-sport-anc-review">JLab Epic Air Sport ANC</a> for a much lower price.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want more ruggedized earbuds for runs or workouts.</li>
  <li>You want very good sound and noise cancelation.</li>
  <li>You want customization and personalization.</li>
  <li>You want a comfortable fit.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want something even more ruggedized.</li>
  <li>You want more battery life.</li>
  <li>You prefer to spend less.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The Sennheiser Momentum Sport offer a lot out of the box and through the Smart Control app, but you have to pay a premium to get it all. These are expensive wireless earbuds by any metric, leaving it to you to make a calculated decision both for your own budget and the value you think you would gain from the unique integration available here.</p><p>They clearly sound great, and are rugged enough to handle most runs and workouts, along with all the customization in the app, so it&apos;s a compelling package. You won&apos;t come away disappointed with what they can do, though only you can decide if it&apos;s all worth it in the end.</p>

<p>Modern phones are designed to last; most devices will get at least three Android updates, allowing them to be relevant for several years after they&apos;ve launched, and in the case of the latest Google and Samsung devices, you will get seven years of software updates.</p><p>It will be interesting to see if these devices are able to hold up to the rigors of extended use — battery degradation continues to be a real issue that affects long-term use — but with features like optimized charging and slow charging available, you can reasonably get several years worth of use out of these devices.</p><p>And if you have an older phone that isn&apos;t getting much use, there are a lot of things you can do with it. I&apos;m sharing a few ways I reuse older phones that aren&apos;t quite capable of being daily drivers, but still have decent hardware.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dXZmSn938KwwPDXRrYPu9S" name="earth-day-phones-4.jpg" alt="OnePlus 7T security" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dXZmSn938KwwPDXRrYPu9S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most security camera brands take a lackadaisical attitude toward customer data — just look at what Eufy got up to — so I&apos;m picky about the brands I trust. I used Nest cameras in the past, and while they&apos;re reliable and have a lot of useful features, they don&apos;t record any footage locally. Ubiquiti&apos;s UniFi Protect cameras are still the best choice if you need local storage, and I use them as outdoor cameras. The main issue is that it&apos;s a hassle to set up the network, as you&apos;ll need to use the cameras with Ubiquiti&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-ultimate-ubiquiti-unifi-home-network-2022">UniFi network gear</a>.</p><p>That&apos;s why I use an old phone if I need to record footage indoors. AlfredCamera is the best utility in this regard, and you can easily turn an old device into a security camera or baby monitor. Obviously, you can&apos;t use it as an outdoor camera, but if you want an indoor camera, you can reliably use your phone. AlfredCamera has a free tier lets you set up the camera and view footage, but any event-based recordings, zooming into the image, and HD video is locked behind a private tier that costs $5.99 a month or $29 annually.</p><p>I&apos;ve been using AlfredCamera in conjunction with an old phone for just over two months as a baby monitor, and it does everything I need. It has activity detection, two-way mic, continuously records footage up to eight hours, and stores events on the cloud.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="m37E4QKnoGBNt7ZsJNoqtR" name="earth-day-phones-3.jpg" alt="Playing music on OnePlus 7T" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m37E4QKnoGBNt7ZsJNoqtR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you have an older phone with a 3.5mm jack, you can turn it into a dedicated music player. Most music streaming services have a lossless tier, and while there are dedicated music players like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m11s-review">Fiio M11S</a>, they&apos;re basically phones without the cellular connectivity and additional DAC hardware.</p><p>Even if your phone doesn&apos;t have a 3.5mm jack, you can get a USB-C dongle — like the $30 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka11-review">Fiio KA11</a> — and pair it with IEMs to get much better sound. Music streaming isn&apos;t resource intensive, and an old phone holds up well as a media player. LG devices in particular had decent DACs built in, so if you have the LG G6, G7, or any of the V series models, you can easily use them to play media.</p><p>This is  a good route to take if you have a large offline music library and want to stream songs on a dedicated device. </p>
<h2 id="use-it-to-read-e-books-2">Use it to read e-books</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U65LV8j8iwCZsZKF3ioXjR" name="earth-day-phones-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus 7T Reading Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U65LV8j8iwCZsZKF3ioXjR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Boox Palma may just be the best choice if you want a pocket-sized e-reader, but you can also use an older phone. This is a particularly good choice if you have a phone that&apos;s older than five years — device makers cared about usability back then.</p><p>Bonus points if you have an old OnePlus phone; legacy OxygenOS versions have a Reading Mode that turn the screen monochrome, making these devices a terrific choice to read. I got a lot of utility out of that feature in the past, and it is annoying that OnePlus doesn&apos;t have anything as good in the current iteration of ColorOS.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-just-the-start-2">This is just the start</h2>
<p>Obviously, there are plenty of other things you can do with an older phone; you can set up an emulator and play retro games, use it as an alarm clock on your nightstand, or set it up as a smart home dashboard. I set up older devices with all of these use cases in mind, and at the end of the day, it&apos;s down to what you&apos;re looking to get out of your phone.</p>

<p>I/O 2024 is right around the corner, but Google probably just made a bigger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-hardware-team-restructuring-merge">announcement</a> than anything we&apos;ll see next month. Rick Osterloh is no longer just running devices and services, but instead, will take the lead for a new "Platforms and Devices" team. With this reorganization, Osterloh is now in charge of Android, Chrome, ChromeOS, Photos, and more, while still overseeing the Pixel team.</p><p>If it weren&apos;t for listing out all of the different departments, it might only seem like a surface-level change within Alphabet. However, there&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/building-ai-future-april-2024/">another major change</a> as Hiroshi Lockheimer will be starting "work on some new projects across Alphabet." While I&apos;m happy to see that Hiroshi will remain with the company, it will be a bit odd not to see him steering the Android and ChromeOS ship.</p>

<p>In a statement made to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133881/google-android-pixel-teams-reorg-rick-osterloh">The Verge</a>, Osterloh explained that AI was at the center of this dramatic reorganization. Considering how hard Google is determined to throw AI and Gemini into everything it can, this consolidation makes a bit more sense. But I can&apos;t help but feel as though we&apos;ve heard this before.</p><p>When Google unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tensor">Tensor chip</a>, it was under the premise that the hardware and software teams were working hand-in-hand. Essentially, giving the Pixel lineup the same treatment enjoyed by the iPhone, with the SoC being tweaked and tuned to the hardware it&apos;s powering.</p><p>There&apos;s an argument to be made on both sides as to whether Google has followed through on the proposition laid forth just a few years ago. But then, the consumer availability of AI was shot of out a cannon with OpenAI and ChatGPT lighting the fuse. Google fumbled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/now-is-the-wrong-time-for-google-bard">launch of Bard</a>, which has since been rebranded to Gemini. Meanwhile, Google continues to stumble a bit, as evidenced by its claiming that the Pixel 8 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-not-getting-gemini-nano">wouldn&apos;t be getting</a> Gemini Nano, only to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">backtrack</a> on those claims.</p><p>Not all hope is lost for Google, as it&apos;s still relatively early in the AI game. However, Osterloh needs to grab the bull by the horns, so to speak, and actually fix the problems that still plague users. That means turning Google into the leader it&apos;s supposed to be and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-better-at-updates-than-google">stopping Samsung from taking all of the credit</a>.</p><p>Perhaps this is the fundamental shift that is needed to avoid issues like Gemini Nano on the Pixel 8. Instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">promising seven years of updates</a>, don&apos;t make users of the most expensive Pixel phone feel like second-class citizens. Act like you own the place, and not just like you&apos;re a temporary resident. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Is this reorganization really just all because of AI? Probably not, but that's Google's story and its sticking to it.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It&apos;s not like this is Google&apos;s first foray into consumer-facing AI products or features. Pixel phones have long ranked among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, even when the camera hardware was laughably outclassed. This was all made possible by the Machine Learning models that were (and still are) being used on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review">Pixel phones</a>, which allow us to take a clear picture of the starry night sky.</p><p>The difference now is that Google is attempting to be more systematic in how it implements AI without being seen as falling behind. Rumors and speculation suggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/ios/ios-18/apples-major-iphone-ai-upgrade-could-have-no-cloud-processing-initial-wave-of-ios-18-features-will-work-entirely-on-device">Apple is planning</a> some big AI-focused announcements at its upcoming developer conference. But Google has a chance to get ahead of the curve simply because I/O is happening first.</p><p>If there&apos;s one common denominator between Google and Apple, it&apos;s that both Siri and Assistant are a bit lost. You can&apos;t get Assistant to reliably set a reminder, and while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-fiasco-proves-ai-is-moving-too-fast-for-googleso-whats-next">Gemini</a> might seem superior, it lacks a lot of the basic functionality we&apos;d expect. Sure, it&apos;s cool to ask Gemini to help you plan and book a trip, but go ahead and try asking it to turn off your lights. Meanwhile, Siri is laughable at best, so much to the point that I&apos;ve remapped the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-made-the-right-decision-to-ditch-the-mute-switch-on-the-iphone-15-pro">Action Button</a> on my iPhone 15 Pro Max to use Perplexity instead of invoking Siri.</p>

<p>One recurring thought that I have is that it&apos;s almost like Osterloh is running a company (Pixel) within a company (Google) within a company (Alphabet) This thought is driven even further home <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/building-ai-future-april-2024/" target="_blank">after reading</a> that "the Google Research teams focused on computational photography and on-device intelligence will also be moving over to join the new org to bring deep AI expertise across platforms and devices."</p><p>In doing so, Osterloh has essentially all of the functioning bodies of a phone manufacturer reporting to him. Basically, I think of it as Osterloh forming a "Pixel Phone" company without going the startup route like Carl Pei did with Nothing. Not to mention the added benefit of having teams of people he&apos;s already familiar with, combined with the financial backing of Google/Alphabet. </p>

<p>We knew that Google would be working to implement AI into the devices and tools that we use every day. It really was only a matter of time, but there&apos;s just one more aspect of today&apos;s announcement that has left me scratching my head. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon provided the following statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133881/google-android-pixel-teams-reorg-rick-osterloh#:~:text=And%20Cristiano%20Amon%2C%20the%20CEO%20of%20Qualcomm%20and%20one%20of%20the%20first%20people%20briefed%20on%20this%20change%2C%20said%20in%20a%20statement%20that%20%E2%80%9CI%20look%20forward%20to%20working%20with%20Rick%20to%20deliver%20leading%20Android%20experiences%20powered%20by%20Snapdragon%20not%20only%20in%20mobile%20but%20across%20Auto%2C%20XR%20and%20Compute.%E2%80%9D">The Verge</a>: "I look forward to working with Rick to deliver leading Android experiences powered by Snapdragon not only in mobile but across Auto, XR and Compute."</p><p>Has Google&apos;s partnership with Samsung come to an end? Will Qualcomm manufacture Tensor chips moving forward? Is this Google reaching for the "white flag," signaling the end of the Tensor program as we know it? Am I over-analyzing a single sentence? Other than that last question, only time will tell.</p><p>If this is the end of the <em>current</em> iteration of Tensor, the writing has kind of been on the wall for a while now. Last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-made-by-tsmc-in-the-works">reports claimed</a> that Google was "pushing back" the launch of its "first custom Pixel chip" until sometime in 2025. Initially, the plan was for this "custom Pixel chip" to be the Tensor G3. It would be built by TSMC, as opposed to Samsung, while looking to provide a true flagship experience, one that could rival the best from Qualcomm and maybe even Apple.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Are we witnessing the "beginning of the end" for Tensor? Or maybe Tensor is next in line to be overhauled.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It wouldn&apos;t be completely out of left field for Google to pivot and work with Qualcomm. It happened with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, which ditched the modified Samsung Exynos SoC in favor of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-wear-risc-v-upgrade">Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon W5</a>.</p><p>Perhaps instead of working with Samsung on the design, Google is looking to shore up its relationship with Qualcomm. It seems as though the forthcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite</a> chips are capable of rivaling Apple Silicon, something that Windows and ChromeOS devices have sorely needed for years. that means improved performance, paired with sorely-needed improved efficiency, while also being able to provide the same experience on Arm devices as you find with non-mobile processors.</p><p>Maybe all of this is just a long example of how one tries to think "outside of the box." I just can&apos;t help but think that Google has much bigger plans in store for the future. If I&apos;m right, Google&apos;s biggest announcement in years is just the first drop in the bucket.</p>

<ul><li>Newly surfaced rumors suggest Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 could be quite taxing on upcoming flagship batteries.</li><li>Supposedly, smartphone makers may need to increase battery capacities to nearly 6,000mAh, but there some are allegedly being tested with 5,500mAh.</li><li>Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 will feature its custom-made Oyron CPU cores and is rumored to reach 4.0GHz in speed.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A newly surfaced rumor suggests smartphone makers might have to include a larger battery in their flagship device if it&apos;s to contain the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4.</p><p>The rumor stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5023710107669290">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) on Weibo, who states the next generation of phones could feature "high-density" batteries (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-8-gen-4-flagships-featuring-large-batteries-due-to-high-power/">WCCFTech</a>). They add that, so far, three flagship devices preparing to run Qualcomm&apos;s next chip have started development with 5,500mAh batteries.</p><p>Rumors add that the core materials for such batteries are still being developed to support the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5024143802109701">follow-up post</a> by the leaker on Weibo states that batteries could reach upwards of 6,000mAh in order to satiate the chip&apos;s power hunger.</p><p>Speculation surrounding the SD 8 Gen 4&apos;s increased power hunger could be due to its alleged 2+6 core setup, the WCCFTech noted. This rumored setup supposedly removes the possibility for Qualcomm to include any efficiency cores to cut down on how much power it draws.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-reportedly-causing-issues-before-launch">similar speculation</a> was made about MediaTek&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-launch">Dimensity 9300</a> before the chip launched. Word spread that the chip&apos;s weight on power started causing overheating issues with devices that featured it. MediaTek promptly denied such rumors, stating it was "completely false and has no source or basis in fact."</p><p>It&apos;ll be wise to remain cautious until Qualcomm&apos;s chip is out to see how it behaves.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Qualcomm&apos;s chief marketing officer, Don McGuire, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">confirmed some specs</a> about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 during MWC 2024. McGuire stated that users can expect the chip to launch during the Summit in October and that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">will feature Oryon CPU</a> cores. Qualcomm stated the cores can output 2x greater CPU performance and 4.5x faster AI processing.</p><p>The cores will likely be accompanied by Qualcomm&apos;s seventh-generation modem with 5G and non-terrestrial network support for satellite communication capabilities.</p><p>The chip is also rumored to be built off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4-tsmc-rumor">TSMC&apos;s 3nm process</a>, and the cores could reach 4.0GHz speeds. With Qualcomm seemingly going all in on power, the latest rumors make a little more sense.</p><p>There is speculation that the three manufacturers testing devices with increased batteries could involve OPPO and Xiaomi. However, OnePlus had its name tossed into the mix as the company (usually) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-battery-charging-speeds">quickly incorporates</a> the latest Qualcomm chips into its flagship phones.</p>

<hr>
<p>Just this week alone, Google has laid off workers, launched massive reorganization efforts, and fired 28 protestors. A series of protests were staged at two Google offices this week related to the company&apos;s cloud contract with the Israeli government, and employees were fired for their involvement. Separately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-hardware-team-restructuring-merge">Google announced a merge of multiple teams</a> into a single "Platforms and Devices" unit. </p><p>The layoffs were first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-layoffs-more-employees-2024-4" target="_blank">Business Insider</a>, which said that jobs were cut across Google&apos;s finance and real estate teams. The company confirmed to Business Insider that layoffs occurred but would not say how many positions were eliminated or elaborate further. However, the report referenced an internal email from  Google&apos;s finance head, Ruth Porat, that the company was moving some positions to "growth hubs," which are located in cities like Bangalore, Mexico City, and Dublin.</p><p>Google&apos;s latest round of job cuts follows the thousands of roles that were eliminated across 2023 and thus far in 2024. Previous rounds of layoffs affected AR hardware, Google Assistant, and core engineering divisions, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai at the time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/more-job-cuts-on-the-horizon-for-google-says-ceo-sundar-pichai">warned more layoffs would come</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the layoffs, Google fired 28 workers who were involved in a protest of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-project-nimbus-ai-surveillance-evil">Project Nimbus</a>, which is a billion-dollar cloud contract with Israel&apos;s government that also includes other companies. Some employees occupied the offices of Google executives and were removed by law enforcement, suspended, and arrested. Later, in a memo to employees viewed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133700/google-fires-28-employees-protest-israel-cloud-contract">The Verge</a>, Google&apos;s head of global security said that "behavior like this has no place in our workplace and we will not tolerate it."</p><p>"These protests were part of a longstanding campaign by a group of organizations and people who largely don&apos;t work at Google," a Google spokesperson told Android Central in a statement. "A small number of employee protesters entered and disrupted a few of our locations."</p><p>The spokesperson said that after individual investigations were concluded, Google fired 28 employees and reiterated that the company "will continue to investigate and take action as needed."</p><p>"Physically impeding other employees&apos; work and preventing them from accessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely unacceptable behavior," the Google spokesperson added.</p><p>The group that organized the protest, who goes by the "No Tech for Apartheid" name, released a response statement on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medium.com/@notechforapartheid/statement-from-google-workers-with-the-no-tech-for-apartheid-campaign-on-googles-indiscriminate-28ba4c9b7ce8">Medium</a>. "This flagrant act of retaliation is a clear indication that Google values its $1.2 billion contract with the genocidal Israeli government and military more than its own workers," the unauthored post read. </p><p>Pichai appeared to acknowledge the discourse related to the protests in a note to employees <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/building-ai-future-april-2024/">posted to Google&apos;s blog</a> today. </p><p>"Ultimately we are a workplace and our policies and expectations are clear: this is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes them feel unsafe, to attempt to use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics," the Google CEO wrote. "This is too important a moment as a company for us to be distracted."</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>There are indications that Samsung might introduce a vertical scroll option for the app drawer in the next version of One UI.</li><li>Good Lock's Home Up module used to allow customization of the app drawer layout, but Samsung removed this option in recent updates.</li><li>Samsung might be planning to integrate a "vertical list function" directly into the OS instead of relying on Good Lock.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s app drawer has always swiped sideways, unlike most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> that scroll up and down. But it looks like Samsung might be jumping on the vertical scroll bandwagon at last.</p><p>Apparently, the official word from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a>&apos;s development team is that the next version of One UI will include a vertical scrolling option for the app drawer, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-7-vertical-app-drawer-hint/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>.</p><p>This juicy detail came out when a Samsung representative was responding to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-z/goodlock%EA%B8%B0%EB%8A%A5-%EC%A4%91%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-%EC%95%B1%ED%99%94%EB%A9%B4%EC%9D%84-%EC%84%B8%EB%A1%9C-%EB%A6%AC%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8%EB%A1%9C-%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EB%B0%A9%EB%B2%95%EC%9D%B4-%EC%9E%88%EC%97%88%EB%8B%A4%EA%B3%A0%EB%8A%94-%EB%93%A4%EC%97%88%EB%8A%94%EB%8D%B0%EC%9A%94/m-p/26524885/highlight/true#M156631" target="_blank">user&apos;s query</a> about the possibility of bringing back that feature in Good Lock&apos;s Home Up module.</p><p>Right now, One UI&apos;s app drawer organizes apps into pages, so you have to swipe left or right to move around. However, Home Up used to be the go-to for customizing the One UI home screen, including switching the app drawer to a vertical scroll layout. But in recent updates, Samsung took that option out of the module.</p><p>In a comment on Samsung’s forums, a member of the Good Lock support team shed some light on why the feature got axed. Apparently, Samsung is cooking up a "vertical list function" to be supported in the next OS version instead of relying on Good Lock.</p><p>While Samsung might just bring back the vertical scroll option in Good Lock, it&apos;s more probable that the moderator is hinting at native support for vertical app drawers being added to the OS with the release of One UI 7 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>.</p><p>Samsung has been known for doing things its own way on Android. Take seamless updates, for instance—the company has been avoiding them for ages. But in March, the South Korean tech giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-a55-seemingly-adopting-seamless-updates">finally gave in and started rolling out the feature</a>.</p><p>Now, it looks like another user-requested feature for Samsung phones might be on the horizon—a feature most other Android users already have.</p><p>We&apos;ll have to wait and see until Samsung&apos;s Android 15 update, One UI 7, hits the beta stage, which is still a few months down the road.</p>

<p>Head to Amazon today and you can grab the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus for only $159.99 (for the 64GB version) or $209.99 (128GB version). Either way, you're getting a record low price on a popular Samsung slab that features great battery life with fast charging, quad Dolby Atmos speakers, and expandable storage up to 1TB via microSD. </p>
<p>The tablet doesn't support the S Pen stylus and there's no water resistance rating, but aside from those flaws, the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus is pretty much the perfect couch companion, and right now it's selling at a low price that we've never seen before. <em><strong>This deal could expire at any moment, so don't wait if you're interested.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a tablet with great battery life and reliably-fast performance; your budget is under $250; you just need something simple for streaming, reading, and browsing the web. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want to use a stylus with your tablet; you can afford a more premium device; you need something for serious gaming; you want a device with a water resistance rating. </p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus scored the top spot in our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">best cheap Android tablets</a> that money can buy, mainly because it has just about every feature you could want in a modern tablet at a considerably lower cost. The 64GB version of the slab typically retails for around $219.99, but thanks to this record-smashing discount, you can grab the A9 Plus for a mere $159.99.</p><p>Unlike most tablets in this price range, there are honestly very few drawbacks with the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus. Perhaps the biggest issue here is the lack of S Pen stylus support, so if you like to draw or physically write notes on your tablet, you should probably look elsewhere. And sure, if you can spend more, there are certainly more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> out there (the Tab S9 Series immediately comes to mind), but if you&apos;re trying to save a little cash without skimping on useful features, this Galaxy Tab A9 Plus deal is a no-brainer. </p>

<p>As previously stated, the Nothing OS 2.5.5 update is rolling out in a staggered manner to all Phone 2 owners. The company states that while every user will not see the update simultaneously, it allows them to catch problems if they arise.</p><p>The latest update arrives two weeks after the Phone picked up its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-os-2-dot-5-dot-3-update-to-phone-2">2.5.3 update</a>, which included Nothing&apos;s April 2024 security patch. The update brought better icon organization while scrolling through pages. System stability and improvements to the device&apos;s animations were among the update&apos;s notes, as well. Curiously, it seems there&apos;s more to do with the Phone 2&apos;s animations, as the 2.5.5 update brings in more tweaks.</p><p>The latest Nothing OS update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-phone-2a-receives-april-2024-security-patch">arrived on the mid-range</a> Phone 2a on April 16. The device picked up camera changes that should help its color saturation, better optimization for blur accuracy, and overall clarity.</p>

<ul><li>Sony's Japanese website teases the "Xperia Special Event 2024" in Tokyo, Japan on May 17.</li><li>The name alone seems to tease a new Xperia launch, and a "product experience" is also listed in the schedule, furthering this suspicion.</li><li>Sony has yet to announce a launch for the Xperia 1 VI, however, its predecessor was revealed in May 2023, so there's a possibility for the same this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Sony has started teasing a reveal regarding its Xperia flagship phone series as an event in May could hold its official launch.</p><p>Sony launched a new event <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.jp/xperia/special/event/xse2024spring/">splash page</a> promoting the "Xperia Special Event 2024," which is set for May 17 in Tokyo, Japan (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/18/sony-could-launch-the-xperia-1-vi-at-may-17-event/">9to5Google</a>). The details (machine translated) state "Xperia developers introduce the latest features" and that consumers can join in to see them in person.</p><p>The company highlights the event&apos;s itinerary, starting with a reception and then a welcome speech before rolling into a "product experience." While it&apos;s likely that this portion will reveal what "new features" Sony has in store for its Xperia line, it could also reveal its next flagship: the Xperia 1 VI.</p><p>Sony states that the event is limited to 100 people in Japan, and people have until April 30 to apply for a seat in the crowd.</p><p>Sony has yet to announce the existence of the Xperia 1 VI formally, but we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-v-launch">Xperia 1 V</a> to look back on. Last year&apos;s device, aimed at content creators, launched around May 11 — which is close to this year&apos;s planned "Xperia" event in Japan.</p><p>It&apos;s cause for excitement, but nothing is set in stone, so we&apos;ll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>Rumors have surfaced regarding the upcoming flagship entry, with some suggesting it could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperai-1-vi-display-aspect-rumors">drop in display quality</a>. It was stated that the Xperia 1 VI could lose its 4K resolution display in favor of a "2K Plus" or "Quad HD Plus" panel. The former is what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-5-v-launch">Xperia 5 series</a> sports, which is usually seen as an alternative consumers can look to instead of the flagship Xperia 1 series.</p><p>More recently, supposed Xperia 1 VI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xperia-1-vi-renders-have-leaked">renders leaked</a>, and give us a look at an alleged change to its aspect ratio. The device seems to opt for a 19.5:9 ratio instead of the taller 21:9 ratio that the 1 V features. The renderings suggest Sony will continue its boxy design for the phone alongside a vertical triple camera array on the back panel.</p>

<p>The concept itself is interesting enough, but this story wouldn&apos;t be nearly as intriguing if it weren&apos;t presented the right way. There&apos;s no denying the importance and influence of a person like Cheng Shih, who helped push women&apos;s rights forward in her own unique way. But this story, among others in page after page of a boring history book, simply wouldn&apos;t hold the same weight — it certainly never did for me when I was in school!</p><p>That&apos;s why Meta Quest games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5420468924659233/">The Pirate Queen</a> are the future of education. The story of Cheng Shih in The Pirate Queen, which is brought to life by Singer Films Limited & Singer Interactive Limited and award-winning actress Lucy Liu, is one of historical significance, and the main plot points in the game are based on known events. What takes place in between is classic historical fiction, but that&apos;s what made me love the title so much.</p><p>The difference between a historical fiction book — my favorite genre, by the way — and a game like this is being able to experience these events <em>for myself</em>. That first-hand experience not only made them feel real, it made them memorable. That, in and of itself, is the key to why this sort of experience is so important for education.</p>

<p>Meta recently announced that it would begin a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/new-education-product-for-quest-devices/">VR for education initiative</a>, aiming to take off this Fall when school begins anew. The program is designed to provide access to "a range of education-specific apps and features" for teachers, trainers, and school administrators.</p><p>Based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/JerryUddanelse/status/1779965524161769863">my short interaction</a> with Jerry Jackson, a high school teacher who currently uses a suite of Meta Quest 3 headsets in his classroom, it&apos;s about time Meta began focusing on using Quest headsets in schools like Google uses Chromebooks. The forefront of this new program seems to deal with managing multiple Quest devices at once, something Jackson says is sorely needed.</p><p>Meta says its new program will allow teachers to skip the need to prepare headsets individually, allowing students to "pick up the headset and get started right away."</p><p>But what about the content itself? I think titles like The Pirate Queen could play a pivotal role in helping students better understand and empathize with historical characters from all walks of life.</p><p>Android Central&apos;s Shruti Shekar and I had the opportunity to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sites.libsyn.com/23914/the-pirate-queen-interview-with-lucy-liu-eloise-singer">interview Lucy Liu and Eloise Singer</a> as part of the Android Central Podcast. We discussed how the group got started on the idea of The Pirate Queen, how the story became a VR game before it started being made into a movie, and how VR experiences can be used to help you feel and understand the personal plight of another human being.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6kmVDTPWM9UFFusy9A8j2f" name="the-pirate-queen-official-screenshot-shrine.jpg" alt="Official screenshots from The Pirate Queen running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6kmVDTPWM9UFFusy9A8j2f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Singer Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My life experience has often been one with little discrimination or hardship. While I consider myself a compassionate individual, there&apos;s only <em>so much</em> I can do to truly empathize with stories of humans who have struggled throughout history. But VR can at least help me do better by putting me in the shoes of a person and having me live out at least a small portion of their life.</p><p>In 2019, Felix & Paul Studios published an immersive film called Traveling While Black. You can watch it for free on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/1931356740318898">Meta Quest TV app</a>, along with plenty of other films, and it&apos;ll take less than 20 minutes of your time.</p><p>This film was the first time I experienced the feelings that come with first-person immersion into another person&apos;s story. Yet, it&apos;s still mainly told from the perspective of a person sitting and talking to another person. I imagine it would have been an even more powerful story if I had actually seen it through the eyes of one of the people.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The game focuses entirely on the female lead character and her struggles, creating a "whole new genre" for pirates in the entertainment space.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Eloise Singer, the game&apos;s director, told us that "female hands didn&apos;t exist in VR at the time that we started developing the game." Since then, we&apos;ve seen some prominent female roles appear in VR — the foremost is Half-Life: Alyx, of course — but most of Alyx&apos;s hands are covered in gravity gloves.</p><p>In The Pirate Queen, Cheng Shih&apos;s hands are fully modeled to look like female hands, including rings and adorning jewelry that make her feel like a pirate. Initially, Singer and the rest of the development team were told that including hands that looked so feminine would keep male players from wanting to play the game.</p><p>Ridiculous sounding or not, the fact that any sort of pushback happened at all speaks volumes about the "disparity of what people think they want and what people are willing to try," as Liu put it. She notes that "only about 20% of games feature female leads," despite statistics showing that females make up roughly half of the gaming population.</p>

<p>The Pirate Queen is immersive in a different way, but it still attempts to tell the story of discrimination against a group of people. Women&apos;s rights were nary a concern among the men who ran society at the time, and even among lawless pirates, it doesn&apos;t seem many were convinced that a woman could be in charge of a fleet of hundreds of ships.</p><p>The game takes around two hours to beat and focuses solely on the night that Cheng Shih came to power. As Lucy Liu told us in the interview, "It&apos;s not one of those shoot-em-up kind of games." This is more of a narrative adventure designed for people who appreciate immersive narratives. It&apos;s not a game that&apos;s going to appeal to someone looking for nonstop action or addictive gameplay loops.</p><p>As such, I&apos;d recommend taking your time in each of the game&apos;s thirteen chapters. Walk and look around each room and pick up the objects on the shelves and in the cabinets. Take a moment to listen to Lucy Liu&apos;s brilliant narration of the tale. If you do, I promise you&apos;ll learn something you&apos;ve never known.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>This is essentially a feature-length film packaged in an interactive way.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It&apos;s these moments that really make the adventure shine, and it&apos;s important to know what you&apos;re getting. This is essentially a feature-length film packaged in an interactive way. You&apos;ll not only be learning about Cheng Shih&apos;s story — a woman also known as Zheng Yi Sao, which means "Wife of Zheng Yi" — but about Chinese history and the women who may have gone unnoticed during that time.</p><p>As director Eloise Singer said, "you are literally stepping into the shoes of The Pirate Queen."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hi9RxtUUyd7BeVZ2MHQame" name="the-pirate-queen-official-screenshot-shrine-outside.jpg" alt="Official screenshots from The Pirate Queen running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hi9RxtUUyd7BeVZ2MHQame.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Singer Studios)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, I knew about the horrific practice of bound feet but never quite grasped how small one of these boots was until I played the game. Picking one up from the table, I originally thought it might be a tea cup or something similar. Imagine the horror when I found out a woman&apos;s feet might have to fit inside.</p><p>So many objects scattered throughout the story have substantial meaning that delivers an important historical narrative and context that I might otherwise not appreciate if I weren&apos;t holding them in my hands. Surprisingly, the impact of these stories wasn&apos;t reduced despite the lackluster visual quality.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I enjoyed the escape room-style puzzles and the subtle hints when I got stuck.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I also appreciated the light escape room-style gameplay design here. I&apos;m a person who <em>loves</em> puzzle games and jumps at the chance to enjoy one whenever I can. Most of the rooms were simple, and I often solved the puzzles before Ms. Liu&apos;s narrative finished, but there were a few times when I wasn&apos;t sure how to progress, and the game gently nudged me to the right item.</p><p>These cleverly placed whisps of smoke or rattling doors felt like they fit well into the narrative instead of providing a giant glowing arrow to help me brainlessly meander to the next room.</p><p>After all, a game like The Pirate Queen isn&apos;t designed to be finished quickly. It&apos;s designed to be savored and appreciated.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ttrdsQbB9RDtPa5Msgf3SU" name="sora-schools-vr-davinci.jpg" alt="Sora schools' VR education apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ttrdsQbB9RDtPa5Msgf3SU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sora schools)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many parents who were forced to enroll in virtual school during COVID will tell you that hands-on education is generally better than staring at a laptop for hours on end. Virtual school works quite well for some students but is a very poor choice for others when done on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>.</p><p>But if more kids had access to quality VR curriculum, I believe the idea of virtual schooling could be turned on its head. Just as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/why-are-chores-more-fun-in-vr">gamification of chores</a> makes them more fun, the gamification of education — providing incentives to encourage progression — is probably the best way to make it enjoyable.</p><p>I had a chat with Garrett Smiley, CEO of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://soraschools.com/">Sora Schools</a>, who talked to me briefly about how the school is working to implement a VR curriculum into its virtual-only school structure.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BTfMDxqTJs8SobZv5C9GpU" name="sora-schools-vr-curriculum.jpg" alt="Sora schools' VR education apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BTfMDxqTJs8SobZv5C9GpU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sora schools)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I&apos;m not sure the school is currently allowing students to play through interactive narratives like The Pirate Queen, the examples I was given seem far more convincing than watching someone teach through a Zoom meeting on a flat display.</p><p>Smiley was quick to note that most of his school&apos;s VR curriculum was optional and supplemental but nonetheless intriguing and truly interesting.</p><p>"At Sora, we&apos;re super excited about how VR and AR are shaking things up in the world of learning," Smiley told me in the interview. "In the next few years, this technology will no longer be a dream but an everyday reality. These gadgets are getting cheaper and more powerful, so they will be accessible to more people.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re on a continuous mission to make learning interesting. Imagine diving into our Sora Catalog of Expeditions and feeling like you&apos;re there. Whether you&apos;re learning from historical characters, diving deep into the ocean, or even walking on Mars, we&apos;re all about making it fun, interactive, and igniting curiosity in students."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Seeing is believing, and being able to hold something in your hands makes it even more memorable and personal.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Thankfully, those of us with VR headsets don&apos;t have to wait to experience great content that can <em>also</em> be educational. My very first room-scale VR experience was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/pcvr/984294025016007/">the Blu</a> by WEVR. I played it on an HTC Vive at IFA 2015 in Belin and was blown away at the true size of a blue whale that swam over my head. You can play it today with a decent gaming PC capable of VR.</p><p>Games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/7146257325418969">Terra Alia</a> take the gamification of education in a literal sense, dropping you into an RPG that teaches you a new language. This one is also a bit short, but the developers are working on updates and more content that&apos;ll be added free of charge.</p><p>Thankfully, the multiplayer beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TerraAlia/comments/1biu38c/get_ready_to_level_up_your_language_skills_with/"><em>just launched</em></a>, showing that the developers are serious about keeping the game updated and relevant.</p><p>Even the environments and ships you&apos;ll be on in The Pirate Queen are realistically recreated. Singer told us that "every ship was designed to be historically accurate." After the team had originally started modeling the ships with wood and nails, it was learned that ships in China at the time only used dovetail joints. That meant everything had to be redesigned, but it also ensured the game ended up being more historically accurate.</p><p>Seeing is believing, and being able to hold something in your hands makes it even more memorable and personal. Titles like these help people learn better, feel more empathetic toward historical figures and events, and make education fun. It&apos;s a win-win for everyone involved, and I encourage you to give these titles a try!</p>
