<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a>, the latest budget entry in the Google Pixel line, joins the Google Pixel 8 and Google Pixel 8 Pro. Like its bigger siblings, it promises seven years of OS and security updates as well as Feature Drops. This means the phone will be “current” until 2031. </p><p>Loaded with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, it offers the same OS as the other two phones in the line that launched last year. Like the others, Feature Drops are included, and this assurance means you will be able to load and enjoy new features on the phone for the same length of time. Google launches Feature Drops consistently, several times per year, so the phone will always provide a fresh, new experience. </p><p>The Google Pixel 8a, which will likely rank among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">the best cheap Android phones</a>, is about as powerful as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, although not so much the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> with its 12GB of RAM. Still, it’s a decent phone that users will want to keep for years. With that said, if you do decide to upgrade, the option to resell or trade-in the device, or even hand it down to a friend or family member, helps extend the investment and add value. With so many years of support, the phone will retain more of its value than a device that only supports a few years of OS and/or security updates, for example, and is considered outdated by the time you’re ready to upgrade. </p><p>You could purchase the Google Pixel 8a, for example, use it for a few years, then hand it over to a family member. Upgrade to something more powerful if you decide you need something else or if you have saved up for a higher-end phone. Parents will especially love the lengthy support since you can confidently invest in this phone for one child and hand it down to the next when they come of age without worrying that it won’t be supported by the latest OS or, more importantly, security updates. </p><p>It should be noted that Google offers a shorter software promise with its older, recent Pixel phones and devices, which only span three OS upgrades and five years of updates, making this is an important selling point for the Pixel 8a. Keep the phone protected in a great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-cases">Pixel 8a case</a>, add a screen protector, and this phone will not only look but also operate like new for many years to come.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google has streamlined the process of setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) for Workspace users.</li><li>Users can now set up two-step verification without needing to provide a phone number.</li><li>Even if 2FA is disabled in your Google account settings, your previously enrolled second steps and backup codes will now be preserved, rather than being deleted.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is making it easier to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for Workspace users, so admins can more easily encourage members to turn on 2FA.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/05/updates-for-configuring-two-step-verification-for-your-google-account.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Google announced that you can now set up two-step verification without a phone number. Instead, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-two-factor-authentication-google-account">secure your account with either the Google Authenticator app</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/adding-security-key-your-google-account-good-idea-and-heres-how-do-it">physical security key</a>. Both options offer an extra layer of protection and make it much harder for hackers to gain access, even if they steal your password.</p><p>Before, you had to give out your phone number to set up two-step verification. Nowadays, many people hesitate to share their phone numbers because of privacy concerns. Let&apos;s face it, relying solely on SMS codes isn&apos;t the most secure approach.</p><p>While SMS verification for 2FA is better than nothing, it&apos;s not foolproof. Google itself warns in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839#zippy=%2Cuse-a-verification-code-from-a-text-message-or-call" target="_blank">support document</a> that codes sent via text messages can be vulnerable to hacks targeting phone numbers.</p><p>The latest update allows you to skip the less secure SMS method and remove it entirely from your security setup. By letting you ditch the phone number altogether, you&apos;re opting for more secure methods like an authenticator app or security key.</p><p>Furthermore, users who use hardware security keys now have two options on the "Passkeys and security keys" page. They can either register a FIDO1 credential on their security key or create a passkey.</p><p>If you have a managed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> account, you might still need to log in with your password, depending on your administrators&apos; setup.</p><p>Another update is that your "enrolled second steps" will now remain intact. Previously, if you turned off two-step verification in your Google account settings, all second-step methods and saved backup codes would be deleted. Now, these will be saved even if you disable 2FA.</p><p>However, if an admin turns off 2FA for a member, all related security measures will still be removed, maintaining a thorough security system as before.</p><p>Google has begun rolling out the update to both Workspace customers and personal account users.</p>

The tech is still in its infancy, but there are legitimate use cases where AI makes a difference — transcribing notes, generating summaries, image editing, and so on.</p><p>It&apos;s no surprise, then, that Qualcomm is getting in on the action. The chip manufacturer unveiled the AI Hub back at Mobile World Congress, and it is a platform of AI models that can easily be deployed by developers on devices running Qualcomm hardware, including Snapdragon 8-powered phones and various IoT devices.</p><p>With AI Hub, Qualcomm is making it easier for developers to utilize AI models into their existing services with a minimum of effort. The idea is to provide access to on-device AI utilities on portable devices, and as such the models that Qualcomm is integrating into AI Hub target use cases like image recognition and editing, generating images from text prompts, automatic speech recognition, and so on.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mFERrZktAxxxyeDafaSfJd" name="qualcomm-sahil.jpg" alt="Sahil Arora, Qualcomm India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mFERrZktAxxxyeDafaSfJd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To get a better understanding of what the brand is trying to achieve, I talked to Sahil Arora, Qualcomm India&apos;s Senior Business Development Manager, on the sidelines of the Qualcomm India Developer Conference. We started out with the basics: how does AI Hub benefit developers?</p><p>"We are taking on a lot of workload that&apos;s usually handled by application developers, and this makes it easier for them to get going with AI. So if a developer wants to use any particular AI model, we already have it available in the AI Hub, and these models are pre-optimized and pre-tuned; they just need to use a sample application to get started. In just five codes of line, they can get started with an AI model," said Arora. "We are basically helping developers to focus on coming up with new and innovative use cases instead of putting efforts into integrating tools and AI models into their workflow."</p><p>What&apos;s interesting about the way Qualcomm is positioning AI Hub is that if a developer wants to run their own models, they can do so easily. "If a developer has already worked on a particular AI model and wants to use it on a device, they can just publish it to the AI Hub and integrate it seamlessly," noted Arora. AI Hub models target Snapdragon 8 series devices — including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> — and Qualcomm&apos;s IoT platforms, and the chip vendor is set to launch these models on its Snapdragon X series in the coming months.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="paYxFADwQuqdWLubvkhEmG" name="xiaomi14-ultra-30.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paYxFADwQuqdWLubvkhEmG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AI Hub launched with 75 AI models, and it now has 95 models available to choose from, including the likes of Stable Diffusion, Whisper, ControlNet, and Baichuan 7B. While it&apos;s great that these tools are easily accessible, I wanted to know how they&apos;ll affect end users. "With these utilities, developers can easily offer extensive personalization and customization options — such as expanding an existing picture&apos;s backdrop, AI translation, or creating AI-assisted backgrounds — without having to turn to the cloud." said Arora.</p><p>A big part of AI Hub&apos;s allure is that the included models are primarily run on-device; Qualcomm showcased use cases like image object eraser on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">OPPO Find X7 Ultra</a>, AI-assisted image expansion with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, and AI-powered video editing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a>. Arora noted that Qualcomm sees itself as a "technology enabler," and that it delivers the tools that allows its partners to come up with unique use cases. "AI Hub isn&apos;t a customer-facing feature, but it has the ability to impact a lot of consumers."</p><p>The best part about AI Hub is that Qualcomm isn&apos;t charging a license to use the included AI models; they&apos;re free to use by all developers. By focusing on generative AI use cases on mobile devices, Qualcomm is looking to offer another layer of differentiation with its Snapdragon chipsets, and with the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> touted to deliver sizeable gains in this area, it will be interesting to see what next-gen phones have to offer.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The CMF Phone 1 is expected to be more affordable than Nothing's current budget models, with a starting price of around INR 12,000 ($140).</li><li>The phone is reported to feature a 6.5-inch display with Gorilla Glass protection, a single rear camera, and a MediaTek Dimensity 5G SoC.</li><li>It will likely run on a version of Nothing OS that doesn't have all the features of the OS on higher-end models.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new leak just uncovered details about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-by-nothing-first-phone-rumors">CMF by Nothing&apos;s upcoming phone</a>, and it might be cheaper than Nothing&apos;s usual budget models.</p><p>Nothing&apos;s sub-brand CMF has been keeping a low profile <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/cmf-by-nothing-september-reveal-date">since its debut</a>, focusing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cmf-by-nothing-buds-pro-watch-pro-announced">budget-friendly devices like a smartwatch and earbuds</a>. Now, it seems the company is gearing up to enter the smartphone race, with a new model expected to launch later this year.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-cmf-phone-1-specifications-price-expected/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a> reports that CMF by Nothing’s next phone will be called the CMF Phone 1. It&apos;s said to sport a plastic body and be available in three colors: black, white, and orange.</p><p>This release might not make huge waves, but if the latest report holds true, the starting price sure could. According to the report, the CMF Phone 1 is set to retail at around INR12,000, which is about $140.</p><p>Compared to the Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a>, which retails at $349, it sounds like the CMF Phone 1 will be a more affordable entry-level option, positioned a tier below Nothing&apos;s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget Android offering</a>.</p><p>The CMF Phone 1 is rumored to include a decent-sized 6.5-inch display with some Gorilla Glass for protection. On the back, there&apos;s supposedly a single camera, but details about the sensor are still under wraps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:768px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eoWxTAa3MGhUPdsxN4PuHc" name="CMF-phone-1.jpg" alt="CMF phone 1 render with orange back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eoWxTAa3MGhUPdsxN4PuHc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="768" height="432" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Under the hood, the CMF Phone 1 might come equipped with a MediaTek Dimensity 5G chipset. Plus, it&apos;s rumored to include a 5,000mAh battery that supports 33W fast charging.</p><p>The leak also suggests the phone might run a stripped-down version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-os-2-review">Nothing OS</a>, so don&apos;t expect all the bells and whistles. But at least the report says the sub-brand is promising three years of software updates and four years of security patches.</p><p>This is all based on leaks, so there&apos;s a lot we still don&apos;t know for sure. The actual design could be a big deal for people deciding if they want this phone.</p>

The Xiaomi 14 isn&apos;t far behind either, and it has a smaller form factor that&apos;s ideal if you need a compact device.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> and 14 Ultra are now on sale globally, and it looks like both devices have issues with condensation getting inside the camera housing, fogging up the lenses and making it difficult to take photos or videos. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1bam5fk/xiaomi_14_water_condensation_inside_cameras/">several</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1b314x0/xiaomi_14s_camera_lens_is_fogging/">threads</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1bqf9wa/xiaomi_needs_to_release_a_statement_regarding_the/">on Reddit</a> detailing the issue, and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Xiaomi-Ultra-Black-Smartphone-Snapdragon/dp/B0CRFV83FW">Amazon UK listing</a> is littered with customers having the same problem.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t seem to be an isolated incident either, with last year&apos;s Xiaomi 13T Pro also seeing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/170sfq0/is_condensation_inside_the_camera_lens_normal_on/">similar issues</a>. For what it&apos;s worth, my Xiaomi 14 and 14 Ultra don&apos;t have this issue, and I used both devices extensively. It looks like the problem is particularly noticeable in European markets, and it doesn&apos;t seem to affect other regions as much. That&apos;s understandable; condensation tends to form in situations where there&apos;s a rapid difference in temperature, so users in colder countries tend to be affected.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wcutUTnENk8UNbSzv6RX2C" name="xiaomi14-ultra-9.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wcutUTnENk8UNbSzv6RX2C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, it shouldn&apos;t occur on $1,000 phones; both the Xiaomi 14 and 14 Ultra have IP68 ingress protection, so they should have seals to prevent water ingress into any part of the phone. What makes this situation annoying is that Xiaomi doesn&apos;t seem to think there is an issue with its flagship devices getting lens condensation, noting that it is not a "product quality issue" and that it is a "natural phenomenon."</p><p>In a statement to Android Central, Xiaomi said:</p><p>"Xiaomi 14 Series are tested in our labs to deliver dust ingress and water spray protection."</p><p>"We reassure it is not a product quality issue. Instead, it is a natural phenomenon to encounter camera lens fog-up due to temperature differences between the lens and the surrounding air under some specific user environment. This is more common in situations where ambient temperature switches rapidly from high temperature to low temperature, long exposure to high temperature with high humidity, or water damage."</p><p>"If you experience lens fog, we recommend you leave your device in a dry area with airflow to help alleviate moisture."</p>

<p>Xiaomi&apos;s solution to use the device in a dry area doesn&apos;t do anything; I got a faulty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-nord-2-review">OnePlus Nord 2</a> that had a similar issue with the inside of the camera lens fogging up, and no matter what I did, it would return after a few days. The only thing that worked was getting a new unit.</p><p>If you bought a Xiaomi 14 or 14 Ultra that has lens condensation and are trying to get a refund because of the lens fogging up, there&apos;s a good chance it won&apos;t work — Xiaomi needs to acknowledge that there&apos;s an issue in the first place. But if you&apos;re able to, you should turn in the device and get another unit.</p>

<ul><li>Chrome is seen testing a new "Browser health" option that will help with improving user experience and browser slowdowns.</li><li>This option will be added to a dedicated "performance" panel on the main menu for easier access, along with the battery saver and memory saver tools.</li><li>Chrome seems to be following Microsoft Edge's footsteps, as the panel looks a lot like Edge's "Browser Essential" hub.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Ever get annoyed when you are in peak work mode with multiple tabs open on Chrome and the dreaded feeling when you see the "stop responding" message? This experience can slow down productivity as the browser might be using too many resources. Google is trying to help you keep up with your daily activities by adding this new performance tool to their browser.</p><p>Chrome has been revamping itself with new extensions and features, and with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gains-more-google-assistant-features">powerful tools like Gemini </a>added to the mix, it is sure to take up some room in the browser. To ensure better execution, a new "Browser health" section was spotted by a tipster on X, who goes by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64">Leopeva64.</a></p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I GUESS this new "Browser Health" section will be similar to Edge's "Browser Essential" hub and will show you recommended actions to improve the memory and CPU consumption of your open tabs: pic.twitter.com/RmJvF5NIhW<a href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64/status/1787191383113060395">May 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The new option will join the Memory Saver and Battery saver, tools that are tucked away inside the Performance page in the "More tools" submenu. However, now, it looks like this is expected to become a standalone "Performance" panel, helping users track the web browser&apos;s overall performance without leaving the current page.</p><p>From the screenshots, it looks like the Browser health option will offer users easy access to recommendations on how to improve the memory and CPU usage of their open tabs. This is something that we all look forward to when Chrome gets cluttered, especially since the browser can often use up a lot of RAM.</p><p>The tipster adds that this feature resembles Edge&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/browser-essentials?form=MA13FJ">"Browser Essential" hub</a>, which includes features like a Performance detector, sleeping tabs, and efficiency mode. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google will move the "Performance" entry to the main menu (it was previously hidden in the "More tools" submenu), and the "Memory Saver" and "Battery Saver" sections have already been added to the Performance panel (Chrome Canary):https://t.co/xqfhZU9Wcphttps://t.co/OyC1fWt2sc pic.twitter.com/jc8Q7Pj1fa<a href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64/status/1727378428880716091">November 22, 2023</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>It remains unclear when Google is set to roll out this option, as this was spotted on Chrome Canary. However, the company seems to be making a clear statement about keeping Chrome slowdowns to a minimum with this performance panel.</p>

<h2 id="it-doesn-apos-t-cost-much-to-get-the-best-google-pixel-8a-screen-protection-2">It doesn&apos;t cost much to get the best Google Pixel 8a screen protection</h2>
<p>Much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-deals-how-to-buy">excellent pricing of the Pixel 8a</a>, its accessories also give you bang for your buck. None of the best Google Pixel 8a screen protectors cost more than $10, and these are all multipacks we&apos;re talking about. This gives you spares for emergencies or to share with family and friends.</p><p>Before buying a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> screen protector, make up your mind about whether you want something made of glass or plastic. Plastic refers to TPU and PET films, which can be surprisingly reliable. They don&apos;t offer better shatter-proofing than tempered glass, but plastic films can self-heal from minor scratches and they are much thinner so you get better touch sensitivity.</p><p>When it comes to tempered glass screen guards for the Pixel 8a, you have an insanely wide array of options. The JETech Screen Protector 3-Pack is the best overall pick in this category at the moment. You get high-grade tempered glass screen protectors with oleophobic properties. This means each of the three screen protectors in the box repels liquids and solids, so they stay squeaky clean. JETech also gives you an installation frame, so you can easily apply the screen guards by yourself at home without misaligning them or getting air bubbles.</p><p>If you prefer flexible films that can heal small scrapes and abrasions, Supershieldz has a budget-friendly three-pack of PET films you should check out. Films are super thin so they offer higher touch response as opposed to tempered glass. This set is case-friendly too, so you don&apos;t have to worry about compatibility issues with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-cases">Pixel 8a case</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>The next Galaxy foldables should launch as early as July and new information indicates critical changes are coming to the Galaxy Z Fold 6’s cover screen ahead of the launch.</p><p>According to a reliable tipster, Ice Universe on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-aims-for-sweet-spot-wider-galaxy-z-fold-6-cover-screen/">SamMobile</a>), the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> will likely have a wider cover screen than the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>. The tipster indicates that the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 6 could have a cover screen measuring 60.2mm in width instead of the 57.4mm from the previous iteration.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Galaxy Z Fold6's external screen width is 60.2mm, while the Fold5's external screen width is 57.4mm. Therefore, you can get a wider external screen, which is beneficial to the experience, but not too wide. pic.twitter.com/j2eLPJELx4<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1787832306788601917">May 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Ice Universe managed to share the possible third-party screen protectors of the Z Fold 6, which has not only revealed the size of the cover screen but has also further indicated that it will have a flatter surface and squared corners rather than rounded from the previous model.</p><p>After three years, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 may get a better and larger cover screen if the third-party screen protector that the tipster provided is accurate. This is because the cover screens of the previous three generations of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> were nearly identical.</p><p>While it sounds too good to be true, it will be encouraging to see if Samsung opts for it. A wider cover screen also means wider real estate; thus, the use case should be much easier, similar to what we have seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a>.</p>

<p>In another recent X post, Ice Universe shared some interesting details about the foldable screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 6. This time, The folding screen will likely look more squarish when unfolded in a design similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>. Besides, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-renders-leak">first renders</a> of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 also indicated similar design elements.</p><p>In April, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 was also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-display-sizes-and-weight-tipped">tipped</a> to be thinner and lighter than the predecessor as it is expected to weigh 239 grams, down from 256 grams on the Z Fold 5. In terms of thickness, the drive should likely measure 5.6mm (unfolded) and 12.1mm (in folded state); in comparison, the previous iteration measures 6.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has just wrapped up the launch of the new Pixel 8a and the Pixel Tablet. On the other hand, the company has also put out the May update to its Pixel phones today (May 7).</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/273300936/google-pixel-update-may-2024?hl=en&sjid=9398719716867767018-AP">community post</a>, Google announced the update rollout to Pixel devices running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, including Pixel 5a and above. The global versions of these handsets carry <strong>AP1A.240505.004/005</strong> builds and also include the Pixel Tablet. While the rollout begins today, Google says it will continue in phases over the next week, depending on the carrier and handset model.</p>

<p>While the May update includes the latest security patch, it brings in bug fixes and improvements for Pixel users. The improvements can be seen in the stability or performance of Bluetooth LE audio for the aforementioned Pixel devices, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> and Pixel Tablet.                                                                                                                                              </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> owners who faced issues in camera performance under certain scenarios, such as when recording a video, a new fix has been included in the latest update.</p>
<p>The latest Pixel phones update follows the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-may-2024-update">Pixel Watch</a> update that came in earlier today.

<p>Vivo has confirmed that its upcoming X100 Ultra and the X100s series will arrive on May 13.</p><p>The company highlighted as much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1809745371/OcZJNAQ6u">on Weibo</a>, while also giving consumers a decent look at what the devices will look like (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fonearena.com/blog/423138/vivo-x100-ultra-launch-date-x100s-x100s-pro.html">fonearena</a>). The X100 Ultra continues Vivo&apos;s trend of a large circular triple-camera housing array in the center of its back panel. However, the lenses are in a square formation rather than a diamond, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a>.</p><p>Vivo&apos;s confirmation video shows that Zeiss still powers the device&apos;s camera system. Moreover, the back paneling has been upgraded with a glossier finish, rather than the matte look the Pro model delivers. The upcoming X100 Ultra also appears to have a slightly curved display along its edges, as well.</p>

<p>The publication mentioned rumors which suggest the Ultra variant will be powered by Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC. The camera housing is speculated to hold a 50MP LYT-900 primary lens, a periscope lens, and a 200MP telephoto lens with an f/2.67 aperture.</p><p>Known Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OcZyzbRzx">Digital Chat Station</a> chimed in, suggesting the Ultra will arrive in Black, Titanium, and White colorways. Additionally, the device could arrive for consumers with the following RAM/internal storage setups: 12/256GB, 16/512GB, and 16/1TB.</p><p>For its 1TB option, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/3108827753/Od07R1kAT">pricing leak</a> suggested consumers could see an 8,499 yuan ($1,180) price tag (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://playfuldroid.com/vivo-x100-ultra-x100s-x100s-pro-are-launching-on-may-13-prices-leaked/">PlayfulDroid</a>).

<p>The X100s and X100s Pro are rumored to feature a 6.7-inch display, similar to the Pro variant from 2023. Unlike the upcoming Ultra model, Vivo&apos;s teaser shows that the X100s series will sport flat edges and sides. Internally, the devices are expected to arrive powered by MediaTek&apos;s recently debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">Dimensity 9300 Plus</a> chipset. The chip launched today (May 7), featuring higher clock speeds and better AI processing over the base 9300.</p><p>Vivo is keeping the design theme consistent across these two new additions with the centered circular camera array.</p><p>The company is suggested to offer the base X100s model with the following RAM/internal storage options: 12/256GB, 16/256GB, 16/512GB, and 16/1TB. The device should be available in black, blue, titanium, and white colorways. The X100s Pro is expected to have the same RAM/storage options; however, its colorways will drop the blue option.</p><p>Similarly, the pricing leak states the 1TB option for the X100s and X100s Pro could pick up a 5,199 yuan ($720) and 6,199 yuan ($855) tag, respectively.</p><p>We&apos;re one week away from Vivo&apos;s debut event on May 13. At that event, we&apos;ll learn more concrete details about these upcoming flagship phones.</p>
