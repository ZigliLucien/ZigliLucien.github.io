<p>If you&apos;re like me, using a Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel, or Apple iPhone has become increasingly difficult due to these phones&apos; use of flickering displays. The OLED panels that power these devices sure look nice, but unfortunately for us, our eyes and brains just don&apos;t like how they operate.</p><p>Thankfully, several options on the market offer a great experience without sacrificing processing power, camera quality, or overall experience. We&apos;re working to deliver the best guide for PWM/Flicker-sensitive people to make an informed buying decision and are aiming to include phones from every product category and price range.</p><p>I&apos;ve tested a lot of phones over the years and have been specifically testing phones for flicker sensitivity since originally posting about becoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">PWM-sensitive</a> in mid-2023. Many of these phones are also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, and some, surprisingly, even use OLED displays. If you&apos;re extremely sensitive to flickering and PWM dimming, it&apos;s safe to say most phones with OLED displays are likely not in your future.</p><p>Some upcoming phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/embargo-226-2-am-et-tcls-50-series-phones-will-debut-in-north-america-starting-q2-2024">TCL 50 series</a> sport "paperlike" LCD displays that use no PWM according <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtube.com/shorts/NJBf31yQFao?si=mLdpBbiNTrWphvXl">to my brief testing</a> at MWC 2024. Look forward to those if you need an LCD-based upgrade this year.</p><p>People who are sensitive to display flicker aren&apos;t all sensitive to the same problems, so what works for one person may not work for another. I&apos;ve included as much information as I can on each phone to help you make the best decision.</p>

<p>Motorola has taken a massive turn for the better in 2023, and part of that is thanks to its excellent displays. The pOLED in the Motorola Edge+ (2023) is super eye-friendly, particularly with Motorola's flicker-reduction setting enabled.</p>

<p>Motorola took us by surprise this year when it released the Motorola Edge Plus (2023). Motorola&apos;s premium phones had been struggling in recent years so it was refreshing to see Motorola not only release a phone with such stellar hardware but also back that hardware up with a four-year software update promise and a PWM-friendly OLED display.</p><p>Motorola sells this model as the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) in the U.S. and as the Motorola Edge 40 Pro in most of the rest of the world. It&apos;s also sold in China as the Moto X40.</p><p>Motorola debuted a relatively new flicker-reduction option with the Edge Plus (2023) that ensures the phone&apos;s display is on 99.51% of the time during the duty cycle. In practice, this is identical to DC dimming, which means the phone is actually reducing the voltage to the OLED diodes instead of using PWM flickering to fake a dimmer display.</p>

<p>As is telling from light flicker measurements, the brightness dips a little bit each time the display refreshes. In this case, the display is refreshing at around 120Hz. This is normal for all DC-dimmed OLED displays.</p><p>As long as the flicker reduction feature is enabled, the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) never switches to PWM dimming, even at the lowest brightness settings. Because of this, you might notice some display noise that looks a bit like an old 35mm movie. That&apos;s because OLED diodes have difficulty showing consistent brightness levels and color when voltage is reduced.</p><p>The upside is that the display doesn&apos;t flicker or use PWM to manage these negative factors, meaning it&apos;s a lot more comfortable to look at.</p><p>If you disable the flicker reduction feature, you&apos;ll see that 720Hz PWM dimming is used below 35% brightness. Check out the video below to see it in action.</p>

<p>This is my personal favorite premium phone and I have no comfort issues from using this phone all day long.</p><p>Aside from just having a comfortable display, the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) is a downright amazing phone. It&apos;s got a blazing-fast Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, plus 2-day battery life and those timeless Motorola features that make using Motorola phones so convenient.</p><p>The camera could be better but it&apos;s surprised me more than a few times.

<p>The Xiaomi 13 is a community pick and the one that best fits in the category of best international premium phone. We&apos;ve had the pleasure of reviewing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-13-ultra-global-review">Xiaomi 13 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-13-pro-review">Xiaomi 13 Pro</a>, and Android Central&apos;s Harish Jonnalagadda also has the regular Xiaomi 13 as well, so we&apos;re familiar with the software and overall phone experience.</p><p>But the smaller (and less expensive) Xiaomi 13 is the one to pick for PWM-sensitive folks. Out of the box, it utilizes a 1,920Hz PWM OLED display, but you can enable DC dimming by selecting the "anti-flicker" setting in the display options.</p><p>Graphs from the same Opple Light Master light meter I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://yourphonehurts.com/xiaomi-13/">can be found here</a>, and you can see the difference between the two modes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1P44y1U7tj/">in this video</a>.</p><p>Aside from a vision-friendly display, you&apos;re getting a cutting-edge Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, great battery life, and faster charging than anything offered by Google, Apple, or Samsung.</p><p>It&apos;s also got a great camera â even if it&apos;s not as good as the Xiaomi 13 Pro or Ultra models â and MIUI is always feature-packed and updated regularly.</p><p>The phone is clearly styled after the iPhone with its shiny, flat sides. This is something that people will either love or hate, as is evidenced by the constant design changes back and forth over the years. MIUI is also extremely Apple "inspired" and has always been a sort of iOS clone since its inception.</p>

<p>If camera performance is the most important part of a smartphone for you, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-camera-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro&apos;s camera</a> will seriously blow you away. Not only are everyday shots from the 50MP main camera and 180MP telephoto camera incredible, but the phone&apos;s software is smart enough to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-photography-oppo-honor-mwc-2024">take pictures for you</a>.</p><p>But before we get into all that, let&apos;s go over the display because this is one <em>weird</em> OLED panel. First off, it&apos;s capable of emitting an eye-searing 5,000 nits of brightness at its peak, something it regularly staves from by utilizing DC-like dimming to keep the eye pain at bay.</p><p>But the weird thing is that Honor uses a 360Hz backplane for its DC-like dimming structure, which means it might feel more like 360Hz PWM dimming to some people.</p>

<p>At 100% brightness, the display uses a moderate 17% modulation rate which is 3x deeper than the Motorola Edge Plus 2023 at the same brightness. It&apos;s nowhere near phones like the Galaxy S23 Ultra or Google Pixel Fold with their 99% modulation rate at full brightness, but it&apos;s not quite as good a some others on this list.</p><p>But when you drop the display to 30% brightness and below, something very odd happens. The 4,320Hz PWM rate kicks in below 30% brightness but it&apos;s interwoven with the same 360Hz DC-like dimming method from higher brightness levels.</p><p>The effect is so strange that my Opple Light Master IV can&apos;t pick it up at all and reads it as 360Hz all the way to 0% brightness. Despite what my measurement instrument is telling me, a high speed camera shutter proves that the phone does use 4,320Hz PWM dimming below 30% brightess.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_QUgEftJtMQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>For me, this display was super comfortable from the moment I started using it. Thus far, this has been my main phone since I began using it in early February 2024 and I have yet to feel any discomfort form the display.</p><p>In fact, this is one of the few phones I&apos;ve been able to use with auto brightness enabled. The consistency that the 360Hz frequency delivers is likely the reason for this as it helps emulate a sine wave pattern similar to an incandescent bulb.</p><p>Beyond the display, I&apos;ve mostly enjoyed using the phone and heartily recommend it over past Honor phones. While Magic OS is still very iOS-heavy in its design, Magic OS 8.0 overhauled the UI and fixed a lot of problems I had with previous Honor Magic OS releases. It no longer feels clunky and outdated, even if I don&apos;t care for the iOS style split notification panels and some other UI elements.</p><p>I&apos;ve had my fair share of quirks along the way though, including a sometimes unresponsive app drawer and the occasional notification that&apos;ll get missed. If you pick one up, make sure you disable all the nonsense power saving "features" that are enabled by default and enable notifications on all apps. Otherwise, you&apos;ll end up missing a lot.</p><p>The phone sports some seriously incredible performance and battery life even when you disable the silly power saving features, though. Honor is using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-battery-life">new type of battery</a> with the phone and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor soars through every test imaginable. It&apos;s a bit win overall, despite the quirks.</p>

<p>The worst part about being a fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">folding phones</a> is when you&apos;re also someone who&apos;s sensitive to display flicker. Most folding phones use Samsung AMOLED panels, and, as a result, most of them flicker <em>a lot</em>. Motorola uses pOLED panels by LG, and these allow for proper DC dimming at high brightness levels.</p><p>Motorola&apos;s flicker reduction option in display settings further helps keep things under control, but that doesn&apos;t mean this phone will work for everyone who is flicker-sensitive.</p><p>As you can see from the charts below, the phone uses refresh rate-locked DC dimming for the OLED panel, meaning there&apos;s a slight dip in brightness every time the screen refreshes. Dropping the refresh rate to 60Hz may make this phone more comfortable for some folks since the dips happen less often.</p>

<p>But, even with DC dimming enabled, the modulation rate is a bit higher than what&apos;s comfortable for some flicker-sensitive folks. For me, anything below an 8% modulation rate is usually the most comfortable.</p><p>Other flicker-sensitive folks might find this display is still comfortable, though, since it doesn&apos;t use PWM dimming above 25% brightness. Extra dim is supported on this panel, but it triples the modulation rate, so I wouldn&apos;t recommend using it.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DYU_yoMDkjY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The video confirms that modulation is low throughout most brightness levels. You can see the difference between the flickering levels with the flicker reduction setting enabled and disabled here, too.</p><p>The phone&apos;s cover display modulates at the exact same rate as the large folding display, so using that more often won&apos;t change much.</p><p>If you&apos;re comfortable with these numbers, Motorola&apos;s flip phone is one of our favorite flip phones of all time. While it doesn&apos;t have as many software features as Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip series, Motorola&apos;s cover display is <em>much</em> more useful than the Galaxy Z Flip 5&apos;s because Motorola lets you do <strong>anything</strong> with it. It&apos;s all here, from running full apps, swiping through widgets, or even playing games without having to flip open the phone.</p><p>It uses an older Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor which still feels snappy despite being a few years old now. Unfortunately, that doesn&apos;t mean battery life is particularly good â something that plagues all flip phones. Thankfully, Motorola&apos;s chargers are quicker than Samsung&apos;s, and you can top up in just a few minutes without worry.</p>

<p>If you know anything about Nothing&apos;s phones, you&apos;ll know the company takes its design language seriously. The company&apos;s first budget-friendly option, the Nothing Phone 2a, delivers a superb mid-range experience without compromising on design. It&apos;s still got the glyph interface lights on the back, and the company&apos;s trademark transparent design language looks as good as ever.</p><p>More impressively, the company kept an OLED display onboard that uses DC-like dimming above 50% brightness and 2,160Hz PWM dimming below 50% brightness. While the refresh frequency is more aligned to the refresh rate than the Nothing Phone 2, the Phone 2a&apos;s modulation rate is a bit higher.</p><p>You can see this effect in the video below. The Phone 2a has a darker single line at high brightness while the Nothing Phone 2 has double lines that are dimmer. The means the Nothing Phone 2 pulses at a higher rate, which could be less comfortable with DC-like dimming, but the brightness dip at the end of the duty cycle isn&apos;t quite as stark as it is on the Phone 2a.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-A5h7UynfnQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>In a nutshell, this means the Phone 2 will be more comfortable for some people while the 2a might be more comfortable for other folks. It all depends on what bothers your eyes more.</p><p>I found the Nothing Phone 2a was most comfortable at 49% brightness, as the higher PWM rate actually felt great to use. That makes it a little harder to see outside in the sun, but it&apos;s about as bright as your average budget LCD phone at this level, so it&apos;s not too bad.</p><p>In fact, one of the reasons I think this brightness level was so comfortable for me is because the graph, seen below, looks very similar to what a good LCD display looks like. The line is quite flat despite using PWM, and that made it feel gentler on my eyes.</p>

<p>Coming from the Honor 90, which was our previous pick for this category, the Nothing Phone 2a&apos;s Nothing OS is a breath of fresh air. While Honor tends to stick closely to iOS-style design, Nothing OS feels a lot more like classic Oxygen OS used to.</p><p>It&apos;s got a super light and fast feel while retaining a unique visual look. The company&apos;s dot matrix-style font stands out, and the home screen customization settings will help immediately differentiate your phone from everyone else&apos;s â as if the transparent back and LED glyph interface on the back doesn&apos;t already do that!</p><p>Plus, I really enjoyed the build of this phone. Sure, it&apos;s completely made of polycarbonate with an aluminum frame for support, but the company made the edges with a sandpaper-like texture. That makes it very easy to grip and pick up from a table, plus the centered camera island means it won&apos;t wobble when you place it down like so many other phones do.</p>

<p>OnePlus has long been a company focused on delivering value, and the Nord series fulfills its diehard customers&apos; expectations of that idea. The Nord N30 is the 2023 U.S. Nord release, and it brings the usual suite of improvements along with one surprising change: the 60Hz OLED display on the N20 was swapped out for a 120Hz LCD panel on the N30.</p><p>That LCD panel is super friendly for anyone suffering from flicker sensitivity as it uses proper DC dimming at an extremely high frequency â greater than 15,000Hz, in fact â to get things done.</p>

<p>This display is mostly flicker-free at all brightness levels, as evidenced by the video below. However, there seems to be a slight flicker below 10% brightness that doesn&apos;t get picked up in the video.</p><p>Some users in the PWM-sensitive community have picked up the phone and found that it does bother them at very low brightness levels like this, so I wouldn&apos;t recommend using it at super low brightness.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hdzaLqCrX08" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Aside from the flicker-free display at most brightness levels, the Nord N30 is a fantastic budget phone that&apos;s littered with features thanks to OxygenOS. This is the same OxygenOS you&apos;ll find on more expensive OnePlus phones, so you&apos;re getting the best features at a bargain price.</p><p>And the processor in this phone is fast enough even for graphics-intensive games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/the-division-resurgence-brings-console-quality-gaming-to-phones">The Division Resurgence</a> thanks to fast internal storage speed and general improvements in optimization in OxygenOS over the years. Plus, battery life is truly excellent, and it charges in about 30 minutes flat with the included charger.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oL2F2WHwKLTkJifBERwKK9" name="Motorola-edge-plus-2023-hands-on-display-03.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Motorola Edge+ (2023) looking at the curved glass on the front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oL2F2WHwKLTkJifBERwKK9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re PWM or flicker-sensitive, it can be extremely difficult to figure out which phones work best for you. As a rule of thumb, IPS LCD panels are usually friendlier on the eyes than any kind of OLED panel, but even that&apos;s not guaranteed. PWM dimming is sometimes used for cost reasons, while it&apos;s used to mask poor low light screen quality in other instances, so even LCD panels can use it.</p><p>OLED displays have to use PWM dimming at a certain brightness level to retain accurate colors and details. You can read about why that&apos;s the case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">in detail here</a>. But know that most OLED displays <em>can</em> use DC dimming to maintain brightness at high levels. Some manufacturers â like Samsung, Google, and Apple â just refuse to do this.</p><p>While the phones on this list have been tested and used by us, everyone&apos;s eyes and brains work a little differently. That means what works for one person won&apos;t always work for another person. If you&apos;re PWM-sensitive, there&apos;s a high likelihood that you may have to try several options on the list before you find something that&apos;s comfortable for you.</p><p>If you find your phone bothers your eyes when using automatic brightness, try setting it to manual at 100% brightness. Then use an app like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.ericytsang.screenfilter.app.android">screen and notification dimmer</a> to artificially lower the brightness. I&apos;ve tested a lot of screen-dimming apps, and this is the best one.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>What phone works for one person may not work for another person, especially if you have sensitive eyes.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Folks looking for a premium phone in the U.S. should look no further than the Motorola Edge+ (2023). Motorola uses a special flicker reduction DC dimming method that ensures the screen&apos;s duty cycle remains on 99.51% of the time.</p><p>In simple terms, that means the screen isn&apos;t flickering like other OLED displays no matter the brightness level. Just make sure you enable "flicker reduction" in the phone&apos;s display settings. The Motorola Razr Plus uses a similar method of flicker reduction, making it the only foldable phone available in the U.S. that&apos;s vision-friendly.</p><p>Internationally, there are a lot more options. Many smartphones from Asia offer DC dimming methods, including the Xiaomi 13, Honor Magic 6 Pro, and several other options. More and more companies have begun to increase their display PWM rates and have been better about clearly marking the rate in the phone&apos;s marketing.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung has announced the flagship Galaxy S23 series under its popular Certified Re-newed program.</li><li>They ship with One UI 6.1 out of the box, including the Galaxy AI features.</li><li>The Galaxy S23 under the CRN program starts at $619, the S23 Plus at $769, and the Ultra at $919, the same as the predecessor models.</li></ul>

<p>Samsung habitually launches refurbished Galaxy phones, especially premium ones, in the U.S. market. After the Galaxy S22 and S21 series received the refurbished treatment, the flagship Galaxy S23 series is now being launched in the country under the company&apos;s Certified Re-newed program, just in time for Earth Day.</p><p>While the company has seen a successful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series launch early this year, the company is bringing its predecessors in a new avatar under its CRN program, which involves the trio of devices, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Galaxy S23</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-review">S23 Plus</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">S23 Ultra</a>. All phones go through extensive testing, receive genuine parts, and are further assembled by Samsung engineers, the company notes in a shared press release.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="rwNMoerBuMGeBTEodrop7M" name="galaxy-s23-ultra-certified-renewed.jpg" alt="Galaxy S23 Ultra Certified Re-newed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rwNMoerBuMGeBTEodrop7M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like the current Galaxy S24 series, the new refurbished S23 series will also carry Samsung&apos;s one-year warranty alongside the latest announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search with Google</a> and Live Translate â thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6.1</a> shipping out of the box.</p><p>This means you get access to premium, like-new phones and the latest features for much less than you normally would.Â This should appeal to individuals who may be put off by the idea of spending more than $1000 on a Samsung flagship phone, especially those considering purchasing from a third party.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S23 Ultra CRN version will start at $919 and can be purchased in Phantom Black and Green colorways for a 256GB storage variant. The larger 512GB, however, only comes in the Phantom Black option. for reference, the brand-new version of the Ultra model started at $1,199 when it launched in the U.S.</p><p>The Galaxy S23 Plus under the new program starts at $769 and is only available in Phantom Black for 256GB and 512GB storage options. The standard Galaxy S23 is priced at $619 and available in Phantom Black for both storage options.</p>

While it may look outdated now compared to the Quest 3 and Pro, the upgraded refresh rate provided a 25% improvement over the original Oculus Quest at launch, delivering a smoother, much more immersive VR experience.Â </p><p>Meta Quest 2 runs supported games at 90Hz and even some at 120Hz natively, but if you&apos;re connecting to a PC with Oculus Link you may still need to adjust some settings to get the best experience.</p>
<h2 id="quest-games-with-120hz-support-2">Quest games with 120Hz support</h2>
<p>A few years ago, Meta updated the Quest 2 with an experimental 120Hz mode. The Quest 2 still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/november-quest-2-update-adds-90hz-app-gifting-oculus-move-and-more">automatically switches</a> the display to 90Hz mode when a game supports it, but you&apos;ll need to go into your Quest 2&apos;s settings to enable a 120Hz refresh rate. Since there aren&apos;t a ton of games that have full 120Hz support, many games will still cap at 90Hz.Â </p><p>That said, players won&apos;t have to modify their Quest 2 in order to play their Oculus Quest games at higher frame rates anymore. The caveat here is that developers need to update their games in order to support 90 or 120Hz on the Quest 2, otherwise they&apos;ll run at 72Hz like the original Oculus Quest did.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-enable-120hz-on-quest-2-2">How to enable 120Hz on Quest 2</h2>
<p>The Quest 2&apos;s offered support for 120Hz refresh rates for some time now, but for the time being, they&apos;re tucked away with other experimental features on the Quest 2. Â Before you enable 120Hz though, it&apos;s important to note that the 120Hz refresh rate on Quest 2 is still considered an experimental feature, so it can affect your Quest 2&apos;s battery life, temperature, and other performance-related specifications. To <strong>enable 120Hz on your Quest 2</strong>...</p>
<ul><li>Open your Quest 2's <strong>Settings App</strong>.</li><li>At the bottom of the Settings App, you'll find a widget labeled "<strong>Experimental</strong>."</li><li><strong>Enable 120Hz </strong>will be the first setting you can toggle below he "Reset Experimental Features" option.</li></ul>

<h2 id="how-to-enable-higher-framerates-with-oculus-link-2">How to enable higher framerates with Oculus Link</h2>
<p>When you connect your Meta Quest 2 to a gaming PC with a Link cable, you&apos;ll be able to play PC VR games using Rift software. The $80 Oculus cable is officially recommended by Meta to provide the highest-quality experience. You can save money by opting for one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-link-cable-alternative-oculus-quest-2" target="_blank">great Link cable alternatives</a>, as well.</p>
<p>1. If you don&apos;t already have it,<strong> </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-rift-s/install-app-for-link/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwn7mwBhCiARIsAGoxjaK_bzn4AohK6RKuvQOBy1hiMNj9oB3Oycijgmv7OXMa3ll9CZMdyfMaAs99EALw_wcB"><strong>download the Link software here</strong></a>.</p><p>2. <strong>Sign in with your Oculus account</strong>.</p><p>3. Connect one side of the USB cable to a <strong>USB port on your PC</strong> and the other side to your <strong>Oculus Quest 2</strong>.</p><p>4. The Oculus app on your computer should recognize the Oculus Quest once it&apos;s plugged in. Click <strong>Continue </strong>on the screen that pops up to enable Oculus Link.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pdar5ugqvpv9TkFNYvkXk9" name="oculus-link-rift-software-1.jpg" alt="Oculus Link Rift Software" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdar5ugqvpv9TkFNYvkXk9.jpg" mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdar5ugqvpv9TkFNYvkXk9.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="0" height="0" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>5. During the setup, you can test the cable to make sure it&apos;s fast enough to be used with Oculus Link by clicking the <strong>Test </strong>button at the bottom of the screen. If your cable fails the test, you should consider one of the cables we recommend above.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dNcWTBmVQv9G8qhSiuYWe6" name="oculus_link_cable_failed.jpg" alt="Speed test failed for the Quest 2 USB Link Cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dNcWTBmVQv9G8qhSiuYWe6.jpg" mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxVUvMH3r32hHqAePgj2f.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Charlie Wacholz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>6. Click <strong>Continue </strong>and put the Meta Quest on your head.</p><p>7. If asked to <em>Allow access to data</em>, select <strong>Deny</strong>.</p><p>8. Select <strong>Enable Oculus Link</strong> on the next pop-up that appears.</p>
<p>Now that you&apos;ve got your Quest 2 connected and set up, it&apos;s time to head to advanced options to make sure you&apos;re running at 90Hz.</p>
<p>9. With the Oculus software open on your PC, select <strong>Devices </strong>from the menu on the left.</p><p>10. In your list of devices, click on <strong>Quest 2 and Touch</strong> to open device options.</p><p>11. Scroll down to Graphics Preferences and click it.</p>

<p>12. Select <strong>your desired framerate</strong> from the range of refresh rate options.</p><p>13. Click <strong>Save & Restart</strong> to restart the Oculus software.</p>
<h2 id="the-difference-in-frame-rates-is-a-big-upgrade-2">The difference in frame rates is a big upgrade</h2>
<p>Frame rates like 120, or even 90Hz are a huge upgrade for loads of VR games, even if the number jump from 72Hz to 90Hz doesn&apos;t seem like a lot. Every increase in refresh rate with a VR headset means a more comfortable experience, less motion sickness, and a more realistic feeling.</p>

That focus has resulted in much better apps coming to the platform, with YouTube Music being among them. After launching on the Galaxy Watch series in 2021, YouTube Music has been a staple as one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">best music streaming apps</a> on the platform.</p><p>However, using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> on your smartwatch is a bit different from using it on an Android phone. So, we&apos;ll go over the ins and outs of how to use YouTube Music on your Wear OS watch, so you can enjoy your tunes without pulling out your phone.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-youtube-music-on-wear-os-2">Getting started with YouTube Music on Wear OS</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kufxphEuKxyDsosc99yqwN" name="YouTube-Music-Wear-OS-app.jpg" alt="YouTube Music app on Wear OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kufxphEuKxyDsosc99yqwN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After you download YouTube Music from the Play Store on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>, you&apos;ll automatically be logged in to your Google Account. However, it&apos;s easy to switch accounts if you find yourself logged into a different account. This is important if you want to keep the same playlists, likes, and recommendations from your primary YouTube Music account. You can skip the following steps if you&apos;re already logged into your preferred account.</p>
<p>1. Scroll down and tap <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Switch account</strong>.</p><p>3. <strong>Tap the account</strong> you want to switch to or select <strong>Manage accounts</strong> to log into another account from your phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1350px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.33%;"><img id="ZkwNTstmSEz2cdGVzWjrtR" name="Youtube-Music-Wear-OS-switch-accounts.jpg" alt="Swithcing YouTube Music account on Wear OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZkwNTstmSEz2cdGVzWjrtR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1350" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you open YouTube Music, you&apos;ll be directed to the home screen, which consists of a few sections and options:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Downloads</strong>: This is where all your pending downloads and downloaded content will appear. We will go over how to download music in the following section.</li><li><strong>Workout</strong>: This section includes various workout mixes created by YouTube Music based on your listening habits.</li><li><strong>Recommendations</strong>: This is where you find your Liked songs as well as various playlists, albums, and more than you have listened to or may be interested in listening to based on your habits.</li><li><strong>Library</strong>: This is where you access your Settings and content saved in your library.</li></ul>
<p>You cannot search for music in the YouTube Music Wear OS app like you can on a smartphone. The wearable app is primarily for listening to music in your library or recommended content/mixes. That said, you can select an album, playlist, or podcast to scroll through and play individual songs/episodes, or you can simply hit the Shuffle button found at the top of an album or playlist.</p><p>The best part is that you don&apos;t need to download music to listen to, as in the early days of the Wear OS app. You just have to have an active Wi-Fi or LTE connection, which will allow you to stream content.</p><p>That said, downloading music to your watch has benefits, which we&apos;ll discuss in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-download-music-on-your-wear-os-watch-2">How to download music on your Wear OS watch</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DKeh7PREAMeHZvpUqURLLN" name="YouTube-Music-Wear-OS-recommendations.jpg" alt="YouTube Music app recommendations on Wear OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DKeh7PREAMeHZvpUqURLLN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While not necessarily the case with LTE smartwatches, Wi-Fi smartwatches don&apos;t always have a connection available, especially if you&apos;re out and about. That&apos;s one main reason why you should download music for offline listening, something that&apos;s only available if you are subscribed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a>. Downloading content is also good for preserving battery life as opposed to streaming songs on the go.</p><p>Doing so is pretty easy:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Select</strong> a playlist, album, or podcast. You can alternatively <strong>press and hold</strong> any individual song.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>download icon</strong>, and your download should begin.</p><p>3. YouTube Music will let you download albums or playlists. However, podcasts have to be downloaded by the episode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1350px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.33%;"><img id="6sSK2V4vVHjTrRQnEYwyPS" name="Youtube-Music-Wear-OS-download-content.jpg" alt="Downloading content on the YouTube Music Wear OS app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6sSK2V4vVHjTrRQnEYwyPS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1350" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also enable Smart Downloads, which will automatically download additional music to your smartwatch that it thinks you&apos;ll like based on your listening habits. Keep in mind, this will take up more storage space on your smartwatch, so you may need to keep an eye on that.</p>
<p>1. Tap <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2.

<p>As mentioned, you have a few options when listening to music on the app. You can browse through your library, select from a mix, or choose from your recommended content. You can also listen offline or stream using your Wi-Fi/LTE connection.</p><p>That said, you must be connected to wireless earbuds, as there&apos;s no option to listen to music through your watch speaker.

<p>When a track is playing, you will be directed to the Now Playing screen, which sits to the right of the home screen and is always a swipe away, regardless of whether or not anything is actually playing. You have options to play and pause content, rewind and fast forward (for podcasts), and skip or go back (music). You&apos;ll also find a like button and a volume button, which lets you tap the display to adjust volume (you can also ignore this button and use the crown for watches that have one or the bezel for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Galaxy Watch models</a>).</p>

<ul><li>Android 14 QPR1 Beta 2 introduced a new feature to enable better syncing between phones and smartwatch apps.</li><li>Mishaal Rahman spotted the new addition, which lets users "Sync permissions from phone."</li><li>It is a new toggle that should extend app permissions from Android phones to Wear OS smartwatches.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Pixel Watch app for Android has been spotted with a new app permission feature that should make using apps on your smartwatch and Android phone more seamless.</p><p>First spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/MishaalAndroidNews/1100">Mishaal Rahman</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/app-permission-syncing-galaxy-watch-android-phone-coming-soon/">SamMobile</a>), a new sync permissions feature allows users to sync their app permissions between their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and connected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatches</a>. While the feature doesn&apos;t operate now, it gives us an idea of what to expect from future updates.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.42%;"><img id="7sdpmQhX9PAQAxYzwhErp4" name="Pixel-watch-app-permission.jpeg" alt="New Pixel Watch app permission" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7sdpmQhX9PAQAxYzwhErp4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="1119" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mishaal Rahman)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android phone users will be able to navigate to their System preferences and hit the Device details section, where they&apos;ll spot the new "Sync permissions from phone" toggle. Enabling it would "Give your watch the same app permissions" that users have allowed on the respective handset. As mentioned, it is currently in the works and can only be enabled by a flag first spotted in Android 14 QPR1 Beta 2.</p><p>Whenever the feature rollout happens, it should help Android phone and Wear OS users save time dealing with the app permissions on both devices.</p>
<p>As SamMobile puts it, whenever a user grants permission to access their location on Google Maps, the same app permission will extend to their smartwatch, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a>, for the respective Google Maps app. What&apos;s more is that this feature won&apos;t be exclusive to Pixels so other Android phones and Wear OS smartwatches will be able to take advantage.</p><p>That said, your smartwatch may need to run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>, which is only available on a handful of models. Aside from the Pixel Watch and Galaxy Watch models, Wear OS 4 is available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and may soon come to the TicWatch Pro 5, assuming Mobvoi&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-4-beta-recruitment-opens">beta test</a> goes well.</p>

<ul><li>Google rolled out new ways to filter your search in the Google Drive app for iOS last month, and at the time, said the features would come to Android at a later date.</li><li>Now, it appears that the search filters are starting to appear in the Google Drive app for Android after a recent update.</li><li>The filter categories can be found right below the in-app search bar and include things like File Type, Owner, and Last Modified.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google Drive app for Android is getting a much-needed update to make finding the exact file you&apos;re looking for easier. Google is adding a collection of search filters to the Drive app directly under the main app search bar, just like it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-drive-video-playback-speed-boost">added to the iOS version of the app</a> early last Month. When the company announced the change, it said Android users would eventually get search filters as well but did not elaborate further.</p><p>Now, it looks like Google is pushing the update that includes search filters in Google Drive to Android users, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-drive-new-search-filters-on-android/" target="_blank">Android Police</a> spotted. It comes a bit over a month after Google brought the feature to iOS, which is something the company occasionally does despite being Android&apos;s developer.</p><p>Search filters are nothing new to Google Drive, but these ones on the Android app are smarter than usual. When searching for a file in Drive, the filtering options will move around based on the contents of your search. Essentially, Google hopes to put the needed search filter directly under the search bar right when you need it without having to make users scroll to find the one that&apos;ll help.</p><p>You can take a look at how search filters work in the Google Drive app for Android in the screenshots below, which Google shared when it first made the feature available on iOS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:788px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:95.18%;"><img id="riLqdt7o8doyMYQHokDUh9" name="google-drive-search-filters.jpg" alt="new search filters in google drive" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/riLqdt7o8doyMYQHokDUh9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="788" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The search filters include options like File Type, Owners, and Last Modified. They come in handy in several situations, like if you only want to search images or documents. You can also see only files that were modified recently via set time intervals you can choose between. You can also search only files owned by a specific person, which is neat, too.</p><p>Again, search filters are hardly a new thing, but Google is making the Drive app for Android more like the desktop versions with this change. As phones get bigger and more powerful, there&apos;s a higher chance people will try to do more work on the go with their smartphones. With features like these â and the emergence of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">great folding phones</a> â that kind of usage becomes more of a possibility for everyday people.</p><p>We&apos;ve spotted search filters appearing in the Google Drive app on a few of our devices. If you&apos;re not seeing the update, try updating the Drive app manually in the Google Play Store app. Google says this feature is available with all Google accounts, including personal and Workspace accounts.</p>

<ul><li>Google appears to be adding an Android 15 feature that will give you a better idea of the health of your phone's storage chip.Â </li><li>While flash storage is generally considered to be extremely reliable, it can fail just like other smartphone components, and this feature will try and gauge how much life is left in a phone's storage chip.</li><li>The upcoming functionality will work similar to battery health on Android, showing the health of a storage chip in the form of a percentage.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Flash storage is much more reliable than other types of storage, and it doesn&apos;t contain moving parts like hard drives do. However, it isn&apos;t completely failproof either, and that&apos;s why Google wants to show the remaining life of your phone&apos;s storage chip in Android 15. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-storage-health-3435507/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> uncovered, Google plans to show your the health of phone&apos;s storage chip with a percentage in the next version of Android.</p><p>Android Authority notes that information related to storage can be found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-run-diagnostics-on-your-pixel">Device Diagnostics</a> app. Additionally, more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-check-android-phone-battery-health">information about your phone&apos;s battery</a> will be shown in Device Diagnostics as well. The storage health functionality is powered by a new API that "returns the remaining lifetime of the internal storage device, as an integer percentage."Â </p><p>So, a reading of 80 from the API would mean that only 80% of the chip&apos;s expected lifespan remains. It&apos;s unclear exactly how Android determines the health of a phone&apos;s storage chip; however, there are a handful of storage attributes that can be signs of a failing or degrading flash chip.Â </p><p>High temperatures can accelerate flash chip degradation, which is a concern on smartphones. There are plenty of ways that a smartphone is exposed to extreme temperatures, including wired charging, wireless charging, prolonged use, and extended periods of time in the sun. As such, the lifespan of a smartphone&apos;s flash chip is more important to monitor than, say, an SSD in a computer.</p><p>The remaining lifespan of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> will be most accurate on Pixel phones, which report a percentage down to one percent accuracies. However, other Android phones merely provide percentages at 10% intervals. Some Android devices will lack the reporting functionality entirely and will be unable to show the percent of a phone chip&apos;s usable lifetime remaining.</p><p>We&apos;ll learn more about this feature in future Android 15 releases since Google&apos;s patch notes say it is "intended to be displayed to users" rather than for internal use.Â </p>

<hr>
<p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-markup-feature">adding annotation support to Google Docs</a> earlier this year, Google Meet users can now make annotations and collaborate with others while presenting. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/04/Annotations-Google-Meet.html" target="_blank">announced</a> the changes last week, and they&apos;re now starting to roll out to users of select Google Workspace tiers. With annotation, it&apos;s easy to highlight, draw, or add text to presented content from screen shares to file or webpage shares.</p><p>Annotations will be turned on by default when you start presenting content in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-10-google-meet-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Meet</a>. There&apos;s a new menu that can be found in the bottom righthand corner of the share preview that houses all of the settings an options related to annotations. Alternatively, there is an annotation button in the top left corner of the presentation toolbar in Google Meet as well.</p><p>This menu includes stickers, a disappearing ink tool, a pen tool, a highlighter tool, text boxes, sticky notes, lines and shapes, and a color picker. Additionally, there is a <strong>Clear all</strong> option as well as an eraser tool. When you&apos;re finished annotating, there is a <strong>Stop annotating</strong> button in this menu too.Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5443px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ekaJyHic3X6DW9Q9YD67PY" name="Google-Meet-Annotate-2.jpg" alt="Annotation menu in Google Meet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ekaJyHic3X6DW9Q9YD67PY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5443" height="3061" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other meeting participants can be added as co-annotators, and this is helpful so the presenter can talk while a helper annotates. It also might be conducive to collaboration, with more people being able to participate.Â </p><p>However, annotations in Google Meet aren&apos;t available for everyone. You&apos;ll need a specific Google Workspace account to enjoy them, and the following Workspace tiers are included:</p>
<ul><li><strong>BusinessÂ </strong>Starter, Standard, and Plus</li><li><strong>Enterprise</strong>Â Starter, Standard, and Plus</li><li><strong>FrontlineÂ </strong>Starter and Standard</li><li><strong>Essentials</strong>, Enterprise Essentials, and Enterprise Essentials Plus</li><li><strong>Education</strong>Â Standard, Plus, the Teaching & Learning Upgrade</li><li><strong>Workspace Individual </strong>subscribers</li></ul>
<p>iOS users also miss out on annotations while presenting, even if they are Google Workspace subscribers, although they can make annotations as co-annotators. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android users</a> can make annotations in Google Meet, co-annotating is unsupported at the time. Google says the functionality will come in a subsequent update.Â </p><p>For now, eligible Google Workspace users on a rapid release schedule started seeing the update on April 18, but it could take up to 15 days after that date for everyone to get the feature. Users on the scheduled release plan will start seeing annotations in Google Meet on April 25, and it could also take 15 days for all users to get the feature after that.</p>

<p>Wrist-based running dynamics, aka running form analysis, is the hot new thing for fitness watches. Garmin, COROS, Apple, and Samsung (among others) will analyze your cadence, stride, balance, and power. The question is, can amateur runners use this information to improve without injuring themselves? I spoke with Garmin Forerunner product manager Joe Heikes to find out.</p><p>Heikes warned me that "form improvements are pretty tough because they often feel unnatural." Trying to self-correct your below-average running dynamics will "produce less economical running" and keep you out of the zone. Neither novices nor running veterans benefit.</p><p>While Heikes doesn&apos;t think runners "should obsess over these numbers," he did explain several scenarios where acting on running form data will improve your abilities â with some effort and data study on your part.Â </p><p>Let&apos;s dive into those scenarios and get you on track toward running more efficiently in terms of running form and power!

<p>Let&apos;s briefly run through the running metrics data that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> can collect, along with where you theoretically <em>should</em> be in each category.Â </p><p>Your <strong>cadence</strong> and <strong>stride length</strong> are your steps per minute and average step distance. Stride is partially height-dependent, but Garmin says that most runners average between 163â185 steps per minute for cadence, with taller runners falling on the lower side.</p><p><strong>Vertical oscillation</strong> measures your torso&apos;s vertical movement per step in centimeters. Experienced runners only move about 6cm up, while beginners waste motion with taller steps in the 10cm+ range, especially when pushing hard. Garmin combines your oscillation and stride data into a <strong>vertical ratio</strong> score, with lower percentages corresponding with better efficiency.</p><p>You also want as low a <strong>Ground contact time (GCT)</strong> as possible, with under 300 milliseconds as the usual baseline and elites hitting closer to 200 ms. If your stride is overly long or high, you&apos;ll land longer and harder than you should, slowing you down and wearing down your feet with excessively hard impacts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cCGNu8dp4BWvz2dvRtkE2N" name="COROS-APEX-2-running-power.jpeg" alt="Running power score during a guided workout on the COROS APEX 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cCGNu8dp4BWvz2dvRtkE2N.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Average <strong>running power</strong> only partially belongs in this category, but it measures how much effort you put into a run. Ideally, you&apos;ll want to use as little Wattage of power as possible while running at a good pace. A more efficient running form would help with this, but so would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">improving your VO2 Max</a>. Generally speaking, the lower your average running power relative to your pace, the better.</p><p>Lastly, even the most advanced running watches, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a>, can only measure so much from your wrist. For metrics like <strong>GCT balance</strong> â which detects whether you spend more time on one foot than the other â or the <strong>peak ground reaction force</strong> your foot produces when pushing you off the ground, you need a separate pod accessory for your shoe or waistline, like the Garmin Running Dynamics Pod or COROS POD 2.</p>
<h2 id="changing-your-running-form-is-risky-2">Changing your running form is risky</h2>
<p>The more you run and the fitter you get, the more naturally "efficient" your running form will become. "There is no one-size-fits-all prescription for what to do with [running form] data," Heikes says, and runners who have "many thousands of miles under their belts...might not be wise to monkey with it."</p><p>When you look at a Garmin post-run summary, you can see how your cadence or vertical ratio compares to other Garmin runners. Yet this generalized graph can&apos;t possibly account for factors like pace or height, which change how many steps you take per minute or how far your feet travel.</p><p>You may be below or above average for a very good reason, and prematurely "obsessing" over this by taking quicker or longer steps could stop you from finding your natural running form over time, Heikes warns.Â </p><p>This tracks with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-im-using-fitness-tech-train-my-marathon">interview with Roberto Mandje</a>, former Olympian and NYRR director of Runner Training, a few years back. He warned me that by paying attention to running dynamics, you&apos;ll start chasing "generic numbers from the internet...without knowing if you really should and exactly what your optimal cadence and stride length should be."</p>
<h2 id="study-your-stats-over-time-2">Study your stats over time</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2556px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.13%;"><img id="aZmFWmuGK682urLF7wQVQm" name="garmin-running-dynamics-power-and-vertical-ratio.jpeg" alt="A Garmin running dynamics graph showing the author's power and vertical ratio during a half-marathon." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZmFWmuGK682urLF7wQVQm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2556" height="1179" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>His disclaimer aside, Heikes <em>isn&apos;t</em> saying to ignore your data entirely, merely to run long enough that you have a natural running form, and then tinker from there.</p><p>For any specific running metric, "look at how this data changes over time," he explains. Compare two runs of similar lengths a year apart and see if your dynamics have changed in correlation with your improved (or worsened) VO2 Max. What&apos;s (un)changed will help you gauge where to focus your future efforts.</p><p>Then, "compare the data from a fast run to a slow one" and see which metrics you change to gain speed. Heikes says, for example, that his cadence tends to stay consistent while his stride length increases, whereas other runners might focus more on faster movement with a consistent stride to run faster.</p><p>He also recommends looking at data graphs across a long race (like a marathon) to see "how fatigue shows up in the running dynamics measurements." Maybe you&apos;d see that your cadence shortens or ground contact time (GCT) gets too long, for instance, and use that data to figure out your stamina limits.</p><p>After you&apos;ve figured out your averages for different types of runs, you could then try changing your running form and see the results, both for pace and metrics. Heikes gave the famous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20821619/think-tall-for-good-running-form/" target="_blank">"run tall" example</a>, saying you can "tell quantitatively how that is reflected in objective data" once you&apos;ve established a benchmark to compare against.</p>
<h2 id="naturally-improve-your-form-with-strength-training-2">Naturally improve your form with strength training</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PDXSzw9KFA8xDA2TAMqPuS" name="Garmin-Venu-3-muscle-map.jpeg" alt="A muscle map for side lunges on the Garmin Venu 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PDXSzw9KFA8xDA2TAMqPuS.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Heikes says his favorite running dynamic metric is GCT balance because he "had a couple of knee surgeries," and it helps him catch "when I might be getting more imbalanced in my stride," whether due to fatigue or because he needs to "do some strength training on the weak side."</p><p>While he didn&apos;t go into much more detail about this, other running coaches online will point you towards strength exercises as a way to improve specific running metrics. An imbalanced stride might push you to do more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://strengthrunning.com/2020/11/single-leg-exercises-for-runners/" target="_blank">single-leg exercises</a>, for instance.</p><p>COROS, which just released a running form test for watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">PACE 3</a>, has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://coros.com/stories/coros-metrics/c/running-form-test-from-data-to-action" target="_blank">"From Data to Action" guide</a> for people scoring low in key areas, and most of its tips are (you guessed it) strength training. For example, fixing high GCT starts with burpees, mountain climbers, and other bodyweight jumps that get your feet off the ground quickly.Â </p><p>Lower-body exercises like squats, deadlifts, and calf/heel raises give you more powerful launches to improve your stride with less cardiovascular effort. More generally, core-strength workouts like planks help combat fatigue&apos;s negative impact on your form across long races.</p><p>Rather than manually trying to change your running form, give your body the muscular tools to run more efficiently, with this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://training.coros.com/schedule-plan/share?planId=455706700727631876&region=1&share" target="_blank">"8-week strength training plan"</a> as a solid starting point for runners.Â </p>
<hr>
<p>I can&apos;t stop you from checking your running dynamics data and actively changing your form to come closer to the average. However, from what I learned from various coaches and fitness brand experts, running dynamics is more useful as a <em>benchmark</em>, the same as VO2 Max or your estimated race paces.Â </p><p>The fitter and stronger you get, the more likely that your cadence, GCT, vertical ratio, and power efficiency will improve, especially for marathons where cardiovascular endurance isn&apos;t enough. With runner-focused strength training, you&apos;ll improve naturally without spending every run distracted by how high or long you&apos;re stepping.Â </p><p>As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> specifically, Joe Heikes says that the Forerunner product team believes "there is still a lot of application potential for the running dynamics data we currently provide and for other metrics we have been working on in-house. We are not yet done innovating in this area!" So, we may see new Garmin Coach tools or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">better indoor workouts</a> focused on running dynamics in the future.</p>

As part of this shift, the company is bringing its hardware and software teams together under a new Platforms and Devices team that oversees Android, Chrome and ChromeOS, Google Photos, Pixel devices, and more.</p><p>The new team will be lead by Rick Osterloh, and Sameer Samat will oversee the Android ecosystem. Meanwhile, Hiroshi Lockheimer, who has head Android up until now, will be involved with other projects across Alphabet (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133881/google-android-pixel-teams-reorg-rick-osterloh">The Verge</a>).</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/building-ai-future-april-2024/">blog post</a> by Google CEO Sundar Pichai, the crux of the reorganization is to strengthen the synergy between the company&apos;s hardware and software efforts so it can move faster to bring better products to market. Pichai points to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> feature, which first arrived on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> at launch before then coming to the Pixel series.</p><p>But beyond that, this also means the teams can better integrate Google&apos;s AI efforts into its products.

The back also appears to be matte, but we&apos;re likely looking at a prototype of some sort, so the finished product may differ.</p>

<p>From what we can see on the display, the phone may have up to 16GB of RAM, although it also shows 128GB of storage. We also get a close-up of the cameras and a comparison shot with the phone next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-14-pro-max-review">iPhone 14 Pro Max</a>, revealing how much smaller the Pixel 9 Pro might be when it launches later this year.</p><p>According to rumors, we may receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">three Pixel 9 devices</a>, including the standard Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro (which is likely what we&apos;re seeing here), and a larger Pixel 9 Pro XL. Additionally, it&apos;s rumored that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> successor may switch up names and instead be called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-successor-name-change-rumors">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, it&apos;s unclear if Google will stick to that moniker.</p>

The higher-end earbuds support LHDC 5.0, bringing low latency and high-definition audio. Both earbuds come with a transparent design and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">Hi-Res audio</a> support. There are also 11mm drivers, and the batteries last more than 5 hours with ANC on or more than 8 hours with it off.</p><p>The main difference between the two is that there are fewer customization options on the more affordable Nothing Ear (a). There&apos;s also no wireless charging with the case, which Android Central&apos;s Tshaka Armstrong noted in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-a-review">Nothing Ear (a) review</a> as a major downside. He also notes that ANC isn&apos;t as strong as it could be, but for a pair of $99 earbuds, they&apos;re still well worth the money.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-notes-app-soft-launch"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>In the fight over popularity, Instagram has "borrowed" a feature or two from TikTok over the years. However, now it&apos;s TikTok&apos;s turn to borrow from Instagram, as the new TikTok Notes app has begun rolling out in select countries. Unlike regular TikTok, this app is focused on still images rather than videos. Users can add one photo or a carousel, text, and even a caption to highlight what your images are about.</p><p>To make signing up easy, users can link their TikTok accounts to log in.</p><p>The only downside of this app launch is that it&apos;s not available to everyone at the start. Right now, TikTok Notes is available "for download and limited testing in Australia and Canada," so if you&apos;re in those countries, you&apos;re free to give it a try.</p><p>Given the popularity of TikTok, this could bring a true Instagram competitor to the table, even as Meta shifts its focus to video content.</p>
