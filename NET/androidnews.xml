                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Garmin fenix 8, previously MIP only, now has AMOLED models as well, making the short-lived Garmin Epix lineup defunct.</li><li>It comes with a 40-meter dive rating, built-in mic and speaker with new voice commands, new strength training plans, and a revamped map interface with "dynamic round-trip routing."</li><li>The Garmin Enduro 3 now hits 90 days or 320 GPS hours with solar charging, about double what the Enduro 2 offered thanks to a new solar panel.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Garmin has announced its new flagship fenix 8 and Enduro 3 watches with a host of hardware upgrades and exciting new software tricks. While both watches still come with battery-saving MIP displays, Garmin continued its AMOLED transition by offering the popular fenix in three AMOLED sizes, as well.</p><p>Garmin previously sold the "Epix" line as an AMOLED alternative to fenix, so I asked my Garmin rep if this news means Epix is dead. She responded, "That&apos;s correct, we&apos;re combining both Solar/MIP and AMOLED under the fenix family — which has established itself as a very reputable brand over the past decade."</p><p>The Garmin fenix 8 AMOLED arrives today in 43mm, 47mm, or 51mm sizes, while the fenix 8 Solar has 47mm and 51mm models. You&apos;ll need the 51mm AMOLED to match the 47mm Solar with a 29-day battery life; the 51mm fenix 8 Solar hits a whopping 48 days per charge.</p><p>At the same time, the MIP-only, 51mm Garmin Enduro 3 has arrived with a 90-day battery life and up to 320 GPS hours or 120 multi-band GPS hours. Garmin attributes its "larger, more efficient solar lens" that "provides more than double the solar panel of the previous Enduro model."</p><p>As always, the Garmin fenix 8 and Enduro 3 will cost you a pretty penny. The Enduro 3 is cheapest at $899, while the fenix 8 ranges from $999 to $1,199, based on size and optional titanium bezel or Sapphire lens upgrades. </p><p>We&apos;ll break down the new hardware and software tricks for both the Garmin fenix 8 and Enduro 3 below. Otherwise, Garmin is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.creacast.com/channel/garmin/">livestreaming </a>its fenix and Enduro launch at Charmonix starting at 7a ET today, if you want to get a closer hands-on look.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-fenix-8"><span>Garmin fenix 8</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:10131px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:32.57%;"><img id="RvzJQyVwsbJUEVGR49eokd" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-lineup-render.jpeg" alt="Render of the Garmin Fenix 8 lineup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RvzJQyVwsbJUEVGR49eokd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="10131" height="3300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from replacing the Epix series, the Garmin fenix 8 will also encroach on Descent territory: It&apos;ll have "leakproof metal buttons" and a "40-meter dive rating" with scuba and apnea dive activities added. That&apos;s in addition to the same MIL-STD-810H rating for thermal, shock, and water resistance as the fenix 7.</p><p>Like before, it&apos;ll have a built-in mic and speaker for phone calls and passthrough commands for Google Assistant, Siri, or Bixby. For the first time, Garmin is adding <em>on-watch commands</em> like "set a timer for 5 minutes," "save waypoint," or "start a strength training activity." This feature is long overdue, as much cheaper fitness brands have such commands, and I hope Garmin will bring this feature to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> and last-gen models.</p><p>What I&apos;m most excited about, however, is the new "Advanced Strength Training" update. Garmin promises that athletes will receive "targeted 4–6-week strength training plans to help meet personal goals, plus sport-specific workouts for athletes of all types, including trail runners, surfers, skiers, and more."</p><p>Many Garmin watches have thousands of animated workouts with muscle maps, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">Garmin&apos;s indoor workouts are too limited</a>: creating your own workouts is slow and you won&apos;t find a wide-enough range of premade workouts. Garmin&apos;s new advanced strength training sounds like the solution, the equivalent of a Garmin Coach cross-training calendar that adjusts based on your ability level, equipment, and favorite sports. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5373px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="LZH984yfMA3tsK5y4epCtf" name="garmin-fenix-8-product-photo-2.jpeg" alt="Photo of the Garmin Fenix 8 main watch face on an athlete's wrist." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LZH984yfMA3tsK5y4epCtf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5373" height="3022" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While only the fenix 7X and Pro had LED flashlights, it appears all fenix 8 sizes will have an LED flashlight for your nighttime workouts. And you&apos;ll now have access to the Garmin Messenger app on the watch itself, in case of an emergency.</p><p>Garmin also promises a "new map interface" for its TopoActive maps that lets you "customize map layers," but the press release doesn&apos;t elaborate how it&apos;ll work.</p><p>What&apos;s more exciting (in my mind) is the new "dynamic round-trip routing." Basically, it appears you&apos;ll be able to choose a hiking destination and intended distance, and have Garmin show you possible routes back and how long each would take. This will help keep your local park trails fresh, save you time finding new trails on Alltrails, and ensure you return to your car before it gets dark.</p><p>Those are all of the new Garmin fenix 8 features the company has revealed thus far. Otherwise, you&apos;ll find plenty of familiar training tools: Training readiness, endurance score, hill score, VO2 Max, PacePro, ClimbPro, and Garmin Coach. You also get ECG readings, HRV Status, Pulse Ox, and sleep coaching with nap detection.</p><p>Compared to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>, you&apos;ll get more advanced sports modes, TopoActive Maps, multi-band GPS, longer battery life, and a more durable design with the fenix 8 series.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-garmin-enduro-3"><span>Garmin Enduro 3</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6884px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xPq99BprvdSR28EXvbK3GA" name="garmin-enduro-3-dynamic-routing.jpeg" alt="Photo of dynamic round-trip routing on the Garmin Enduro 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xPq99BprvdSR28EXvbK3GA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6884" height="3872" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned above, the Garmin Enduro 3 beats the Enduro 2 for solar-backed smartwatch days (90 vs. 46 days), GPS hours (320 vs. 150 hours), and multi-band GPS hours (120 vs. 81 hours), thanks to a new solar panel. </p><p>I assume it&apos;s the same revamped solar panel added to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a> in 2023, since the Enduro 2 launched in 2022. For context, that watch lasts 145 GPS hours or 36 multi-band GPS hours. The Enduro 3 costs twice as much and lasts twice as long, so you can decide if you need that extra capacity or not.</p><p>Of course, the Enduro 3 has other perks besides battery life: A titanium bezel, sapphire lens, built-in LED flashlight, and a proper 1.4-inch MIP display that can display more text than an Instinct&apos;s low-res, two-window display. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jVFERauWteBMd9toakort7" name="garmin-enduro-3-photo-led-flashlight.jpeg" alt="Photo taken at night of the Garmin Enduro 3 with the LED flashlight on." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jVFERauWteBMd9toakort7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8256" height="4644" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like the fenix 8, it has preloaded topographic, golf, and ski maps, plus the new dynamic round-trip routing and advanced strength training plan features. Also, you get ECG readings for AFib detection and a built-in LED flashlight for the first time.</p><p>Garmin says the Enduro 3 weighs 63g (I assume without the band) and ships with an UltraFit nylon band. The band-less Enduro 2 weighs 64g, so I assume the experience will feel comparable. It&apos;s also important to note that the Enduro 3&apos;s boosted battery comes from getting a few hours of sunlight per day. Depending on the conditions where you live or hike, your Enduro 3 might not last as long as what Garmin promises on paper.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL might sound like a new addition to the family, since we&apos;ve never had a &apos;Pro XL&apos; Pixel before this, but it&apos;s actually the Pixel 9 Pro that&apos;s the new addition with its smaller screen size. The 9 Pro XL is the direct successor to the 8 Pro, but with a higher price tag and a few improvements.</p><p>Starting at $1,099, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> goes up against a formidable rival — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>. Both phones come with the same level of software update commitment, very useful AI features, premium designs, and great cameras. Picking just one is a tough call, but that&apos;s where we come in. Let&apos;s compare both to see which one would be the most practical choice.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2XTFe28XWSvVLQ4gKWJ4dm" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-display-fingerprint-sensor-01.jpg" alt="An up-close look at the new in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2XTFe28XWSvVLQ4gKWJ4dm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Design is usually a subjective matter, but I think most will agree that the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL has a more head-turning look. It&apos;s something brand new and we don&apos;t have this aesthetic anywhere outside the Pixel 9 series. We&apos;ve seen the look of the Galaxy S24 Plus on previous models and Samsung&apos;s cheaper series too. It&apos;s clean and simple, which some might actually prefer. Regardless of which design catches your fancy, you can expect excellent build quality on both with premium materials like glass and aluminum.</p><p>In terms of ease of use though, the Galaxy has the upper hand here as it&apos;s way lighter and slimmer than the Pixel. We&apos;re talking 7.7mm versus 8.5mm in thickness, and 197g versus 221g in weight. The S24 Plus does have sharper corners which we found to be a little painful when holding it. The Pixel 9 Pro XL feels better in the hand, in our experience. Both get the IP68 rating for proper dust and water-proofing.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S24 Plus and Pixel 9 Pro XL have nearly the same screen sizes. The Pixel has a 6.8-inch Super Actua OLED display with a crisp 2,992x1,344 resolution. It gets a variable refresh rate of 1-120Hz, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for scratch protection, and a peak brightness of up to 3,000 nits. The display looks great in general and gets plenty bright too. However, Google is stuck on the 240Hz PWM dimming rate which can result in severe headaches for those sensitive to this, as our resident Pixel reviewer quickly found out.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Plus doesn&apos;t have this problem, and it matches the 9 Pro XL in terms of specs. It uses a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a sharp 3,220x1,440 resolution. There&apos;s a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz, Victus 2 scratch protection, and a peak brightness of up to 2,600 nits.</p><p>Another thing worth noting is that the 9 Pro XL&apos;s display curves a lot more along the edges than the Galaxy, which can cut off some UI elements like when gaming for instance. Both phones also use ultrasonic fingerprint sensors, but we found the Pixel to be problematic when using some screen protectors.</p>

<p>While both phones come with 2024 hardware, the Galaxy S24 Plus easily beats the Pixel 9 Pro XL when it comes to raw performance and gaming. This is largely thanks to the more potent Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, which is a lot more powerful than the Tensor G4 in the Pixel. The S24 Plus has 12GB of RAM and comes with 256GB of base storage, along with a 512GB option. Prices start at $999.99 and go up to $1,199.99 from Samsung&apos;s official site. Given that it has now been on sale for nearly half a year, you can easily find a deal on Amazon for the top variant, for well under $1,000.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL has only just launched, and unless you snagged a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-deals-pixel-9-pro-discounts">pre-order deal</a>, you&apos;ll most likely be paying full price for a while. The pricing is not great, to be brutally honest. You&apos;ll have to settle for a measly 128GB of storage for $1,099, as going to 256GB to match the Galaxy&apos;s base model would be $1,199. There&apos;s a 512GB option too for $1,319, which I don&apos;t see many opting for.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="cnVn4Mi6GJUxWT7XdjFabJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-plus-all-colors-02.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cnVn4Mi6GJUxWT7XdjFabJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery capacities and charging speeds are also different on both phones. The Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 5,060mAh battery which can be charged at up to 37W using Google&apos;s 45W wall charger. It can also do fast wireless charging up to 23W using the Pixel Stand (2nd Gen) charger. So far in our initial review of the phone, battery life has been pretty stellar in real-world usage, similar to the Pixel 8 Pro.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Plus has a slightly smaller 4,900mAh battery, but charges at 45W wired. Wireless charging is still limited to 15W. This small dip in capacity shouldn&apos;t phase you though, as we regularly got a full day&apos;s worth of use and then some when we reviewed it.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S24 Plus packs a very similar camera setup as its predecessor, which is to say, you can expect quality shots whether day or night. It still struggles to take sharp photos of moving subjects, but this has improved compared to before. Only the main camera gets a high 50MP resolution, while the ultrawide and telephoto have a paltry 12MP and 10MP resolutions, respectively. The same goes for the selfie camera, which is just 12MP.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL is the opposite. It has either 50MP or 48MP resolutions for the rear cameras, and all three popular focal lengths are covered. Even the selfie camera is 48MP. While a direct camera comparison should prove which one is the sharper shooter, my money is on the Pixel.</p>

<p>In the update commitment department, the Galaxy and Pixel are tied. Both offer seven years of support, including OS upgrades and security patches, meaning you&apos;re good till 2031 with either phone. Depending on your flavor of Android, you could go either way here. The 9 Pro XL offers a leaner Android experience with little to no fluff and bloatware. Plus, you have access to Pixel-exclusive features like the new Add Me camera trick. Owning a Pixel means you&apos;ll be the first for updates, as well as new features that Google might add in the future.</p><p>Similarly, the S24 Plus also gets useful AI features and works best with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung&apos;s best smartwatches</a>, which are easily among the best. Even though Galaxy AI features are no longer exclusive to the S24 series, there are some very handy ones like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-chat-assist-samsung-galaxy-s24">Chat Assist</a>. The software interface is One UI, which has gotten way leaner over the years, but it&apos;s still no substitute for a true clean Android experience.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus is, by a good margin, the more sensible and practical phone. It&apos;s cheaper, has a more powerful processor that&apos;ll be relevant for longer, packs enough AI smarts to keep most happy, and Samsung has been pretty on-point with updates off late. Its design lacks the &apos;wow&apos; factor of the Pixel 9 Pro XL for sure, and its cameras are probably a notch behind what the Pixel has, but it still makes a very compelling case for itself, especially when you can have the top 512GB model for less than the starting price of the 9 Pro XL.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL is a special phone, no doubt. It offers that unique Android experience that only a Pixel can, and certain software features will probably stay exclusive to Google&apos;s own hardware. If there&apos;s a specific feature you&apos;re after that the 9 Pro XL has and you have the budget, you should be very happy with it. You could consider the standard Pixel 9 Pro too if size isn&apos;t a deterrent. But keep in mind that the new Tensor G4 is not much powerful than the G3, which wasn&apos;t a game changer to begin with. It&apos;s also thicker and heavier, the display flickering is still an issue if you have sensitive vision, and it&apos;s more expensive.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Honor Magic V3 made a splash in China by setting new thickness records for foldables, and now it’s getting some cool new features before going global.</li><li>Honor and Google Cloud are teaming up to add advanced AI features to the Magic V3, including AI Eraser, Face-to-Face Translation, and Notes Live Translation.</li><li>The new AI tools are similar to those in Samsung’s Galaxy AI and Google’s suite.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor and Google Cloud have joined forces to load the Magic V3 with advanced AI features, such as AI Eraser, Face-to-Face Translation, and Notes Live Translation ahead of the phone&apos;s global debut at IFA 2024 in Berlin.</p><p>When Honor unveiled the Magic V3 in China, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-ultra-thin-durable-creation-details">made waves by breaking thickness records for foldables</a>. Now, before the global launch, the company is adding some great new features to the device.</p><p>The new AI features resemble those seen in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and Google’s AI suite. For example, AI Eraser is similar to Magic Editor, which allows users to easily remove unwanted items from their photos. Both tools use a circular animation to pick out subjects, showing a trend in user interface design.</p><p>Meanwhile, Face-to-Face Translation is a handy feature that translates conversations in real time. It makes talking with people who speak different languages a breeze and keeps the conversation flowing smoothly.</p><p>Furthermore, Honor&apos;s Notes Live Translation is perfect for students, pros, and travelers. It instantly translates handwritten notes, so you can quickly understand and share information in different languages. It’s kind of like Samsung’s Galaxy AI tools, but with its own spin.</p><p>Honor’s partnership with Google Cloud to add AI features to the Magic V3 isn’t breaking new ground. Samsung has done something similar with Google Cloud for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series, and Google itself is using its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> model for AI on the Pixel 8 series, showing that this trend is really picking up steam.</p><p>On top of its cloud-based features, the Magic V3 also comes with Honor’s own on-device AI, Magic Portal. This smart assistant offers personalized recommendations based on your preferences and habits. One standout capability of Magic Portal is its ability to run two separate floating apps at once on the large inner screen. This makes multitasking easier and boosts productivity.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 is finally here, and can be yours for a starting price of $799. It&apos;s more than the Pixel 8 and definitely pricier than the Pixel 7 from 2022, which is still being sold by Google. The 7 is trickier to find today in the color and storage option that you might want, but should you still be bothering with it? Let&apos;s try and answer two things — should you upgrade to the Pixel 9 if you currently have a 7, and is the older model worth getting in 2024? </p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-7-design-xa0-2">Google Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 7: Design </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VU7m9rf75QJJkG3h3FVVvK" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-22.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VU7m9rf75QJJkG3h3FVVvK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can instantly tell the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> apart from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-review">Pixel 7</a> due to the big change in the design language. Gone are the soft, sloping edges in favor of a flat frame on the new model. This makes the 9 look very iPhone-like, for better or worse. Personally, I don&apos;t have a problem with it. I think it looks good and more grown up. The new colors also look great, especially the pink variant. The four corners of the display are also more heavily rounded, compared to the nearly rectangular look of the 7.</p><p>The camera band on the back of the Pixel 7 has been replaced by a metal island on the 9. Despite having the same display size, the Pixel 9 is slightly shorter and lighter than the 7. You won&apos;t be able to reuse any of the 7&apos;s cases, but luckily there is already a good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">selection of Pixel 9 cases</a> online.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JCwKZP4k5G9HZZMq2QTeVP" name="Google-Pixel-7-back-black-10.jpg" alt="The back of the black Google Pixel 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JCwKZP4k5G9HZZMq2QTeVP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has upgraded the display tech in the new model. The Pixel 9 sports an &apos;Actua&apos; display, with a dynamic refresh rate of 60-120Hz. The resolution has been bumped up just a bit to 2,424x1,080 but it&apos;s not something you&apos;ll notice even if you compare both phones side by side. The HDR brightness level is now up to 1,800 nits on the 9 (vs. 1,000 nits on the 7), and the display has a peak brightness of up to 2,700 nits. </p><p>Not that we had an issue with the Pixel 7&apos;s display, but having a higher peak brightness never hurt anyone. The scratch protection on the Pixel 9&apos;s display sees an upgrade to Gorilla Glass Victus 2. Both phones are IP68 rated for dust and water resistance. </p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-7-hardware-and-specs-xa0-2">Google Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 7: Hardware and specs </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4231px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4TXmJfVXGYaC89kvK8erVU" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-04.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 camera app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4TXmJfVXGYaC89kvK8erVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4231" height="2380" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The processor is the biggest change here. The Google Pixel 9 uses the latest Tensor G4 SoC, which is promised to have improved performance and power efficiency. The Titan M2 security chip is also present on both, which provides hardware-level encryption for your personal information. The Tensor G2 in the Pixel 7 chugs along nicely when using common social and productivity apps. This processor isn&apos;t built for gaming, but it can handle most casual titles just fine. Does the G4 change this? I guess you&apos;ll have to wait for our full review of the 9 to find out. </p><p>The increase in RAM to 12GB (from 8GB) on the Pixel 9 is definitely going to be useful in the long run. You can choose between 128GB or 256GB of storage. The latter variant will set you back $899. Meanwhile, the 128GB variant of the Pixel 7 goes for about $450 on Amazon, while the 256GB model costs around $633. The price difference between the two generations will only widen as the 7 is slowly phased out. </p>

<p>The Pixel 9 manages to cram in a larger 4,700mAh battery, despite being slimmer and lighter. We found the battery life on the Pixel 7&apos;s 4,355mAh battery to be alright, but nothing great. Hopefully, the 9 is able to improve on that in real-world use too. The 9 charges quicker too, up to 27W, compared to the 21W of the 7. Interestingly, the Pixel 7 supports up to 21W wireless charging, but the 9 can only charge up to 15W when using the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-stand-2nd-gen-charger-review">Pixel Stand (2nd Gen)</a> wireless charger. Regular Qi charging is limited to 12W on both phones.</p><p>The ultrawide camera on the Pixel 9 gets a big bump in resolution, going from 12MP to 48MP. It has a wider field of view and gains autofocus which means macro photography is possible. Both phones have a 50MP main camera, but again, the 9 has a wider f/1.68 aperture for better low-light shots. You still don&apos;t get a telephoto here, so you&apos;ll have to step up to the Pro models for that. The selfie cameras are similar on both too, but you get autofocus on the Pixel 9 now.</p><p>Camera features are largely similar on both, except for some of the new additions like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">&apos;Add Me&apos;</a> which is currently exclusive to the 9 series.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-7-software-xa0-2">Google Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 7: Software </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CcMYegdn3J5Sf9ybyfyWrR" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-14.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 fingerprint sensor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CcMYegdn3J5Sf9ybyfyWrR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 has the biggest advantage over the Pixel 7 when it comes to software. Google&apos;s seven-year software support commitment began with the Pixel 8, so the 7 is sadly limited to just three years of OS upgrades till 2025. It will continue to receive security patches till 2027, but it most likely won&apos;t get new versions beyond Android 15 or 16 at best.</p><p>The Pixel 9 launched with Android 14 rather than 15, probably because Google moved its hardware announcement earlier this year. The 9 is covered for seven years of OS and security updates, which is a big deal. If you&apos;re paying full price for a new phone, it might as well be supported for at least the next two to three years at the very least.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tQMNQXwaV7Pomdj28HW7nV" name="google-pixel-9-with-buds-pro-2-peony-pink-01.jpg" alt="The Peony pink Google Pixel 9 next to the pink Google Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQMNQXwaV7Pomdj28HW7nV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you can find a good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-preorder-deals">early deal on the Pixel 9</a>, I&apos;d say go for it. The larger battery with quicker charging, more RAM, and newer processor are good enough reasons that justify paying the premium for the new model, over the 7. Not to mention the long software update commitment will keep your Pixel 9 relevant for years to come. </p><p>If you can&apos;t justify spending $800 or more on the 9, ditch the Pixel 7 and look for a deal on the Pixel 8 instead. It&apos;s nearly as good as the latest phone, and it&apos;s only a matter of time before it drops below the $600 mark, making it a great bargain. Comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-8">Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 8</a>, you&apos;re still getting seven years of software support and most of the improved features that are on the 9.</p>

<p>Introduced in October 2022, the Google Pixel Watch was a great first smartwatch for the company. But it has been improved upon not once but twice, with plenty of features, functions, and usability upgrades that make this one outdated and worth upgrading from.</p></p>

<p>So, you’re looking for a new smartwatch. Maybe you are considering upgrading your almost two-year-old Google Pixel Watch. Or maybe, you&apos;re switching to the Pixel Watch from a Fitbit or another smartwatch brand altogether. This might even be your very first smartwatch. If so, congratulations! You won’t regret the decision. If Google’s Pixel Watch line has caught your eye, the deals you might be able to find on the Google Pixel Watch may look enticing.</p><p>But when deciding between the Google Pixel Watch 3 vs. Pixel Watch, it’s clear which one you should go with. First, let’s dive into the differences and why, along with whether you should consider the upgrade if you already own the older model.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-watch-3-vs-pixel-watch-how-they-look-2">Google Pixel Watch 3 vs. Pixel Watch: How they look</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7nHHVPfwbPEaa4VjRngXdi" name="google-pixel-watch-3-45mm-on-wrist-porcelain-band.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 with Porcelain band on wrist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7nHHVPfwbPEaa4VjRngXdi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Google Pixel Watch 3</a>, introduced in August 2024 at the Made by Google event, is available in 41mm or 45mm sizes with the same round face which has become the custom with Pixel Watches. The 41mm size comes in Polished Silver with a Porcelain Active or Rose Quartz band, Champagne Gold with a Hazel band, or Matte Black with an Obsidian band while the 45mm size comes in Matte Black/Obsidian, Polished Silver/Porcelain, or Matte Hazel/Hazel Active.</p><p>It’s made of aluminum versus stainless steel, a strange switch since the latter tends to be more durable. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">his initial hands-on</a>, Android Central’s Andrew Myrick says he finds it to be “light as a feather” compared to other smartwatches in its class, even when it comes to the larger 45mm option. Speaking of which, he loves that option, which he says feels much better on his wrist than the “daintier” 41mm option. He also notices that you can view five more complications along the edge of the larger 45mm screen. The extra screen real estate also displays additional workout options on the same screen, resulting in less scrolling and swiping.</p><p>Both sizes boast more screen real estate than the previous generation Pixel Watch 2, which is also more screen real estate than the original Pixel Watch. You get an Actua AMOLED LTPO always-on display affording 2,000 nits brightness and covered in custom 3D Corning Gorilla Glass 5. There’s a side button and haptic crown along with a built-in mic and speaker.</p><p>This smartwatch is meant to keep up with the rigors of your day, meeting 5ATM and IP68 water- and dust-resistant ratings. So go ahead and shower with it on, or even take a dip in the pool. (It’s a good idea to dry it off when you’re done).</p><p>Battery life is the big differentiator here when comparing this model to the original Pixel Watch, at least based on Google’s claims: Myrick was not yet able to test this out in his initial hands-on but stay tuned for his full review. For now, what we know is that the Pixel Watch had a similar rating for its battery life, but users quickly found that using the always-on display, which most people like to have, significantly drains the battery.</p><p>In contrast, the Google Pixel Watch 3 improved on the battery life (as did the Pixel Watch 2). With that said, it’s still only up to a rated 24 hours per charge with the always-on display, or 36 hours when using Battery Saver mode. The saving grace is that the Watch recharges quickly, and Google claims it charges even faster than the Pixel Watch 2: the 307mAh battery in the 41mm edition can go from zero to full charge in an hour and the 45mm and its 420mAh battery in about 80 minutes.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that since the Pixel Watch 3 uses the same band mechanism as the original Pixel Watch, you would still be able to use extra bands you bought if you already own the latter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9hnCBrTJzTcaDbMwsx3pKM" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-Woven-Band-wearing-01.jpg" alt="The Ivy colorway Google Pixel Watch Woven Band" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9hnCBrTJzTcaDbMwsx3pKM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Google Pixel Watch</a> looks similar with the same round face and an AMOLED screen. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">his review</a>, Myrick found the screen to be vibrant and pleasing. Knowing how much Google has improved upon the screen experience with the Google Pixel Watch 3, you’ll find it even more so. It has the same side button and rotating crown with haptic feedback.</p><p>Available in Champagne Gold with Hazel Active band, Matte Black with Obsidian Band, Polished Silver with Chalk Active band, and Polished Silver with Charcoal Active band, you’ll only get one 41mm size. So, for those with bigger wrists or who prefer larger smartwatches, the larger option with the Google Pixel Watch 3 will be a welcome choice.</p><p>It has a scratch and splash-resistant screen that meets the 5ATM rating but not an IP68 rating making it less durable. This means it isn’t technically resistant to dust or water depth but just certain levels of pressure. You can still swim in shallow water and shower with it on. But the Pixel Watch 3 adds an extra layer of durability to the experience. However, the original Pixel Watch is made of recycled stainless steel instead of aluminum.</p><p>The battery, as noted, is the big difference here since the Google Pixel Watch is known to drain quickly. If you despise having to charge your smartwatch multiple times a day or own the Google Pixel Watch and this is one of your biggest frustrations, it’s one that makes the upgrade worth it.</p><p>With both, you can choose from various screens to personalize the look, add complications, adjust accent colors, and more. Swiping, meanwhile, opens various Tiles so you can explore everything the smartwatches have to offer.</p><p>The biggest selling point here that makes the Google Pixel Watch 3 the better option is the fact that you can enjoy more of the screen real estate, get a better, brighter screen, and, arguably most importantly, battery life has improved.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-watch-3-vs-pixel-watch-the-specs-2">Google Pixel Watch 3 vs. Pixel Watch: The specs</h2>
<p>Let&apos;s see how these two compare when it comes down to specs.</p>

<p>There’s a lot the same but a lot different about these two smartwatches. When it comes down to it, it’s all about what’s under the hood.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-watch-3-vs-pixel-watch-key-features-and-functions-2">Google Pixel Watch 3 vs. Pixel Watch: Key features and functions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="o7JXfP3syzrv9LqmuykoRn" name="google-pixel-watch-3-custom-run-activity-2.jpg" alt="Custom Run Activity on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o7JXfP3syzrv9LqmuykoRn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How do these two smartwatches compare when it comes down to what they can do and track?</p><p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 runs on WearOS 5.0 and tracks all the usual vitals, including SpO2, heart rate and ECG, EDA and skin temperature, sleep, activity, and more. It can track more than 40 different exercises and even provide readiness insights to let you know when you are at your best for a workout or when you need a rest day.</p><p>It has special features for runners, including custom runs that include warmup, cooldown, and pacing, real-time guidance with audio and haptic cues, and performance insights. There’s also advanced motion sensing to measure cadence, stride, vertical oscillation, and more, also ideal for runners.</p><p>What sets it apart from even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Google Pixel Watch 2</a> is the inclusion of Google AI to analyze goals. That feature requires a Fitbit Premium subscription, but the Watch comes with a six-month trial. You also get, it’s worth noting, two years of data for the Watch from Google Fi Wireless.</p><p>Further, you get cardio load details and receive daily targets based on your baselines. A Morning Brief is delivered each morning when you wake up providing a summary of your sleep score, readiness, and weather. The readiness score is a big one here since that was previously included under Fitbit Premium, but now you get the metric even without a subscription.</p><p>Along with working seamlessly with Google Pixel phones (though you can wear the Watch with any Android phone), you can use the Google Pixel Watch 3 to control a Pixel camera. Myrick loved this feature, noting that you can even use the watch as a viewfinder and switch among different camera modes. You can also access Google TV, and even see a compatible Nest Cam feed on its tiny screen and speak to the person at the door or send a canned response. The Watch has 32GB storage for apps, music, and more and 2GB RAM, along with a built-in speaker and mic.</p><p>Additional features include AI call screening, and a smart recorder that can record audio, save it to the app, and even analyze it using AI so the recordings are searchable. From a safety perspective, there are features like safety check, fall detection, safety signal, emergency sharing, and medical ID.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="uFb89yjencX8o8iAkzFAPc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-charging-on-dock.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch charging on the included magnetic dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uFb89yjencX8o8iAkzFAPc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the original Google Pixel Watch, you expectedly don’t get quite as much, and certainly no AI integration. Running the older Wear OS 3.5, it can track plenty of sports and activities. You don’t get any special features for runners, but you can download favorite running apps from the Google Play Store, like Runtastic, and access those.</p><p>You can sign up for Fitbit Premium with this smartwatch, too, which affords access to features like a Readiness Score, nutrition information, access to workouts, and more. With both watches, it should be noted that Google is slowly transitioning from the dedicated Fitbit app login to Google. So, when buying new, you’ll flip right to logging in with your Google account but still have the option for Fitbit Premium.</p><p>The original Google Pixel Watch can track most of the same vitals as well, including SpO2, sleep, heart rate, and ECG, but it does not track body temperature. You get many of the same safety features like emergency SOS and fall detection. But Google enhanced many of these features with the Google Pixel Watch 2 and 3, so the options are limited with this original model. You can, however, still control compatible smart home devices and the Watch still seamlessly pairs with a Pixel phone and works with other branded Android phones.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-watch-3-vs-pixel-watch-which-should-you-buy-2">Google Pixel Watch 3 vs. Pixel Watch: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UTBgD6CtsrdwzTmveZFbUc" name="google-pixel-watch-3-camera-viewfinder-controls.jpg" alt="Camera Viewfinder on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTBgD6CtsrdwzTmveZFbUc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to Google Pixel Watch 3 vs. Google Pixel Watch, the decision of which one to buy is obvious: go with the Google Pixel Watch 3. You get more features, better battery life, two size options, and additional tracking that runners will appreciate. It has the newer version of Google WearOS, can take skin temperature readings as well, and is more durable with an IP68 rating alongside the 5ATM. Plus, there are cool new usability features involving the integration of AI, like screen recording.</p><p>The bigger decision is if you should upgrade if you already own the Google Pixel Watch. The answer to that is yes as well. The massive improvement to battery life alone is worth ditching that old watch and getting the new one, especially if you have found battery life to be a pain point. </p><p>Keep in mind that many upgrades were already made to the Google Pixel Watch 2, so if you’re looking for a happy medium, you can also consider that watch. Introduced in October 2023, it’s still a recent model in the line and might be available for a better deal with the launch of the Google Pixel Watch 3. </p><p>The only real reason to opt for the original Google Pixel Watch at this point, or to stick with it if you already own one, is if you’re running an Android device with an older OS that can’t be updated to the new one. But if this is the case, it’s advisable to upgrade your phone first before you even consider a smartwatch anyway. </p><p>If you aren’t quite sure about the Google Pixel Watch 3, or want to see how it stacks up to others, check out our picks for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">the best Android smartwatches</a> which include both the Google Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 (Pixel Watch 3 inclusion pending) along with plenty other options from Fitbit, Garmin, Samsung, OnePlus, and more.</p>

<ul><li>An APK teardown of the recent Google app beta shows Google is planning to move the location of "Trusted Places" and improve its management capabilities.</li><li>The feature was spotted within your device's Location settings and its home page offers clearer adding, adjusting, and deletion functionality.</li><li>There is speculation that Trusted Places will soon show your "Extend Unlock" settings after Google rolls it out.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Your device security is a hot topic, but Google might improve one setting that helps you feel at ease in places you trust.</p><p>According to an APK teardown by AssembleDebug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-may-make-it-easier-to-manage-the-places-your-phone-stays-unlocked-apk-teardown-3475259/">Android Authority</a>, Google is seemingly preparing to deliver an upgrade to "Trusted Places." Version 24.34.33 of the Google app beta holds signs of better management for such places. The teardown showed that users can soon find the feature easier by heading into <strong>Settings > Location > Trusted Places</strong>.</p><p>From there, users will find the feature listed among several others with the description "tap to manage."</p><p>Doing so will show that the places you trust "are not shared with Google" and are saved on your device. Users can specify certain places at "home," "work," and more through its customization option. The new home for "Trusted Places" comes with a revamped menu as users can add, adjust, and delete locations they no longer need.</p><p>The page also reiterates that "Trusted Places" will provide certain location-based settings based on what you&apos;ve saved. Those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-add-trusted-place-android-50-lollipop">familiar with the feature</a> since the old days of Android 5 (Lollipop) will know that one of its functions is to keep your phone unlocked at a trusted location.</p><p>The publication states that many of these upgrades and changes aren&apos;t working properly in the teardown. No surprise there as Google is most likely in development still, with no telling when we could expect it. One can hope that it&apos;ll arrive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/final-android-15-beta-4-2-rollout">with or sometime after Android 15</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:564px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.38%;"><img id="Z9Tsd5f9xA2RJd4v6KNUfC" name="android-trusted-places-new-home-redesign-settings.jpg" alt="A look an Android's "Trusted Settings" new home and management changes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z9Tsd5f9xA2RJd4v6KNUfC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="564" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>An upgrade for Android&apos;s "Trusted Places" is likely long overdue as it&apos;s (currently) buried in a slew of menus. Moreover, these changes can pair well with Google&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/extend-unlock-rebrand-spotted">Extend Unlock</a>." During its rebrand from Smart Lock, it was discovered that the Extended version would "keep this device unlocked while it&apos;s on you, at specific places that you trust, or near your connected devices."</p><p>The publication mentions that the teardown shows a "see all settings that use trusted places" tagline at the bottom. That could indicate a much closer partnership between several of Android&apos;s personal security settings. </p><p>Of course, this is an easy alternative to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-use-wear-os-watch-unlock">Watch Unlock</a> as that feature requires your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch</a> to be nearby to open the phone.</p><p>Android&apos;s "Trusted Places" might feel like a niche feature, especially considering most users will likely want their device locked and secure. However, in the interest of device security, Google is working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-space-full-details">Private Spaces</a> for Android 15. The feature lets users store apps they don&apos;t want others to see in a separate place on their device. Such a feature might work well with Trusted Places as it steps back into frame.</p>

<ul><li>A rumor from a Weibo tipster claims Xiaomi is beginning to develop a tri-fold device to compete with Huawei and Samsung.</li><li>Little information is known about the device's specifics; however, speculation states a prototype could appear during MWC 2025.</li><li>Huawei's upcoming tri-fold phone was spotted with its former CEO, and rumors suggested it could launch in September.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As more brands pitch their foldable takes, the industry looks to advance towards newer form factors, and now Xiaomi is rumored to enter the fray with its take.</p><p>The latest rumor stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5888095979/OtV7Ii6Ti">Smart Pikachu</a>, a Weibo tipster who claims Xiaomi is working on a tri-folding phone (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/the-race-for-tri-fold-smartphones-might-be-heating-up-xiaomi-to-jump-in_id161791">PhoneArena</a>). Take this rumor with a grain of salt as the tipster&apos;s post didn&apos;t offer any additional information about other aspects of the device.</p><p>The report adds that Xiaomi could be preparing for a more interesting MWC 2025 showcase if this tri-fold device exists. The publication suggests the Chinese company could show off an early prototype of the foldable to start building interest.</p><p>Other speculation from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/08/26/xiaomis-tri-foldable-phone-in-works-heres-what-to-expect/">Gizmochina</a> states Xiaomi could feature its HyperOS 2.0, the Leica camera system, and Qualcomm&apos;s flagship Snapdragon chip.</p><p>Users have started wondering if Xiaomi will upgrade/improve the crease experience of its foldable if this tri-fold rumor is accurate. Additional posts have started to notice the tri-fold trend as they mention the recent rumors and live photos about Huawei&apos;s version.</p><p>Huawei&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-tri-fold-phone-former-ceo-photographed">tri-fold device</a> was spotted in the hands of its former CEO earlier in August. The device appeared quite large in hand, almost tablet-like, as rumors claimed it may feature a 10-inch display when unfolded. Speculation states Huawei&apos;s tri-fold will likely debut with a "premium price tag" alongside HiSilicon&apos;s Kirin 9 series SoC to power it.</p><p>Interestingly, Huawei <em>and </em>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-huawei-new-foldable-phone-push">were rumored</a> to have a couple of new foldable prototypes in the works. The devices would take on a "Z" shape. With Huawei&apos;s version seemingly further along, rumors claim it could debut in China in September. Samsung was reportedly working on a "rollable" style foldable, as shown <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-display-foldable-rollable-tech-concepts-ces-2024">during CES 2024</a>. That showcase was paired with an "In&Out Flip" that could fold its display 360 degrees.</p><p>While we wait to see if this Xiaomi rumor is true, the company launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-confirms-the-launch-date-for-its-galaxy-z-fold-6-contender">new foldable duo</a> in July. The brand debuted the Mix Fold 4 and its first clamshell, the Mix Flip. With the latest rumors about Xiaomi, it seems OEMs are quickly scrambling to bring a third form for its foldables to take on.</p>

<p>The next iteration of Android software isn&apos;t coming as soon as you may have thought, at least according to the latest rumor.</p><p>A report about Android 15&apos;s potential launch window stems from Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-pixel-update-3475337/">Android Authority</a>) who states October might be our best bet for the stable version.

Unsightly problems like this would undoubtedly cause major hiccups for Android devices preparing to receive the new OS. The post doesn&apos;t offer specifics on the problems Google discovered. There were likely more problems beneath its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/final-android-15-beta-4-2-rollout">final Android 15 beta</a> than we realize.</p><p>Rahman <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-source-code-release-3475328/">also reported</a> that Google plans to release the software&apos;s source code to the public "next week," September 3. If true, this development only adds to the confusion and the oddity of this year&apos;s major Android software release.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google for more information about Android 15&apos;s rumored launch. We will update this article when we hear back.</p>

<p>Android 15 potentially launching in October isn&apos;t strange as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> debuted during that same month in 2023. What makes this odd is that we&apos;re getting everything exciting <em>around </em>this major OS without having anything actually landing. Aside from the sheer number of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-it-mean-if-both-google-and-samsungs-android-15-updates-are-delayed">delays from Google and Samsung</a>, the company wrapped up its Android 15 beta earlier this month.</p><p>It seemed to make sense that September would hold Android 15&apos;s launch, as suspected, but instead, we&apos;ve got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-1-begins">first QPR beta</a> to play with. Moreover, consumers are starting to get their hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a>, which was expected to launch with the stable software.</p><p>Android 14 launched early in October last year, which coincided with the release of the Pixel 8 series shortly after. Additionally, the software&apos;s QPR1 Beta 1 kicked off a couple of weeks <em>before </em>the grand reveal, which made sense as users were getting their hands on the real deal soon anyway.</p><p>We hope the delay will be worth the wait as Google seems poised to introduce <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">several new features</a> and improved software optimization.</p>

<ul><li>Users on Reddit and Google's Pixel community forum report problems with the Pixel 9 Pro XL's wireless charging.</li><li>The device is experiencing sporadic and non-functioning charging through several wireless charging accessories.</li><li>Google support confirmed to a user that the company is aware of the problem are is working on a fix.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Users getting their hands on Google&apos;s Pixel 9 series report issues with its wireless charging capability.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techissuestoday.com/google-investigating-pixel-9-series-wireless-charging-issues/">Tech Issues Today</a>, reports in Google&apos;s Pixel community forum have ben complaining quite heavily about the Pixel 9 Pro XL (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/26/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-wireless-charging-issues/">9to5Google</a>). One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/292671042/new-pixel-9-xl-wireless-charger-issue?hl=en">report claims</a> their device displayed "odd behavior" when wirelessly charging using a MagSafe puck with a Mous MagSafe case. The user states that their phone would begin charging, only to see it fail shortly after.</p><p>Attempting to charge via a MagSafe Qi charger caused charging to become sporadic. Moreover, the Pixel 9 Pro XL generated more heat this way, with the report adding that the device became hot. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/292671042?hl=en&msgid=293113902">Another user</a> chimed into the situation, listing five wireless chargers that failed to produce consistent results.</p><p>One user attempted to charge their Pixel 9 Pro XL with Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-stand-2nd-gen-charger-review">second-generation stand</a>; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/292487833/pixel-9-xl-wireless-charging-issues?hl=en">that didn&apos;t help either</a>. Interestingly, they state that the device "recognizes the charging stand" but refuses to charge. They add that the device will display the appropriate charging icon on the screen, though it&apos;s not charging.</p><p>Of course, contacting Pixel support is your best option. The publication spotted a user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1eys71k/comment/ljidk0z/">receiving confirmation</a> from Google that the device&apos;s odd wireless charging issues are being worked on. The only <em>true </em>solution is to keep a wired charger handy or try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1eys71k/comment/ljidk0z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">one of the tips</a> one user received from support.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that some users reported having similar charging issues with the smaller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> as well. The number of reports is lower than the XL, but they exist, nonetheless.</p>

<p>As the Pixel 9 series arrives for consumers, issues continue to afflict yet another flagship smartphone line for the company, and it&apos;s a frustrating one at that. Pixel 8 Pro owners may remember the weird <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-already-doubting-the-long-term-durability-of-my-pixel-8-pro">USB-C charging port issues</a> that plagued the device a few months after it launched. Android Central reported on the topic, stating that after placing the device on the charger through the night, the phone woke up with 18%.</p><p>The Pixel 6 Pro faced a similar problem during its time, too.</p><p>There&apos;s no telling how long it&apos;ll take for Google to fix the issue. A fix will likely arrive via a software patch, so perhaps we can look for it in September (fingers crossed).</p><p>Google launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> on August 13 alongside the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro. The device offers a 6.8-inch display, a slightly boosted Tensor G4 SoC, and loads of Gemini features.</p>

<ul><li>Google Pixel 9a allegedly appears in leaked images for the first time.</li><li>The upcoming mid-range Google phone sports a flatter design, as seen on the Pixel 9 models.</li><li>Per the leaked images, there appears to be a newly designed camera visor on the back.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The dust around the Pixel 9 series has just settled, and a new leak hints that another Pixel 9 series phone, the mid-range Pixel 9a, is already in the works.</p><p>An X user, ShrimpApplePro, has shared what appears to be a couple of real-life images of the alleged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a>. According to the user, the photos were found in a private Facebook group, which is believed to have been deleted. However, the user managed to grab the images, which show the device&apos;s design.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pixel 9aSource: some random post on Facebook pic.twitter.com/y8jwaQM6Z8<a href="https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1827972946830520568">August 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The Pixel 9a will likely have the same boxy design as the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> phones. It includes flat sides and rounded corners, which is being adopted in more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> lately, including the Samsung counterparts.</p><p>According to the images, Google&apos;s next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phone</a> features sizeable bezels around the display. The SIM tray, USB Type-C, and a single speaker grille are placed at the bottom. The interesting element, however, appears on the back of the device.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, and the models before that, are widely famous for their giant camera visor at the back despite featuring only two lenses, and it also includes the LED flash. Perhaps this won&apos;t be the case this time, as the image reveals the omission of the large visor for the camera housing. Instead, the cameras are placed in a structure that&apos;s nearly flush with the back panel and offset to one side. It&apos;s quite reminiscent of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/essential-phone">Essential PH-1</a> phone, at least at first glance. The LED flash is also moved out of the visor.</p><p>If the images above turn out to be accurate—unless it is some prototype Google phone—the design appears to be quite an interesting departure from the previous Pixel A series phones. It somewhat aligns with the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and Pixel 9 models despite the lack of a protruding camera housing. Still, if the pricing is similar to the earlier models in the lineup and Google doesn&apos;t increase the price as it did with the Pixel 9, it might be an exciting device to choose from the budget segment.</p><p>That said, it&apos;s very possible that this isn&apos;t the Pixel 9a, and even if it is, it may not retain the same form factor, as the expected launch is quite far away. Going by the history of previous models&apos; launches, we expect the device to be launched sometime in Q2 of 2025.</p>
