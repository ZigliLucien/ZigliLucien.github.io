You can transform your pictures into avatars, which you might use for your WhatsApp profile image. The feature can create sketches to look like you, but it may not always get it exactly right. Luckily, there is an option to create a new batch of images.</p><p>You can try the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a> on any picture in your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy phone</a>&apos;s gallery and later share it with others. You can try it on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> or any Galaxy phone with One UI 6.1.1, the version you&apos;ll need to use Portrait Studio.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>To use the feature, your phone must be running on<strong> </strong>One UI 6.1.1. The only phones with this version are the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 at the time of writing. However, the feature will soon be available on older Galaxy phones.</p>

<h2 id="adding-style-to-your-pictures-2">Adding style to your pictures</h2>
<p>Other Samsung features can give your images more style.

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring is a stylish ring that packs a ton of features in a slim and lightweight design. Ideally paired with a Samsung Galaxy phone and/or new Samsung Galaxy Watch, it is ultra-durable so you can wear it just about anywhere. With incredible battery life and an equally elegant charging case to extend that, it’s poised to give Oura a run for its money.</p></p>

<p>Less expensive than the Samsung Galaxy Ring, the Ringconn Smart Ring has the advantage of working equally well with all types of phones, without missing out on any feature. It’s not quite as durable nor as sexy, but feature-wise, it tracks many of the same metrics. It too comes with a case that can keep it going for weeks, a bonus for travelers.</p></p>

<p>Smart rings are popular nowadays with new models coming to market frequently from numerous brands. Two popular ones to consider include the Samsung Galaxy Ring vs. RingConn Smart Ring. Both are premium smart rings that function similarly to smartwatches and fitness trackers, except they are worn on your finger instead of your wrist.</p><p>They are sleek, filled with sensors to track all types of health and wellness metrics, and have their own unique benefits. Which of the two smart rings should you choose? We’re here to help.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3937px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="4b5saqQ7cfSP9bZPWD9ysM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-hands-on-3.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4b5saqQ7cfSP9bZPWD9ysM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3937" height="2215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First, let’s examine fit and design. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> is ultra-slim at just 2.6mm in thickness as well as lightweight, weighing from 2.3 grams up to 3 grams, depending on the size. Speaking of which, it comes in nine size options from 5 to 13 to fit a variety of finger circumferences. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">his hands-on</a>, Android Central’s Derrek Lee says he was surprised by how thin and light the Galaxy Ring is, noting that even though the dimensions suggest it’s thicker than others, the concave design makes it seem thinner. “It feels more like a ring and less like a regular smart ring,” he notes.</p><p>It’s advisable to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-find-the-right-samsung-galaxy-ring-size">get the ring sizing kit to choose the right size</a>. Wear the size you think fits best for 24 hours on your index, middle, or ring finger. Since your finger tends to fluctuate in size throughout the day, especially for women, it’s crucial to ensure that you’re choosing one that isn’t too tight or too loose. Once you confirm the size, you can place your order.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-color-samsung-galaxy-ring-should-you-buy">Available in three scratch-resistant finishes</a> with a durable titanium frame, choose black, silver, or gold. It comes with a full cradle quick charge case that can keep it powered up for as long as two weeks. The ring itself lasts for a week per charge. The clear charging case is stylish with a nice lighting effect to confirm status.</p><p>The ring is extra durable in that it boasts both an IP68 rating as well as a 10ATM rating, which means you can safely swim with it, even in depths as deep as 100 meters. As with any water-resistant device, however, be mindful that this pertains to freshwater surfaces. You’ll want to heed caution in heavily chlorinated pools as well as saltwater.</p><p>On the underside of the watch are three sensors that come in contact with your skin. There’s an optical bio-signal sensor for measuring heart rate, an accelerometer for tracking activities like walking and running, and a skin temperature sensor. The ring pairs seamlessly with the Samsung Health app and does not require a subscription.</p><p>While you can use this smart ring with any Android phone, you’ll be able to leverage all the features when it’s paired with a Samsung Galaxy smartphone. With some of the latest Galaxy smartphones and Galaxy watches, you’ll get additional features, too.</p>

<p>At 2.6mm thin as well, the RingConn Smart Ring comes in Moonlit Silver, Midnight Black, or Pale Gold, very similar colors. It boasts a unique “squircle” design that’s not quite a smooth circle. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-smart-ring-review">his review</a>, Lee says that while the ring doesn’t look as premium as others, it’s not too thick and stands out among a sea of others that all look identical to one another. The flat bottom also makes it easy to tell which side should be on the underside of your finger.</p><p>Sizing ranges from 6-14, so those with extra-thin fingers might find the Samsung Galaxy Ring’s smallest size most suitable. Conversely, those with extra-thick fingers might need to size up and opt for the largest size 14 of the RingConn model. As with the Samsung Galaxy Smart Ring, it’s advised to use the custom sizer to make sure you get the right fit. It’s slightly heavier than the Samsung Galaxy Ring at 3-5 grams, depending on the size.</p><p>Made of lightweight titanium that’s corrosion-resistant with a PVC coating, the RingConn Smart Ring is also IP68 rated, but it does not have an ATM rating for pressure. Nonetheless, you should still be able to safely enjoy casual swims and showers with this model.</p><p>The RingConn Smart Ring comes with a portable charging case as well and lasts for up to seven days per charge, too. The company says the case can offer up to 18 full recharges, which is a huge deal since you can keep it going presumably for weeks. On the underside of this smart ring are four PPG sensors, four temperature sensors, and a 3D accelerometer.</p><p>This smart ring does not require a subscription either, and it can pair seamlessly with all types of phones, including both Android and iOS. Thus, if you don’t own a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, you might prefer this one. it’s also compatible with Apple Health and Google Fit.</p>

<p>How do these two rings measure up? Let’s take a look.</p>

<p>These two smart rings do a lot of the same things and have a lot of the same sensors and features. They even look alike! But let’s look further into how they function.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4ctBCNrQJTj22inn3z6ZDL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-wearing-01.jpg" alt="Wearing the gold Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ctBCNrQJTj22inn3z6ZDL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you have the right size and you’re sporting a new Samsung Galaxy Ring on your finger, what can it do? The smart ring has three sensors, as noted, that track metrics like heart rate, sleep, stress, skin temperature, and more. The sleep tracker offers additional features like snore detection, sleep stages, heart rate during sleep, movement, sleep latency, and respiratory rate. There’s also cycle tracking for ladies to track their menstrual health along with heart rate alerts and the option to run a live heart rate check.</p><p>Thanks to the inclusion of Galaxy AI, you’ll also get an Energy Score. This calculates physical readiness based on the previous night’s sleep, heart rate, and activities to let you know if you should take a rest day or go for it with an intense cardio session. Along with tracking a variety of workouts, it has auto workout detection for walking and running, as well as inactive alerts to remind you to get up and move.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring also provides wellness tips and personalized suggestions, learning more about you over time, and monitors health vitals 24/7. All health data is stored in Samsung Cloud and accessible through the companion Samsung Health app. </p><p>With a compatible Samsung Galaxy phone, you can use the ring to control it through a pinch gesture motion. This can trigger actions like snapping a photo or snoozing an alarm. Lee tried this with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and says the gestures work really well. With a compatible phone, you can also ping the ring with Find My Ring, perfect if you left it in the locker room at the gym or forgot where you put it down in the house. However, it only turns on the ring’s sensor light when you do this, so it might not be helpful in a bright room.</p><p>Samsung also says that when you wear the Galaxy Ring paired with one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">the best Galaxy smartwatches</a> like the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, you’ll get more accurate health analysis. This is because the two together improve precision, especially while sleeping. You can also purportedly wear the Galaxy Ring for longer when it’s paired with the Galaxy Watch, extending the battery life by up to 30 percent.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xqh9iSYteNyEm9Sqy79ZYN" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-review-23.jpg" alt="The RingConn Smart Ring on a hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xqh9iSYteNyEm9Sqy79ZYN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What about the RingConn Smart Ring? Its sensors work much the same way, tracking many of the same metrics, including heart rate, sleep and sleep stages, blood oxygen, stress, and skin temperature. It offers 24/7 health monitoring as well with a unique feature that lets you share health data with a family member or caregiver, great for the elderly or those with disabilities or who are keeping an eye on risk factors like heart attack or stroke. (Naturally, as with any smart ring, this isn’t a medical device).</p><p>You get detailed analysis as well as suggestions as the Ringconn Smart Ring tracks various metrics, with everything easily accessible in the RingConn app. You can also use the app to refine goals as you notice improvements or want to create more accessible goals. While Lee says the app might look busy to some, the Wellness Balance feature, currently in beta, is a neat view that combines all your data and plots it onto a graph. This makes it easy to see which areas need work and how you are progressing (or regressing).</p><p>One limitation is that The RingConn Smart Ring has limited exercise modes from which to choose, with the feature still in beta. It includes basic ones like running, walking, and cycling, but that’s it. Hopefully more are coming in the future; Lee says RingConn is “working to develop more diverse sports modes.” There are, however, neat badge rewards to help encourage you as you hit goals or even wear the ring for a specific duration of time. Lee says it’s a “fun way to turn wearing your smart ring into a game.” But for now, if you want to be able to track different sports, exercises, and activities and don’t already own a smartwatch to do that, the RingConn model won’t be a good choice.</p><p>There are no added bells and whistles with this smart ring, which is also reflected in its price, which is much more affordable than the Samsung Galaxy Ring. But the integration with Google Fit and Apple Health might make it the better option for those who own something other than a Samsung Galaxy smartphone. However, it’s worth noting that Lee did experience issues syncing and connecting the ring to the app on multiple occasions, which can be frustrating.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UB9UfAgqm9GXv9QrCd9gvV" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-review-20.jpg" alt="The RingConn Smart Ring in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UB9UfAgqm9GXv9QrCd9gvV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, you’re ready to take the leap and dive into the smart ring space. Whether you’re using it on its own or complementing a smartwatch or fitness tracker you already wear, both the Samsung Galaxy Ring vs. RingConn Smart Ring are good options to consider.</p><p>Naturally, if you own a Samsung Galaxy phone, it’s a no-brainer to buy the Samsung Galaxy Ring. You’ll enjoy a truly holistic experience with everything tracked in the Samsung Health app. If you also own a compatible Samsung Galaxy Watch, you’ll really appreciate adding this model to the ecosystem to get the most accurate results possible.</p><p>If you own another branded Android phone or even an iPhone, I’d recommend going with the RingConn Smart Ring instead. Like Apple, Samsung has a fairly closed ecosystem with its products. While you can technically use the Samsung Galaxy Ring with another branded Android device, it doesn’t make much sense when you’re paying for some features you won’t be able to leverage.</p><p>With that said, if you partake in a lot of water-based activities or just spend a lot of time outdoors, you might appreciate the extra durability the Samsung Galaxy Ring affords. The 10ATM rating is higher than you’ll find in most premium smartwatches, much less smart rings. Plus, the focus on additional sleep data could be crucial to those who are focused on improving sleep, especially if you suffer from sleep apnea or want to measure your snoring.</p><p>But the RingConn Smart Ring offers enticing features, too, like the 500mAh charging case that can keep the Ring powered up for weeks. Pop it in your purse and recharge while having brunch or commuting home from work. The health-sharing option will be appreciated by those who want to keep an eye on loved ones as well.</p><p>A small but potentially important detail: those on either extreme side of sizing might find that Samsung’s smallest size fits better or conversely, Ringconn’s largest size accommodates them. This could be a deciding factor for you once you get the respective sizing kits and try them on.</p><p>Final decision? If you have a Samsung Galaxy phone and/or Galaxy watch, go with the Samsung Galaxy Ring. If you own any other Android phone or an iPhone, the RingConn Smart Ring is a better option.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google has improved deepfake handling and expanded the "About this image" feature to Circle to Search and Google Lens.</li><li>Users can see when an image was first indexed, its origin, and its spread across various platforms.</li><li>Google has also improved its algorithm to reduce deepfake visibility and made it easier for users to remove deepfakes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google just dropped a few handy image search updates today, including improvements to how Google Search deals with deepfakes and the rollout of the "About this image" feature to Circle to Search and Google Lens.</p><p>Now, users can use the "About this image" tool, previously only on Google Search, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> on Android or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens</a> on both Android and iOS. Launched about a year ago, this feature gives users more context about images.</p><p>With "About this image," users can find out when an image or similar content was first indexed by Google, learn about its possible origin, and see how it has spread across news outlets, social media, and other websites, Google said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-about-this-image-update-july-2024/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>Users can access the "About this image" tool within Circle to Search on select Android devices, including Samsung and Pixel phones, foldables, and tablets. It offers detailed image context from news, fact-checking sources, metadata, and digital watermarks.</p><p>The image search tool is available in forty languages, including French, German, Hindi, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:175.48%;"><img id="tKRCSEMEEiQ4UoK4mrKhDZ" name="Circle-to-search-about-this-image.png" alt="About this image feature in Google Search's Circle to Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tKRCSEMEEiQ4UoK4mrKhDZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="420" height="737" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-explicit-deep-fake-content-update/" target="_blank">introduced</a> a two-pronged approach to tackle deepfakes. First, the company has improved its ranking algorithm to reduce the visibility of deepfakes in search results. Second, Google has made it easier for users to remove deepfakes from its platform.</p><p>Google claims that the updated ranking system will significantly reduce the visibility of fake content in search results. When users search for individuals using terms that could be manipulated by deepfakes, Google Search will focus on displaying high-quality, accurate content such as relevant news articles.</p><p>The tech giant also says it&apos;s gotten better at telling the difference between real, consensual explicit content, like actor nude scenes, and fake stuff like deepfakes. Google admits it&apos;s a tough job but is constantly working on making sure real content shows up more and fake content gets pushed down.</p><p>Google has made it easier to remove deepfakes from search results. When someone successfully requests the removal of explicit, non-consensual fake content featuring them, Google&apos;s systems will try to filter out all explicit results for similar searches about that person.</p><p>Moreover, if someone gets an image removed from Google Search, Google will also search for and delete any duplicates of that image in its index.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung and uBreakiFix by Asurion deliver an update following its 2023 expansion of repair centers for Galaxy customers.</li><li>The stores have achieved a 5.5% higher average NPU score for customer experience while also streamlining their repair services for faster returns.</li><li>Samsung's flagship repair centers can now fix the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has continued to honor its commitment to device repair services through uBreakiFix and today (July 31) both share an important update.</p><p>In a press release, Samsung states that one year after its flagship repair store service expansion, it is now delivering the network&apos;s "highest Net Promoter Scores." The NPU is the industry&apos;s standard representation of customer experience, and Samsung has achieved a 5.5% higher score across the broader network. More importantly, Samsung&apos;s flagship stores can now repair the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Fold 6</a>.</p><p>The company states that each of the stores acts as a "testing ground" for research and innovation regarding device repair. Dave Barbuto, CEO of uBreakiFix by Asurion  states, "at our Samsung flagship stores, it&apos;s often the little things that make the biggest difference."</p><p>One of those differences includes the flagship store&apos;s technicians discovering an unnecessary part of their device repair. According to Samsung, its workers found a redundancy in camera calibration testing. This was an object of quality control that Samsung already conducts during the manufacturing process.</p><p>With it gone, the flagship store technicians have quickened their workflow when repairing devices.</p><p>Additionally, Samsung states its repair centers stock "23% more SKUs than average stores." For consumers, this means that Samsung&apos;s official repair stores should have the parts you need for your device if it&apos;s received damage. The Korean brand reiterates that consumers can find its flagship stores in Los Angeles, Chicago, Newark, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix.</p><p>Outside of those areas, you can find solace in hundreds of uBreakiFix stores authorized for Galaxy device repair.</p>

<p>Samsung and uBreakiFix&apos;s partnership has been ongoing for the past six years, and last summer the companies announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-ubreakifix-expand-repair-options">a 50-store expansion</a>. It was stated that the stores would be granted access to "specialized" equipment capable of handling a customer&apos;s device woes. More importantly, a primary focus was to ensure customers could experience same-day repairs.</p><p>However, as Samsung mentioned today (July 31), its stores will still offer a "loaner" Galaxy device just to ensure you remain connected throughout the repair process.</p><p>The tech giant&apos;s collaboration with uBreakiFixit offers a "We Come to You" service option. Available technicians can go and meet customers wherever they are to begin servicing their damaged devices. Mark Williams, Samsung’s VP of customer care said this ability highlights Samsung&apos;s commitment to a user&apos;s repair services.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I&apos;ve never been a person who enjoys wearing a watch. Even though I&apos;ve used dozens of smartwatches over the years, I seldom wear one all day long. That&apos;s where a smart ring comes in for me. As someone who already wears a wedding band every day and finds it comfortable, I had hoped a smart ring would feel like the ideal form factor when compared to cumbersome fitness straps or bulky watches.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> is the latest smart ring to try and woo customers over with the concept, which started back in 2015 with the release of the first-generation Oura Ring. But if you were hoping to replace your smartwatch with the Galaxy Ring, you&apos;re going to need to temper your expectations.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring is designed for 24/7 health tracking and little else. It&apos;ll automatically track walking, running, and even sleeping, but lax software integration means manual workout tracking is nearly nonexistent and data accuracy is questionable, at best. It lacks AFib detection, something the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> recently added. Even the "find my ring" feature only really works on Samsung Galaxy phones, a hugely missed opportunity for Samsung to one-up the competition.</p><p>But not all is lost. While Samsung has a lot of improvements to make, all of them are software-related. The hardware is gorgeous, fits nicely, and is supremely comfortable to wear. This will be a solid product once Samsung irons out the issues — especially since there&apos;s no monthly subscription. Hopefully, for Samsung, things will get better before our final review in a few weeks.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-review-2">About this review</h2>
<p>I&apos;ve been using the Galaxy Ring for seven straight days as of the publishing of this review. My gold size 10 Galaxy Ring has been paired with a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra running One UI 6.1.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring is available for $399 and comes in three classic ring colors: silver, gold, and black. As of this review, the Samsung Galaxy Ring is on backorder but Samsung has allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-reportedly-boosts-galaxy-ring-production-to-match-soaring-demand">ramped up production substantially</a> to meet demand. The Galaxy Ring currently takes a few weeks to ship out once ordered.</p><p>To purchase a Galaxy Ring, you&apos;ll first need to spend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Receive-Towards-Purchase/dp/B0D3JDTZZQ">$10 on a sizing kit</a>. That comes with a $10 credit towards the purchase of a Galaxy Ring, so the sizing kit is effectively free once you buy a Ring. Samsung makes Galaxy Rings in standard ring sizes 5–13.</p><p>Unlike its biggest competitor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a>, the Galaxy Ring doesn&apos;t require a monthly subscription to access your data. All that is handled through the Samsung Health app, which works with any Android phone. Samsung users with a Galaxy phone that sports Galaxy AI built-in, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, will get extra insights for their data powered by Galaxy AI.</p>

<p>If I could get true feature parity, I&apos;d swap out a smartwatch for a smart ring nearly any day of the week. Except for some kinds of workouts, a smart ring is a significantly more comfortable device to wear 24/7, and the Galaxy Ring is no exception.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s hardware design is largely excellent, stuffing a battery and tons of tech into a svelte ~2.6mm thick ring. This is notably thicker than some standard rings — like my gold wedding band — but it&apos;s not so thick as to feel <em>more</em> noticeable on my finger than a standard ring.</p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s concave design helps to make the ring look thinner than it actually is, and the titanium construction is both impressively light and quite durable. Over the past week, though, I&apos;ve already scuffed up the edge in two places, although this isn&apos;t noticeable unless you look very closely.</p><p>Thankfully, that concave design seems to work well to keep the center of the Ring from getting as scratched as the edges.</p><p>On the underside, you&apos;ll find an orientation indicator letting you know how to wear the ring. This line should always line up with the middle of the underside of your finger as it ensures the Ring&apos;s sensors are in the most optimal place. I didn&apos;t find that the Ring would rotate much throughout the day but I still checked the indicator&apos;s location regularly as a habit.</p>

<p>The Ring fit nicely on the middle finger of my right hand where I found that particular finger shape to be better for wearing a ring than my index finger. It&apos;s more comfortable, overall, but it also doesn&apos;t get in the way like it would when I tried to wear it on my index finger.</p><p>Samsung recommends wearing it either on the index or middle fingers if you want to use the gesture feature, so this is right in line with expectations. Gestures are something unique to the Galaxy Ring and an advantage Samsung has over competitors, even if they are currently a bit limited in scope.</p>

<p>I haven&apos;t been able to test out the gestures during this initial review phase because my Galaxy S24 Ultra doesn&apos;t have One UI 6.1.1 yet, but Android Central&apos;s Managing Editor Derrek Lee and I already tested them out at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Watch hands-on</a> event and they worked well there.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that there are only two main gestures right now: take a photo, and stop an alarm on your phone. To perform either of these actions, you&apos;ll double-tap your ring-wearing finger and thumb together in the air as if you&apos;re pinching something twice.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy Ring's two most unique features are gesture support and the ability to remotely find a lost ring, but both only work with certain Samsung Galaxy phones.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Samsung also supports a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-find-my-mobile-locate-your-lost-samsung-galaxy-phone">Find my device</a>" feature that works identically to other Samsung Galaxy devices. Open the Galaxy Wearables app, then tap <em>find</em> on the main menu. The app will give you a rough location of where the Ring is — or where it was last detected if it&apos;s not in your general vicinity — including a handy GPS map using Bluetooth for local location.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring doesn&apos;t vibrate or make noise, which means that it doesn&apos;t support giving you notifications. That also means that it&apos;s a little difficult to find, especially if it fell between the couch cushions or rolled under something like a fridge or stove.</p><p>The app lets you rapidly blink the lights on the Galaxy Ring&apos;s sensors but this is, largely, only useful at night or in a dark room. The lights simply aren&apos;t bright enough to be seen during the day or in any kind of bright lighting.</p>

<p>The other issue is that the "find my device" functionality <strong>only </strong>works on Samsung Galaxy phones. The Samsung Find app is exclusive to the Galaxy Store. Sideloading the APK doesn&apos;t work either as it requires hooks found in Samsung&apos;s One UI to work.</p><p>Samsung could have made it work with Google&apos;s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My Device</a> upgrade — many other Samsung devices do — but it woke up and chose violence. The best you&apos;ll be able to do with a non-Samsung phone is blink the Ring&apos;s lights which, as I pointed out, isn&apos;t all that useful.</p><p>Still, other smart rings don&apos;t have a "find my" feature at all, so any way to find your lost Ring is an advantage for Samsung, even with its limitations.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons to choose a smart ring over a smartwatch is battery life. Most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> need to be charged daily, while some fitness-focused options like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965 </a>can last 1-3 weeks depending on how often you use GPS tracking.</p><p>My Galaxy Ring lasted 6 full days on the first charge, lining up nicely with Samsung&apos;s estimate of 7-day battery life. At the end of the 6th day, it had 10% battery left — plenty to still perform sleep tracking that night — with me charging it on the 7th day.</p><p>Remaining battery percentage can be tracked both on the Galaxy Wearables app and with the Ring itself. Just take off the ring and look at the indicator LEDs inside for a few seconds. They&apos;ll flash green indicating the battery percentage left in 25% increments. Four flashes mean between 75%-100% battery is left, three flashes for 50%-75%, etc.</p>

<p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best earbuds</a>, you&apos;ll charge your Galaxy Ring using the included charging case. This case has its own battery with enough capacity for several full Ring charges. It also charges via USB-C, so it&apos;s convenient to quickly charge and take on the go with you if you need it.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy Ring has true week-long battery life, and the included charging case works like a wireless earbuds case for easy travel.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The case itself it gorgeous, with a transparent, flashy design including a ring of LEDs that illuminate when opening the hinge. This ring is used to display the case&apos;s remaining battery life, and tapping the button can also initiate pairing.</p><p>Like many Samsung devices these days, though, charging the Galaxy Ring is abysmally slow. A 30-minute charge resulted in a measly 50% Ring charge, while it took a full hour to top-up the tiny ~20mAh battery. No doubt, Samsung makes the charging so painfully slow in an effort to prolong battery longevity but at least you only need to charge it once per week.</p>

<p>I hate wearing a watch to sleep. It&apos;s not something I do outside of the occasional smartwatch review, but I&apos;ll continue to wear my Galaxy Ring to sleep because it&apos;s <em>so darn comfortable</em>. Rings are a lot more comfortable for me overall so this comes as no surprise as a person who doesn&apos;t even wear a watch most of the day, let alone at night.</p><p>If you&apos;ve worn a Galaxy Watch to sleep before, expect the same kind of metrics from a Galaxy Ring. That, in and of itself, is a triumph. A smaller, more comfortable device that can get the same kinds of readings for sleep data as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> is truly a fantastic proposition.</p><p>The problem is that Samsung&apos;s sleep data isn&apos;t considered the best in the industry by any means, and bands like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whoop-40-review">Whoop 4.0</a> or smaller smartwatches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> present far more accurate data.</p>

<p>Of course, much of this is going to come down to alignment and fit. Smartwatches need to be worn fairly tightly in order to get an accurate reading. Move around too much at night with a loose wristband and you might as well just delete the tracking data. Likewise, a Ring that spins or wobbles a lot on your finger won&apos;t do you much good.</p><p>For this reason, I started wearing the Ring on my index finger after the first few nights, but it didn&apos;t seem to affect overall accuracy much.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Sleep tracking was largely inaccurate compared to the Pixel Watch 2 which is the gold standard in Android smartwatch sleep tracking.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Samsung Health app is chock full of great little details and well-presented information, from the prominent sleep score to the individual metrics and easy-to-read graph that break your sleep down into awake, light, REM, and deep sleep patterns.</p><p>Below the sleep score is the breakdown of what metrics fueled the score, including sleep time, physical recovery, restfulness, mental recovery, and sleep cycles. I&apos;m a very light sleeper by nature, and the Ring picked that up handily.</p><p>But while I initially felt good about the overall sleep score, diving into the data made me feel less confident in it. I often noticed blips in the graph where no data was collected at all. Some of this is down to fit, but there&apos;s no way to control my movements while sleeping, which means data accuracy will vary from person to person.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.15%;"><img id="6qgZewbeA5RuAurtuAHkJT" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-sleep-data.jpg" alt="Looking at all the sleep data gathered from a Samsung Galaxy Ring in the Samsung Health app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6qgZewbeA5RuAurtuAHkJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1109" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other data points like blood oxygen and skin temperature while sleeping should also be taken with a grain of salt. Skin temperature readings from a finger will be different from a wrist or even a torso band because of their location — some people like heavy, heat-trapping blankets, while others may put their hands under a pillow, both of which could produce inaccurate readings.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung provides lots of sleep tracking data but I'm not sure I trust its accuracy.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Daily energy score is calculated by combining all the available metrics, but my number was never quite accurate because the Ring never successfully detected any of my workouts at the gym, which you&apos;ll read about below. If I was going to plan my day around that energy score number — which is the entire purpose of it — it&apos;s likely I&apos;d have a less active day than I should.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6YWib-kr4">One YouTuber</a> showed how the Galaxy Ring lines up with other bands and watches, putting it in line with the rest of the Galaxy Watch line and right in the middle of most other sleep and fitness-tracking wearables. In short, it&apos;s not bad, but it&apos;s not great, either.</p>

<p>My biggest disappointment with the Galaxy Ring revolves around fitness tracking. I never expected this to replace a smartwatch because of the lack of a screen — I primarily wear a smartwatch while working out to monitor my heart rate — but Samsung&apos;s software is seriously lacking some necessary fitness tracking requirements and it makes it nearly useless at a gym.</p><p>While going on a neighborhood walk or a hike, heart rate tracking seemed to be generally good and accurate compared to my Pixel Watch 2. I was pleasantly surprised at how effortless and transparent tracking was, but this is where my positive impressions end.</p><p>First off, if you&apos;re not a runner or don&apos;t plan to use the Ring to track a walk or a hike, don&apos;t bother getting one. Automatic workouts are only supported for walking or running, and even then, I found that automatic tracking only seemed to work when I walked or ran outside. Even then, shorter 400m runs at the gym — including outdoor runs — were <em>never </em>automatically detected in my week-long testing.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is the polling rate. Heart rate data is only recorded every ten minutes — to save battery — and this doesn&apos;t seem to be often enough to detect a workout successfully. Samsung uses other sensors inside to help with detection but they didn&apos;t seem to do much good for me.</p><p>I went to the gym several times — hour-long workouts at a CrossFit-style gym — but all I saw from the Ring was a blip or two on the heart rate graph showing an elevated number. That was during the best of times. At the worst of times, the Ring didn&apos;t grab any heart rate data during my workouts at all.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>All in all, I'm not inclined to recommend this Ring as a fitness-tracking tool.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>When I asked Samsung about this, I was told that starting a manual workout from the Samsung Health app should solve my problems. Unfortunately, this didn&apos;t work. Any manual workout started from the Samsung Health app never recorded any Ring data. All I got was a generic calorie burn value relative to the workout I chose and the length of the workout.</p><p>In other words, I might as well have not even bothered bringing the Galaxy Ring to the gym.</p><p>Other smart rings like the Oura Ring Gen 3 do automatic workout detection far better and will regularly detect a workout, then allow you to select its type <strong>after</strong> the workout was completed.</p><p>All in all, I&apos;m not inclined to recommend this Ring as a serious fitness-tracking tool.</p>

<p>Despite being nearly three-years-old, the Oura Ring Gen 3 feels like a better overall buy for folks who are more serious about fitness tracking with a smart ring. Oura&apos;s software does a better job of automatically detecting workouts and gives you far more options for categorization and tracking than Samsung. The big downside is that you&apos;ll need a $6/month subscription to access that data.</p><p>But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> is probably the best overall buy. It&apos;s $50 less than the Galaxy Ring and, unlike Oura, has no subscription cost. Our Wearables reviewer Michael Hicks found the sleep tracking data to be quite accurate — unlike my experience with the Galaxy Ring. It even has AFib detection, something that&apos;s vitally important in a 24/7 wearable. The downside is that active fitness tracking isn&apos;t any better than the Galaxy Ring.</p><p>The best budget pick is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-smart-ring-review">RingConn Smart Ring</a>, which weighs in at $279 and features a unique squircle design. Activity and fitness tracking also isn&apos;t great with this ring, but 24/7 health metrics and sleep tracking mean you&apos;ll get most of the data you want for $120 less than Samsung&apos;s offering.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a nice-looking ring that does more than look pretty.</li><li>You want a smart ring without the expensive subscription.</li><li>Casual 24/7 health tracking is more important to you than focused fitness or sleep tracking.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a serious fitness-tracking device.</li><li>Your workouts involve more than just walking or running.</li><li>You need a wearable with notification support (audible or vibration).</li></ul>
<p>Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Ring is a fantastic first-generation effort that eclipses some other smart rings by providing lots of data and features without a monthly subscription requirement. The hardware is sleek, and it&apos;s comfortable to wear all-day, which is especially important for sleep tracking and automatic exercise detection.</p><p>But Samsung&apos;s software feels early by nearly every measure. Automatic workout tracking is limited in scope to just walking or running and, even then, only works well when doing these activities for long periods of time or outdoors. Sleep tracking is comfortable but not nearly as accurate as a good smartwatch. Some data is even restricted to users who pair the ring with a Galaxy phone that has Galaxy AI built-in.</p><p>The hardware is stellar but I think it&apos;s going to take a few months (or so) for the software to feel like it&apos;s truly ready for primetime. The amount of data you get is superb, but the quality of that data seems a bit questionable at this point in my review process. Early adopters will likely be thrilled with the technology packed in the ring, but anyone serious about quality fitness or sleep tracking should look elsewhere.</p><p>Smart rings are the ideal form factor, but Samsung&apos;s overall execution leaves a bit to be desired. Even as a 24/7 health tracker, other rings do it better because the Galaxy Ring is missing features like AFib detection. There&apos;s simply no way I&apos;d be happy if I spent $400 on this device and, for that reason, I can&apos;t recommend it to most people today.</p>

<p>The green line of death is an immortal enemy of modern smartphones. We&apos;ve seen this issue resurface time and time again, for years upon years now. I personally saw many a OnePlus and Xiaomi phone succumb to this ailment as early as 2018. My close personal friend lost his precious OnePlus 7 Pro to the issue back in the day.</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems like the latest phones are not immune to the green line of death. I interviewed two phone owners in the past week, both of whom faced this issue in front of my very eyes. The first user, a friend of mine called Darryl, had a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra in mint condition which fell prey to the green line of death. Meanwhile, the second victim named Chris had bought a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a> less than 10 months ago when it too faced the same glitch.</p><p>I found their stories intriguing because I had thought that such issues were a thing of the past. But a quick search on community forums like Reddit or X with the keywords "green line" seems to say otherwise. These are not isolated incidents and this problem is far more widespread than I had thought.</p>

<p>Darryl had purchased his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review">Galaxy S22 Ultra</a> from Dubai about three years back. He is extremely fond of his tech and gear, so he went out of his way to keep it as fresh as possible. Bear in mind that he&apos;s not a power user either.</p><p>One fine day the poor guy woke up to find his dear smartphone glitching out of nowhere. According to him, he did not update the device or install anything new on it. It was an ordinary day and he wasn&apos;t doing anything unusual on his S22 Ultra. All he did was pick it up to check the time somewhere in the middle of the day. And lo and behold, the green horseman of death had arrived.</p><p>Since his warranty was already up, Darryl ended up paying out of pocket to get his display replaced by Samsung. Unlike him, Chris was a little luckier.</p><p>Unable to resist a fantastic deal offered by his Canadian carrier, Chris bought the irresistibly cool Motorola Razr Plus 2023 roughly 10 months ago. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable</a> was working just fine until a couple of weeks ago, when a green line appeared out of nowhere on the internal display. It went away when he restarted the phone immediately, but soon came back and started spazzing out, going from green to black and blue, and then green again randomly.</p><p>Since Chris was still covered by Motorola&apos;s warranty, he was able to replace his Razr+ 2023 free of charge in no time at all. Motorola did not tell him much about what was wrong, but at least the brand was quick to replace his faulty device. Users like Darryl and countless others have not been this fortunate.</p>

<p>Up until very recently, Samsung had also kept mum on its Galaxy phones facing the green line of death. Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/some-galaxy-phone-screens-are-showing-a-nasty-green-line-after-an-update">Galaxy phone screens started showing a nasty green line</a> after the April 2024 update, affecting the Galaxy S22, S21, and Note 20 series. When numerous reports of similar incidences started piling up, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-offering-free-screen-replacements-for-affected-galaxy-devices">Samsung India announced that it would offer free one-time screen replacement</a> for Galaxy display defects, as long as the phone hadn&apos;t been bought over three years ago.</p><p>My issue with this is multifaceted. Not only is this offer limited to Samsung India, but it also does nothing for other Galaxy owners who have lost devices to the green line going back to the Galaxy S9 era. What&apos;s their consolation? Who will compensate those users for the flaw that was not their fault and yet they still had to pay to fix?</p><p>The journalist in me had a strong desire to uncover the secrets of the green line. What is it, what causes it, and why? To answer all my questions, I reached out to several smartphone and display manufacturers. Since reports of green lines include phone displays made by Samsung, LG, and BOE, I tried to reach out to all of them. BOE was unreachable, whereas Samsung and LG gave no response. The same goes for Motorola, who was also unresponsive.</p>

<p>In my quest to understand what causes green lines, I also reached out to industry experts, but no one responded to my queries. Thus, I turned to my smart colleagues Jerry Hildenbrand and Harish Jonnalagadda who are fluent in nerd speak.</p><p>According to their extensive knowledge, there are various reasons why your display could start having green lines and go kaput. It&apos;s a hardware flaw, but this flaw can sometimes remain dominant until a software change or flaw triggers it. This would explain why some displays see the green line of death appear after software updates while others see no apparent cause for it.</p><p>Green lines could be damaged pixels, but in most cases, they are there because the display driver isn&apos;t sending a signal to those selected pixels. This can happen when the same model of phone has slightly different revisions of the components that power and drive the display, and the software may have inconsistencies on certain revisions. That&apos;s why an update will often lead to a bunch of people seeing this green line issue.</p><p>And it&apos;s not just the display or smartphone software at fault alone. Usually, it&apos;s the flex cable at fault, but it could also be the substrate itself degrading over time because of overheating, or the controller. Every brand uses at least two vendors to source each part, so it becomes very hard to pin down what&apos;s causing it.</p><p>Phone brands have been silent for far too long and refuse to give us conclusive answers about this mystery. So what&apos;s the solution to all of this? Since this is real life, the answer is just not that simple. We need to hold companies accountable, push them to use better quality parts, and ask for better quality control measures in smartphone manufacturing plants.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t matter whether your phone&apos;s display is made by Samsung, BOE, or LG. What matters is that they recompense people like Darryl who are fond of their possessions and take care of them, and yet are still forced to pay for repairs that they are not liable for. What matters is that we aren&apos;t sold faulty devices unknowingly, paying full price for phones that might stop being functional at an unknown point after purchase, quite possibly when your warranty is no longer valid.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Phone 2a Plus looks very similar to the Phone 2a, including the transparent back and Glyph Light system.</li><li>It features the world's first MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G processor, with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage.</li><li>The phone sports a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate, 1300 nits peak brightness, and faster 50W charging.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing is on a roll with back-to-back launches, like the Phone 2a and CMF Phone 1. Now, it&apos;s adding the Nothing Phone 2a Plus to its growing lineup.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a> stands out for its great value, offering both affordability and a unique look. Its Glyph Light system and customizable software give it a special edge. With strong photography features, solid performance, and plenty of personalization options, it&apos;s easily among our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">top picks in the budget Android phone</a> segment.</p><p>The hype around Nothing&apos;s most recent mid-range smartphone might have set expectations for something groundbreaking. However, the Plus model looks a lot like the Phone 2a. It features the same transparent back, showing off the wireless charging components, and the signature Glyph Light system that defines the series.</p><p>What sets the Phone 2a Plus apart is its exclusive MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G processor, making it the first phone in the world to use this chipset. It also comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p><p>MediaTek&apos;s latest chipset is built for entertainment, especially for gamers. With advanced TSMC 4nm Gen 2 technology, it features 8 cores running up to 3.0GHz, making the CPU almost 10% faster than the Phone 2a. This means smoother multitasking, faster app switching, and quicker content loading.</p><p>Apart from the new specs, the Phone 2a Plus looks almost identical to the Phone 2a. There aren&apos;t any obvious visual differences between the two based on official renders from Nothing.</p>

<p>The new phone features a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 1300 nits. It has the same 5,000mAh battery as the regular model but charges faster at 50W compared to the standard model&apos;s 45W. According to Nothing, it can reach a full day&apos;s power in under 20 minutes, which is nearly 10% faster than the Phone 2a.</p><p>The Phone 2a Plus comes with a 50MP dual-lens camera (main and ultrawide) in the center of a circular panel, three Glyph lights, and a wavy pattern on the bottom half. These features are also present in the standard model.</p><p>On the front, the Phone 2a Plus has a 50MP selfie camera, an upgrade from the Phone 2a&apos;s 32MP front camera.</p><p>The device comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and Nothing OS 2.6, with promises of three years of major Android updates and four years of security updates.</p><p>The color options are metallic grey and an updated black. While it&apos;s a good-looking phone, it doesn&apos;t stand out much in appearance. You might easily mistake the Phone 2a Plus for the Phone 2a when you see them out and about.</p><p>The Phone 2a Plus officially hits the market on August 3 in London for £399. The first place you can grab it is at Nothing&apos;s Store Soho, making it the initial launch spot worldwide.</p><p>In the US, the Phone 2a Plus will be available in grey for $399. Users can get it through the US Beta Program starting August 7. More details on market availability and pricing will be announced in September.</p>

<ul><li>Another round of Pixel Watch 3 leaks has seemingly spoiled all that Google and Fitbit have planned for features.</li><li>The Pixel Watch 3 may feature "Advanced Running Metrics," a "Morning Brief" courtesy of Fitbit, and a "Battery Saver" mode for 36 hours between charges.</li><li>Yesterday (July 29), the Pixel Watch 3 had its assortment of band options and colors leaked.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Even more information about Google&apos;s Pixel Watch 3 has come to light and this time it involves some of the latest features.</p><p>Those over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-watch-3-has-2000nit-peak-brightness-20-faster-charging-more.html">Android Headlines</a> received an alleged batch of Pixel Watch 3 promo material, which may have ruined everything Google has planned. The publication&apos;s source provided a comparison image between the Pixel Watch 3 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>. The photo suggests the upcoming device boasts a 20% faster charging time for the 41mm variant only.</p><p>It will reportedly feature an Actua display with "up to" 2,000nits of peak brightness over the 1,000nits AMOLED display of the 2023 iteration. Google is also seemingly taking its battery further with a "Battery Saver" mode, which supposedly extends the power to roughly 36 hours before a charge.</p><p>The leaks continue by stating the device will sport 24 hours of battery with AOD (always-on display) enabled. That was one of the drawbacks of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> and Pixel Watch 2 as users needed to charge it (at least) once per day.</p><p>Moreover, the image suggests the Pixel Watch 3 will feature "Advanced Running Metrics." The material shown doesn&apos;t explain this particular feature, however, there was a "Morning Brief" displayed. The leaked photo states Fitbit will "deliver a summary of your most important health and fitness metrics." The feature will also encourage users to push themselves the next day or to cut back and rest.</p><p>"Cardio load" is supposedly designed to monitor how hard your heart is working during exercises to notify you if you&apos;re overworking it or hitting your stride.</p>

<p>What&apos;s more, the publication suggests that the Pixel Watch 3 will let users view their connected Nest Doorbell cameras from the device. The <em>idea </em>of doing this isn&apos;t new as Wear OS 3 devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-preview-update-camera-performance-wear-os-alerts">could see a snapshot</a> of their doorbell. However, Google might take it further and enable live feeds of a user&apos;s Nest Cam or doorbell from the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>Lastly, the leak states Google may offer an active band alongside the appropriate charging cable/puck for the Pixel Watch 3 when purchased.</p><p>These leaks have surfaced quite quickly after another major leak, which ripped the cover off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-band-options-colors-leak">Pixel Watch 3&apos;s band options and colors</a>. The 41mm variant was rumored to feature its own selection of three styles: Stretch, Metal Mesh, Metal Slim, and Two-tone Leather in various colors. Combined, the 41mm and 45mm could see six options with several color choices.</p><p>We also have some rumored prices for the Pixel Watch 3, and those are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/forget-budget-friendly-the-pixel-watch-3-price-rumors-are-brutal">nothing short of brutal</a> (expensive). Additionally, we expect the device to be revealed during Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">event on August 13</a>, but others say the watch could launch separately later this year.</p>

Fortunately, if you&apos;re looking for a new phone AND a new wireless plan, this Mint Mobile promo might be exactly what you&apos;re looking for. Pick up the new Google Pixel 8a alongside any six-month data plan at Mint and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-8a/5777318/"><strong>you&apos;ll score a straight $100 off the phone, plus six additional months of service for 100% free</strong></a>. </p><p>In other words, this deal gives you <strong>50% off an entire year</strong><em> </em>of wireless service from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carrier</a> operating today, not to mention an extra $100 off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-students">our favorite phone for students</a>. Do the math and compare those numbers to your current phone bill: you&apos;ll see why this is such a big deal. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a> ranks as our number-one Android phone for students because it packs great cameras, useful AI software features, and flagship-level performance into an affordable sub-$500 package. Pair the purchase of the phone with any six-month data plan at Mint Mobile and you'll score an additional six months of service for free, effectively giving you 50% off one year of wireless. </p>
<p>This means you could be getting a great phone AND a full year of Mint's Unlimited plan for just $579 upfront (or $25 per month if you pay using Affirm)! That's a back-to-school deal worth celebrating. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-8a/5777318/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="306748ec-e76c-41d9-a23c-65d99fd92a73" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$499" data-dimension48="$499">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you have good T-Mobile coverage in your area; you don&apos;t mind committing to one wireless carrier for a year; you want an Android phone with AI software features and outstanding cameras.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re happy with your current wireless carrier; you want to pay your phone bill on a monthly basis; you or the student in question is using a family plan. </p><p>If you&apos;re buying for a college or high school-aged kid, the best way to handle this would probably be to make the purchase upfront and get the phone and wireless coverage handled in one fell swoop. That way you literally won&apos;t have to think about paying another phone bill for an entire year. Alternatively, you could sign up for Affirm and pay $25 per month for the phone and wireless combo. Either way, it&apos;s going to be considerably less than any phone deal from a mainstream phone company like AT&T or Verizon. </p><p>There are a lot of great things to say about the Google Pixel 8a, but that&apos;s not to say that Mint Mobile is a slouch. As noted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">our Mint review</a>, this T-Mobile-owned carrier has a lot to offer with its "buy in bulk" plan system. To sign up for any of its four data plans, you need to pay for your wireless service in 3, 6, or 12-month increments of time, with discounts being added the more you buy upfront. This simple structure means you can easily change your plan or switch carriers when your time allotment is up without any hassle or pesky contracts to worry about. </p><p>The plan options range from 5GB to Unlimited and all plans come with unlimited talk and text, free calls to Mexico and Canada, and a mobile hotspot, plus you&apos;re getting access to the world&apos;s largest 5G network through T-Mobile. If you&apos;re unsure, you can always explore the service through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/free-trial/"><strong>Mint Mobile&apos;s 7-day free trial</strong></a>, but once you&apos;re ready to commit, this Pixel 8a deal presents an awesome opportunity for any student looking for cheap wireless. </p>

<hr>
<p>Users have continuously reported problems regarding the Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s battery and it seems Samsung is on the case.</p><p>Users on Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EC%9B%A8%EC%96%B4%EB%9F%AC%EB%B8%94-%EC%9B%8C%EC%B9%98-%EB%B2%84%EC%A6%88/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-%EC%9B%8C%EC%B9%987-%EB%B0%B0%ED%84%B0%EB%A6%AC-%EB%AC%B8%EC%A0%9C/m-p/28357666#M268410">community forum</a> (Korean) started discussing how severe the Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s battery drain issues are (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsungs-working-on-a-fix-for-galaxy-watch-7s-battery-problem/">SamMobile</a>). The original poster stated that after running through the standard setup procedures, their Watch 7&apos;s battery drained at an estimated 10% rate per hour. The user added that they&apos;ve turned on the device&apos;s battery-saving function but to no avail.</p><p>Moreover, the post states that after fully charging it and wearing it to bed, the device would only have 30% to 40% of the battery left.</p><p>These issues were echoed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1eainb0/watch_7_battery_life/">users on Reddit</a> who reported similar problems. The user stated their device was left with an 8% charge nearly 12 hours after a full charge despite only utilizing its health features.  Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1eainb0/comment/lem611d/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">chimed in</a>, saying they&apos;re losing around 20% of battery when sleeping and are forced to charge the Watch 7 "2 to 3 times a day."</p><p>The user on the forum contacted Samsung support in South Korea and was told that a software update may be necessary. This was backed up by a company development manager who confirmed that Samsung was aware of battery issues. Additionally, they said, "we have identified the cause of the battery discharge issue and have come up with a solution. We will soon distribute a SW that fixes the issue."</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear if this has started rolling out today (July 30), however, the publication spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/first-galaxy-watch-7-watch-ultra-software-update-released/">the first update</a> hitting the Galaxy Watch 7 and 7 Ultra. Version L310XXU1AXG2 (173.5MB) arrives for Watch 7 owners while version L705FXXU1AXFB (330MB) hits the Ultra. Samsung&apos;s official changelog doesn&apos;t specifically mention the battery drain problem.</p><p>Regardless, it&apos;s most likely worth updating considering its "stability improvements" and performance enhancements.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 7 series debuted on July 10 during Unpacked and the duo seem to make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-excited-about-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-health-feature">the idea of upgrading a breeze</a>. Sleep is a critical part of our lives and the Watch 7 takes it a step further by nudging you if it detects <em>signs </em>of sleep apnea. The idea is to piggyback off the data collected by your Watch 7 or 7 Ultra with your doctor to weed out these critical signs.</p><p>The watches also boast new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">BioActive sensors</a>, which take your health-tracking analytics to another level.</p>
