<ul><li>Tipster Digital Chat Station has come up with interesting information regarding the Mix Flip.</li><li>Xiaomi's long-rumored first clamshell phone could soon see the light of day.</li><li>The device will likely have a solid battery capacity alongside the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC underneath.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The rumors of Xiaomi&apos;s first clamshell foldable phone trail back to last year, when we first heard about its existence through a render, followed by an IMEI database registry. Prolific tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/u/6048569942">Digital Chat Station</a> is back again, sharing some exciting details of Xiaomi&apos;s clamshell phone tentatively named Mix Flip.</p><p>According to the tipster&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OitwqEDUc?pagetype=profilefeed">recent Weibo post</a>, Xiaomi&apos;s first vertical folding phone, popularly called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">clamshell phone</a>, is coming soon. It will be powered by the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, which appears to be a step up as other f<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">oldable phones</a> that it competes with have used Snapdragon 8 Plus series chipsets, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a>, and not the flagship SoC. However, the 2024 Razr Plus model gearing up for the release is rumored to equip a Snapdragon 8s Gen 3.</p>
<p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/u/6048569942#:~:text=Snapdragon%208Gen3%20flagship">interesting details</a> of the phone include the launch of the foldable, which is likely to happen in July, notes Tipster. If it turns out to be accurate, it will be placed right next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, which will also be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. </p><p>That, however, happens when Xiaomi chooses to launch the Mix Flip globally, unlike the Mix Fold phones, which don&apos;t launch worldwide. In terms of design, the tipster further indicates that the device will incorporate a metal middle frame paired with a glass body. The battery capacity is also said to be one of the significant aspects of the foldable to look forward to.</p><p>In other news, the Mix Flip has also been spotted in the hands of Xiaomi CEO (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-mix-flip-nbtc-certification/">91mobiles</a>). The device shown through images on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5043415945840915">Weibo</a> indicates the CEO walking around with the Mix Flip in a folded state. While the shared photo is unclear, it still hints at a foldable clamshell phone.</p>

<p>On the other hand, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/xiaomi-mix-flip-nbtc-certification/">MySmartPrice</a>, the Mix Flip phone has also been found on a Thailand-based NBTC certification site that confirms the device&apos;s model number, <strong>2405CPX3DG</strong>, right next to the device moniker, Xiaomi Mix Flip. Alongside the moniker, the certification also reveals the device&apos;s support for 5G connectivity. </p><p>Besides, early this year, the device also hit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-mix-flip-to-get-satellite-connectivity">MIIT certification</a>, indicating that the upcoming clamshell phone supports Satellite Connectivity. </p><p>As for the looks of the Mix Flip, nothing concrete about the device has come up yet aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-mix-flip-spotted-imei-database">render</a> and an alleged hands-on experience with the device. Both reveal a cover screen aided by a separate camera module featuring dual primary cameras. While the design certainly strikes differently, the cover screen will likely measure less in size than the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Razr Plus 2023 external displays.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (June 12), Samsung announced the start of its One UI 6 Watch beta program for U.S. users.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Tips/1st-Beta-Software-Update-Jun-12th/m-p/2917871#M6">community post</a>, Samsung states that its first One UI 6 Watch beta gives users a glimpse into what&apos;s coming up for its Galaxy watches. As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-6-watch-beta-program-galaxy-watch-6/">SamMobile</a>, consumers with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 or 6 Classic</a> should be able to enroll in the Samsung Members app. It seems as though only the Bluetooth variant can join the beta for now. LTE device support should come at a later date.</p><p>A few health-related features, backed by Galaxy AI, headline this first beta. The initial One UI 6 feature helps users "monitor energy levels." Samsung Health is picking up a new "energy score," which shows a user&apos;s physical and mental readiness based on their sleep and physical data.</p><p>Users will receive "personal insights" to advise them to rest if their score is low or push ahead with a high one.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, Samsung&apos;s sleep analysis now offers a "detailed" report. The company states its One UI 6 Watc beta will display your heart rate, respiratory rate, and how long it took to fall asleep the previous night.</p><p>The health features conclude with a new option to create a "custom workout routine." The Korean OEM states users can combine a series of different workouts and set targets for sets, reps, "and more."</p>

<p>The gesture controls on the Galaxy Watch 6 and 6 Classic are being upgraded, beginning with a double pinch. Samsung states users can pinch their index finger and thumb to answer calls, dismiss alarms, sift through notifications, control music, snap photos, and more.</p><p>Galaxy watches are also gaining the ability to determine which apps can ping your wrist without opening the Wearable app. Additionally, Galaxy Watch Modes have been upgraded to control more settings on your device based on "what you&apos;re doing or where you are."</p><p>Samsung states its watch Modes can control Do not Disturb, Always On Display, Raise Wrist to wake, Touch Screen to wake, Touch Bezel to wake, Sound mode, and Disconnection alerts.</p><p>Universal gestures are entering the One UI 6 Watch beta, giving users access to an action&apos;s appropriate controls quickly without manually changing focus. Tapping the bottom of your watch&apos;s UI will display ongoing activities like phone calls, exercise sessions, and music.</p><p>The rest of the One UI 6 Watch beta patch notes are as follows:</p>

<p>Samsung warns users that some of their Watch apps may need to be updated after installing the beta program. More information is reportedly available in the program&apos;s recruitment notice.</p><p>Interested users can enter the Samsung Members app and head to <strong>Notices > Registration for One UI Watch Beta Program </strong>to begin preparations.</p><p>Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/one-ui-5-watch-beta-available-now">last year</a>, Samsung is getting its next wearable software beta going in June ahead of its summer Unpacked. It&apos;s worth remembering that Samsung&apos;s One UI 6 Watch beta is based on Google&apos;s Wear OS 5 software. Moreover, the upcoming Galaxy Watch 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-google-reportedly-testing-wear-os-5">has been rumored</a> to feature this new OS once it launches this summer.</p>

<ul><li>Meta and LG planned to challenge the Apple Vision Pro with a new "high-performance XR headset," likely called the Meta Quest Pro 2.</li><li>An LG spokesperson said that LG has relocated most of the team from the project, essentially signaling that the headset has been canceled.</li><li>Meta and LG will continue to partner for R&D on VR headset components, meaning we'll likely still get LG-made components in upcoming Meta Quest headsets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Just as the Apple Vision Pro made its debut in February of this year, Meta and LG announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-lg-rumored-to-join-alliance-for-quest-pro-2-and-ai-projects">a strategic partnership</a> "to release the highest-performance XR headset that surpasses Apple&apos;s &apos;Vision Pro&apos; in the first quarter of next year." But it turns out that things weren&apos;t going according to plan and LG is canceling work on the aforementioned headset.</p><p>A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20240612000169?mc=em_008_00001">ET News</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/lg-meta-xr-partnership-on-ice/">Road to VR</a>) confirms that earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2-new-display-delay">rumors of a shaky partnership</a> were true. Per an LG electronics official, the company has "recently finalized the policy of relocating personnel in charge of the XR business. The relocation will be carried out for about a month in consideration of the desired departments and workplaces, as well as the demand for additional manpower from other departments."</p><p>It&apos;s said that LG moved specifically because industry growth for a premium XR headset didn&apos;t align with the company&apos;s internal projections. Apple pulled in around $630 million dollars during the product&apos;s launch but reports since then have shown that demand for the company&apos;s $3,500 headset has significantly slowed down.</p><p>One year ago, it was said that Meta scrapped its own plans for an internally-developed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2">Quest Pro 2</a>, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/156fnjx/meta_cto_heavily_implies_that_quest_pro_2_is_not/">Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth said</a> that just one prototype headset was canceled and that the company works on several prototypes at any given time. Likewise, the report from ET News notes that Meta and LG&apos;s partnership isn&apos;t dissolved and that the companies will continue to partner on R&D for XR headset components in the future.</p>

<p>This means that LG-made displays and other important components should still be used in future Meta Quest headsets. Perhaps this means the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Meta Quest 4</a> will use an LG-made OLED panel or that one of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">Meta Horizon OS-powered headsets</a> made by Asus and Lenovo might use other LG components.</p><p>Meta has neither confirmed nor denied its own plans for a Quest Pro 2 although, as said before, the company regularly tests out prototype devices that could one day become a proper consumer device. Whether one of these turns out to be called the "Quest Pro 2" or something entirely different will all depend on the circumstances.</p><p>We know that the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung XR headset</a> made in partnership with Samsung and Google plans to challenge the Apple Vision Pro by attempting to beat it at its own game. Largely, that means providing super high-resolution displays <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-meta">and millions of apps</a> available at product launch, which is currently expected for sometime in 2025.</p><p>Google also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-magic-leap-partnership">recently announced a partnership</a> with AR glasses maker Magic Leap, which is likely to use the same Android XR operating system as the Samsung XR headset. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">quietly showed off XR tech</a> at this year&apos;s Google I/O show, helping showcase what could become a mainstay in future human communication.</p>

Spatial audio uses the Immersive Video and Audio Services (IVAS) codec, part of the next-generation 3GPP standards. While we&apos;ve all heard spatial audio before, doing it over a cellular connection is an industry first.</p><p>Nokia is a big contributor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nokia.com/standardization/technology-standards/multimedia/#immersive-voice-and-audio">IVAS codec</a> standards, which are part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2023/01/how-5g-advanced-will-deliver-the-next-big-boost-to-mobile-broadband-experiences">5G Advanced</a>—the next generation of 5G that companies and researchers are hashing out to give us even more capability when it comes to using both our phones and other products like VR and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming devices</a>.</p>
<p>I&apos;ll admit, I think things like this are cool because I love seeing what smart people with huge budgets can come up with. But this is also the kind of news that needs a bit of explaining.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-spatial-audio-2">What is spatial audio?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="oQUstZRZbe8oumEW8jFVU7" name="DropTHX-Panda-headphones.jpg" alt="Drop THX headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oQUstZRZbe8oumEW8jFVU7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;ve probably heard or read about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-android-users-need-know-about-spatial-audio">spatial audio</a>. You&apos;ve also experienced it even if you didn&apos;t know it at the time.</p><p>The easy way to describe spatial audio is by giving an example—you&apos;ve almost certainly listened to music through a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">pair of headphones</a> and have noticed different sounds coming from each ear. That&apos;s an example of spatial audio at work.</p>
<p>Spatial audio is multidirectional sound that lets your brain think sound is coming from a certain direction, and we see it in movies or games. It&apos;s well supported by Apple, Microsoft, and Google, so almost any device you buy can do it. Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-might-add-spatial-audio-to-chromebooks-in-a-future-chromeos-update">adding the feature to Chromebooks</a>, too. </p><p>Some communications software already uses spatial audio, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-10-google-meet-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Meet</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-microsoft-teams-chromebook">Microsoft Teams</a>. As long as you have hardware that supports it and software that can deliver it, things can sound like they are coming from the proper direction in real time.</p>
<p>Right now, the supporting "software" isn&apos;t available for use over a phone&apos;s voice connection. You might be able to experience it via apps like Meet mentioned above, but those use your phone&apos;s data connection, not the regular voice channel.</p><p>Incorporating the IVAS codec into the 3GPP (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.3gpp.org/">3rd Generation Partnership Project</a>) standards means every phone on every network can use spatial audio in both voice calls and "standard" video calls through your phone provider.</p>
<h2 id="do-we-really-need-this-why-is-this-important-2">Do we really need this? Why is this important?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BBmzDtp8uTLRDpnHrQFcPi" name="gamesir-x2-bluetooth-mobile-controller-with-phone-4.jpg" alt="Gamesir X2 Bluetooth Mobile Controller With Phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BBmzDtp8uTLRDpnHrQFcPi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Jennifer Locke / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Do we need this? No. We also don&apos;t need <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomis-first-android-phone-4k-display-could-be-way">4K displays on phones</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-dollar3000-marq-carbon-watches-make-epix-2-pro-look-affordable">expensive smartwatches</a>, or phones that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">fold in half</a>. Just like you may want to use one of these things, someone else can want to use spatial audio over a phone call.</p><p>Spatial audio in a phone call does sound like an unnecessary gimmick. Do you need to know which direction a passing car is coming from when someone is calling you, or do my coworkers need to know which shoulder my screaming parrot is sitting on? Nope. But it could be handy in conference calls where more than one person is in the room or in some other imaginary scenario that probably isn&apos;t going to happen.</p><p>But that&apos;s not why this is being worked on or why it might matter. </p>
<p>Think back to before we had 5G and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-explained">all the promises we heard</a>. 5G isn&apos;t just about your phone. 5G is about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-kills-android-things-adding-yet-another-product-its-ever-growing-graveyard">Internet of Things</a>.</p><p>I hate that phrase as much as you do, but just because it gets abused and thrown around until we&apos;re sick of hearing it doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not a real thing. Plenty of the products we use now could benefit from spatial audio over 5G, like a security camera with audio enabled. Other things could just be a little cooler with it enabled, like a gaming handheld that uses a SIM card. </p><p>With a standard in place, we wouldn&apos;t have to depend on support from the people who make the products and the software that powers them. As long as they follow accepted worldwide standards, it will work.</p>
<p>I&apos;m not going to get hyped over a spatial audio call like The Finnish Ambassador of Digitalization and New Technologies did because I don&apos;t feel a need for immersive and rich phone calls. Maybe I&apos;m old-fashioned that way.</p><p>I do look forward to seeing the next cool stuff tech companies can invent, and the more tech available for them to leverage, the better. Bring on the immersion!</p>

<ul><li>India is proposing a DMA-like law called the Digital Competition Bill, which aims to prevent companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon from dominating the market through anti-competitive practices.</li><li>The bill outlines rules for data handling, platform neutrality, and user control. Violations could result in tech giants paying hefty fines of up to 10% of their turnover.</li><li>The Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is set to hold two meetings on Thursday (June 13) and Tuesday (June 18) with different tech companies to address "serious concerns" and consider the interests of all parties involved before going ahead with the bill.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While Google and other tech companies are battling to keep up with the EU&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a>, they&apos;ll have to watch for a new bill from India that&apos;s set to hit them soon. </p><p>The act, which has yet to be put into motion, is called the Digital Competition Bill (DCB), which could restrict Google, Meta, Apple, and Amazon from following practices that would benefit them in monopolizing the market. The bill also seeks to impose heavy penalties, which could amount to billions of dollars for violations. If the DCB were to be implied, these tech companies would have to make major changes to their platforms (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/draft-digital-competition-bill-big-tech-opposes-9330370/">The Indian Express)</a>.</p><p>In May, U.S. lobby groups representing Google, Amazon, and Apple are pushing India to rethink this bill, citing that the regulations against data use and treatment of partners could raise user costs for these companies. </p><p>After receiving backlash, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is set to hold two meetings on Thursday (June 13) and Tuesday (June 18) with different tech companies to address "serious concerns" and consider the interests of all parties involved before going ahead with this bill, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/draft-digital-competition-law-urgent-meeting-this-week-amid-industry-concerns/article68277966.ece">official sources</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-bill-and-who-does-it-impact-2">What is this bill and who does it impact?</h2>
<p>India’s Ministry of Corporate Affairs released the Draft Digital Competition Bill on March 12. The bill aims to promote fair competition practices, especially for large tech companies. The focus remains on social media sites and search engines, which will be designated Systematically Significant Digital Enterprises (SSDE) based on their user base, market influence, and revenue. </p><p>The quantitative parameters for a company to be designated an SSDE are:</p>
<ul><li>If in the last 3 financial years, its turnover in India is not less than Rs 4,000 crore, or its global turnover is not less than $30 billion, or</li><li>Its gross merchandise value in India is not less than Rs 16,000 crore or</li><li>Its global market capitalization is not less than $75 billion or</li><li>These companies' core digital services should have at least 1 crore end users or 10,000 business users.</li></ul>
<p>This bill takes what&apos;s called the "ex-ante" approach, meaning it aims to prevent anti-competitive practices even before they happen, unlike the current laws that intervene after the fact. </p><p>The Indian government <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-eu-like-antitrust-law-worrying-technology-firms-2024-06-11/">says</a> these new regulations are needed as the digital market is "increasingly becoming concentrated," with a few large companies having "immense control over the market." According to the panel, this bill favors smaller digital firms and startups that rely on big tech giants, prompting an "imbalance of power."</p><p>The bill aims to stop companies from monopolizing the market, controlling prices, and excluding competition. It also addresses data collection, preventing large tech companies from using data collected on one platform to benefit another. For instance, Facebook cannot use the data collected on its platform to benefit Whatsapp/Instagram unless user consent is given.</p><p>The bill also addresses other aspects like allowing users to download third-party apps on their platforms (like installing a non-App Store app on an iPhone), and companies would have to give the users more control of their data, allowing them to freely choose default settings making it easier to transfer data to other platforms. </p><p>If this bill is passed, the new law will require companies to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-eu-like-antitrust-law-worrying-technology-firms-2024-06-11/"> pay a penalty</a> of up to 10% of a company&apos;s global turnover for violations. </p>

<p>While this bill promises several potential benefits, some stakeholders are also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/draft-digital-competition-law-urgent-meeting-this-week-amid-industry-concerns/article68277966.ece">raising concerns</a>. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www2.itif.org/2024-india-digital-competition-bill.pdf">argues</a> that the bill&apos;s benefits of an ex-ante regime will outweigh its harms, "and in particular a reduction in the dynamic competition that is often the best corrective to market failure in fast-moving digital markets."</p><p>They also argue that the bill might put a compliance burden on these tech companies, pushing them to increase the cost of their services to users. Some argue that the regulations could stifle the relationship of international companies with India, hampering economic growth. </p><p>According to Reuters, companies like Amazon and Flipkart are being <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-top-court-says-antitrust-probe-amazon-walmarts-flipkart-should-continue-2021-08-09/">examined</a> for promoting select sellers on their e-commerce platforms, hurting rivals. Many times, Google has been brought into the ring of fire and faced antitrust fines in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/india-antitrust-body-orders-probe-into-googles-billing-dispute-2024-03-15/">legal battles</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/indias-antitrust-directives-android-that-have-spooked-google-2023-01-12/">abusing</a> its position in the Android mobile operating system market, restricting users&apos; ability to remove pre-installed apps.</p><p>The law proposal and feedback received will now be reviewed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and its minister, Nirmala Sitharaman. </p>

<ul><li>YouTube has started a "Test & Compare" experiment, which lets creators upload multiple thumbnails for a video.</li><li>The platform will alternate up to three thumbnails "evenly" for viewers on YouTube as an engagement test to see what catches their eyes and boosts video engagement.</li><li>YouTube launched a "Remix" test for Shorts creators earlier this year while also expanding its AI-backed "jump ahead" test for viewers in May.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube announced a test for creators that will let them determine which thumbnail attracts the most viewers.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/279488115">Team YouTube</a>, creators on the platform will soon pick up access to the "Thumbnail Test & Compare" test feature (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/12/youtube-video-thumbnail-testing-tool/">9to5Google</a>). Partaking creators can then upload "up to three" thumbnails for a singular video. The purpose is to gauge which of those three entices viewers the most to click on your video.</p><p>The post states that the platform will "show your chosen thumbnails evenly across your video’s viewers." After the test, creators will see a "Winner" label on whichever thumbnail outperformed the others. YouTube states a winning thumbnail&apos;s performance is calculated based on "watch time share."</p><p>However, if a thumbnail "likely" outperformed the other two based on watch time, YouTube will display a "Preferred" tag. If there is no clear winning thumbnail, the platform will display the first photo a creator uploaded to their audience.</p><p>YouTube states a test could vary from a few days to a few weeks. The amount of time taken is reportedly due to a "variety of factors" like the amount of impressions a video receives and the number of thumbnails uploaded.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:599px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.17%;"><img id="tiBDqRzHXccB6xxwZct9TJ" name="youtube-creator-test-and-compare-experiment.jpg" alt="YouTube is kickstarting a "Test & Compare" experiment for creators, allowing them to upload multiple thumbnails for a video." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tiBDqRzHXccB6xxwZct9TJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="599" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The platform allows creators to go back and upload a couple of extra thumbnails to older videos if they choose, as well.</p><p>As stated on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13861714">support page</a>, the Test & Compare experiment is rolling out to a "limited set" of content creators on YouTube. Those lucky enough to get in will notice a Test & Compare button when putting the final touches on your content in YouTube Studio. Those interested in (hopefully) getting chosen should ensure that their account is eligible by hopping into <strong>YouTube Studio > Feature eligibility > Enable "Advanced Features."</strong></p><p>Earlier this year, YouTube started a test for creators making Shorts, which let them "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-remix-music-video-rollout">Remix</a>" their content using music videos. Users could grab the video&apos;s audio through the "Sound" option, "Collab" with it by featuring their content next to an artist&apos;s music video, and more.</p><p>A more user-facing experiment rolled out for wider availability earlier in May called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtubes-jump-ahead-experimental-ai-feature-is-here-in-wider-test">jump ahead</a>." The test, backed by YouTube&apos;s AI, lets users automatically skip through a video to its best parts to save you time. Speculation suggests that YouTube needs a rather large sample size of viewers clicking on a video and watching to determine what those "best parts" are.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you want one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> currently on the market at a record low price; you want a great clamshell foldable that isn&apos;t by Samsung; you want a foldable with a nice cover display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you can wait until the Motorola Razr Plus (2024) comes out later this year; you want a phone with great battery life.</p><p>As senior editor Derrek Lee described in his glowing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus (2023) review</a>, the Motorola phone "outclasses just about every flip-style phone on the market". You get two gorgeous displays (with refresh rates of up to 165Hz), surprisingly loud stereo speakers, and a stylish clamshell design that could send the best Samsung devices running for the hills. </p><p>Of course, as with many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, not everything is sunshine and rainbows with the Razr Plus (2023). The cameras are only so-so, and it&apos;s not a great device if you need loads of battery life. It&apos;s also worth noting that the phone&apos;s Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset was already a bit old in 2023, so even though it still performs very well in most situations, it may not be the best choice if you like using the newest processors on the market. </p><p>Despite those issues, the Motorola Razr Plus (2023) remains one of the best devices in its class. If you&apos;ve had your eye on the phone for a while, there&apos;s never been a better time to buy than right now. </p>

<ul><li>The first renders of the Pixel Watch 3 XL surface again, thanks to OnLeaks.</li><li>The device shows up with a white strap brand and stainless steel build.</li><li>The upcoming smartwatch will likely have a bigger display and larger body than the Pixel Watch 3.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Recently, the first renders of Google&apos;s upcoming smartwatch, Pixel Watch 3, surfaced online, indicating little to no design changes. This is probably because Google is gearing up for another new smartwatch to accompany it. Tentatively dubbed Pixel Watch 3 XL, the first possible images of the new smartwatch have surfaced online for the first time.</p><p>The leak again comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1800911312069054820">Steve Hemmerstoffer</a>, widely known as OnLeaks, who showcased the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-renders-leak">Pixel Watch 3 renders</a> early this week. The tipster has partnered with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/pixel-watch-3-xl">Android Headlines</a> to showcase the highly anticipated Pixel Watch 3 XL renders. </p>

<p>The design of the Pixel Watch 3 XL doesn&apos;t look drastically different from the Pixel Watch 3 renders, which are very familiar to the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>. </p><p>The Watch 3 XL, paired with some kind of white band, appears to carry the same seamless domed glass design sitting in a steel frame and aided by a digital crown. While it helps navigate the Wear OS interface on the smartwatch, the button on the top presumably triggers the Google Assistant, similar to the older Pixel Watch models.</p><p>The publication has also shared the expected specs of the Pixel Watch 3 XL, including a 1.45-inch display, which is slightly bigger than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, which will sport a 1.2-inch display, the same as the previous iteration.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the Watch 3 XL is likely to be thicker, with its body measuring 13.89mm in thickness. It will also measure 45mm x 45mm, indicating a bigger smartwatch overall. This could also mean Google opting for a more prominent battery capacity and likely some extra sensors to track health monitoring activities. </p><p>Overall, it is encouraging to see the Pixel Watch 3 XL in live renders rather than just hearing about it through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/googles-next-pixel-watch-will-reportedly-come-in-bigger-45mm-size">rumors</a>, which earlier indicated that it would be named Pixel Watch 3 Pro, complementing the Pixel phone lineup. However, Google&apos;s strategy appears different, as it is going old school by naming the upcoming smartwatch similar to older Pixel phones, like Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL.</p>

<hr>
<p>After introducing the feature drop for the Pixel product line, Google quickly released the June security updates for the Pixel phones and the Pixel Watch, which introduced some new changes.</p><p>The global versions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> will now receive the <strong>TWD9.240605.001.A1</strong> builds that include the latest security patch, bug fixes, performance updates, and also new features from the feature drop. While the complete changelog can be viewed on the accompanying Google Pixel Watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/279505749/google-pixel-watch-update-june-2024?hl=en&dark=1&sjid=14902075217234821058-AP">community page</a>, here are the major ones we should see in the new update rollout.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="kMRm7cMHhoycbzrZnkvYqM" name="Pixel-Watch-2-car-crash-detection.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 2 June Feature drop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kMRm7cMHhoycbzrZnkvYqM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wrist Detection for both Pixel Watch models, including the ability to detect on-body and off-body, improves, especially for users who have tattooed their wrists. Both smartwatch models have also gained the new Bicycle Fall Detection, which now has an updated fall detection algorithm to detect falls from bicycles. </p><p>Another prominent feature coming to the Pixel Watch includes the popular Car Crash Detection feature. The Pixel Watch 2 can now detect "if a user has been in a car crash and calls for help if the user is unable to." </p><p>This helpful feature is further paired up with Emergency Sharing, which will help users share their real-time location with their emergency contacts when involved in a crash. Additionally, Google provides an updated Personal Safety app, which can be downloadable via the Play Store.</p>

<p>In addition to these updates, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-and-pixel-watch-2-feature-drop">June feature drop</a> is another essential release to look forward to. Alongside the features mentioned above, the feature drop also adds support for PayPal accounts for users who make payments via Google Wallet. Besides, the Google Home app has gained a major revamp that brings in a new Tile for both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>-powered Pixel Watch models. It also includes new shortcuts for users to control their fan speeds or rotation of blinds in their homes right from their wrist.</p><p>As for the June security patch, the rollout began on Tuesday (June 11) for the Pixel Watch and Watch 2 owners globally. Needless to say, it will be a phased rollout based on the user&apos;s device and carriers.</p>

<p>A new leak may finally give us a look at the price of Samsung&apos;s upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> ahead of their official unveiling, and let&apos;s just say your wallet might need some warming up because it&apos;ll probably be pricier than their predecessors.</p><p>A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/breaking-samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-us-pricing-variants-revealed/" target="_blank">Smartprix</a> report, backed by industry leaker @OnLeaks, reveals the US pricing for the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The base model with 256GB storage is rumored to start at $1,900, which is $100 more than the previous version. The trend continues with the 512GB model at $2,020 and the 1TB variant at $2,260.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK #FutureSquad, today I have the #Samsung #GalaxyZFold6 storage variants, color options, weight and pricing (USD) to share with you!😏On behalf of @Smartprix 👉🏻 https://t.co/l4jtH9XYlk pic.twitter.com/14qD9DZbGt<a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1800829621044392253">June 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Furthermore, a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/z-flip-6-us-pricing-reveal-are-you-willing-to-shell-out-an-extra-100-for-samsungs-latest/" target="_blank">Smartprix report</a> claims that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 will start at $1,100 for the 256GB variant, while the 512GB model will cost $1,220.</p><p>The Galaxy Fold series has maintained steady pricing over the past few years, with the Fold 3, Fold 4, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Fold 5</a> all launching at $1,799. This was a nice drop from the original Galaxy Fold at $1,980 and the Galaxy Z Fold 2 at $1,999. But now, it seems like we might be heading back into higher-priced territory.</p><p>This price hike could be a tough sell for potential buyers, especially with rumors suggesting only minor upgrades from the Z Fold 5 to the Z Fold 6. The Galaxy Z Fold series is already Samsung&apos;s priciest smartphone line, and these increases make it even harder to justify for those looking for substantial improvements.</p><p>Even with the price bump, there are promising rumors about the Z Fold 6. Samsung is reportedly tackling previous issues by offering a wider display, a sleeker design, a bigger battery, and the latest processor upgrade. These improvements might make the higher price tag a bit more palatable for those on the fence.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a silver lining for those concerned about the Z Fold 6&apos;s weight. According to Smartprix, it might weigh in at 239 grams, which is 14 grams lighter than the Z Fold 5. For anyone who thought last year&apos;s foldable was a bit too hefty, this could be a welcome change.</p><p>Staying true to earlier rumors, the Z Fold 6&apos;s color options are said to include Navy, Silver Shadow, and Pink. Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-s-flip-6-colorways-leak-again">past leaks mentioned white and "Crafted Black" as possible online exclusives</a>, hinting at a more limited production run for these shades compared to the main three.</p>
