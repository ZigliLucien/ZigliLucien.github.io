                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Do you remember the rush of sitting down to play a brand-new game on a brand-new console that you got? I sure do, and it&apos;s a feeling that I&apos;ve been chasing for years. Thanks to the explosion in popularity of gaming handhelds, it&apos;s easier than ever to just sit back and fire up a game from your childhood from practically anywhere. </p><p>Devices like the Retroid Pocket 4 Pro or Logitech G Cloud aren&apos;t a new concept, by any means. What is new is seeing companies like Logitech and Razer enter the fray. And with events like Prime Day, you can save a few bucks such as getting the G Cloud for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09T9FHZLH">$40 off on Amazon</a>. </p>

<p>With Prime Day upon us, the G Cloud isn&apos;t the only gaming handheld deal to be had. The Retroid Pocket 4 Pro is powered by MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 1100 SoC which offers a bit more oomph. Although we were hoping for a steeper discount given the recent Retroid Pocket 5 announcement, you can knock $25 off of the price, as long as you apply the on-page coupon. </p><p>What if you&apos;re in the market for a dedicated gaming handheld, but don&apos;t want to spend a bunch of money? Well, you&apos;re in luck thanks to devices like the Anbernic RG35XXSP and Miyoo Mini Plus. The former retails for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9M9H1RY">about $87</a>, while the latter is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBQ8TVR3/">priced at $76</a>. But you can enjoy a 20% discount on either one (or both) of these, which is pretty darn great. </p>

<p>Despite its cloud gaming focus, the Logitech G Cloud is much more capable than just being used for streaming games. You can load it up with your own retro gaming library, download RetroArch, and enjoy all of your games. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09T9FHZLH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1e0e7e09-afe8-497b-80f5-3bb6b7444a97" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Logitech G Cloud: $299" data-dimension48="Logitech G Cloud: $299">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Retroid has been in the handheld game for a few years, with the Pocket 4 Pro acting as the company's flagship handheld until recently. It's a bit more powerful than the G Cloud thanks to the Dimensity 1100 SoC, and comes in a bunch of awesome colors. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTHGYPMC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a920d071-137e-450a-96c2-bf7424caa86b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Retroid Pocket 4 Pro: $249" data-dimension48="Retroid Pocket 4 Pro: $249">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>When it comes to nostalgia, it's one thing being able to play your favorite retro games. But it's something else entirely when you have a device replicates the same experience. The RG35XXSP is the perfect modern version of the Game Boy Advance SP, but can play so many more games from a variety of systems. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D57TX452" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="27300773-1e33-4d0d-8d8e-6a13122d36ed" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$86.99" data-dimension48="$86.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>If you're looking for something that's reminiscent of the Game Boy Pocket, look no further than the Miyoo Mini Plus. It sports a 3.5-inch HD display, and can slide right in and out of your pocket with ease. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBQ8TVR3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="834d6b7d-6c45-48ed-bc07-e8799798305e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$75.99" data-dimension48="$75.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>While other gaming handhelds have been released, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Edge-WiFi-Gaming-Tablet-Console-Class/dp/B0CKM287V2/">Razer Edge</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Android-Console-2560x1440-Snapdragon/dp/B0DDKMK7L3/">Ayaneo Pocket S</a>, the G Cloud remains a fan favorite. Along with the solid performance, Logitech seemed to have struck gold when designing the ergonomics. It&apos;s something that other handhelds haven&apos;t been able to match up with, giving the G Cloud a distinct advantage. </p><p>The Retroid Pocket 4 Pro is one of those G Cloud competitors, undercutting Logitech&apos;s handheld while being more powerful. The ergonomics are no match, but since you&apos;re <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTHBS9QF">saving a few bucks</a> on the handheld itself, you can use that to pick up a grip! </p><p>Both of those handhelds are great in their own right, but they don&apos;t quite offer the nostalgic feeling you might be looking for. Have no fear, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9M9H1RY">RG35XXSP</a> manages to do just that, and so much more. Grab it, start playing your favorite games, and enjoy the satisfying "click" whenever you close the lid. Then, flip it back open and pick up right where you left off.</p><p>Then, there&apos;s the Miyoo Mini Plus, which is the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Console-Classic-Consoles-Wireless/dp/B0DC6L9TF1/">Miyoo Mini</a>, offering a larger screen and giving you the ultimate Game Boy Pocket experience. It supports more than 20 different emulators and up to eight hours of battery life. Plus, once you get into the world of these kinds of handhelds, you&apos;ll never want to go back.  </p>

However, many of these items will still end up costing a pretty penny, even if they&apos;re hitting their lowest prices ever. That&apos;s why we&apos;ve put together a collection of some of the top Prime Day sales that won&apos;t cost you more than $50.</p><p>There&apos;s no rhyme or reason to this collection; these are just the tech items that caught my eye and things that I myself would buy if I had the disposable income to get everything on the list. With any luck, you&apos;ll find something on this list that you could use or even gift to someone else as a present for the upcoming holidays.</p>

Since it had some Quest 3 128GB stock left, it discounted it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1776469-REG/meta_quest_899_00579_01_3_advanced_all_in_one_vr.html"><strong>$429 ($70 off)</strong></a> while supplies last.</p><p>Turns out that the supplies won&apos;t last long! The Quest 3 128GB has already sold out at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target, though you can buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Performance-Oculus/dp/B0D5H6WRPH"><strong>Renewed Quest 3 for $379 at Amazon</strong></a><strong> </strong>— just $79 more than the brand-new Quest 3S with some major downgrades.</p><p>If you don&apos;t like buying used, we&apos;ve found a few retailers still carrying the new Quest 3 128GB — for now. Unlike the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">Prime Day deals</a> guaranteed to last through the 9th, we have no way of knowing when the Quest 3 128GB will run out of stock for good, making <strong>now</strong> the only certain time to get a new headset before you have to pay for storage that most everyday VR users probably don&apos;t need.</p>

<p>We've included four store links to find the Meta Quest 3 128GB because four more popular stores have already sold out and we don't know how many headsets are left. This is the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headset</a> on the market, and while you can save even more on the $300 Quest 3S, we'll recommend you grab one of these while you can.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1776469-REG/meta_quest_899_00579_01_3_advanced_all_in_one_vr.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="fbe16aee-b411-4fa5-8e2b-79add6fa6611" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest 3 128GB: $499" data-dimension48="Meta Quest 3 128GB: $499">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Why buy the Quest 3 when the Quest 3S arrives in a week for $299, offering the same CPU, RAM, controllers, RGB cameras, and game library? It&apos;s a fair question, but my guide on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Meta Quest 3 vs. 3S</a> will answer it.</p><p>Essentially, to save on costs, Meta upgraded the hardware but didn&apos;t upgrade the lenses or display. The Quest 3S uses last-gen Fresnel lenses that have the same "sweet spot" as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest 2</a> did, meaning things look blurry when you glance to the side. Plus, it has 445 fewer pixels per inch (PPI) or 5 pixels per degree (PPD) than the Quest 3.</p><p>If you buy the Quest 3, you not only receive that major resolution boost, but things also look significantly crisper from any eye angle thanks to their pancake lenses, which are more condensed so the headset design is less front heavy. Plus, you get a 3.5mm headphone jack (which the Quest 3S cut) and a more exact lens adjustment system so you&apos;re not looking cross-eyed at VR worlds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37" name="Meta-Quest-3S-vs-Meta-Quest-3-front-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">We tested the Quest 3 (left) and Quest 3S (right) at Meta Connect 2024 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even though the Quest 3S runs the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-exclusives-and-enhanced-games">enhanced Quest games</a> and exclusives as the Quest 3, you won&apos;t feel quite as immersed in the action because it won&apos;t display the enhanced 4K textures and resolution boost as clearly. So spending that extra cash on the Quest 3 will make it truly feel like a next-gen headset instead of a Quest 2.5.</p><p>Your only question is whether to buy New or Renewed. While you may not like buying used, we typically recommend buying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">Quest 3 accessories</a> for better comfort and battery life anyways, so you can use the saved money to swap out the used parts you would have thrown away from the newer headset regardless. </p><p>Either way, I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll regret picking up the Quest 3 instead of the Quest 3S, despite the extra cost! </p>

<p>Qualcomm may have just teased the processor for the highly anticipated OnePlus 13, and while details are still unclear, it seems the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phone</a> may take an unexpected direction.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> was initially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-hits-benchmark-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4">expected to draw its power from the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>, but with Qualcomm working on a new flagship chip, OnePlus might be rethinking its choice.</p><p>In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/2619244577/OAyGuDqPl?pagetype=profilefeed" target="_blank">Weibo post</a>, Qualcomm offered a glimpse into the forthcoming Snapdragon Summit, teasing the arrival of a new chipset called the Snapdragon 8 Elite. The video showcases Oryon cores, a tech already featured in the Snapdragon X Elite laptop SoCs.</p><p>The exact role of the Snapdragon 8 Elite is still unclear. It’s uncertain if Qualcomm plans to launch it as a separate flagship alongside the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 or if it’s just a rebranding of the Gen 4.</p><p>Along with the Snapdragon chipset teaser, the video featured a smartphone with a circular camera island, likely a prototype resembling the OnePlus 13’s design. It keeps the classic OnePlus camera setup in the top-left corner, sticking to the look of the OnePlus 11 and 12.</p><p>Leaker Digital Chat Station also hinted on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OAz2w4u6f?pagetype=profilefeed" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that the OnePlus 13 could be the first smartphone to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/10/08/snapdragon-8-elite-chip-could-launch-first-on-oneplus-13-suggest-official-teaser/" target="_blank">Gizmochina</a>). Additionally, early reports suggest the smartphone will sport a 6.82-inch LTPO OLED display, offering 2K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 is also expected to feature a powerful triple rear camera setup, led by a 50MP LYT-808 primary sensor. It’ll supposedly be joined by a 50MP ultra-wide sensor and a 50MP periscope telephoto lens, offering a 3x optical zoom.</p><p>Although OnePlus hasn’t officially announced the OnePlus 13 yet, Xiaomi has jumped ahead by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/yabhishekhd/status/1839245301732835667" target="_blank">revealing</a> that its Xiaomi 15 series, launching on October 23, will be the first to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.</p><p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon Summit, happening from October 21 to 23, is expected to give us the full scoop on the new chipset.</p>

After all, why wait for the Black Friday deals to go live when Amazon&apos;s offers are this good?</p><p>For example, were you aware that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDLHD3B"><strong>Samsung Galaxy S24 is currently sitting with a 25% discount</strong></a> at Amazon? That&apos;s a record-smashing discount on one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> that money can buy, and it&apos;s pretty unlikely that we&apos;ll see the price drop much further when Black Friday hits. </p>

<p>The Galaxy S24&apos;s compact design has drawn comparisons to an iPhone, but this is an Android phone through and through. You get all of the fun Galaxy AI features that Samsung has been advertising as of late, plus years of software support and outstanding cameras. The S24 also features a bigger battery than its predecessor, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset is one of the best mobile processors in the game today. </p><p>Sure, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-vs-s23">Galaxy S24 isn&apos;t a vast improvement over the S23</a>, but when a Prime Day discount comes along and knocks the price of the 2024 flagship down to $599.99, I wouldn&apos;t blame you for considering the upgrade. Go ahead and hit that Add to Cart button, we can always do Black Friday next year. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>YouTube has reportedly started "hiding" the skip button during the initial ad for a video on mobile devices.</li><li>The ad shows a full length duration bar, but the skip button only appears once that finishes and the ad continues to play.</li><li>YouTube recently started pushing ads for paused videos, a format the company sees as "less disruptive."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A report has surfaced about YouTube&apos;s latest attempts at getting users to view ads on its platform on mobile devices.</p><p>The report claims the changes could be part of an "extended test" YouTube is dishing out to a limited number of users. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-hiding-skip-button-mobile/">Android Police</a>, viewing the preceding ad for a video no longer displays a "skip" button. This change doesn&apos;t seem all that bad once the evidence is accounted for.</p><p>It seems like YouTube is removing the skip button for the portion of the ad that isn&apos;t skippable anyway. Typically, skippable ads must run for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2467968?hl=en#:~:text=ad%20breaks.-,Video%20ad%20format,-Description">specific duration</a> (five seconds) before the user can pass it off. The change on mobile devices shows a full bar for the ad&apos;s supposed "duration," which is likely just the portion users <em>must </em>see.</p><p>After, the skip button pops up in the bottom right corner (as usual) while the ad continues to play until it&apos;s pressed.</p><p>While mobile devices are seeing the skip button hidden until it&apos;s available, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-hiding-skip-button/">the publication reiterated</a> that those on the web are seeing it blocked out. This is reportedly in place of the typical countdown circle, which didn&apos;t sit well with users on Reddit. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/extremelyinfuriating/comments/1ftyw5w/comment/lq6021k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">one user reported</a> that the gray boxes that blocked out the skip button were a "bug."</p><p>They stated that YouTube likely pushed another update that simply removed the skip button from sight until you can move along.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HsBXzZ9s9Em9RtshD6qs8K" name="youtube-zte-axon-10-pro.jpg" alt="YouTube Axon 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HsBXzZ9s9Em9RtshD6qs8K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Jason England / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>YouTube has been wrapped in a war against ad blockers for a while now, but this change doesn&apos;t feel like that. At the very least, it seems like a change that the company likely deems makes sense, but has yet to say officially.</p><p>The company was spotted displaying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-statement-paused-content-ads-appear">ads for paused videos</a> on mobile devices and Smart TVs. YouTube&apos;s communications manager, Oluwa Falodun confirmed the change, stating it was due to "advertiser and strong viewer response, we’ve since widely rolled out Pause ads to all advertisers." On TVs, pausing a video would see the chosen ad appear on the right side of the display until it was resumed.</p><p>More importantly, paused videos showing ads were something illuded to during Alphabet&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/alphabet-q1-2024-earnings">Q1 2024</a> earnings report. It seems Google sees the format as "less disruptive," though these aren&apos;t the ads we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tests-less-disruptive-mid-roll-ads">thought we were getting</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Fitbit is delivering its first Labs experiment for a feature in development that progresses the app&apos;s health and fitness analytics.</p><p>In a community <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/The-Pulse-Fitbit-Community-Blog/Fitbit-Labs-Testing-new-experimental-health-amp-fitness-capabilities-in-the/ba-p/5675311">blog post</a>, Fitbit detailed the initial opt-in test in Labs called "Insight Explorer." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sign-fitbit-premium">Premium subscribers</a> will notice the new Labs banner in their "You" tab with the following description: "Discover insights generated by AI." Fitbit states this new feature leverages LLMs (large language models), but more specifically, it uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google&apos;s Gemini</a> intelligence.</p><p>The test is to see how well Gemini can "understand" a user&apos;s personal health questions from Fitbit data. Gemini&apos;s purpose in the Insight Explorer is to give users "personalized answers" about the various pieces of data Fitbit keeps a record of.</p><p>Fitbit directs us to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14566053?visit_id=638640084795721188-3276302874&p=insights_explorer&rd=1#zippy=%2Cinsights-explorer%2Cwhat-is-insights-explorer%2Chow-do-i-get-started-with-insights-explorer%2Cwhat-fitbit-data-can-insights-explorer-use-to-answer-questions%2Chow-is-my-insights-explorer-data-used%2Chow-do-i-provide-feedback-on-insights-explorer%2Chow-do-i-turn-off-insights-explorer%2Cwhat-limitations-does-insights-explorer-have:~:text=have%20a%20waitlist%3F-,Active%20labs,-Insights%20explorer">support center</a>, which expands on its first Labs test of Insight Explorer. Wearing your Fitbit device is ideal as the app collects your health & fitness data concerning a wide range of areas. The post states Insight Explorer will leverage steps, Active Zone Minutes, sleep score, sleep duration, heart rate variability, resting heart rate, and more for Gemini&apos;s functions.</p><p>With enough data, users can begin asking Gemini specific questions about themselves. Fitbit states users can ask about their averages (think steps), trends, highest/lowest values (sleep, etc.), personal bests, comparisons, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="EG8YqxbytiLB5eCuCcebhL" name="fitbit-labs-gemini-insight-explorer-test-start.jpg" alt="Fitbit Labs starts and kicks off with its first test of its Gemini-powered "Insight Explorer."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EG8YqxbytiLB5eCuCcebhL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1068" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fitbit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fitbit highlights some advisories about Insight Explorer, such as the chance that it may get your data wrong. The company attributes this to its usage of generative AI, which we know is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-with-bard-would-be-the-perfect-way-to-challenge-chatgpt">prone to hallucinations</a> and erroneous statements. Insight Explorer may also take "up to" 48 hours before your data of gathered and available for personalized answers via Gemini.</p><p>More importantly, the company states "when you ask a question in insights explorer, your data may be analyzed to provide a response to your question." Additionally, some of your data may be used to "improve and develop" Fitbit products alongside keeping its machine learning capabilities sharp. Of course, users don&apos;t have to engage with Insight Explorer in Fitbit Labs.</p><p>The post adds that users can opt out of the generative AI experience by entering <strong>Fitbit Settings ></strong> <strong>Fitbit Labs</strong> > <strong>Insights Explorer > Turn off</strong>. This will likely be how to disable it once it arrives in a stable update for all users.</p><p>We&apos;ve been waiting for Fitbit Labs to start since the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai-powered-fitbit-labs-coming-later-this-year-for-some-fitbit-premium-subscribers">teased its arrival</a> in March. It&apos;s worth remembering that Labs is open to a "limited" number of people, so you might have to wait if things fill up quickly.

There is a better way.</p><p>That means dealing with wires. I know, I know, we collectively hate wires now but you might change your mind when you listen to your music through these Shure Wired Earbuds, and you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SE215-K-Isolating-Earphones-MicroDriver/dp/B004PNZFZ8">grab them on Prime Day for just $79</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to make your music sound better but don't want to spend a fortune and aren't sure where to start you need these earbuds. Paired with a quality headphone adapter, you have everything you need to enjoy and relax.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SE215-K-Isolating-Earphones-MicroDriver/dp/B004PNZFZ8/?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="926d5f87-8628-42e8-b3e0-787064dad006" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$99" data-dimension48="$99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>You know you want to listen to music at a higher quality than a typical pair of Bluetooth earbuds can deliver, but don&apos;t want to spend a fortune. They&apos;re also great for kicking around in your pocket on the go where you don&apos;t want uber-expensive headphones to get ruined.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>You&apos;re happy with the Bluetooth earbuds you already have. You won&apos;t have to deal with the wires and there is nothing wrong with them. You enjoy what you want to enjoy and never listen to anyone who says otherwise.</p>
<p>These aren&apos;t the best in-ear monitors you can buy. Shure makes better ones, even. But they are an awesome value; they sound a lot more expensive than they are. At $79 they are exactly what you should buy if you know you want to listen to high-quality music but have no idea what you should buy or where to get started.</p><p>You will also need a good headphone adapter. You can get by with almost any you find, but if you buy something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/helm-audio-bolt-dac-amp-review">Helm Audio Bolt adapter</a> (my pick for using with a phone and something I carry every day) you&apos;re going to be happy. You can grab one of those on Prime Day for $60 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Headphone-Amplifier-Playback-Certified/dp/B086GK94X2">using a 10-dollar-off coupon</a> at Amazon.</p>
<p>I&apos;m told I have an unhealthy obsession with headphones and admit I have spent far too much money on them. I&apos;m also pleased with how these Shure buds sound, especially considering the price. Believe it or not, $79 is cheap for high-grade audio gear.</p><p>I recommend these every time they go on sale for the same reasons I recommend them this time: I think they are the best value out there when talking about headphones. </p>

<p>Google is making parking a lot easier for drivers by letting them reserve and book spots with SpotHero right through Google Maps and Search.</p><p>SpotHero, a parking reservation platform, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241008323536/en/SpotHero-Integrates-with-Google-to-Expand-Access-to-Digital-Parking-Solutions-via-Google-Maps-and-Google-Search" target="_blank">announced</a> today that it has joined forces with Google to bring its services right into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/15-best-google-maps-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Maps</a> and Search. This partnership is rolling out across the U.S. and Canada, allowing users to easily snag parking spots at over 8,000 locations.</p><p>Even with this expansion, the new feature might not be available everywhere. SpotHero says it only covers 300 cities across the U.S. and Canada. You can even find it at popular spots like Madison Square Garden and the SAP Center.</p><p>It&apos;s worth pointing out that SpotHero was first added to Maps and Search in a limited way back in April, but the exciting news is that this feature is now available to more users.</p><p>This new feature makes it super easy for users to find parking close to where they’re headed and reserve it with just a click of the “Book Online” button in Maps or Search.</p><p>When you tap that button, you&apos;ll be taken right to SpotHero to wrap up your booking without having to switch apps. It cuts out the hassle of flipping between the app and a web browser.</p><p>The platform also gives users the option to reserve parking ahead of time, allowing them to pick their preferred dates and times. Plus, it features handy filters to help you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-eco-friendly-driving-directions-google-maps">find parking spots that meet your specific needs</a>, whether that&apos;s EV charging stations, wheelchair access, or valet services.</p><p>This new development is a big win for drivers who are fed up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-gets-helpful-parking-feature">hassle of driving around city blocks searching for parking</a>, especially in busy areas. Since 2011, SpotHero has been making life easier for over 10 million drivers. </p><p>Google Maps has revamped how we travel, making navigation a breeze for everything from last-minute trips to family vacations. Now, it’s stepping up its game by helping with that tricky parking situation.</p>

I spend as much time as I can with each brand, trying to sus out which ones are the best in practice, not just on paper.</p><p>If I didn&apos;t already have this heaping box of smartwatches, I&apos;d be eyeing Prime Day 2024 closely for smartwatch deals. Many of my favorites are on sale, though I&apos;d recommend you skip some deals and wait for something better around Black Friday. Others, though, I&apos;d call "buy-now deals" because they&apos;re for last-gen watches that may not stay in stock forever, or at all-time lows.</p><p>Rather than waste your time and mine with a whole hub of generic deals, I&apos;ll focus on the five "best" deals in my subjective opinion, based on my time testing or reviewing each of them. </p>

<p>My first recommendation is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C797946T"><strong>Galaxy Watch 6 44mm at $169 (48% off)</strong></a>. Although the Galaxy Watch 7 is also on sale for $260, my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Galaxy Watch 7 vs. 6</a> guide shows that the 2023 model either matches or closely falls behind the newer watch in nearly every metric. I&apos;d miss the Watch 7&apos;s dual-band GPS, but I can live with every other minor downgrade.</p><p>I always recommend a Samsung watch first to Android users because of the four-year software promise; the Watch 6 will still be getting updates through 2027, as long as other newer watches. While I also <em>love</em> my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3 45mm</a> as a Wear OS alternative, Google is keeping it full price ($399) for now, so the Galaxy Watch 6 is an easy rec.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> impressed me with its bright, thin-bordered display, reliable Exynos performance, and comfortably lightweight design. It's not the most stylish design — look at the Watch 6 Classic instead for that — but snagging the best watch of 2023 for the price of a budget fitness watch is the best deal I've found.</p>
<p><strong>Also consider the Galaxy Watch 7 for a faster CPU and better fitness accuracy: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1YQ3MML/" target="_blank"><del>$329</del><strong> $260.72 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C797946T" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="3ceefd16-b8b6-44e0-b245-9d0ed8b07aad" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Watch 6: $329.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Watch 6: $329.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>While that&apos;s my top pick, I&apos;ll admit that the Galaxy Watch series isn&apos;t especially...attractive. It&apos;s functional and durable! But if you want a Prime Day deal that actually looks <em>stylish</em>, you have two options: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Best-Fitbit/dp/B0CCQDYY8X"><strong>Pixel Watch 2 for $170.99 (32% off)</strong></a><strong> </strong>or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-100-Hour-Tracking-Sapphire-Dual-Engine/dp/B0CV5ZG5TC"><strong>OnePlus Watch 2 for $209 (30% off)</strong></a>. I&apos;d personally recommend the Pixel Watch.</p><p>Having worn both watches, I appreciate the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> for its polished, stock Wear OS software and its lightweight, attractive rounded-edge design. It has one of the best sensor suites and fitness apps of any smartwatch, not just Wear OS. But it&apos;s also on the short-lived side for an Android watch, whereas the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> can last an impressive four days per charge. And it has the upside of a gorgeous, classic-styled steel frame and a larger display. </p><p>It&apos;s your call which appeals more! But the OnePlus Watch 2 had some software hiccups and fitness accuracy issues that turned me off; OnePlus fixed some of those in the solid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> I reviewed, but that&apos;s (A) not as stylish-looking and (B) not on sale.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel Watch 2 was #2 on our <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatch</a> list for a year; while it's been supplanted by the Watch 3, it remains an excellent device with a strikingly unique design. Get access to native perks like Google Assistant and Maps that'll let you keep your phone in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>Also consider the OnePlus Watch 2 for superior battery life with the same CPU and RAM: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-100-Hour-Tracking-Sapphire-Dual-Engine/dp/B0CV5ZG5TC"><del>$299</del><strong> $209.99 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Best-Fitbit/dp/B0CCQDYY8X" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e48cdbb2-d077-4c90-b538-e1c579599bec" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel Watch 2: $249" data-dimension48="Google Pixel Watch 2: $249">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Aside from Wear OS watches, many of my favorite fitness brands like Fitbit and COROS are largely skipping Prime Day. The exception, thankfully, is Garmin: It&apos;s my go-to brand for improving my running fitness, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> as my daily driver; but even though that&apos;s $100 off right now, it&apos;s still too expensive for most Prime Day deal hunters.</p><p>Instead, I&apos;ll point you to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smartwatch-All-Day-Monitoring-Long-Lasting/dp/B0B5VVKC2J"><strong>Garmin Venu Sq 2 at $149 ($100 off)</strong></a>. It&apos;s just one of many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/october-prime-day-garmin-watch-deals-2024-big-deal-days"><strong>great Garmin Prime Day deals</strong></a> I&apos;ve already highlighted, but the Venu Sq 2 is the gateway drug to tempt non-Garmin fans into trying its impressive training software, without paying the usual $400+ that most Garmin watches cost or getting an ugly non-AMOLED display. Again, I&apos;m more of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a> guy, but the Venu Sq 2 for $300 less is a better bargain.</p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e7e3230a-fcaf-4b19-9e98-be5c2b16b254" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Venu Sq 2:  $249" data-dimension48="Garmin Venu Sq 2:  $249" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smartwatch-All-Day-Monitoring-Long-Lasting/dp/B0B5VVKC2J" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="o6u6odkaEKKwDbrkNAyFGa" name="garmin-venu-sq-2-music-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o6u6odkaEKKwDbrkNAyFGa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Garmin Venu Sq 2: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smartwatch-All-Day-Monitoring-Long-Lasting/dp/B0B5VVKC2J" target="_blank" data-dimension112="e7e3230a-fcaf-4b19-9e98-be5c2b16b254" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Venu Sq 2:  $249" data-dimension48="Garmin Venu Sq 2:  $249"><del>$249</del><strong> $149 at Amazon</strong></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review" target="_self">Garmin Venu Sq 2</a> has never dipped below $199 before now, making this a rare chance at one of Garmin's best mid-range watches for cheap. It offers 11-day battery life, a bright AMOLED display, and accurate multi-GNSS tracking that's better than your average GPS data. I love the Venu series' look and its accessible software, giving new users essentials like stress and Body Battery without overwhelming you with more complicated training guides.</p>
<p><strong>Also consider the Venu 3S for a mic/speaker and enhanced training tools: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Stainless-1-2-Inch-Touchscreen-Silicone/dp/B0CDC6Y617" target="_blank"><del>$449.99</del><strong> $399.99 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smartwatch-All-Day-Monitoring-Long-Lasting/dp/B0B5VVKC2J" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e7e3230a-fcaf-4b19-9e98-be5c2b16b254" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Venu Sq 2:  $249" data-dimension48="Garmin Venu Sq 2:  $249">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>My next recommendation may surprise you, but it&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Resistant/dp/B0CSTFHP3W" target="_blank"><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 for $329 ($100 off)</strong></a>. Despite my Android focus at this site, I tested both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Series 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Ultra 2</a> over the past year, and since my favorite (the Ultra) is still a painful $799, I&apos;ll point out instead that the Series 9 is consistently solid. You can pay $400+ for the skinnier titanium S10, but key areas like battery, speed, software, and fitness tools are virtually identical, and the <em>slightly</em> larger display isn&apos;t worth the extra cost.</p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2ab8fff9-4d52-464a-81a8-44091556b9f1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Apple Watch S9: $429" data-dimension48="Apple Watch S9: $429" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Resistant/dp/B0CSTFHP3W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:749px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="LhMhzo8fLtv93jC5bdGyhG" name="apple-watch-series-9-render.jpeg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LhMhzo8fLtv93jC5bdGyhG.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="749" height="749" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Apple Watch S9: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Resistant/dp/B0CSTFHP3W" data-dimension112="2ab8fff9-4d52-464a-81a8-44091556b9f1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Apple Watch S9: $429" data-dimension48="Apple Watch S9: $429"><del>$429</del><strong> $329 at Amazon</strong></a></p>
<p>Apple's last-gen smartwatch may not stay in stock long enough to last until Black Friday, so if you're looking for a good deal and don't want to wait until next summer for a cheap S10, the S9 lives up to Apple's reputation for quality at a more reasonable price.</p>
<p><strong>Also consider the Apple Watch SE 2; it's too downgraded for me, but also a much better price: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminum-Detection/dp/B0CHX2F5NJ"><del>$249</del><strong> $169 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Resistant/dp/B0CSTFHP3W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2ab8fff9-4d52-464a-81a8-44091556b9f1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Apple Watch S9: $429" data-dimension48="Apple Watch S9: $429">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>My last recommendation is <em>sort of</em> a Prime Day deal. Technically, you can grab the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartwatch-Wellness-Tracking-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YL96ND/"><strong>Galaxy Watch Ultra for $100 off</strong></a> from Amazon if you want the quickest one-click deal on my favorite premium Android watch. But I&apos;d consider instead buying from Samsung directly, where it&apos;s currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch-ultra/buy/galaxy-watch-ultra-47mm-titanium-gray-sm-l705udaaxaa/"><strong>$50 off</strong></a>.</p><p>Why? Because they&apos;ve temporarily reopened their launch trade-in values, so you can get $100 off by trading in "Any smartwatch, any condition" or up to $350 off with a recent Samsung or Apple watch. Even with some random cheap Amazfit sitting in a drawer, you can bring the price down to $500 (better than Amazon&apos;s price); and with the right watch, it could fall down to $250.</p>

<p>I called the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> "stronger than expected" in my review, not just because of its military-grade durability, but because it surpassed my expectations for battery life, performance, GPS accuracy, and heart rate accuracy during workouts. It spares me having to worry about frequent charges, and the 3,000-nit display looks gorgeous outdoors. The main downside is the price, but Prime Day (or a trade-in) will help with that!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch-ultra/buy/galaxy-watch-ultra-47mm-titanium-gray-sm-l705udaaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4a206df9-008c-4fcb-b4e6-23f0bdaa93a4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: $650" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: $650">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>I chose the Ultra because it doesn&apos;t really have a last-gen predecessor (the Watch 6 Classic and Watch 5 Pro don&apos;t count), because it&apos;s just that good of a watch, and because I doubt it&apos;ll be that much cheaper during Black Friday. </p><p>Every other pick, though, is a last-gen smartwatch at or near an all-time low. I&apos;m comfortable recommending them because Apple, Garmin, Google, and Samsung are all excellent at supporting their devices for years after launch, so you&apos;re liable to get new features and bug fixes years after launch. They&apos;re affordable <em>and</em> they offer good value.</p><p>Aside from my Prime Day smartwatch recommendations, I&apos;ll point out that now&apos;s a great time to snag a smart ring, since several of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> are on sale. My personal smart ring of choice is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> (currently $40 off), but you can snag an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Oura-Ring-Gen3-Horizon-Tracking/dp/B0CSR7G7NX"><strong>Oura Ring Gen 3 for $50 off</strong></a> since Oura is clearing out stock for the new Gen 4 rings.</p>
