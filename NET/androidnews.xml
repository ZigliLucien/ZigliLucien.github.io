<p>Over the past few months, Windows laptops have gotten a bit of a "glow-up," if you will. While Intel and AMD continue churning out chips that promise the best performance, Qualcomm might have just snuck ahead of them all with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite</a> series. </p><p>See, we&apos;ve been waiting for the day that Intel or AMD would release a chip that is capable of going toe-to-toe with Apple Silicon. To date, that has yet to come to fruition. </p><p>There&apos;s always some major compromise that we have to deal with, whether it be in the power department or battery life. Technically, you can get a laptop that&apos;s capable of matching or even surpassing Apple&apos;s M-series of chips in terms of raw power. But, good luck using the laptop for more than an hour or two before needing to find an outlet. </p><p>On the flip side, there are chips, even Arm SoCs, that provide endless hours of battery life. However, there&apos;s not enough performance to use more than a couple of apps at a time, and you&apos;re better suited to just get a tablet instead.</p><p>This problem isn&apos;t limited to just the Windows scene, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> also have their fair share of compromises. No, we aren&apos;t talking about the limitations of ChromeOS. But it&apos;s always a "pick your poison" situation, and there&apos;s yet to be an option that checks <em>all</em> of the boxes. </p><p>At the time, Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-competing-with-copilot-plus">Chromebook Plus</a> initiative seemed like a great idea, and it still is. Offer a base level of specs and features, and toss in a few extra goodies, all while <em>trying</em> to ease the decision-making process. Times are a-changin&apos;, and it&apos;s time for Chromebook OEMs to go back to the drawing board with the Snapdragon X Elite in tow. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="XsWQwguCiVAwk7xL4Atjm3" name="macbook-pro-14-microsoft-surface-pro-11-windows-central.jpg" alt="MacBook Pro 14 next to Surface Pro 11 on desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XsWQwguCiVAwk7xL4Atjm3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn&apos;t to say that you can&apos;t get both great performance <em>and</em> battery life out of a Chromebook. What I am saying, is that after spending some time with the latest Surface Pro 11, it can get even better. Furthermore, I&apos;m frankly shocked that we haven&apos;t seen any Chromebooks announced with the Snapdragon X Elite. </p><p>Further driving the point home, is that I&apos;m writing this during IFA 2024, at which point Qualcomm has announced more Snapdragon chips that will make their way into Windows laptops. More importantly, this upcoming crop of laptops will be much more affordable than the initial wave, with some priced as low as $700. </p><p>Maybe that&apos;s the answer as to why we have yet to see new Snapdragon-powered Chromebooks. Although $700 might be seen as affordable in the Windows space, that&apos;s not the case with Chromebooks. For that, you&apos;re looking at the higher-end Chromebook models, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-features-rolling-out">Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714</a>, ASUS Expertbook CX54 Chromebook Plus, and others. </p><p>Unfortunately, the real sweet spot for Chromebooks seems to be between the $300 to $500 price point. You might be able to stretch that to include the $600 bracket, but that&apos;s usually reserved for those higher-end options that are on sale for less.</p><p>Okay, so let&apos;s bring it back a bit. What is so special about the Snapdragon laptop chips that make me want one in a Chromebook? Well, at least in the case of the Surface Pro 11, it finally gives me both the performance and battery life that I look for in a laptop.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="sCg7SvA6CCjop2aBwy8b5L" name="acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-with-snapdragon-x-elite.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 714 (2023) with Snapdragon X Elite promo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sCg7SvA6CCjop2aBwy8b5L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1165" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Imagine a non-Apple world where your laptop can last for at least 10-12 hours, while also being capable of running a bunch of apps at the same time without so much as a stutter. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve been experiencing with my Surface Pro 11, which doesn&apos;t even feature the most "powerful" Snapdragon X Elite model there is. </p><p>More often than not, I&apos;m reaching for the Surface than the Spin 714 or even my own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/mac/macbook/macbook-pro-16-inch-2023-review-apple-does-it-again">M2 Max MacBook Pro</a>. Not because there&apos;s anything drastically different about Windows, but because I know that 9/10 times, it will still have plenty of battery left, even after sitting unused for a day or two.</p><p>Perhaps another reason why we&apos;ve yet to see anything of substance here is because of <em>how</em> Qualcomm is making this work. We&apos;ve seen Arm on Windows devices before, but it failed rather spectacularly, despite the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-qualcomms-not-making-special-chromebook-chip">Surface Pro X</a> being practically perfect from a design perspective. </p><p>The reason is that there just aren&apos;t very many developers that are willing (or able) to make their apps compatible with Arm CPUs. There are quite a few, with Adobe notably offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/adobe-confirms-when-premiere-pro-illustrator-indesign-and-after-effects-will-run-on-windows-11-on-arm-natively">Arm-compatible</a> versions of many of its Creative Cloud applications. But, what about indie developers or "one-man-band" developers that don&apos;t have the time or resources to do something like that? </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5vGeuXbbC9oCmbnKzk9LvA" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-3-external-display-work.jpg" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 multiple windows with external monitor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5vGeuXbbC9oCmbnKzk9LvA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is where the fun part comes in, Qualcomm relies on a transition layer, allowing x86_64 apps to run on Arm, which is essentially a mobile platform. There have been some growing pains, but this was to be expected, and honestly, it&apos;s been a much better experience than the first time that this was attempted in the Windows arena. </p><p>Which gives me a nice little segue into the obvious — ChromeOS has been there before, and it works just fine. Our favorite ChromeOS tablet, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-ideapad-chromebook-duet-3-review">Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3</a>, is powered by the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 SoC, a mobile-first chip. Aside from some bottlenecks with the 4GB version and the reliance on eMMC for storage, it works just fine. </p><p>No, you can&apos;t do <em>everything</em> with the Duet 3 as you can on one of the x86 Chromebooks. But, you <em>can</em> do much more than you might suspect, while still enjoying the fruits offered by the Play Store. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1726px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dgghcuEa4ubjgVmxA9yY27" name="google-intel-ifa-2024-chromeos.jpg" alt="Jim Johnson, Senior VP and GM, Client Business Group at Intel alongside John Solomon, VP and GM of ChromeOS & Education at IFA 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgghcuEa4ubjgVmxA9yY27.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1726" height="971" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another factor that may be playing a part in why we have yet to see the Snapdragon X Elite on a Chromebook is Google&apos;s partnership with Intel. At IFA 2024, Intel introduced its new lineup of Intel Core Ultra chips. During the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKK7ITG9wj8">presentation</a>, John Solomon, Vice President and General Manager of ChromeOS & Education was brought on stage by Intel&apos;s Jim Johnson, Senior VP and GM, Client Business Group.</p><p>The two spoke about the power of Intel processors, while also reinforcing the relationship between Intel and Google. A Gemini demo was also played in the background, showing off the upcoming Help Me Read feature, along with the excellent Magic Editor feature in Google Photos. More importantly, the point was driven home that all of the AI tasks were being performed on-device, without reliance on the cloud.</p><p>At first glance, it appears that Intel and Google&apos;s partnership isn&apos;t going away anytime soon. However, I couldn&apos;t help but feel as though the repeated mentions of "Chromebook Plus" was Google leaving the door open a bit. Not because there&apos;s anything wrong with the "Plus" moniker, but it could lead way to additional branding being added into the mix. </p>
<p>To me, pairing the Snapdragon X Elite with a Chromebook sounds like a match made in heaven. Dare I say that it would make for the perfect pairing for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-pixelbook-2">return of the Pixelbook</a>? I mean, with HP bowing out of the premium Chromebook space, things are lining up, yet again, for Google to make a big splash.</p>

<ul><li>Android Auto may soon give users a way to easily ditch the streaming services and use local audio, instead.</li><li>Users may also be able to play radio stations through Android Auto instead of having to switch back and forth between it and the car's infotainment system.</li><li>The features may launch in Android Auto version 12.8.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android Auto is convenient because it streams music and simultaneously allows you to stay connected to your phone and apps hassle-free while driving. A new update to the app might level up your audio streaming experience.</p><p>Folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-auto-local-media-playback-apk-teardown-3477234/">Android Authority</a> have managed to perform an APK teardown of the latest Android Auto 12.8 version, wherein they spotted some clues indicating a new functionality that will allow users to play local media files stored on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p><p>According to the publication, a new string in the teardown mentions "Car Local Media" and the corresponding labels attached. It is new for Android Auto as it previously only allowed users to play from their favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a> like YouTube Music or Spotify.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:26.39%;"><img id="YWuKAfwvevamNJpkPntNjS" name="Android-Auto-local-media-finding.jpg.jpg" alt="Android Auto local media support" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YWuKAfwvevamNJpkPntNjS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="285" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similarly, a new Car Radio string has also been found in the latest version of the app that could allow users to play their AM and FM stations. Up until now, users had to disconnect Android Auto and rely upon the car&apos;s onboard infotainment system to play the radio. </p><p>The new findings follow the previous radio string mentioned in the Android Auto 12.3/12.4 version of the app via an APK teardown done by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/17/android-auto-car-radio-teardown/">9to5Google</a>. All the evidence points to the possibility for Android users soon, which is welcoming.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:26.39%;"><img id="B7psMV8Uexpm3nJq862dcS" name="Android-Auto-am-and-fm-support.jpg.jpg" alt="Android Auto Car Radio support" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B7psMV8Uexpm3nJq862dcS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="285" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Local media could have some limitations even though the new functionality adds some convenience. It is believed to only allow users to play local media stored on their Android phones and not the audio stored on an external USB thumb drive or in the car&apos;s built-in storage for compatible cars. In such case, users will have to exit Android Auto again and go back to the car&apos;s infotainment system. </p><p>Regardless, it is still interesting to see Google working on Android Auto and bringing new ways for users to rely less on their phones while putting their focus on driving, which is safer. These latest functionalities could soon see the light of day as it appears that the company has been working on them for quite some time now, considering previous findings.</p>

<p>XGIMI has introduced its newest line of home and portable projectors at IFA 2024, aimed at the US market.</p>
<h2 id="mogo-3-pro-2">MoGo 3 Pro</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/xgimi-mogo-3-pro-review">XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro</a> is a great step up from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/xgimi-mogo-2-pro-review">MoGo 2 Pro</a>. It now runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a>, so you no longer need a separate dongle. Plus, it has Netflix built right in for a smoother streaming experience.</p><p>Weighing in at just 1.1kg, the MoGo 3 Pro is practically begging to be taken on the go. Just hook it up to a power bank, and you&apos;ll have endless hours of "cinematic visuals and sound," according to XGIMI&apos;s press release.</p><p>The MoGo 3 Pro comes with a rotating base and DLP tech that delivers 1080p resolution, a 90% DCI-P3 color gamut for eye-popping visuals, and 450 ISO Lumens of brightness.</p>

<p>This portable projector has a protected lens and can project images up to 120 inches. The integrated hidden bracket lets you tilt the projector 130 degrees for the perfect viewing angle.</p><p>It also uses XGIMI&apos;s ISA 2.0 image correction technology to automatically fix keystone distortion, avoid obstacles, focus the image, and align the picture for perfect viewing.</p><p>The MoGo 3 Pro features two integrated 5W Harman Kardon speakers for powerful sound. You can also use it as a Bluetooth speaker and enjoy the Ambient Light Mode, which lights up to the rhythm of your music.</p><p>The MoGo 3 Pro costs $449, but if you grab it with the Powerbase stand (usually $129) as a bundle, you’ll only pay $499. You can also grab the Optical Filter attachment for $49 and the Carrying Case for $69.</p>

<p>A more budget-friendly alternative to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xgimi-elfin-review">Elfin</a> compact projector, the Elfin Flip features a brightness of 600 ISO lumens and runs on the Android TV operating system.</p><p>The Flip&apos;s specs aren&apos;t quite as high-end as the MoGo 3 Pro, but it&apos;s still great for movie nights. It tops out at 400 ISO lumens of brightness, offers 1080p resolution, and covers 113% of the Rec.709 color space. It’s got HDR10, a 27ms low-latency game mode, plus auto keystone correction, auto focus, and automatic screen alignment.</p><p>The integrated stand lets you tilt the Elfin Flip projector up to 150 degrees, so you can angle it however you need. However, it runs on WebOS, which is a surprise twist.</p><p>At $399, the Elfin Flip is a steal compared to the original Elfin at $649. It&apos;s perfect for movie buffs who want a projector they can toss in a bag.</p>

<p>The Aura 2 is XGIMI’s newest ultra-short throw projector. If space is at a premium, this model has you covered, requiring only a few inches from your wall or screen thanks to its ultra-short 0.177:1 throw ratio.</p><p>The Aura 2 crams theater-level sound and visuals into a compact short-throw design. With its Dual Light 2.0 tech, it’s ridiculously bright and color-accurate—2,300 ISO lumens, IMAX Enhanced, Dolby Vision, and 99% DCI-P3 color coverage. So, if you’re into crystal-clear colors and booming sound, this projector has you covered with four 15W Harman/Kardon speakers.</p><p>Amazingly, it also comes with a $100 price cut compared to its predecessor, now going for a surprisingly reasonable $2,699.</p>
<h2 id="horizon-s-series-2">Horizon S series</h2>
<p>XGIMI has also unveiled two Horizon S Series projectors, namely the $1,299 S Pro and the $1,899 S Max.</p><p>The Horizon S Pro is a premium projector with Dual Light 2.0 technology, blending tri-color laser and LED for super bright images. It’s Dolby Vision-ready and comes with a flexible stand that swivels 360º horizontally and 135º vertically.</p>

<p>With 1,700 ISO lumens and a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, it’s designed to wow. Harman/Kardon speakers with 2×12 output, DTS, and Dolby Audio, plus ISA 5.0 tech for real-time adjustments and an electric sliding cover, make it a real standout.</p><p>Furthermore, the Horizon S Max takes the Dual Light 2.0 tech and cranks it up a notch with Dolby Vision and IMAX Enhanced certifications—something no projector has done before. It’s 30% brighter than the previous model, boasting 3,000 ISO lumens and a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio.</p><p>Neither of these models gets the Google TV upgrade, though; they’re sticking with the Android TV OS from the Horizon Ultra.</p>

The brand is building on that foundation with the MoGo 3 Pro, which has notable upgrades over its predecessor.</p><p>The MoGo 3 Pro is brighter — going up to 450 lumens — and it has dual 5W drivers while retaining the same weight as the MoGo 2 Pro. XGIMI overhauled the design with this generation, and the projector looks much more upmarket, and has a unique pivoting system that makes it a breeze to set up and use.</p><p>The biggest addition is Netflix integration; XGIMI now offers Google TV with a native Netflix client, and you no longer have to rely on a workaround to use the streaming service. That alone makes the projector worthy of recommendation over the MoGo 2 Pro and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xgimi-halo-plus-portable-projector-review">Halo+</a>, and there are plenty of other upgrades on offer. I used all of XGIMI&apos;s portable projectors thus far, and the MoGo 3 Pro is the best yet in this segment.</p>

<p>XGIMI unveiled the MoGo 3 Pro at IFA 2024, and the projector is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Licensed-Adjustable-Portable/dp/B0D8HRH431/">now available on Amazon for $449</a> as well as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.xgimi.com/products/mogo-3-pro?variant=41635185623088">brand&apos;s website</a>. The pricing is identical to the MoGo 2 Pro, and XGIMI is bundling the Creative Optical Filter accessory with all orders, a $49 value. If you intend to use the projector at home and want a mount that doubles as a charger, you can get the MoGo 3 Pro with the PowerBase Stand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.xgimi.com/products/mogo-3-pro?variant=41635185655856">as a bundle for $499</a>.</p><p>XGIMI is doubling down on accessories this year, and there&apos;s a carrying case that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.xgimi.com/products/xgimi-carrying-case">costs an extra $69</a>. The case has a faux leather design with suede lining, and it does a great job securing the MoGo 3 Pro.</p><p>In addition to the MoGo 3 Pro, XGIMI is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Vision-Enhanced-Lumens/dp/B0D8KRD3JK">launching the Aura 2 UST projector</a>, and the Horizon S Max and S Pro. </p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-xgimi-mogo-3-pro-design-and-accessories"><span>XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro: Design and accessories</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WrgbbeTSVjwWPLTSZNd8vn" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-1.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WrgbbeTSVjwWPLTSZNd8vn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To call the design of the MoGo 3 Pro an upgrade over its predecessor would be an understatement. It is instead a fundamental reimagining of what a portable projector should look like, and the cylindrical chassis makes the MoGo 3 Pro that much more elegant while increasing portability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9qWFMvWibdWsY3DDjE8FZ5" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-13.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9qWFMvWibdWsY3DDjE8FZ5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design consists of two parts: the base houses the dual 5W audio drivers, and the projection hardware, ports, and active cooling are located up top. Both parts are connected by a built-in stand, and the projector pivots on the stand, allowing you to easily adjust the image by 130 degrees. There&apos;s a sliding metal rail inside the stand that lets you change the positioning as well, and it makes a big difference.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="M5v3HEVudypamwSjJGH2K" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-4.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M5v3HEVudypamwSjJGH2K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The changes to the design makes the MoGo 3 Pro that much more usable on a variety of surfaces, and XGIMI nailed the design brief. The projector lens tucks into the base when not in use, and it doesn&apos;t get any scratches or dust as a result. There&apos;s also a lanyard on the side that lets you hook the projector to the outside of a bag — if you&apos;re feeling adventurous.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NhVCDf9SsQvsPZsPv5tTX8" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-21.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NhVCDf9SsQvsPZsPv5tTX8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you want a traditional way to take the projector on the road, XGIMI has a carrying case accessory that&apos;s ideal for the job. It has a hard shell design with PU leather and suede lining, and it is water and dust-resistant. The case accommodates the MoGo 3 Pro and the bundled remote, but there&apos;s no provision for the charging plug.</p>

<p>XGIMI also has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.xgimi.com/products/xgimi-powerbase-stand">PowerBase Stand</a> that is a floor stand and a power bank. The stand houses a 20000mAh battery, and allows you to power the MoGo 3 Pro with relative ease. It isn&apos;t convenient to use outdoors, but if you plan to use the projector at home and need an integrated solution, it is a decent choice — provided you buy the bundled option. It costs $129 as a standalone product, and you may as well get a dedicated power bank and regular floor stand instead.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vKGsanEYZrxoyLvrCyvv78" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-18.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKGsanEYZrxoyLvrCyvv78.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My favorite accessory is the Creative Optical Filter. It&apos;s basically a fish-eye lens that you can attach to the MoGo 3 Pro, magnifying the projection and distorting the edges, ideal if you want to set up an ambient projection on the ceiling. It is used in conjunction with XGIMI Wall, a custom app that has dynamic backgrounds.</p><p>The sleeker design of the MoGo 3 Pro gives it a much better presence, and it&apos;s just easier to set up and use anywhere. Coming in at just 2.4lb, the MoGo 3 Pro is inherently portable, and the tweaks to the design make it a better overall product.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-xgimi-mogo-3-pro-features-and-connectivity"><span>XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro: Features and connectivity</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VV9dyW7XiWPJciBdY4opT6" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-15.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VV9dyW7XiWPJciBdY4opT6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just like the MoGo 2 Pro, there isn&apos;t a built-in battery on the MoGo 3 Pro, and you&apos;ll need to power it via a wall plug or power bank. XGIMI bundles a standard 65W USB PD charger in the box, and you can use your own. Any power bank or power station that delivers 65W of power via the PD standard also fits the brief.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zG7FhRkV3db7DxX4fUufs" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-6.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zG7FhRkV3db7DxX4fUufs.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because of the integrated design, you don&apos;t get much in the way of ports; there&apos;s a Micro HDMI and USB-A port on the side, and that&apos;s about it. The projector has the USB-C port at the bottom of the stand, and the only physical control is the power button. There&apos;s a fan at the back that does a good job cooling the unit, and it isn&apos;t audible in regular use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QiDSoKaHok7uziV3gHuYJ7" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-16.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QiDSoKaHok7uziV3gHuYJ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The MoGo 3 Pro shares the same hardware as the Halo+; it is powered by a quad-core Arm Cortex A53 cluster that goes up to 1.3GHz. There&apos;s 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, and you get a Mali-G52 with a solitary shader core. The projector doubles as a regular Bluetooth speaker, and the dual 5W drivers get pretty loud — more so than I imagined. The 360-degree design makes a difference in this area, and there isn&apos;t much distortion even with high volume.</p>
<p>Coming to connectivity, you get Wi-Fi ac and Bluetooth 5.1, and while there&apos;s no Wi-Fi 6, there were no issues connecting to my home network and streaming content. Similar to other XGIMI projectors, the MoGo 3 Pro has auto keystone correction and autofocus, and regardless of how often you change the orientation of the projector, the keystone correction calibrates the image in a matter of seconds — it goes a long way in making the MoGo 3 Pro hassle-free to use.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-xgimi-mogo-3-pro-picture-quality"><span>XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro: Picture quality</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QgYfWXtejjJEnLi3mv3Ry5" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-14.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QgYfWXtejjJEnLi3mv3Ry5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The MoGo 3 Pro is a DLP projector that uses an LED light source and a 1.2:1 throw ratio, and it goes up to a 1080p resolution. It goes up to 450 lumens — 50 lumen more than its predecessor. There&apos;s a noticeable difference between the two in regular use, and along with increased brightness, the MoGo 3 Pro has better color vibrancy. I recently tested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/yaber-t2-plus-review">Yaber&apos;s T2 Plus</a>, and the MoGo 3 Pro easily outmatches that portable projector in both color accuracy and brightness.</p><p>You&apos;ll still need to minimize ambient light to be able to use the projector — it doesn&apos;t get anywhere as bright as the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xgimi-horizon-pro-4k-projector-review">Horizon Pro</a> — but it has a better showing than just about any other portable projector today, and that&apos;s a big deal.</p><p>There are three brightness modes — Standard, Eco, and Performance — and the projector uses Eco mode by default. You can switch to the Standard mode from the settings, and this is what you&apos;ll use most of the time. That&apos;s because you can only get maximum brightness when using the bundled XGIMI wall plug. Even if you have any other 65W PD charger or power bank, you&apos;re limited to the Standard mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="43M9mdRp6aiQJDzq9Fyck" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-5.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/43M9mdRp6aiQJDzq9Fyck.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fan kicks into high gear in Performance mode, and it gets sufficiently loud that you&apos;ll need to turn up the volume to drown out its sound. While you get better brightness and color accuracy, the hassle of using the bundled charger means you miss out on portability, so I just connected the MoGo 3 Pro to the massive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-300w-48000mah-power-bank-review">48000mAh Nexode power bank</a>.</p><p>There&apos;s an ambient mode that creates diffused light when you tilt the projector lens down, and it&apos;s a nifty feature. While the MoGo 3 Pro has smaller audio drivers this time around, it still delivers powerful sound.</p>

<p>The MoGo 3 Pro has a standard Google TV interface, but there&apos;s one pivotal inclusion: Netflix. The brand finally managed to secure a Netflix license, and the platform is installed out of the box on the MoGo 3 Pro. That&apos;s a huge deal, and you no longer have to use a workaround or install a web client to stream Netflix on an XGIMI projector.</p><p>The interface is decent, but it isn&apos;t fluid, and you will have to be patient as you&apos;re navigating it — this is no Shield TV. That said, there isn&apos;t any noticeable lag when streaming content, and the MoGo 3 Pro held up just as well as other portable projectors in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xHSaUaFRuNbsgx7NLXour6" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-17.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHSaUaFRuNbsgx7NLXour6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The bundled remote is decent enough, and while it is made out of plastic and doesn&apos;t have backlighting, it comes with all the requisite buttons.</p>

<p>If you need a brighter image, XGIMI&apos;s Halo+ goes up to 700 lumens, and there&apos;s a new version of the projector that has the same Netflix integration as the MoGo 3 Pro. It isn&apos;t as easy to set up, and you miss out on the effortless adjustability, and at $799, it costs a lot.</p><p>The MoGo 2 Pro is still a decent choice, and it should be discounted now that the 3 Pro is available. You don&apos;t get Netflix and miss out on the adjustable design, but it has a bright projection, and better sound.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a stylish projector with good onboard sound</li><li>You need a bright projection</li><li>You need Netflix and Google TV</li><li>You want auto keystone correction and portability</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a projector with a built-in battery</li></ul>
<p>Overall, there isn&apos;t much to fault on the MoGo 3 Pro. The projector has one of the best designs in this category, and the ability to easily adjust the projection angle unlocks a range of new use cases. The image quality itself is terrific, and the MoGo 3 Pro gets sufficiently bright and detailed. You still can&apos;t use it in daylight, but that&apos;s the case with all portable projectors.</p><p>The lack of a built-in battery is going to be a deal-breaker to some, but I think this is a more elegant system; you get much better battery life by connecting the MoGo 3 Pro to any decent-sized power bank, and the extensibility of connecting over USB-C beats the convenience of a built-in battery.</p><p>Most of all, the inclusion of Netflix creates the biggest differentiator. I&apos;ve reviewed and recommended XGIMI&apos;s offerings for over four years now, and the biggest pain point is missing Netflix integration. That&apos;s not a problem now, and if you need a portable projector that&apos;s easy to carry and has a bright projection, the MoGo 3 Pro is the one to beat.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung’s rolling out the One UI 6.1.1 update for the Galaxy S24 series, featuring AI features and the September 2024 security patch.</li><li>The update, revealed at IFA 2024, is also coming to the Galaxy S23 series, S23 FE, Z Flip 5, Z Fold 5, and Tab S9 series.</li><li>Korea got the update first on September 5, with North America and Europe set to follow from September 9.</li></ul>

<p>Samsung is finally rolling out the One UI 6.1.1 update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series, packed with AI features and the September 2024 security patch.</p><p>At IFA 2024, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-expands-latest-galaxy-ai-features-to-even-more-users-around-the-world" target="_blank">revealed</a> during a press conference that One UI 6.1.1 is officially rolling out to its latest flagship devices. The company also mentioned that many of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">beloved Samsung devices</a> will get the update next week.</p><p>This means the One UI 6.1.1 update is making its way to a wider range of Galaxy devices, including the Galaxy S23 series, S23 FE, Z Flip 5, Z Fold 5, and Tab S9 series. These devices will have access to the advanced AI features introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>Productivity gets a boost with the One UI 6.1.1 update. New features like Note Assist, PDF Overlay Translation, and Sketch to Image streamline tasks. Note Assist can translate and summarize notes, while PDF Overlay Translation offers text translation for PDFs, images, and graphs. Sketch to Image turns simple sketches into image options.</p><p>The update also makes communication a breeze. With AI-powered tools like Interpreter, Listening Mode, and Chat Assist, translating languages and getting messaging suggestions is way easier. Plus, the Composer feature gives a hand with writing more effectively.</p><p>Of course, there&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> feature, made with Google, for quick visual searches. Photography fans will also love the improved Portrait Mode and the new Instant Slow-mo feature.</p><p>One UI 6.1.1 also brings in fresh wallpapers that adjust based on the weather and time of day.</p><p>You can use AI features like Composer, Sketch to Image, Interpreter, and Note Assist for free until the end of 2025. Samsung hasn’t revealed how it&apos;ll charge for these features after that.</p><p>It should be noted that even after installing the update, the One UI version will stay at 6.1. Samsung uses the x.1.1 One UI version numbers exclusively for foldable devices and tablets.</p><p>Galaxy devices in Korea were the first to get the One UI 6.1.1 update on September 5. The update will be available in North America and Europe starting September 9.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I was quick to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-still-cant-get-the-basics-right-on-pixels">criticize the Pixel 9 series</a> shortly after launch, and I called out Google for moving the needle enough with its latest devices. Now that I&apos;ve used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> for two weeks, I&apos;m ready to admit that my initial assessment was incorrect — Google made a lot of changes to the phone that are noticeable in daily use.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>The first area of differentiation is the build quality; Google switched to a new design language with the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and while the phone ends up looking like an iPhone because of the flat sides, it feels much better in-hand than its predecessors. It has good weight distribution, and the squarish design with added width around the mid-frame offers increased structural rigidity.</p><p>I&apos;ve broken enough Pixels to know how fragile these devices can be, but the Pixel 9 Pro XL came away unscathed after a few tumbles, so it&apos;s clear that Google paid attention to this area. In a similar vein, I&apos;ve had issues with ports and buttons on previous Pixels, but that just isn&apos;t the case on the Pixel 9 Pro XL — the build quality is finally on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>.</p>
<p>Another big change has to do with the modem. The Pixel 9 Pro XL is powered by the Tensor G4, and while it isn&apos;t noticeably faster than the G3, the Exynos 5400 modem delivers much better connectivity. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a> couldn&apos;t maintain a reliable connection to my home network, but the Pixel 9 Pro XL doesn&apos;t have those shortcomings; I got a steady signal throughout the house, and while the signal strength wasn&apos;t as high as Qualcomm-powered devices, I had zero issues in regular use.</p><p>Overheating was a big problem last year, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL mitigates that via the use of a vapor chamber and aggressive power limits. Google set up the G4 to throttle earlier than the G3, and this is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">evident in the benchmarks</a>. The result is that the Pixel 9 Pro XL isn&apos;t anywhere as good as Snapdragon 8 Gen 3-powered devices at gaming — it throttles way too quickly, and you get visible jitter in demanding games.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Br5AMsMAifmQ2PSg86wRqP" name="pixel-9-9-pro-xl-5.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL with Vivo X100 Ultra and Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Br5AMsMAifmQ2PSg86wRqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The upside is that the Pixel 9 Pro XL has the best thermals of any phone I used in 2024; it doesn&apos;t exceed 42 degrees under full load, and it&apos;s obvious that Google configured the Tensor G4 this way to prevent any overheating. While the Pixel 9 Pro XL isn&apos;t a gaming powerhouse by any measure, there is a noticeable difference in fluidity in day-to-day tasks over the Pixel 8 Pro. I had instances where the 8 Pro would lag in mundane tasks like Chrome or Instagram, and that just hasn&apos;t been an issue on the 9 Pro XL.</p><p>On that note, multitasking was an annoyance on Pixel 8 Pro, and the phone had a tendency to kill background apps after a few hours. Google changed this on the 9 Pro XL, and you can have a lot of background apps active without any issues. I understand that all of these seem like trivial problems, but they&apos;ve been a constant annoyance on previous Pixels, and it&apos;s good to see Google addressing these shortcomings on its latest device.</p><p>That said, there are things that Google needs to fix. The Pixel 9 Pro XL takes too long to save portrait shots to the gallery, and there is shutter lag — you can&apos;t take portrait shots one after the other, and that just isn&apos;t a problem on any other high-end phone I used this year.</p>

<p>After using the phone to take over a hundred photos, it&apos;s clear that Google needs to change the camera hardware. While the brand is still the best at software tuning, the Pixel 9 Pro XL doesn&apos;t have the same caliber of cameras as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, Vivo X100 Ultra, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>I&apos;ve never had an issue with Google&apos;s software efforts; if anything, I tolerated the second-rate hardware in the past because of the excellent software. There&apos;s plenty to like in this area on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, with Google doubling down on AI efforts. All major phone brands offer some level of AI-based features, Google has meaningful additions I actually use.</p><p>With the Pixel 8 Pro, I always got the sense that the phone isn&apos;t built to the same tolerance as other flagships, but that isn&apos;t a problem on the Pixel 9 Pro XL — you&apos;re no longer getting a great camera attached to an average phone. The rest of the hardware is just as good, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL is significantly better than its predecessors in this regard. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/trump-vows-veto-defense-spending-bill-unless-repeal-section-230-regulations-included">Section 230</a> of the Telecommunications Decency Act is a very important law that allows the Internet to function as it does today. Without it, your favorite website would either cease to exist or change in ways that make it unrecognizable. We need these protections because, without them, we would have no way to express ourselves online if we didn&apos;t agree with whoever is tasked to moderate the content.</p><p>But it&apos;s also a very broad law that needs to be reformed. When it was written in 1996, nobody could predict the power that a few tech firms would wield or how much influence social media sites would have on us all. As situations change, the laws governing them must do the same.</p>
<p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca3/22-3061/22-3061-2024-08-27.pdf">recent decision by the Third Circuit US Court of Appeals</a> has ruled that ByteDance, the parent company of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-tiktok-ban-isnt-about-privacy-its-about-politics">TikTok</a>, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/28/24230523/tiktok-blackout-challenge-lawsuit-appeals-court">responsible for the distribution </a>of harmful content even though it is shielded as its publisher. It&apos;s a tragic story of a 10-year-old girl trying the "blackout challenge" she saw in a TikTok short and dying of asphyxia as a result.</p><p>The child&apos;s mother sued for negligence and wrongful death and the case worked its way through the courts to the Third Circuit. The next stop is the Supreme Court. While the case is a terrible one, the ruling from the Third may be what&apos;s needed to revamp Section 230 and hold big tech "accountable" while shielding them at the same time.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to TikTok for a statement and will update this article when we receive one. </p>
<p>There&apos;s a difference between a publisher and a distributor. If I write a post on X or make a video on TikTok encouraging illegal activity, X or TikTok are only publishing it. Once their algorithm picks it up and forces it upon others, they are distributing it.</p><p>You really can&apos;t have one without the other, but the third has decided 230 stating "<em>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider</em>" does not protect the publisher from the consequences of distributing the content.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.13%;"><img id="YexNcJtLbfnJHTy7FAwBM3" name="facebook-logo-pixel-2-2-6cia-6cia.jpg" alt="Facebook logo on phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YexNcJtLbfnJHTy7FAwBM3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="601" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Joe Maring / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t agree with the Third&apos;s reasoning here simply because it&apos;s distributed <em>as a result</em> of it being published. Then again, I have no say in the matter because I&apos;m just some dude, not a circuit court judge. It does point out that social media giants have to have some incentive to better police their content, or the law needs to be changed.</p><p>No, I&apos;m not calling for censorship. We should be able to say or do any dumb thing we want as long as we are willing to deal with the consequences. But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Metas</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">ByteDances</a> of the world don&apos;t have to like what we say or do and can yank it down any time they like as a consequence. </p><p>Without Section 230, they would do it a lot more often and that&apos;s not the right solution.</p>
<p>I have no idea how you fix things. I don&apos;t need to know how to fix it to know that they are broken. People collecting much larger salaries than me are responsible for that.</p><p>I know a 10-year-old child should not be enticed to asphyxiate herself because TikTok told her it was cool. I know nobody working for ByteDance wanted her to do it. I also know that no amount of parental control could prevent this from happening 100% of the time.</p><p>We need legislation like Section 230 to exist because there is no way to prevent terrible content from slipping through even the most draconian moderation. But it needs to be looked at again, and lawmakers need to figure it out. Now could be the right time to do it.</p>

<p>It&apos;s better to head out to the living room and play some games on my Steam Deck or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>, but I don&apos;t like to play active games right away. Instead, I&apos;d rather have a cup of tea and relax on the couch, which means the games I&apos;m playing are all pretty chill. While people often think of VR games as being more active—many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> are, after all—plenty of games are designed to be played seated or even at a table.</p><p>For this week&apos;s column, I&apos;ve collected my four favorite casual games I love to play in the morning. My main criteria was that they not only had to be casual—meaning I can put them down at any time without worry—but they also can&apos;t require the use of controllers. Hand tracking games only!</p><p>For maximum comfort, I use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOBOVR-M3-Pro-Accessories-Compatible/dp/B0CJLG9SBR">Bobo M3 Pro</a> headstrap in the morning and remove the facial interface for the Quest 3 entirely. That leaves things open so it&apos;s easier to drink my tea and play without worrying about sloshing it on my headset. Some of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> might also help, but I think it&apos;s best to keep things simple for the morning.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/wordomi/7368881886507513/">Wordomi</a> has been my new favorite morning game recently, combining everyone&apos;s favorite word game, Wordle, with a little bit of Scrabble or crossword-type puzzles thrown in.</p><p>Each level begins by giving you a handful of letters and a word to solve. Easier levels are usually just three letters to solve a three-letter word—so you can take some time to wake up without immediately feeling super challenged—while the harder levels will present you with more complex words and leftover letters, making you think a bit more.</p><p>As you progress, the game starts to take on a Scrabble flavor with words building off each other in different directions. Wordomi takes great advantage of mixed reality and the spatial nature of VR by letting you grab and move around the "board," or just getting up and walking around it if you so choose. You can even choose to play it on a table, with the word blocks falling and landing realistically on the table when you drop it.</p><p>Like Wordle, Wordomi&apos;s words are randomized rather than being set levels that you can eventually complete. This is a game designed to be played regularly and the structure fits that very well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9WsW8pPXCBLtGWaTPEyuBU" name="cubism-mixed-reality-meta-quest-3-screenshot.jpg" alt="Cubism mixed reality gameplay on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9WsW8pPXCBLtGWaTPEyuBU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Thomas Van Bouwel)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But if you&apos;re not a big fan of word games, I&apos;ve got two shape puzzles that you might enjoy more. First up is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/cubism/2264524423619421/">Cubism</a>, which made waves way back in March 2021 when it became one of the first hand tracking games on Quest.</p><p>Cubism is a clever, super casual play at your own pace puzzler that tasks you with building large shapes out of smaller ones. Each level gives you the outline of the large final shape, plus pieces that closely resemble Tetrominoes from the classic game Tetris. Unlike Tetris, however, you won&apos;t be sweating bullets to get shapes in by a certain time.</p><p>Not only is Cubism the perfect pace for an early morning game, but it also gives you the freedom of playing it on a table like Wordomi. Cubism actually pioneered this design, and it feels just as magical now as it did when it launched alongside the Meta Quest 3 a year ago.</p>

<p>And if you enjoy even more complex puzzle shapes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/puzzling-places/3931148300302917/">Puzzling Places</a> takes the concept of those expensive 3D puzzles and brings them into VR, complete with realistic rendering of 3D scanned buildings.</p><p>Puzzling Places lets you choose not only different real-life places and buildings to piece back together, but also gives you the option of changing the difficulty for each level to suit your tastes.</p><p>The game received a fantastic hand tracking <em>and</em> multiplayer update at the end of 2023, making it perfect for the category of casual morning games. If you&apos;re fortunate enough to have multiple Meta Quest 3 headsets (or a Meta Quest Pro) around the house, you can even join up with housemates and solve puzzles together!</p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking for something a little more visually involved but still casual at heart, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/little-cities/4988470131168299/">Little Cities</a> is the perfect way to wake up and get your brain going. It&apos;s a classic city-building simulator like Sim City, but with a far more relaxed tone. That means that while you&apos;ll manage important things like water, power, and even cell phone towers, most mechanics are far more simplified than in that classic city builder.</p><p>Hand tracking in Little Cities works like a dream, too. It&apos;s ultra simple to play without controllers thanks to the game&apos;s clever UI, which gives you a smartwatch to check all your stats with, plus handy floating bubbles that you&apos;ll pop to select each option.</p><p>While you&apos;re totally immersed in the world instead of playing in mixed reality, there&apos;s no reason to stand up and walk around thanks to an ingenious use of board game-like mechanics. Each city takes place in an island, and you&apos;ll grab the island and move it around to reach every area. You can even "pinch and zoom" by grabbing with both hands and moving them closer or farther apart.</p><p>Since Little Cities autosave constantly, you don&apos;t need to worry about when to stop playing. Just take the headset off and rest assured that you&apos;ll find yourself right where you left off. Plus, several different save slots, a full campaign, and even a sandbox mode ensure that there&apos;s plenty to do and lots of great ways to build the city of your dreams.</p><p>Waking up is more fun with VR, and since you don&apos;t need controllers, you can still get that morning induction of caffeine while chilling on the couch.</p>

<hr>
<p>Rumors have continued to mention a Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Slim," but recently those whispers swapped to a "Special Edition" and this leak might&apos;ve shown it off early.</p><p>An alleged photo of the device has surfaced courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/09/exclusive-first-look-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-design.html">Android Headlines</a> and the phone in question sports a few notable differences. The device is rumored to take its thickness down to 10.6mm when folded and roughly 4.9mm when unfolded. This is only moderately thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and its 12.1mm measurement when folded.</p><p>Additionally, the supposed photo suggests that the device will continue to sport that boxy look, but with slightly rounded corners for handheld comfortability.</p><p>The back of the device has streaks running vertically, potentially indicating a "brushed metal finish" as the publication notes. Moreover, rumors claim the device could have a thin layer of glass above that finish as extra protection.</p><p>Another difference on the rear panel is the triple camera island. On the standard Fold 6, this island is pill-shaped and conforms to the shape of the top and bottom lens (since it&apos;s rounded). This alleged Fold 6 "Special Edition" picture claims that Samsung is moving toward a rectangular shape for the array.</p><p>It also seems that the typical camera bump will exist on this next model. A small LED flash can be seen off to the right side of the array, as well.</p>

<p>Something to remember is that the Fold 6 "Slim" or "Special Edition" was rumored to feature a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-slim-titanium-panel-rumors">titanium rear panel</a>. It was stated that Samsung was "reviewing" the idea of implementing the material due to its lighter weight and heightened durability over standard options. This <em>could </em>still be the case. It&apos;s difficult to tell visually from the photo and without Samsung&apos;s official say-so.</p><p>For its cameras, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-clues-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-slims-launch-date-and-camera-upgrade-surface">rumors claim</a> the Korean OEM will upgrade the phone&apos;s UDC (Under Display Camera). The Fold 6 "Special Edition" could pick up a 5MP UDC, up from 4MP, to help with sharpness and detail. What&apos;s more, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/08/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-major-camera-boost.html">publication notes</a> that the phone could include a 200MP primary sensor on the back.</p><p>With how speculation is shaping up, it feels like the Fold 6 Special Edition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-rumored-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-special-edition-might-not-be-all-that-special">won&apos;t be all that special</a>. The marginally slimmer estimations on the device&apos;s thickness (which today&apos;s rumor doubles down on) might not entice consumers as much. However, one shining rumor is the upgraded camera system, which Samsung might finally do for this "Special Edition."</p><p>Regardless, this next Fold 6 variant is rumored to arrive in South Korea on September 25 and could cost a whopping 2.8 million won (~$2,100).</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google now offers Pixel 9 series repair manuals for download from a support website.</li><li>The manuals aren't concise, being hundreds of pages in length, but they are clear and readable even to people without prior repair knowledge.</li><li>Google executives have said in the past that they want everyone to be able to repair their phones, and quality manuals and guides are key to that future. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is heavily involved in the right-to-repair movement, partnering with iFixit and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-publicly-endorses-oregon-right-to-repair-bill">backing legislation</a> in recent years. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-ifixit-breakup-highlights-google-efforts">Samsung&apos;s deal with iFixit fell apart</a>, Google&apos;s partnership is thriving. Some disagree on the means and methods that Google uses to design its phones and achieve greater repairability. However, now that the company has shared its Google Pixel 9 series repair manuals, it&apos;s clear that Google is at least doing one thing right. </p><p>Its guides are publicly available, easy to read and understand, and might just empower users to learn more about their devices. Google has publicly stated its goals for Pixel repairability, but unlike a few other manufacturers, the company actually backs it up with right-to-repair initiatives. </p><p>Earlier this year, an episode of the Made by Google podcast <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-wants-to-design-pixel-phones-to-be-repairable-without-special-tools">featured an interview with Steven Nickel</a>, who runs consumer hardware operations at Google. Nickel&apos;s role includes making sure Pixels are designed with repairability at the forefront. In the interview, Nickel said that Google "want[s] everyone to be able to do repairs." That future may be far out, but there are things Google can do today to bring the Pixel repair experience closer to that dream.</p><p>"We want to get to a point where you can reach into a kitchen drawer and be able to replace your screen," Nickel added.</p><p>As it stands currently, the average person can&apos;t take apart and repair their smartphone at home, for many reasons. There are technical concerns, sure, but part of the issue is that manufacturers have spent years fear-mongering about everything that can go wrong when self-servicing your tech products. In the past, companies like Apple and others have warned about the dangers of replacing your battery, which should be one of the simplest and most-common repairs. </p><p>Of course, lithium-ion batteries can be dangerous if mishandled, but the same goes for many other things we interact with on a daily basis. For example, working on your car can be dangerous for the inexperienced, but that doesn&apos;t stop people from doing so while being cautious and willing to learn. So, empowering users and giving them the knowledge to work on their phones is half the battle for the right-to-repair movement. </p><p>There&apos;s no doubt that there are technical issues that need to be addressed before the average person can fix their phones and devices at home. Google still has work to do there, but it&apos;s dominating the other half of the battle, which is empowering users with knowledge. It first started issuing English repair manuals in December of last year, and last week, Google released the repair guides for all four <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> series devices. </p>
<h2 id="repair-guides-you-apos-ll-actually-understand-2">Repair guides you&apos;ll actually understand</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fMUduBYuxw5pVEKDtsYBkW" name="Pixel-9-Official-Repair-Guide-Google.jpg" alt="A Pixel 9 repair guide from Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMUduBYuxw5pVEKDtsYBkW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think it&apos;s fair to say that consumer repair guides released by major tech companies have been a form of "malicious compliance" in the past. In other words, even the manufacturers that released repair guides wrote them for experienced repair professionals rather than average consumers. If you tried to look at one of Apple&apos;s repair guides with no prior knowledge or experience with smartphone repair, you&apos;d probably end up so confused that you&apos;d never try to repair your own stuff again. </p><p>I&apos;m a bit biased as a tech reporter, but to me, Google&apos;s Pixel 9 series repair guides are some of the easiest to decipher of the consumer tech repair guides out there. In the image above, taken from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14725410#zippy=%2Cenglish-manuals" target="_blank">Pixel 9 repair guide</a>, you can see a detailed and colorful expanded view of the Google Pixel 9. Each part is identified and labeled, so you know exactly where everything is located. The following page details the locations of every screw inside the Pixel 9, its size, and whether it&apos;s hidden or visible.</p><p>This might sound like a stretch, but I&apos;ve read Ikea assembly instructions that were way more confusing than this Pixel 9 repair guide. It&apos;s thorough and accessible, which are two words I never thought I&apos;d use to describe a repair manual officially-released by a big tech company. Even if you aren&apos;t ready to fix your own devices at home, simply reading through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> series manuals will teach you a lot about the devices you use. </p><p>Big tech corporations have created a stigma around independent and at-home repair, causing notions that it&apos;s dangerous or unreliable. In order for the right-to-repair movement to thrive, that stigma needs to be reversed. To me, the first step is education. Users need to learn more about their devices, how they work, and how they break and are ultimately fixed. After combing through the Pixel 9 repair manuals, no major company is doing a better job at educating their users than Google. </p>
