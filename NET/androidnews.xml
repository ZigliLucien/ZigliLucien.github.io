                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio releases a lot of gear over the course of the year, and when the brand announced that it was coming out with the Q15, I thought it would be a higher-end model of the Q7. But the Bluetooth DAC costs half as much as the Q7, while retaining a similar design — albeit in a smaller size — and a lot of similar features.</p><p>If that sounds familiar, it&apos;s because Fiio has made a habit out of doing this. The K9 DAC also goes the same route, offering the same design and a ton of the same features as the flagship K9 Pro, but for a lot less. Clearly, Fiio is looking to flesh out its DAC portfolio and list products in all price segments, and in that context, the Q15 makes a lot of sense.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2ReuhYf2Qnf3EMSVCZF6KQ" name="fiio-q15-2.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ReuhYf2Qnf3EMSVCZF6KQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Q15 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Headphone-Amplifier-Bluetooth-LDAC%EF%BC%8C1600mW/dp/B0CMWBZK8J">retailing at $399 on Amazon</a>, and that is less than half of what the Q7 costs. When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-q7-review">reviewed the Q7</a>, I called it an endgame DAC that had everything you could want in a portable DAC. Fiio hasn&apos;t changed too many things with the Q15; in fact, the biggest omission is the lack of a 6.35mm port — the DAC just isn&apos;t big enough to accommodate the jack. Otherwise, the Q15 is able to deliver 1.6W of power, uses AKM hardware, and has all the AptX codecs you need.</p>

<p>Other than that, it retains a similar design as the Q7, and you get a bold aesthetic with jagged edges that looks striking. What&apos;s great is that you now get a titanium color option, so if you don&apos;t like the look of the standard black model, the titanium variant looks much more pleasing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JFSB78P785KnGNo7Yia9PT" name="fiio-q15-20.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JFSB78P785KnGNo7Yia9PT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming in at 305g, the Q15 is less than half the weight of the Q7, and that makes it a great choice if you need a portable DAC. The biggest design difference is at the back, where Fiio switched out the leather back of the Q7 with a frosted glass back that feels great to hold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rwnJXEakLEbg7aayxsKdUQ" name="fiio-q15-3.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rwnJXEakLEbg7aayxsKdUQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The front has a glossy insert that takes up a considerable amount of the real estate, and the 1.3-inch TFT panel is housed within the island. Fiio is reusing the same panel as the Q7, and it has the same size and resolution of 240 x 240. The panel lets you change modes — you get USB, coaxial, and Bluetooth — and you can access the settings with a long press of the volume knob, giving you access to gain, max volume, filters, and EQ. You get the same Hi-Res labels as the Q7, but there&apos;s no THX branding.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fAnWUzQxuWetouS5wmPBtR" name="fiio-q15-13.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fAnWUzQxuWetouS5wmPBtR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The menu interface is basic, but it gives you easy access to all the features of the DAC without having to pull up Fiio&apos;s Control mobile app. This is a small tweak, but I like that the settings menu now has a back button that lets you go back to the source page.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9ZqmQ7q5ScTrCpczVCTijR" name="fiio-q15-12.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZqmQ7q5ScTrCpczVCTijR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio includes a carrying pouch with the Q15, but I would have liked to see a case similar to that of the Q7. But given the positioning of the Q15, you don&apos;t get one in the box. Other than the case, you get two USB-C to USB-C cables, a USB-A dongle, and two silicone bands that let you attach the Q15 to a phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jcNvte36Z6KuSgcBqMdTAR" name="fiio-q15-8.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jcNvte36Z6KuSgcBqMdTAR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The build quality of the Q15 is phenomenal; the DAC has an all-metal chassis that uses aluminum, and in the three months I had the unit, I didn&apos;t see any issues whatsoever. I like the texture volume knob too, as it makes changing the volume easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3PTN7NNqNKrT2csiqV87cQ" name="fiio-q15-4.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3PTN7NNqNKrT2csiqV87cQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Q15 has a 3.5mm single-ended port and a balanced 4.4mm port that are located on either side of the large volume knob, and as is usually the case with most Fiio products, there&apos;s an LED ring that encircles the volume knob. The Q7 gets 2.5mm and 6.35mm connectors as well, but considering the use case of the Q15, a single-ended and balanced connector are more than adequate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YPwUkyiTcr9xvnhXxxHjsQ" name="fiio-q15-5.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPwUkyiTcr9xvnhXxxHjsQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar to the Q7, you get control buttons on the Q15, but they&apos;re now located on the left; there&apos;s a power button, and three buttons to control music playback. At the bottom is where you see the various ports; the Q15 has coaxial and USB connectors, and there&apos;s a second USB-C port that can be used to charge the DAC. By contrast, the Q7 has a single USB-C port to connect and charge the DAC, and it has an optical port in addition to coaxial.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YBxVGSiwbh8sVWmPEv4UbR" name="fiio-q15-11.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YBxVGSiwbh8sVWmPEv4UbR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But what&apos;s great is that you can switch between modes easily via toggles located at the bottom. You can use the Q15 in desktop mode, and it doesn&apos;t use the built-in battery in this mode. There&apos;s a phone mode as well, and in this mode, the Q15 uses its built-in battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9SvCe82P5nZ9HNsqmKEabS" name="fiio-q15-22.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9SvCe82P5nZ9HNsqmKEabS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that subject, the Q15 has a 5500mAh battery that delivers just over nine hours of music playback over the balanced 4.4mm port, and eight hours on the 3.5mm jack. It takes over three and a half hours to charge the DAC, so it isn&apos;t something you&apos;ll want to do during the day. It goes up to 15W when using a USB PD charger, and I left the unit charging overnight most of the time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3vJgVPs3r8SwXdxVo3ZjtS" name="fiio-q15-21.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vJgVPs3r8SwXdxVo3ZjtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given that the Q7 has one of the best sound signatures of any portable DAC, the Q15 has a lot to offer in this area, and it is off to a promising start. The DAC uses a combination of AKM&apos;s AK4191EQ and AK4499EX, and they&apos;re joined by the Qualcomm QCC5125, which oversees the Bluetooth side of things.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kpDsVGhRV3NQPnxCAKqVAS" name="fiio-q15-14.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kpDsVGhRV3NQPnxCAKqVAS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Q15 includes all the AptX codecs — AptX, AptX HD, AptX LL, and AptX Adaptive — in addition to LDAC, and in USB mode, it is able to go up to 768kHz/32-bit over PCM and DSD512. If you use the coaxial connector, it goes up to 192kHz/24-bit and DSD64.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BR76E9unCSjpSFDLdMBeJS" name="fiio-q15-16.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BR76E9unCSjpSFDLdMBeJS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s the power on offer that makes the Q15 such a great choice; the DAC is able to deliver 1600mW of power, and that allows it to drive any IEM and headset in the market today. I used it with the Audeze LCD-GX, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">Fiio FT5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft3-review">FT3</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fx15-review">FX15</a>, and about a dozen IEMs over the course of the last three months, and didn&apos;t run into any issues.</p>
<p>Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity makes the Q15 about as easy to use as possible with a phone, and with most Android devices offering LDAC natively — Google baked it into Android several years ago — you will get 96kHz/32-bit playback over Bluetooth without any hassle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Sit6RZBrH4quMKrHY7W7mS" name="fiio-q15-19.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sit6RZBrH4quMKrHY7W7mS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the Q15 doesn&apos;t have any audible hiss, so even sensitive IEMs are a good pairing with the DAC. Like other Fiio DACs, the Q15 has a neutral sound that doesn&apos;t add any coloration. That said, going with AKM over the usual ESS Sabre models means you get a slightly different sound profile, with increased vibrancy in the low-end.</p><p>The bass is wonderfully detailed and textured when using the FT5, and there is a slight exuberance in the sub-bass region that makes using the Q15 that much more enjoyable. The mids are natural and have plenty of character, and the treble has good extension. The imaging and dynamics are excellent, and the Q15 is the latest in a long list of Fiio DACs that absolutely nails the technical details.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="89nrdcJKstKmAegLhqth4T" name="fiio-q15-23.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/89nrdcJKstKmAegLhqth4T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just like the K9, the Q15 is a value leader. Yes, the Q7 has better tonality and does a better job driving endgame headsets, but if you just need a Bluetooth DAC to use with IEMs and most headsets under $1,000, it does an incredible job. The feature-set is nearly identical to what you&apos;re getting on the Q7, and the affordability makes the Q15 a no-brainer.</p>

<p>When a total solar eclipse happens, the moon slides right between Earth and the sun. This means the moon will completely block the sun for a few minutes, turning daytime into twilight (how long depends on your viewing spot).</p><p>This eclipse is set to be a blockbuster, with tens of millions of people residing along the path of totality. This path stretches across Northern America, spanning 115 miles wide, where the moon will pull off the ultimate cover-up, blocking out 100% of the sun&apos;s disk.</p><p>If you&apos;re lucky enough to be there, you won&apos;t want to miss it. And while at that, there are a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/watch-the-eclipse-through-your-smartphone-with-these-cheap-solar-glasses">few cheap solar glasses with which you can watch the eclipse</a>.</p><p>As per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/the-sun/2024-solar-eclipse-map-where-to-see-the-eclipse-on-april-8" target="_blank">Live Science</a>, this cosmic journey kicks off in Sinaloa, Mexico, and then heads northeast, trekking through Texas before cruising through 15 states. Finally, it bids farewell to the U.S. as it heads north into Canada.</p><p>The states along the way where you&apos;ll catch totality are: Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.</p><p>That said, Tennessee and Michigan will only get a quick peek at the moon&apos;s shadow passing by.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.greatamericaneclipse.com/visitation" target="_blank">Great American Eclipse website</a>, around 1 to 4 million Americans are expected to travel for this stellar event.

<hr>
<p>Meta is asking for a U.S. antitrust lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to be thrown out due to a lack of evidence, according to a motion for summary judgment filed Friday, April 5. The case centers around whether Meta exerts monopolistic power in the social media industry due to its ownership of Facebook, Instagram, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>. If successful, Meta would be forced to divest (in other words, sell) WhatsApp and Instagram, effectively reversing the acquisitions. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ftc-lawsuit-could-force-facebook-give-instagram-and-whatsapp">original complaint</a> was filed by the FTC in 2020, but it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/facebook-antitrust-cases-dismissed">dismissed</a> due to insufficient evidence. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ftc-files-amended-complaint-against-facebook">revised complaint was submitted in 2021</a>, and the legal battle has ensued to date. Meta is now asking for the case to be dismissed again for the same reason, hoping to avoid a trial. </p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/meta-files-motion-for-summary-judgment-in-ftc-lawsuit-relating-to-instagram-and-whatsapp/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, the company explained its reasoning for the motion to dismiss. "We&apos;ve asked the court to dismiss the case because the FTC has failed to provide evidence to support its claims," said Jennifer Newstead, Meta&apos;s chief legal officer. "The evidence instead shows that we face fierce competition from a range of platforms and that our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp have benefited consumers."</p><p>The FTC is joined by the attorneys general of 48 U.S. states, who together claim that the purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 were anti-competitive. The same agency approved both acquisitions before they were completed and is now trying to reverse that decision. </p><p>"The decision to revisit done deals is tantamount to announcing that no sale will ever be final," adds Newstead, who goes on to say that this lawsuit "will also make companies think twice about investing in innovation, since they may be punished if that innovation leads to success."</p><p>The official complaint calls into question the FTC&apos;s antitrust market, which is described as "personal social networking services," or PSNS. The FTC claims that this market exists, but it includes only four apps: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and MeWe. Meta disputes this notion by saying that consumers turn to services such as TikTok, YouTube, X (formerly Twitter), and LinkedIn for many of the same offerings that Meta apps provide. </p><p>Meta also rejects the claim that it has monopoly power, in part because it does not see the FTC&apos;s antitrust market as valid. Additionally, it believes the company cannot be considered a monopoly because it has "never charged a price and never restricted output."</p><p>"From the very beginning, the FTC has failed to state a plausible claim, and the agency has done nothing to build its case through the discovery process to prove otherwise," said Newstead.</p><p>Now, the FTC can make its case for why the lawsuit should continue. After deliberation, the court can either rule in Meta&apos;s favor and toss out the complaint, or continue toward a trial. </p>

Something new that watch users can look out for is the vibration feature, and as the name suggests, users will notice the current time play in haptics whenever a user chooses to use gestures on the watch face.</p><p>Additionally, it also got improvements in auto brightness functionality, allowing "users to perceive the difference when switching levels easily." Another feature to look out for is the new progress bar for app downloads/ updates done via Google Play Store, which isn&apos;t officially included, but it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-could-gain-a-new-app-download-indicator">spotted</a> by some Pixel watch users recently. </p><p>Meanwhile, Pixel phone users also get their own set of updates at the same time. The update includes 28 general security patches for Android and another 25 that are exclusively for Pixel devices. </p><p>You can check if your Pixel phone has the April 2024 update by navigating to <strong>Settings > System > Software update</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-price-increase-new-plans-claims"><strong>here</strong></a>. </p><p>Spotify subscribers might be in for a pinch of another couple of dollars, according to a new report that was released this week. The Bloomberg report claims that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming service</a> might be raising the price for its &apos;basic&apos; plan by a dollar and its duo plan by $2 in certain markets worldwide. This means that subscribers in the UK, Australia, and Pakistan will see these increases take effect by the end of April. The U.S. is also expected to see this price hike later this year. Spotify is also looking into adding more subscription plans for consumers to drive revenue. </p><p>Speculations around Spotify working on a new "basic" tier with music and podcasts, and without audiobooks, have also been making the rounds. This plan may cost $11, the same as the premium plan for a solo user.</p><p>A new "Supremium" plan was briefly mentioned in the report that allows users to stream HiFi audio for a steeper price.</p>

However, things didn&apos;t go as planned for folks with the S23 series. Many faced charging issues, fingerprint scanner glitches, touchscreen woes, and biometric sensor issues.</p><p>Users took <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1bql7sw/fingerprint_issue_after_one_ui_61_update/">to Reddit</a> to report problems with the biometrics (fingerprint), stating that their "fingerprint sensor randomly doesn&apos;t register my input" when attempting to unlock their device.</p><p>The touchscreen issue was seen on specific models like the Galaxy S23, Galaxy S23 Plus, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>.

But for now, it&apos;s best if S23 users might want to steer clear of the One UI 6.1 update if it can be helped.</p>

However, Google may have made cross-checking this a bit easier. </p><p>April 2 is seen as International Fact-Checking Day, and Google is expanding the reach of some of its most useful tools in Google Search for verifying facts, images, and sources. In addition, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-fact-checking-resources/">announced</a> that its Fact Check Explorer is exiting beta and will be available to all.</p><p>Two familiar Google search features, About this image and About this page, are now available in 40 more languages globally. When it comes to About this image, when you open an image&apos;s detail menu in Search and tap the About this image option, you&apos;ll be able to learn more about an image and where it came from.</p><p>Specifically, Google says that About this image can list the following types of information about an image in Search: the history of an image, how the image is used and described by other sites, and the metadata associated with an image. This could reveal whether an image was AI-generated or came from an untrustworthy source.</p><p>Similarly, <strong>About this page</strong> and <strong>About this result </strong>will display more information about a website before you decide to click on a Google Search result. This could reveal whether the site is trustworthy, if it is believed to be biased in some way, and who owns it.</p>

<ul><li>Google Pixel 8a was spotted in an advertisement ahead of its expected launch.</li><li>The device can be seen in two colorways with a matte finish frame.</li><li>The Pixel 8a is expected to launch at Google I/O 2024 on May 14 with a Tensor G3 chipset.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Pixel 8a is Google&apos;s next highly anticipated product launch, and it&apos;s expected to appear at Google I/O in May. However, a recent Google Fi ad appears to give us an official look at the Pixel 8a in two different colorways.</p><p>As seen on YouTube and reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/is_the_google_pixel_8a_hiding_in_plain_sight-news-62309.php">GSMArena</a>, the ad showed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> in what appears to be Porcelain and Bay color variants, similar options to what we&apos;ve seen on the current Pixel 8 devices.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/thpjxUZol1o" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>While the ad doesn&apos;t specifically say that the showcased phones are the Pixel 8a devices, the curved corners, and thinner camera visor seem to match what we&apos;ve seen in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-leaked-renders">previous renders</a> of the device, which are quite different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>. GSMArena also points to the rear mic placement, which seems to differ from other Pixel models and is not visible on the camera visor, as seen in earlier renders.</p><p>While it&apos;s possible the rear phone could be the Pixel 8 Pro, the Pixel 8a renders seems to show a matte frame, whereas the Pixel 8 Pro comes with a glossy finish. The signs seem to point to this being the Pixel 8a, especially since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-pixel-8-should-you-buy">Pixel 8 is not available in blue</a> (it&apos;s exclusive to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>), although for now, you should take this with a grain of salt until the official launch.</p>
<p>Overall, the upcoming Pixel 8a is expected to be pricier than its predecessor. Underneath, the Tensor G3 chip will likely power it, and some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-rumored-to-have-a-bigger-battery">recent certifications</a> have assured that the Pixel 8a would sport a bigger battery as well.</p><p>The Google I/O is slated for May 14, 2024, when we might get our first official look at the Pixel 8a alongside other devices.</p>

It&apos;s a pretty big deal if you&apos;re in North America, and it should be a spectacular show in much of the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>This one won&apos;t be right over my house like the eclipse from 2017 was, but it will be close enough that I want to make sure I&apos;m prepared to get at least one really good photograph of it. In 2017, phone cameras kind of sucked, and most of my pics from back then are pretty trash. In 2024, I can do better. We all can do better!</p>

<p>The hardest part of getting good eclipse photos is making sure you&apos;re in the right place at the right time. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eclipse-explorer.smce.nasa.gov/">NASA has a great interactive map</a> showing where and when, and if you live in or around places like Dallas, Memphis, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Toronto, or Montreal, you&apos;re in for a treat. If you live on the West Coast or southeast U.S., you probably won&apos;t see anything worth taking a photo of.</p><p>You can&apos;t just run outside, point your phone (or your eyes) at the sun, and start taking pictures. that&apos;s a good way to hurt your eyes and maybe even burn your phone camera&apos;s sensor. Fortunately, the gear you need is cheap. More importantly, the way to do it is super simple.</p>

<p>The internet is full of great advice about taking pictures of the eclipse. <em>Really</em> full. That&apos;s great and highlights what a cool resource the internet can be, but it can be a little overwhelming.</p><p>If you want to know how it works or techniques for professional photographs, Google everything you can. Some of the articles out there are full of awesome stuff, and I&apos;ve enjoyed reading through them. Even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/photograph-solar-eclipse-google-pixel/">Google is talking about</a> ways to get a great image from your Pixel phone.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s get simple though. You need four things before you can take good photos of an eclipse: </p>
<ul><li><strong>Your phone:</strong> You're going to get better results from a phone geared towards photography like a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> or a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, but the phone you have in your hand will work. I'm not saying you should rush out to buy a new phone, just know budget phones aren't going to take photos like the ones you'll find on Instagram the day after.</li><li><strong>A tripod</strong>. If you want to go that route, you can get a good cheap phone tripod on Amazon in time for the eclipse. I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aureday-Wireless-Extendable-Recording-Streaming/dp/B0C1MC68M7">this one</a>, and I like it. You can also fashion a tripod using a phone mount and something sturdy. Find a way to hold your phone steady while it's pointed at the sky.</li><li><strong>A lens filter</strong>. Some say you can't damage a phone camera by pointing it at the sun. Some people say you will. I can tell you that the phone cameras of 2017 can be damaged by taking pictures of the sun because it happened to me using an HTC U11. I suggest you play it safe and buy a specially designed-filter <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smartphone-Solar-Imaging-Enhancing-Photo/dp/B0CFBX3KNN/ref=sr_1_1">like this one</a>. It also makes getting pictures easier because you can see what you're doing through the screen. <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/watch-the-eclipse-through-your-smartphone-with-these-cheap-solar-glasses"><strong>NEVER LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN WITHOUT EYE PROTECTION</strong></a>.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1324px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="Q24NMymgNm8QGfBcmTuLpU" name="perfect-eclipse.png" alt="Don't look at the sun" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q24NMymgNm8QGfBcmTuLpU.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1324" height="744" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Getty)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, you need to know how to use the manual settings on your phone&apos;s camera. Take the time to learn how to do two things: turn off the flash and adjust the brightness. If you can, turn off things like "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ultra-hdr-explained">Ultra HDR</a>" if your phone has them. Phone camera AI can and will ruin your eclipse shots if you let it.</p><p>With this gear at the ready and knowing how to adjust a few camera settings, taking the picture is easy. Find a good spot to keep your tripod or homemade rig steady and get set up. Remember, it will be dark for a few minutes, so be careful not to trip or knock anything over.</p><p>Now, get ready to take some photos of the eclipse:</p>
<ul><li>Get your phone on the tripod and make sure you have a good view of the sky.</li><li>Attach the phone camera filter according to the directions that came with it. Masking tape might be your best friend here.</li><li>Don't use digital camera zoom. If your phone has a zoom or telephoto lens, use it. Pinching all the way in is a good way to get a grainy photo. Remember, it will be mostly dark, and you won't be using the flash.</li><li>Find the sun before the eclipse starts and focus on it. </li><li>Use the manual settings to lower the brightness until you see a crisp outline of the sun on a very dark background.</li><li>When the eclipse starts, try not to move things too much when you tap to take the photo. If you do, take a second or two and set it up again. You can also use a remote shutter for your phone's camera <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Upgraded-Bluetooth-Shutter-Android-Wireless/dp/B084VTFS4X/ref=sr_1_1">like this one</a> instead of touching the screen to take a picture.</li><li>Take <em>a lot</em> of pictures.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Y9GKfDhUB9jZ8YhHiqbHHB" name="Photoshop.jpg" alt="Adobe Photoshop logo on a PC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y9GKfDhUB9jZ8YhHiqbHHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a couple of things you should do after the eclipse. Sort through all of your pictures on the best screen you can find, keeping every one that looks OK. These are the pictures you want to run through editing software. </p><p>You can find plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-photography-apps-android">photo editing software</a> for your phone, and some of the available apps work really well. Alternatively, you can transfer the pictures to another computer and edit them. Just be prepared to adjust the sharpening and exposure to make your good photos great.</p>
<p>You should back them up, too. If you have your own backup solution with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">NAS in your house</a>, use it. Use online backup, too; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> is great (and comes with a pretty good built-in editor), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-photos-best-photo-storage-service-youre-not-using">Amazon Photos</a> is good, too. Make sure to keep them somewhere besides on your phone.</p><p>Finally, remember to share them. You think pictures of the eclipse are cool, which is why you took them. Plenty of folks feel the same (guilty), and we want to see your pictures!</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio started focusing on the high-end segment two years ago, and that led to a deluge of premium products, including DACs, IEMs that used a combination of three different driver units, and network streamers. While these products were aimed at the high-end segment, they still delivered a great feature-set, and undercut their rivals by a considerable margin.</p><p>Nothing illustrates this as much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k9-pro-ess-review">K9 Pro DAC</a>; Fiio did all the right things with the product, and having used it for over a year and a half, I&apos;m convinced that there isn&apos;t anything better at this price point. The only downside is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Amplifier-Headphone-Bluetooth-Resolution/dp/B09PDM588T">K9 Pro still costs $849</a>, making it inaccessible to a mainstream audience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vAPe5yF5vG3j4vi3kkmbo" name="fiio-k9-2.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vAPe5yF5vG3j4vi3kkmbo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s where the K9 comes into the equation. Fiio rolled out the K9 last year, and at the outset, there really isn&apos;t much of a difference between the standard model and the K9 Pro; both use similar ESS DACs, THX amps, Bluetooth connectivity with the same set of codecs, and an identical design. The difference is that the K9 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-K9-Headphone-Amplifier-Bluetooth/dp/B0C13XK1WC">available for $499</a>, just over half the asking price of the K9 Pro.</p>

<p>Obviously, Fiio designed the K9 to slot into the mid-range segment, filling the void between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k7-review">$200 K7</a> and $849 K9 Pro. But by retaining the same design and a lot of the same features as the costlier K9 Pro, Fiio is running the risk of cannibalizing its high-end product, because after using the K9 for six months, I don&apos;t really see the need for buying the K9 Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EwMJP2JMW7ot4ELoM54Qi5" name="fiio-k9-19.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EwMJP2JMW7ot4ELoM54Qi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting with the design, the K9 uses the same chassis as the K9 Pro, and this is something Fiio is prone to doing. It did the same with the K7, which retained the chassis of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k5-pro-review">K5 Pro</a>, and at the time, the brand noted it was to save manufacturing costs and make it easier to get the product out the door.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RdAnzMLWZFZfhwqkDzzaD4" name="fiio-k9-10.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RdAnzMLWZFZfhwqkDzzaD4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Clearly, the brand is using the same strategy here, and the K9 is nearly identical to the K9 Pro. The only difference is the lack of the Pro branding at the front of the unit, and the volume dial that dominates the front fascia doesn&apos;t have gold accents. That said, the labels underneath all the connectors and button are now in white and have better contrast, and they&apos;re significantly easier to read. This continues to be an issue on the K9 Pro, with the grey labels merging with the black chassis, making it hard to make out any of the markings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HmhQqxwRD5wMp6xV9oCPt4" name="fiio-k9-14.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmhQqxwRD5wMp6xV9oCPt4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The K9 has the same connectors up front, so you get a balanced 4.4mm port, 4-pin XLR that has a dust cover, and a single-ended 6.35mm connector. The status LED highlights the mode in use, and you can use USB, optical, coaxial, line in, and Bluetooth. At the bottom, you get the power button, gain toggle — high, medium, and low — along with an input selector, and output toggle that lets you use the K9 as a dedicated DAC, headphone out, or in a configuration that sees it acting as a preamp.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pUm4NyPBEs8oybnCMiDvP4" name="fiio-k9-11.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pUm4NyPBEs8oybnCMiDvP4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given that the K9 uses the same black chassis as the Pro model, it doesn&apos;t really draw much attention to itself. Both sides of the unit have a vented design to deliver passive airflow, and this is needed because there&apos;s no active cooling. You get the same THX branding at the top, but it isn&apos;t embossed, and the new Fiio logo is etched above.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uTfQ6KfUcDufdbiKqkYA54" name="fiio-k9-9.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uTfQ6KfUcDufdbiKqkYA54.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s at the back where things get interesting, with the K9 offering the same set of connectivity options as the K9 Pro. You get an antenna to deliver a stable Bluetooth signal, and there are USB-B, coaxial, and optical inputs along with a 4.4mm balanced and the traditional RCA. You also get RCA and 3-pin XLR out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rTdX67VUnFVRQi7JBBu3h3" name="fiio-k9-7.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rTdX67VUnFVRQi7JBBu3h3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only thing missing on the K9 is USB-C connectivity, and MQA rendering. While I would have liked to see USB-C, it isn&apos;t a big deal, and honestly, you get a ton of other ports on the DAC. MQA is used mostly by Tidal, and as the standard itself is out of favor, its omission doesn&apos;t actually mean anything.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="w5mmjnZRHbEfydaJg626u3" name="fiio-k9-8.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w5mmjnZRHbEfydaJg626u3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like about the K9 retaining the same design is that it can be mounted in a horizontal or vertical orientation, and you get a stand in the package that lets you mount it vertically. Coming in at 5.7lb (2.6kg), it is just as heavy as the K9 Pro, and it isn&apos;t designed with portability. The package contains a USB cable, 3.5mm to 6.35mm connector, and an additional fuse.</p>

<p>The FiiO Control app continues to be great, and it gives you exhaustive control over just about every area of the K9. You can see the active mode, select Bluetooth audio codecs, adjust the lighting around the volume knob, set EQ, and adjust the channel balance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CypFupoPDJPXpfXVXJPNP5" name="fiio-k9-17.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CypFupoPDJPXpfXVXJPNP5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the audio side of things, the K9 uses two 32-bit ESS Sabre ES9068AS DACs. The 2-channel DAC sits one tier below the ES9038 Pro that&apos;s featured in the K9 Pro, but you don&apos;t really notice much in the way of difference between the two in daily use. You once again get two THX AAA 788+ amps, and the K9 utilizes the same Qualcomm QCC5124 Bluetooth modem as its costlier sibling to deliver Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SLLfw35kPvtLKSNmHbwkt5" name="fiio-k9-21.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SLLfw35kPvtLKSNmHbwkt5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Talking about Bluetooth, you get all the audio codecs you&apos;ll ever need: AptX, AptX LL, AptX HD, AptX Adaptive, and LDAC. The LED light on the volume knob changes based on the codec in use, and it is a good visual indicator.</p><p>When used in USB mode, the K9 is able to go up to 768kHz/32-bit over PCM and DSD512. That goes down to 192kHz/24-bit over coaxial, and 96kHz/24-bit via optical. The K9 is an all-in-one device, and it has plenty of power to drive just about any audio device, including the most demanding planar headsets. Conversely, it is able to power sensitive IEMs without any issues whatsoever — all you&apos;ll need to do is set the gain to low.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qAc26umtnc69d3QoSX5LD5" name="fiio-k9-16.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qAc26umtnc69d3QoSX5LD5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The K9 is able to deliver up to 1W of power at 16Ω, 1.5W at 32Ω, and 200mW at 300Ω over the 6.35mm port. Switching to the balanced 4.4mm and XLR ports, you get 1W of power at 16Ω, 2W at 32Ω, and 780mW at 300Ω. I tested the K9 with plenty of headsets, including the outstanding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">Audeze MM-500</a>, Audeze LCD-GX, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft3-review">Fiio&apos;s FT3</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">FT5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fx15-review">FX15</a>, and Dan Clark Audio&apos;s Aeon X. The DAC did an outstanding job with every device, and as I said at the start, I don&apos;t see the need to justify paying a premium for the K9 Pro any longer.</p>
<p>Fiio DACs usually deliver a clean sound without any coloration, and the K9 is no different. Like all great DACs, it just gets out of the way, and allows audio devices to shine; using the MM-500 with the K9 was just as enjoyable as with the K9 Pro. Yes, the K9 Pro delivers a better low-end when testing with the same headsets, and it has cleaner mid-range and elevated highs. That said, the differences are barely noticeable, and in all honesty, the K9 does just as good a job in daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EwMJP2JMW7ot4ELoM54Qi5" name="fiio-k9-19.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EwMJP2JMW7ot4ELoM54Qi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the K9 stands out is by pitting it against the K7; in this situation, the differences are easily noticeable. The K9 delivers a much better soundstage and dynamics, and you can immediately notice the difference in tonality between the two DACs — the K9 is just able to deliver a vibrant sound that you don&apos;t get with the K7.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the K9 offers the best value in Fiio&apos;s extensive DAC catalog. It has most of the features that made the K9 Pro an outstanding choice, and the best part is that it costs just $499. That&apos;s quite the bargain considering just what you&apos;re getting with this DAC.</p>

<ul><li>Sunbird, the messaging app that aimed to bring iMessage to Android users, announced Friday that it is relaunching in beta.</li><li>The original app quickly shut down after users exposed critical security and privacy flaws that left user messages susceptible to being intercepted.</li><li>The company added a page to its website detailing what went wrong the first time around and what has been changed since.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Sunbird, the messaging app that infamously partnered with Nothing to bring iMessage to Android <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/sunbird-pulls-app-from-playstore">before being swiftly shut down</a>, is now returning. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sunbird-messaging-announces-beta-app-relaunch-enhancing-connectivity-and-security-302109405.html" target="_blank">announced</a> Friday, April 5, that it would relaunch the beta version of its app after making changes to its backend infrastructure. Sunbird says that over 165,000 users have registered for the app&apos;s waitlist and that invitations will become available in small phases.</p><p>The first time around, Sunbird brought iMessage to Android through its own app and the Nothing Chats app. Nothing, the Android phone manufacturer behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a>, wanted to make all of its devices compatible with iMessage through Nothing Chats. However, users quickly discovered that the messages and internal processes were unencrypted, leaving user messages and shared files available for anyone to access. </p><p>Sunbird explained the technical changes to its iMessage architecture, intended to increase security and fix the original app&apos;s privacy woes, on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sunbirdapp.com/update-security-incident-remediation-and-sunbird-re-launch" target="_blank">website</a>. If you&apos;re curious or skeptical, here they are: </p>
<ul><li>Unencrypted messages are never stored anywhere on disk or in a database. When messages are decrypted to be passed to the iMessage and RCS/Google Messages network, they exist in that state only within memory for a limited period of time. In the front-end app, messages are only stored in an encrypted state within the in-app database.</li><li>Static files transmitted through the service are stored in secure cloud storage buckets that are encrypted in transit and at rest. They are protected through permissioned URLs that prevent unauthorized access and are completely expunged from the Sunbird systems no later than 48 hours after sending or receiving them.</li><li>All communication from the Sunbird app to the Sunbird API is protected at the transport layer, either through HTTPS or the MQTTS protocol.</li><li>The MQTTS broker is secured via strict access control lists to ensure that users are only able to access broker topics specifically assigned to them and no others.</li><li>Further, the contents of the message payload itself is encrypted at the application layer using AES encryption with an encryption key controlled completely by the client and only held in memory on the Sunbird side. Messages flow through the Sunbird system in an encrypted state and are only decrypted (in memory) at the moment of transfer of messages to the native messaging platform.</li></ul>
<p>Sunbird also indirectly mentions Beeper in its press release, which discontinued support for its iMessage client — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/beeper-mini-removed-from-the-play-store">called Beeper Mini</a> — after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/beeper-gives-android-imessage-app-one-more-go">repeated moves by Apple</a> to shut it down. The company claims that Sunbird is a solution to the iMessage compatibility problem that doesn&apos;t take steps to provide unauthorized access to Apple&apos;s iMessage servers. Ironically, Sunbird points out the "security and privacy concerns" related to Beeper Mini due to the app&apos;s "unauthorized access to iMessage."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7PHSHKgTneXCZo78APxUB3" name="beeper-mini-app-oneplus-open-iphone-15-pro-max.jpg" alt="Beeper Mini app on OnePlus Open Home Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7PHSHKgTneXCZo78APxUB3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, it&apos;s up to end users to decide whether Sunbird is actually worth trusting. For what it&apos;s worth, the company has already been caught in the middle of a discrepancy again. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/05/sunbird-imessage-android-return/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>  noticed that Sunbird claimed that it brought on Jared Jordan, a Google engineering director, as a formal advisor. However, Jordan&apos;s LinkedIn page reveals that he left the company months ago. Sunbird quietly updated its website to change the wording around Jordan&apos;s past experience, with no mention or acknowledgment of the change. </p><p>Sunbird says that the reason the company pulled the app for months was due to its "unwavering commitment to the privacy and security of our users." Instead of shipping a quick fix, Sunbird opted to rebuild its internal architecture entirely.</p><p>Still, it remains to be seen whether users trust Sunbird again. The app still has a long way to go, as it is now starting over from scratch in a very limited beta.</p>

Opening <strong>Settings</strong>, followed by the <strong>Battery</strong> option.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Battery usage</strong>, and you&apos;ll see the apps that have been using the most battery power since the last full charge.</p><p>The option doesn&apos;t tell you directly if the battery health is good or not, but it does give you helpful information on how much power your phone has, and you can see if your phone lasts as long as it did before but with data to back it up. </p>

<p>If your phone&apos;s battery is good, that&apos;s excellent news. You can use other battery-related options, such as battery optimization, but if you would rather keep apps running, you can always <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-battery-optimization-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">turn them off</a>. If the battery health is weak, you can try taking it for service since Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-ubreakifix-expand-repair-options">partnered with repair shops like uBreakiFix</a> for phone repairs and part replacements. You might want to consider getting yourself a new phone, maybe the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. Any excuse is good when it comes to an upgrade.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-check-battery-health-for-using-a-dial-code-2">How to check battery health for using a dial code</h2>
<p>There is a dial code trick you can try, but it doesn&apos;t work on all Android phones.</p><p>1. Open the dial-pad and enter <strong>*#*#4636#*#*</strong></p><p>2. Without having to do anything else, you should see a menu with options such as Phone information, Usage statistics, and Wi-Fi information.</p><p>3. Look for the <strong>Battery information</strong> option, but if you don&apos;t see it, don&apos;t worry. The following section will show you how to get battery health information regardless of your Android phone.</p><p>Some phones don&apos;t have the battery option. But entering the code does nothing on Samsung models, while other models at least show a menu. Some phones support it, and others don&apos;t. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-battery-health-info-with-third-party-apps-2">How to get battery health info with third-party apps</h2>
<p>You can use free third-party apps to get the battery health information you need. One popular app is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digibites.accubattery">AccuBattery</a>. However, you might not like that it won&apos;t give you a health report right away, since it needs time to gather information. </p><p>If you&apos;re like me and you want the information now, you can try apps such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gombosdev.ampere">Ampere</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gombosdev.ampere">DevCheck Device System Info</a>. These apps will tell you how healthy your phone&apos;s battery is within a few seconds of installing them. When I swiped left, I could choose from different information layouts on my phone.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-know-if-your-android-battery-is-damaged-2">How to know if your Android battery is damaged?</h2>
<p>A phone battery that is not in good condition shows it&apos;s struggling. But how do you know <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-tell-when-phones-battery-has-gone-bad">when your phone&apos;s battery has gone bad</a>? One of the various signs is that your phone won&apos;t charge to 100% and drains very quickly when it reaches a full charge. If the battery looks swollen, that is a clear sign that your phone needs a new battery. Does your Android phone take longer than usual to charge?  </p><p>Battery health is not the same as battery life since battery health is how well the battery performs, like holding a charge. Battery life is how much power you have until you need to charge your phone again. But before assuming it&apos;s the battery, you can try using a new charging cable and block to avoid that possibility.</p>
<h2 id="keep-your-android-phone-apos-s-battery-healthy-2">Keep your Android phone&apos;s battery healthy</h2>
<p>Besides knowing how healthy your Android phone&apos;s battery is, it&apos;s also important to understand how to take care of your battery. By knowing what not to do, you can keep your phone in good shape. All Android users should also know various tips for extending the life of their phone&apos;s battery. That way, you don&apos;t have to waste time taking it for service or get a new phone.</p><p>Here are just some tips to keep in mind when it comes to taking care of your phone&apos;s battery:</p>
<ul><li>Charge your phone when it needs a charge and remove it from the charger when it's finished. Don't be afraid to use a wireless charger.</li><li>Use quick charging sparingly if you're concerned about its effect on battery lifespan. There is little immediate damage or danger from using the right charging method for your phone.</li><li>Try to manually shut your phone off if the charge ever drops below 10% and leave it off while charging it for a few minutes.</li><li>Never store a phone with a dead battery and check on a stored phone periodically.</li><li>Don't buy cheap chargers or cables from the gas station or that dude at the flea market. Use the type of charger the people who made your phone recommend.</li></ul>
<p>Whether you have a new Samsung phone or an older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-lg-phones">LG phone</a>, the tips for keeping your phone healthy apply. But now, with the free battery apps on Google Play, you can monitor your battery health.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung's upcoming affordable smartwatch is tentatively named Galaxy Watch FE.</li><li>It is most likely a revamped version of the Galaxy Watch 4, indicates a new leak based on model numbers.</li><li>The Galaxy Watch FE is expected to release alongside the Galaxy Watch 7 later this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It is rumored that Samsung will bring a Fan Edition Galaxy Watch for the first time this year. While there have been minimal details about that till now, new information heavily suggests it is indeed happening.</p><p>We first heard about the Fan Edition Galaxy Watch, tentatively named Galaxy Watch FE, earlier this year, implying that it would come on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/04/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-is-coming.html">Android Headlines</a> corroborates the same with new information. It is seemingly a new version of Galaxy Watch 4, which will be renamed the Galaxy Watch FE.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:841px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:19.62%;"><img id="jDzQNuBXHhsK2jGwBhfqDh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-FE-leak.jpg" alt="Galaxy Watch FE leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jDzQNuBXHhsK2jGwBhfqDh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="841" height="165" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Headlines further notes that the Galaxy Watch FE will be seen in the global, U.S., and Korean markets with corresponding model numbers bearing <strong>SM-R866F</strong>, <strong>SM-R866U</strong>, and <strong>SM-R866N</strong>, respectively. For the unaware, the Galaxy Watch 4 also featured the <strong>SM-R860F</strong> model number — the similarities between these numbers further establish that the Galaxy Watch FE is most likely a revamped version of the Galaxy Watch 4.</p><p>If the previous Fan Edition products from Samsung are any indication, with the upcoming Galaxy Watch FE, we can expect some of the goodies from the then flagship smartwatch model.</p><p>Meanwhile, we have also recently seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-announced">Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024)</a> refresh after two years of launch, dubbed Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2022). While most of the parameters between both tablets remained the same, the 2024 model came with a new chipset underneath.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jpPfxLZvPDpSYEzgFz5bjc" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-hands-on-8.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic Hands On" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jpPfxLZvPDpSYEzgFz5bjc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Likewise, alongside bringing some highlights from the Galaxy Watch 4, the upcoming Galaxy Watch FE is expected to have a new, rumored Exynos chipset for better performance.</p><p>The fact that it&apos;s an FE model also means it will be an affordable offering, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-could-launch-in-2024">previous rumor</a> indicates that the Galaxy Watch FE will cater to the mid-range, competing against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">best affordable smartwatches</a>, something that Wear OS hasn&apos;t really tapped into when it comes to new model releases. As for the Galaxy Watch FE release, it is expected to launch alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> series (which may include Pro and Classic models) later in the year, presumably next to the Galaxy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>.</p>
