I didn&apos;t expect there to be (tech publications often receive details about products early so they can be prepared for their launch), but I still had a small sliver of hope. I was disappointed like I am every year.</p><p>I&apos;ve finally decided I&apos;m no longer going to have any expectations about seeing a wearable designed for wheelchair users from companies like Google, Samsung, or Apple because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">the wearable market</a> is like the market for every product; it&apos;s based on profits and not some lofty humanitarian effort.</p>

<p>I&apos;ll start by saying there <em>is</em> a wearable designed for people like me so it&apos;s not like we&apos;ve been forgotten. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">Garmin Venu 3</a> does an amazing job keeping track of how often I fail to meet my fitness goals, tracks workout routines specifically designed for folks in wheelchairs, and has been tailored for the physical changes and challenges people in a chair face. And it does an excellent job doing it.</p><p>I&apos;ll also say it&apos;s not the best smartwatch out there because of its software. It runs a proprietary Garmin-built operating system that isn&apos;t as intuitive or feature-packed as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Google&apos;s Wear OS</a> or Apple&apos;s watchOS. Besides, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> looks really good, and I like things that look nice. I just want one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fs5f8mn65hUPZJwc2DbzHS" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-at-made-by-google.jpeg" alt="Two Google Pixel Watch 3s on display at the Made by Google 2024 event." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fs5f8mn65hUPZJwc2DbzHS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Google can&apos;t have the same priorities as I do because it wants to sell watches. Google could prioritize a wheelchair mode complete with algorithm changes based on physiology for the next Pixel Watch, but that&apos;s not going to open many wallets.</p><p>Almost every product is like this. In the U.S., <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theregreview.org/2023/03/28/welch-ross-opening-the-skies-to-passengers-who-use-wheelchairs/">8.5% of the population has some sort of mobility issue</a>. Of those people, 15% use a wheelchair. That&apos;s 15% of 8.5%, or about 3.5 million people. That&apos;s a lot of people, but when compared to the 343 million people who <em>aren&apos;t</em> in a wheelchair, it puts the number into perspective. You see this in your daily life — you will find people using a chair, but not very many.</p>
<p>Most companies can not cater to marginalized groups. Yes, I said that and I can, because I&apos;m part of that group. Don&apos;t get mad. Garmin does it because it found a way to do it without compromising the work on features built for everyone else. Other smartwatch companies will let you set your wearable in chair mode without core changes to how fitness tracking works, and that&apos;s enough to include everyone without making things difficult for development.</p><p>This goes for every group of people with any sort of special need. Android Central&apos;s Phones editor, Nick Sutrich, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">can&apos;t use phones that flicker</a> the screen too slowly because he&apos;s sensitive to this. I also can&apos;t use headphones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-active-noise-cancellation-and-how-does-it-work-headphones">Active Noise Cancellation</a> because my brain gets funky trying to process the imperceptible white noise they create. Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Buds (and other brands of earbuds) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-ear-infections">cause havoc to people sensitive to Nickel</a>. </p>

<p>These companies can&apos;t change their products to better serve the needs of the relatively few people affected. I guess they <em>could</em>, but that would be a silly business decision because it&apos;s spending money in a way that doesn&apos;t make your product better for the vast majority of people. It would only slow the development of features everyone wants.</p><p>I don&apos;t have to like this, but I&apos;ve decided I&apos;m going to stop hating it so much. With every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch</a> launch, I&apos;ve told myself this could be the year they make a watch for me. It&apos;s never that year.</p><p>Meanwhile, Android Central has contacted Google regarding any potential plans to bring wheelchair-focused features to the Pixel Watch but has not received a response in time for publication. I will update this article when I hear back.</p>
<p>Still, you should not let any of this influence your buying decision unless you&apos;re affected. Look at what gives you the best feature-to-value ratio, then buy whatever you like the most. Nobody in a wheelchair <del>is going to</del> should ever try to police your tastes. </p><p>Rock your new Pixel Watch and enjoy it. I&apos;ll wear my Garmin Venu 3 until it dies, but I&apos;ll be a <em>little</em> jealous.</p>

Well, before you do, those of you who want the Pixel 9 Pro Fold are out of luck if you were looking to purchase the device through AT&T. While the carrier has highlighted the impending availability of the Pixel 9 series, the company curiously left out the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>So what gives? We&apos;re not sure, but Android Central did reach out for a comment. Perhaps the original Pixel Fold didn&apos;t sell well enough for AT&T to justify carrying the sequel? After all, these aren&apos;t cheap phones. Still, AT&T does carry the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, so your guess is as good as ours until we receive an official statement from AT&T on the matter.

The company was just dealt a major blow after a judge ruled that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">maintaining an illegal monopoly</a> on search. However, as a result of the ruling, it looks like the U.S. is considering potentially breaking up the company.</p><p>The units up for consideration for Google to divest are Android and Chrome, two major products for Google. According to Statista, Android is used on about 70% of devices worldwide, while Chrome holds over 50% of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/545520/market-share-of-internet-browsers-usa/">browser market in the United States</a>.</p><p>However, it may not come to this. The Justice Department is also considering much less drastic moves, such as making Google share its search data with others, which could definitely level the playing field. The government may also ban exclusive contracts like those Google made with companies like Apple to secure itself as a default search engine, which could have interesting consequences for the company.</p><p>These proposals would have to be approved by Judge Amit Mehta, and it seems no decisions have been made, so we&apos;ll keep an eye on the situation as it unfolds.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-app-mirroring-improved"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>One of the cool things about the Link to Windows app is that it allows users to stream their apps or mirror their screens on their PCs. However, one limitation can muddy the experience: You need to give permission to start the streaming process every time you want to open an app.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-devices-confirmed">One UI 6.1.1</a>, that appears to no longer be the case. As pointed out by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-6-1-1-streaming-apps-windows-3469490/">Android Authority</a>, Microsoft made some changes to how the Link to Windows app works and asks for permissions, letting users opt to "Always allow" mirroring. </p><p>The move definitely streamlines the process of streaming apps to your computer. Of course, you can always use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> to achieve more or less the same thing on a desktop-like UI.</p><p>The catch is that One UI 6.1.1 is only available on the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, with no word on when it will arrive on other Samsung devices. Hopefully, it&apos;s soon, as users are hoping to get Android 15 sooner rather than later after it rolls out on Pixel phones.</p>

There have been a few leaks of the Galaxy S24 FE, but the latest suggests that we may be getting the phone fairly soon.</p><p>The phone appears in what looks like press images, revealing the specs and likely colors the phone will launch in. It seems the phone will have a 6.7-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1900 nits of brightness. On the back, we see a triple camera system with a 50MP primary, 12MP ultrawide, and 8MP 3x telephoto. The display will be protected by Gorilla Glass Victus Plus, and the phone will feature an aluminum frame.</p><p>The report from Android Headlines also mentions an Exynos 2400e that will power the phone, likely a slightly downgraded version of the current flagship chipset for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. As for when we&apos;re getting the phone, that&apos;s anyone&apos;s guess. However, it can&apos;t be long now.</p>

<p>Google's second-gen foldable comes with a ton of tweaks; it is significantly lighter and thinner than its predecessor, and both the inner and outer panels are noticeably brighter. There's decent hardware, one of the best camera packages in this category, and a design that's in line with the regular Pixel 9 Pro. Combine all of that with a clean software and plenty of cool AI features, and you get a foldable that excels in key areas.</p></p>

<p>Even though it isn't a new device, the Open continues to be a great choice if you need a new foldable. It is lighter than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, has brighter AMOLED panels, and its cameras hold their own against what Google is offering. You get a smoother hinge articulation, crease that isn't as visible, battery that lasts longer, and 67W charging. Basically, it has a lot of features that you'll actually end up using, but the software is limited; there are useful software features, but the phone will only get three Android updates.</p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dS9GZeJta4Bn4kmYb8crCC" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-oneplus-open-face-down.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold and OnePlus Open face-down with screens open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dS9GZeJta4Bn4kmYb8crCC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> was a showcase of Google&apos;s ambitions, but it was too heavy, and wasn&apos;t available widely. Google is rectifying both issues with the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>; the foldable is 26g lighter than its predecessor, and is significantly thinner. While it isn&apos;t the thinnest or lightest foldable — Honor and Vivo claimed those niches — it is thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, and Google is using that to its advantage in North America.</p><p>Coming to the design itself, Google did a good job maintaining the same design aesthetic as the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> series, and the dual-stacked camera housing at the back looks great. That said, the defining design feature is the side profile where the cover screen meets the metal chassis, and this is similar to the Open — but a little more prominent.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xHEmLL3ihZfhAp6ZcUyQjB" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-obsidian-porcelain-side-by-side-angle-closer.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Porcelain and Obsidian face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHEmLL3ihZfhAp6ZcUyQjB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the overall design, but coming in at 257g, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is 18g heavier than the Open while having a smaller battery. Google went with an aluminum frame and upgraded hinge, and while it gets to claim that the foldable is thinner than its rivals, the added weight isn&apos;t ideal. That said, the one area where the foldable has an advantage is water resistance; with an IPX8 rating, it is able to withstand water ingress — the Open only has an IPX4 rating that covers splashes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eGyLKviAK3wq4uCoqV8HdX" name="oneplus-open-2024-18.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eGyLKviAK3wq4uCoqV8HdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the Open isn&apos;t without its wins. The foldable has a faux leather back that&apos;s great to hold, and it has a hinge with one of the best articulations in the segment. The crease is barely noticeable in the middle of the inner panel, and OnePlus nailed the design basics.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FGpDTKpipC2U464JTXWyCb" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-split-screen-prompt-alt.jpg" alt="Split-screen prompt on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FGpDTKpipC2U464JTXWyCb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google clearly liked what OnePlus was doing on its foldable, because it went with a similarly-sized outer panel on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The foldable has a 6.3-inch OLED panel with a 20:9 ratio, and the width makes it just as usable as the regular Pixel 9 Pro. In fact, Google went with the same dimensions, and if the foldable looks like it has the panel of the Pixel 9 Pro up front, that&apos;s by design.</p><p>While the Pixel 9 Pro has a QHD panel, the foldable uses an FHD+ resolution (2424 x 1080) on the outside, but it still gets 120Hz dynamic refresh and decent brightness levels. The inner OLED panel is interesting as well, as the 8.0-inch size is one of the biggest on a foldable. Like other devices in this category, the inner panel has a plastic layer protecting the screen, and it also goes up to 120Hz and hits the same brightness levels.</p>

<p>Talking about brightness, the device is able to go up to 2,700 nits in HDR content, and that&apos;s double that of its predecessor. I&apos;ll update this post once I start using the foldable to gauge how bright it gets in regular use, but there shouldn&apos;t be any issues in this area.</p><p>The Open is a known quantity, and it has a 6.31-inch cover panel and 7.82-inch inner screen. Both panels get 120Hz refresh with dynamic refresh, have a higher resolution than what Google is offering, and excellent color vibrancy and brightness levels. I used the Open extensively over the course of the last year, and didn&apos;t see any issues with either panel.</p>

<p>Google has a unique take on the hardware, and while the Tensor G4 platform is technically new, it doesn&apos;t differ too much to the G3. It isn&apos;t as fast as what Qualcomm is offering, but that&apos;s not the point; Google chooses to focus on the AI side of things, as it sees that being a bigger differentiator.</p><p>Although the Open is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, it is still able to deliver outstanding performance in demanding titles. It is optimized to take advantage of the hardware, and doesn&apos;t have any lag in daily use. While both devices come with 16GB of RAM, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold only has 256GB of storage on the base model, and you&apos;ll need to pay an additional $120 to get the 512GB edition. The Open doesn&apos;t have such shortcomings, and the foldable has 512GB of storage as standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5VEqQ3Ah5DyuAJhYnx4yVV" name="oneplus-open-2024-7.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5VEqQ3Ah5DyuAJhYnx4yVV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Open also has a larger battery, but where it has a sizeable advantage is the charging tech; the foldable goes up to 67W, and you can easily charge the battery in under 50 minutes — Google still relies on 21W charging on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The Open comes with a 67W charger as well, and that&apos;s an added bonus.</p><p>I&apos;m not going into much detail on the cameras, as I&apos;ll still need to get the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and see how it measures up. That said, Google knows how to deliver standout cameras on its devices, and while the foldable isn&apos;t using the latest sensors, it should take great photos and videos.</p>

<p>Google has a sizeable lead on the software front, with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold slated to receive seven Android updates. The foldable launched with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and it will pick up the Android 21 update whenever that becomes available at the end of the decade. By contrast, the Open will get just three software updates, and as it debuted with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a>, it won&apos;t go beyond Android 16.</p><p>Okay, so the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will technically be usable until the end of the decade, but what about the software itself? Google is the only Android brand that has a clean software without any bloatware, and that makes a difference. The Material You design has a decent amount of customization, and the bright accent colors are great to use. It may not be to everyone&apos;s tastes, but I prefer it to other Android skins.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ozwGNvUL9zyb7SM8snz8oW" name="oneplus-open-2024-14.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozwGNvUL9zyb7SM8snz8oW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ll admit that OnePlus did a good job on the software side of things. Although OxygenOS has a cluttered interface, you get a lot of unique software features designed to maximize the real estate of the inner panel, and multitasking is a breeze. You get a few AI features as well, and they aren&apos;t gimmicky.</p><p>But when it comes to AI, no manufacturer comes close to Google. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a slate of new features in this regard, with the likes of Pixel Studio allowing you to create stunning imagery in a matter of seconds. There are lots of other Google-focused utilities that rely on AI, and most of it is handled on-device.</p><p>On the whole, if you want a clean UI with AI features you&apos;ll use daily, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the device to get.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1963px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="nYakyXauxUpCJjCEZvMSBZ" name="oneplus-open-2024-12.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nYakyXauxUpCJjCEZvMSBZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1963" height="1106" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is an easy one to sum up: if you need a new foldable, you should get the OnePlus Open. It may be a year old, but it&apos;s still one of the best foldables around. It has a gorgeous design, the leather back is great in daily use, and you get a smooth hinge with no visible crease. The cameras are terrific, there are no issues with battery longevity, and it charges at 67W.</p><p>The only point of contention with the Open is that it will get just three Android OS updates, and having launched with Android 13, that means it won&apos;t be updated beyond Android 16. That just isn&apos;t enough in this category, and to put things in context, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will get the Android 21 update when that rolls out at the end of the decade. Obviously, you&apos;re not going to use the device that long, but long-term updates absolutely make a difference in the resale market.</p><p>To its credit, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold gets a lot right; I really like the design, the OLED panels are brighter than its predecessor, and it has decent hardware. The biggest selling point is the software and cameras; Google&apos;s clean interface combined with the latest suite of AI features make the Pixel 9 Pro Fold a true powerhouse, and while it may not have the latest sensors, the foldable should take standout photos and videos.</p><p>There&apos;s the cost to consider as well. You can get the 16GB/512GB version of the OnePlus Open for $1,399 in the U.S. and ₹1,39,999 ($1,667) in India, and the same model of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold costs a ridiculous $1,919. Google doesn&apos;t even sell the 512GB model in India; the 256GB version is available for ₹1,72,999 ($2,061), and you can get the 1TB OnePlus Open and have enough left over to buy a swathe of accessories.</p>

<p>Google has a lot to offer with its latest foldable, and if the inflated pricing doesn't daunt you, then you should just pick it up. The outer and inner OLED panels are much better than last year, the software has the best suite of AI-based features available today, and you get versatile cameras at the back.</p></p>

<p>If you don't want to spend too much money but still want a great foldable, the Open is the way to go. I used the foldable a lot over the course of 2024, and it has been outstanding. The software has a ton of cool features, the battery easily lasts all day, and it takes phenomenal photos. The only limitation is the number of software updates, but if you're willing to look past that, it is still an easy recommendation.</p></p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google’s Satellite SOS feature is launching first on the Pixel 9 series and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, but only in the continental U.S. (not Hawaii or Alaska).</li><li>Garmin Response will handle rescue operations, connecting Pixel 9 users with local and international emergency services.</li><li>Skylo’s global satellite network makes it possible for the Pixel 9 to connect in remote areas, with potential for global expansion.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has teamed up with Garmin and Skylo to let you send an SOS message via satellite if you&apos;re stuck somewhere with no cell service.</p><p>During the Made by Google event earlier this week, Brian Rakowski, vice president for product management, announced that the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> series would be the inaugural <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a> to incorporate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-consumer-charge-potential">Satellite SOS</a>. This means users can connect with emergency services and send their location even when there’s no cell signal (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/garmin-skylo-pixel-9-series-satellite-sos/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p><p>Apple was the first to bring satellite connectivity to smartphones with the Emergency SOS feature on the iPhone 14. It gave users in remote spots a crucial way to get help when cell coverage was spotty.</p><p>Much like Apple&apos;s Emergency SOS, Google&apos;s Satellite SOS provides a similar safety net. If you find yourself without cell service, you can use Satellite SOS to reach emergency services. After filling out a quick form about your situation, you&apos;ll be able to text the first responders. Plus, you can let your emergency contacts know what&apos;s happening.</p><p>Just like Apple’s satellite service, Google’s Satellite SOS doesn’t rely on your cellular carrier.</p><p>Google’s Pixel 9’s satellite SOS feature is a joint project with Garmin and Skylo. Garmin Response, known for its global emergency management expertise, will handle rescue operations for Pixel 9 users in the U.S.</p><p>If a Pixel 9 user hits an emergency and is out of cell service, they can use Satellite SOS to reach Garmin Response&apos;s 24/7 emergency crew. Garmin Response will then loop in local authorities like police, fire departments, search and rescue teams, and even international agencies if needed, to get help on the way.</p><p>This partnership could be a real game-changer. Not only does it bring satellite SOS to Pixel users, but it also hints at Garmin’s emergency response services potentially reaching a larger Android crowd, as per Garmin&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/corporate/garmin-announces-support-of-new-satellite-sos-on-google-pixel-smartphones/" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>Skylo’s a big player in this collaboration too. Its global satellite network lets Pixel 9 users get help even in the most remote places. Thanks to this network, there’s potential for satellite SOS to go global, not just stay in the U.S.</p><p>Skylo teamed up with various satellite operators and worked with Google to build a system where phones can connect straight to satellites. This major tech upgrade makes it possible to communicate in emergencies, even in the most isolated spots, according to Skylo&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.skylo.tech/newsroom/skylo-connectivity-enables-new-satellite-sos-feature-on-google-pixel-9-series" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>While Satellite SOS is a groundbreaking feature, it&apos;s still in its early stages. For now, it’s only on the Pixel 9 series and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. Plus, it’s rolling out first in the U.S. but won’t be available in Hawaii and Alaska, according to Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15254448?visit_id=638591764705047306-3664744699&p=satellitesos&rd=1" target="_blank">support page</a>.</p>

<ul><li>An interview with Google's Director of Design for Pixel phones, Claude Zellweger, explained why the Pixel 9's camera visor is so huge.</li><li>Zellweger explained that consumer interest in mobile photography is the catalyst as Google needs to bring large lenses and sensors but keep the device thin.</li><li>The company highlighted "Add Me" for the Pixel 9's camera alongside announcing the arrival of its long-awaited "Zoom Enhance."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s Pixel 9 series picked up one design change that could give consumers a mixed reaction.</p><p>Google&apos;s Director of Design for Pixel phones, Claude Zellweger, sat down with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/24220359/google-pixel-9-camera-bar-small-phones-claude-zellweger-interview">The Verge</a> and discussed why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-pixel-9-series-boasts-a-faster-chip-brighter-screens-and-new-ai-features">Pixel 9&apos;s camera bump</a> is so big. The conversation led off with Zellweger stating the bump is large by design and was also "the most efficient way" to deliver the phone&apos;s cameras.</p><p>He also linked the idea of producing a Pixel phone with such a large camera to consumer interest and what they want from mobile photography. Google says it understands that users want to take good, high-quality photos. However, doing so requires the device to pack beefy sensors and lenses to meet demand.</p>

<p>Additionally, a large camera bump helped Google keep the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL reasonably thin.</p><p>When questioned whether smaller phones could be a possibility, Zellweger saw trials ahead. He stated, "building small phones is just fundamentally a bigger challenge" due to battery life demands, cameras, and more. Zellweger remained hopeful, adding that there could be a future where "some people have different priorities" about their devices.</p><p>This future could indicate a vastly smaller camera bump — which Google might still consider. Zellweger states the design choices are ultimately left to the camera needs of consumers. What&apos;s more, the design choice of the Pixel 9&apos;s camera bump might not stick around "forever."</p>

<p>Google debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">the Pixel 9 series</a> earlier this week and the devices pack small performance increases alongside notable AI boosts. Joining the Pixel 9 and the 9 Pro is the larger 6.8-inch display Pixel 9 Pro XL. Google implemented a completely flat design language with its smartphone&apos;s display this year and flat, shiny sides.</p><p>The camera bump entered the spotlight with a telephoto lens on the Pro models, a 42MP selfie camera, a 50MP primary lens, and a 48MP ultrawide lens.</p><p>The Pixel 9&apos;s photography is taken to new heights with Google&apos;s new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a>" feature.

<ul><li>A worrying vulnerability was discovered on Pixel devices caused by Verizon's demo app, per iVerfy researchers.</li><li>The issue could open a user's Pixel to malware and spyware attacks if it becomes active and receives the necessary permissions.</li><li>Google states it is working on a software update to remove the Verizon demo app from all affected Pixel phones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Every Google Pixel phone sold by Verizon comes preloaded with the carrier&apos;s apps, but one of them could cause a nasty malware attack if activated in person.</p><p>The discovery made by mobile endpoint and response researchers at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://iverify.io/press-releases/iverify-discovers-severe-android-vulnerability-impacting-millions-of-devices-around-the-world">iVerify</a> was detailed in a recent report (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/showcase-app-3472086/">Android Authority</a>). iVerify&apos;s researchers state the file&apos;s malicious properties expose Pixel device&apos;s Android software to MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks.</p><p>Essentially, online threats could virtually inject malware and spyware onto your device to gain "system privileges." According to a Google spokesperson, the vulnerability&apos;s catalyst was found within a file named Showcase.apk, which is the Verizon demo app.</p><p>Normally, uninstalling a problematic app would solve the issue but this is a special app preloaded by Verizon and cannot be uninstalled. iVerify informed Google about the vulnerability and the company says it&apos;s working with Verizon to get a system update out to customers that removes the problematic app.</p><p>The "good" news is that Verizon&apos;s demo app is dormant. So long as the app isn&apos;t enabled or active on your Pixel devices the problem isn&apos;t critical. The cause for concern is that the software still exists within your Pixel device. The publication adds that an attacker would need "physical access" to your phone to enable the app and grant the Showcase.apk file the necessary permissions.</p><p>Google informed Android Authority that it will remove the file in question "from all supported in-market Pixel devices with an upcoming Pixel software update." iVerify&apos;s report states this vulnerability could affect a "large percentage" of Pixel phones sold from September 2017 onward.</p>

<p>Android vulnerabilities and those that plague one subset of devices are scary, but Google&apos;s had to wrangle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-fixed-a-critical-security-flaw-for-pixels-but-other-android-phones-were-left-hanging">with others in recent months</a>. Earlier this year, the company patched a zero-day vulnerability that could&apos;ve erased a user&apos;s data stored on their Pixel.</p><p>Interestingly, only Pixel devices received the fix for this issue. Google stated that other non-Pixel phones will have to wait for Android 15. Another issue that plagued Pixel occurred last year, dubbed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-acropalypse-exploit">aCropalypse</a>," allowed attackers to "un-crop" an image and discover hidden data in it.</p><p>As is the case with most issues, the problem was rectified through a Google software update. Pixel phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> series receive seven years of software updates — including important security updates like these examples — showing just how important it is to receive years of software support.</p>

<ul><li>A new rumor claims Samsung is reworking the screen-to-body ratio of the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</li><li>Supposedly, the device will offer a narrower aspect ratio alongside slimmer bezels and rounded corners for comfortability.</li><li>The recent rounded corner rumors double down on what we've heard previously alongside another leak that claims the device won't pack any battery upgrades.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s next Galaxy S series isn&apos;t expected until next year, but a new round of leaks suggests unique changes might arrive with it.</p><p>The initial rumor stems from known X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1824300253081899277">Ice Universe</a> who purports that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will undergo a screen-to-body ratio rework (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s25_ultras_width_and_screen_size_tipped-news-64159.php">GSMArena</a>). The post claims the device will feature a "smaller" display width than the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Additionally, the body frame changes may result in a narrower aspect ratio, but with an immersive display due to slimmer bezels.</p><p>It seems the device will move away from feeling difficult to hold due to its size and the amount of "frame" users have wrangled with. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1824302121078100117">subsequent comment</a>, the tipster added that the device&apos;s thickness could be compared to Apple&apos;s iPhone 16 Pro Max.</p><p>Elsewhere, the tipster showed off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1823924355849707849">a supposed render</a> of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which suggests Samsung could fix one key aspect: its sharp corners. The rendering doubles down on what we&apos;ve heard previously as the next model could offer rounded corners, instead of ones that dig into your palm.</p><p>The change (if true) would aid in comfortability when holding the device — alongside those rumored body frame alterations.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What is the biggest problem with the S24 Ultra design?The number one flaw is that the horizontal screen-to-body ratio is too low. The body width is 79mm, of which only 72.3mm is the screen, and the remaining 6.7mm is all the frame and the middle frame, which makes the hand feel… pic.twitter.com/YjCVWgWeKi<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1824300253081899277">August 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Curiously, another rumor from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1824358380657578108">Yogesh Brar</a> on X states Samsung could rename its S series Ultra model (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-ultra-note-pro-3472224/">Android Authority</a>). The Korean OEM is allegedly considering swapping the name of the Ultra model for the Note. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1824460462043418967">Brar adds</a> that this may not happen with the Galaxy S25 Ultra since the "branding has been fixed." However, there&apos;s supposedly a chance a Galaxy S26 Note could happen.</p><p>Moreover, the company could rebrand the Plus model to "Pro," instead. If this pans out, perhaps there&apos;s more in-store upgrade-wise for the Galaxy S series&apos; middle device. Google is launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> with two different-sized Pro models this year, so it&apos;s possible Samsung might offer something similar.</p><p>At the end of June, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-might-bring-back-a-classic-look">rumors claimed</a> Samsung could give its next Ultra a classic Galaxy Note look by bringing back the rounded corners. An issue Android Central had with the S24 Ultra was how uncomfortable it was to hold over long periods. Now, with a narrower aspect ratio rumored, perhaps these two changes could help make it effortless to scroll endlessly.</p><p>It was also rumored that the device could feature next-gen display technology, outfitting fingerprint scanning across the screen. Another leak stated the S25 Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s25-ultra-wont-probably-blow-your-mind-with-its-battery-life">might not excite you battery-wise</a> as it could continue to offer a 5,000mAh capacity with 45W charging. Meanwhile, companies like OnePlus have been rumored to outfit their next phones with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-charging-display-upgrade-leak">larger battery</a>.</p>

<p>The best Android phones under $100 do exist, you just have to know where to look. If you&apos;re on a tight budget, these devices will give you a fairly decent user experience. </p><p>They are obviously not going to be the most feature-packed or anywhere close to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> on the market, but we&apos;ve used nearly every device on this list and can recommend ones that will function reliably without breaking the bank. You might even be surprised by some of the specs. The NUU A23 Plus, for example, gets the top spot for the best bang for buck below $100. For users outside the U.S., the Xiaomi Redmi 12C is a great option, even if you might have to wait a little for it to get a bit discounted. Some of these smartphones, like UMIDIGI&apos;s Power 5, even manage to pack in features that are found in flagship smartphones.</p>

<p>The NUU A23 Plus has many exciting features, including a 6.3-inch HD+ display, a MediaTek Helio A22 chipset, 3GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage with a microSD slot. You can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android" target="_blank">memory cards</a> of up to 512GB storage size with this mighty sub-$100 device.

Even if that leaves Verizon, the dual-SIM NUU A23 Plus a fantastic option for U.S. residents.</p>

<p>Although the Xiaomi Redmi 12C usually costs a little over $100, you can easily get it for less than that during sales and promotions. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-xiaomi-phones" target="_blank">Xiaomi phone&apos;s</a> design itself is pretty standard for this price range — a full-plastic body and a small camera cut-out in a waterdrop notch on the front — but you do get a very convenient rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, and the camera experience is better than you might expect.</p><p>The MediaTek Helio G85 SoC inside offers plenty of performance for everyday use, pushing the boundaries of what a cheap smartphone is capable of. You get multiple memory combos, but the cheapest variant of the Xiaomi Redmi 12C comes with 3GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage.</p><p>You even get a delightfully large battery rated at 5,000mAh. A single charge could get you two to three days of use, which is good as the 10W microUSB charger included in the box will take several hours to juice things up. Best charge it overnight and just enjoy using it while you&apos;re awake.</p><p>The 50MP primary camera is the star of the show, delivering the best results of any phone at this price range. Sadly, the Xiaomi Redmi 12C isn&apos;t officially available in the U.S. and even if you get your hands on it, carrier support can be a bit problematic. If that doesn&apos;t matter to you, it&apos;s definitely among the best phones for anyone having a $100 budget.</p>

<p>Exquisite design isn&apos;t something you see on Android phones in this price range, and while &apos;exquisite&apos; isn&apos;t exactly the word we&apos;d use to describe the BLU G33, it certainly stands out from the rest of the phones on this list. The eye-catching textured design on the back is bold and attractive.</p><p>Joining that design is a well-rounded set of specifications, including a 6.26-inch LCD display, a dual-lens rear camera setup with a 5MP unit and a 0.3MP module, a side-mounted fingerprint reader integrated into the power button, upgradable storage, and even face unlock for further security.</p><p>The chipset features an octa-core ARM Cortex A55 setup, but the 2GB/16GB option is very poor for RAM and internal storage. It&apos;s got some of the worst battery life on this list though, as the 3,000mAh battery probably won&apos;t last more than a day. You do get some consolation in the form of the USB-C charging port.</p><p>In addition to the phone itself, BLU gives you all of the accessories you could possibly need, right in the box. These include a screen protector, a silicone case, a charger and cable, and even a BLU sticker for you to place wherever you want. All in all, the water-resistant BLU G33 is a great budget phone for well below $100.</p>

<p>In case you are not familiar with the term, dumb phones are essentially just super simple devices that lack all of the bells and whistles found in modern smartphones. There are typically no apps, no touchscreen, and no high-tech camera software; just try to picture the phone you used in 2006. Durable, cheap, and long-lasting, these devices have been seeing a resurgence in popularity among people who are trying to disconnect from being constantly online. Others may be interested in a dumb phone for privacy reasons or to improve their work/life balance. No matter the reason, the Cat S22 Flip is still among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-dumb-phone" target="_blank">best dumb phones</a> with Android that costs less than $100, even if the company behind it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/bullitt-reportedly-shuts-down" target="_blank">probably won&apos;t be making any more devices</a>.</p><p>Now, if you want to get technical, it’s worth noting that the Cat S22 Flip cannot really be called a true dumb phone since it runs Android 11 (Go Edition). If you’re willing to ignore the semantics, it&apos;s a great phone powered by the quad-core Snapdragon 215 chipset. You can download simple apps like Facebook and YouTube, the phone has a 2.8-inch touchscreen and a 1.44-inch outer secondary display, and the whole thing is military-grade tough, offering resistance to water, dust and insane temperatures.</p><p>The Cat S22 Flip comes with up to 12 hours of battery life, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, USB-C charging, a programmable button, a 5MP primary camera, a 2MP selfie lens, and a microSD card slot for expandable storage.</p>

<p>While the TCL 30 Z isn&apos;t as fancy of a phone as the company&apos;s newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl-40-series-nxtpaper-12-pro-launch" target="_blank">TCL 40 XL</a>, it&apos;s a solid option in the sub-$100 bracket. There&apos;s something to be said about simplicity, and even though the TCL 30 Z is simple, it still has all the basics of a cheerfully cheap smartphone to keep you satisfied.</p><p>Running Android 12 out of the box, the TCL 30 Z has a MediaTek Helio A22 SoC, and pleasantly, 3GB of RAM. You get 32GB of storage onboard and it can be increased up to a whopping 512GB via a microSD card. The smartphone&apos;s 6.1-inch HD+ LCD panel is dwarfed by a thick forehead and chin, but it still looks nice and crisp.</p><p>There are dual cameras — an 8MP rear sensor and a 5MP front-facing lens. They get the job done, but obviously won&apos;t come anywhere close to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera" target="_blank">best Android camera phones</a> out there. Thankfully, you can expect excellent battery life, even with the small 3,000mAh battery of the phone. Although the microUSB port is a letdown, but at least you get Verizon support, which is hard to come by in this price range.</p>

The only other smartphone (that we know of!) having this feature is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review" target="_blank">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a>, and that thing costs more than ten times as much.</p><p>UMIDIGI Power 5 comes with a triple-lens rear camera setup, comprising a 16MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 5MP macro module. The software — Android 11 — is quite dated and there&apos;s no 5G connectivity, but you can&apos;t have everything at this price.

<p>There are many junk Android phones that you can buy in this $100 price range, but there are also many great ones, as seen above. Overall, the NUU A23 Plus stands out as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" target="_blank">best cheap Android phone</a> that we&apos;ve managed to find under the $100 price point. When it comes to buying cheap phones, you want to get as many features as possible. Even then, the NUU A23 Plus gives you bang for your buck, complete with a clean Android 13 experience.</p><p>For Verizon support in the U.S. however, the TCL 30 Z remains our top pick. It costs way less than $100 and comes with a number of decent features including a great screen, plenty of storage, decent performance, expandable storage, and face unlock. The one caveat here is the dated micro-USB port, but it&apos;s probably not a big deal at this price point. We also suggest the UMIDIGI Power 5, which offers decent specs, a big battery, and even a contactless Infrared thermometer, all for less than $100.</p><p>If none of these phones tickle your fancy and you&apos;re willing to stretch your budget a little, we&apos;ve also gathered the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200" target="_blank">best Android phones under $200</a> for you to choose from.</p>

<p>As much as we love fancy flagships and foldables, you don&apos;t need to shell out $1,000 to get a good Android experience these days. If you need a new smartphone but only have a budget of around $200, there are a multitude of great choices you can consider. You might even be surprised to know that some of the best Android phones under $200 offer things like 5,000mAh batteries, multi-lens camera arrays, and years of software updates.</p><p>We <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-we-test-and-review-phones-at-android-central" target="_blank">test all kinds of Android phones</a> to ensure you get the most out of your device, without running into surprises later on. If we had to pick one Android smartphone in the sub-$200 price bracket (almost), it&apos;d be Samsung&apos;s Galaxy A15 5G. It has a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED screen, a big battery with 25W fast charging support, and much more. You can also consider Motorola&apos;s Moto G Play (2024) if you want a basic yet functional device that&apos;ll work well with all major U.S. carriers.</p>

<p>Offering a laundry list of features at an incredibly affordable price, Motorola&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review" target="_blank">Moto G 5G (2024)</a> is hands down the best Android phone you can get for $200 right now. If all you need is a well-rounded smartphone that can get the job done, get this one without thinking twice.</p><p>The Moto G 5G (2024) is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 SoC and has 4GB of RAM. Sure, these are not top-of-the-line specifications, but this hardware is more than capable of handling everyday usage (e.g., web browsing, light gaming) without any issues. There&apos;s also 128GB of internal storage, as well as an expansion slot that can take up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android/">microSD cards</a> of up to 1TB. This essentially means that you can carry a whole lot of media with you, at all times. </p><p>The smartphone&apos;s 6.6-inch IPS LCD may not offer deep blacks and vivid contrast levels, but it&apos;s ideal for things like video streaming. The HD+ resolution is a bit low, but you do get a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>At the back, the smartphone packs in a dual-lens camera system, comprising a 50MP wide-angle module and a 2MP macro sensor. Even when you ignore the macro lens, the primary unit should be able to capture decent photos in well-lit conditions. </p><p>The Moto G 5G (2024) comes with all the essential connectivity features, and even has NFC for hassle-free contactless payments. Other notable additions include stereo speakers, Android 14 (with a promise of at least one OS update), and a 5,000mAh battery with 18W charging support.</p>

<p>None of the phones on this list are considered expensive, but if you&apos;re trying to spend your money on something reliable, the Nokia G100 is for you. Sitting towards the lower mid-range limit of $200, it&apos;s the best unlocked phone in this range at the end of the day. You can get a lot of value from every dollar spent on the Nokia G100.</p><p>The Nokia G100 is equipped with the same 6.52-inch IPS LCD with an HD+ resolution of 720x1600 pixels that was on the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nokia-g20-review" target="_blank">Nokia G20</a>. It also has a Snapdragon 662 processor, 3GB/4GB of RAM, and 32GB/128GB of expandable storage (up to 512GB). Unfortunately, there&apos;s no fast charging, but you shouldn&apos;t miss it too much, thanks to the generous 5,000mAh battery.</p><p>The Nokia G100 will get two years of Android upgrades and three years of monthly security patches, which should get you through 2025. The phone ships with Android 12 and even though the update situation isn&apos;t as good as we&apos;d like it to be, at least the software experience is delightful, since there&apos;s no bloatware and Nokia sticks to stock Android.</p><p>The phone comes with a lovely textured back available in a single blue color and also boasts a side-mounted fingerprint scanner. You get a triple-camera setup, including a 13MP primary camera that is surprisingly decent. Nokia has packed just the right features into this value-rich device.</p>

<p>It&apos;s near impossible to talk about affordable smartphones without mentioning Motorola, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-play-2024-launch" target="_blank">Moto G Play (2024)</a> shows why. The newest member of the company&apos;s G series packs in a truckload of features at a price that&apos;s just too good to resist.</p><p>The Moto G Play (2024) comes with a 6.5-inch IPS LCD with a refresh rate of 90Hz. Although the resolution is still HD+ (720x1600 pixels), the 90Hz refresh rate should make interacting with on-screen content a smooth affair. You get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 chipset under the hood, along with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. </p><p>Although the SoC only offers 4G connectivity, it&apos;s a big improvement over the MediaTek Helio G37 of the last-gen model had. Android Central&apos;s Derrek Lee was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-play-2023-review" target="_blank">quite disappointed</a> with the previous-gen Moto G Play (2023) in his review, primarily because of the smartphone&apos;s sluggish performance. Considering that the newer model sports an extra gig of RAM and faster UFS 2.2 storage, the Moto G Play (2023) should do fairly well in day-to-day usage.</p><p>Interestingly, the Moto G Play (2024) only has a single 50MP lens at the back. The lack of an ultra-wide module is disappointing, but we&apos;re glad Motorola didn&apos;t include one of those useless macro units just to pad up the spec sheet. The smartphone runs Android 13 with Motorola&apos;s minimal My UX baked on top and should get at least Android 14, if not further.</p><p>Motorola Moto G Play (2024) sports a 5,000mAh battery - same as its predecessor - but the charging speed has now been upgraded to 15W. The previous-gen model had fairly decent battery life and we&apos;re quite sure this one at least matches, if not exceeds that.</p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s Galaxy A-series smartphones have come to be renowned for offering incredible value for money, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-review">Galaxy A15 5G</a> is no exception. Sure, it&apos;s just a penny shy of $200 and will cost you a little more than that after taxes, but this thing offers so many goodies that we suggest stretching your budget just a little bit. Moreover, you can often find it available for much less through major online retailers like Amazon.</p><p>As its name suggests, the Galaxy A15 5G offers 5G connectivity so you&apos;ll be able to enjoy blazing-fast speeds for video streaming, web browsing, and more while on the move. The 6.5-inch display sports a 90Hz refresh rate, but what truly sets it apart is that it&apos;s a Super AMOLED screen, a big upgrade compared to the LCD offered by the previous-gen model(s). The display is also perfect for content consumption. </p><p>Powered by MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 6100+ chipset and 4GB of RAM, the smartphone is fairly capable of handling everyday tasks with ease. You also get 128GB of internal storage, expandable via a microSD card slot.</p><p>The Galaxy A15 5G features a triple-lens camera system at the back, comprising a 50MP primary sensor, a 5MP ultra-wide unit, and a 2MP macro module. It obviously does not stand a chance against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera" target="_blank">best camera phones</a> out there but it does more than suffice for taking a few photos every once in a while. As far as the software is concerned, you get the latest Android 14 with Samsung&apos;s One UI 6 overlaid on top.</p><p>Samsung Galaxy A15 5G is backed by a 5,000mAh battery that&apos;ll easily last you a full day or two with moderate use. The 25W wired charging isn&apos;t really the fastest, but considering the top-of-the-line <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24" target="_blank">Galaxy S24</a> also charges at the same rate, we&apos;re not complaining.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s start with the positives, shall we? The Moto G Power (2022) has the best camera in its class, delivering crisp, clear photos throughout the day and even in low-light situations. It&apos;s no Pixel but it&apos;s certainly impressive for a phone under $200. Even the macro camera is impressive — something you&apos;ll almost never see in this price range — letting you get super up-close to objects for some interesting, &apos;Grammable imagery.</p><p>It&apos;s also got fantastic battery life that&apos;ll easily get you through the promised 3 days per charge. Our<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-g-power-2022-review" target="_blank"> Moto G Power (2022) review</a> confirms the longevity, although it will take several hours to charge it up since it only supports 10W charging.</p><p>But the kicker is that to achieve this kind of battery life, Motorola went with an incredibly weak MediaTek processor in the Moto G Power (2022). Simply put, if a sluggish UI and lag when switching between apps is a deal breaker for you, consider something with a better CPU. The Moto G Power has a Mediatek Helio G37 chipset that was never going to break any records.</p><p>At least the screen is relatively large at 6.5 inches and can even run at 90Hz if you&apos;re doing light enough work that the chipset can keep up. It runs Android 11, which isn&apos;t common for this price point anymore. When you consider how many other phone makers are committing to updates on cheaper phones, like Samsung, it&apos;s definitely a major weakness. Still, just about anything you need to do on this phone should work without issue on this older version of Android.</p>

<p>Putting a case on the phone is an excellent way to ensure it stays safe throughout your daily use, but some phones were designed to be rugged and durable right out of the box. One such phone is Blackview&apos;s BV5200 Pro, and if you&apos;re prone to clumsiness or work in a physically demanding environment, the BV5200 Pro is a solid choice.</p><p>The design of the BV5200 Pro makes its ruggedness unmistakable, and it has durability ratings to back it up. Not only is there an IP68 and IP69K dust/water resistance rating, but you also get a MIL-STD-810G certification. This means the BV5200 Pro has been tested to survive drops of up to five feet.</p><p>Moving beyond its design, there are plenty of other highlights for the BV5200 Pro. It has a massive 5,180mAh battery, USB-C charging, a Mediatek Helio G35 chipset, and NFC for contactless Google Pay payments. There&apos;s also 4GB of RAM along with 3GB virtual RAM, adding up to 7GB total, and 64GB of storage that can be expanded up to 1TB. You&apos;ll miss out on any platform upgrades past the pre-installed Android 12 and there&apos;s no fingerprint sensor, but you do get face unlock.</p><p>The design of the BV5200 Pro certainly isn&apos;t for everyone, but if you&apos;re someone who knows you&apos;d benefit from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-rugged-android-phones" target="_blank">ruggedized handset</a> like this one, it&apos;s definitely worth a good, hard look. Although Blackview BV5200 Pro makes a lot of compromises, its rock-bottom price tag makes it a very attractive deal.</p>

There are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" target="_blank">"cheap" Android phones</a> that are pretty great.</p><p>We think the best Android phone under $200 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review" target="_blank">Moto G 5G (2024)</a>, out of all the options currently available. For the average person shopping for a new phone, it&apos;s an excellent choice having a clean software experience, good battery life, 5G support, and even extras like NFC.</p><p>Backed by Samsung&apos;s industry-leading software support of up to four years of major OS updates, the Galaxy A15 5G is the right choice if you like to keep your phones for a long time. Among other goodies, it sports a stunning 6.5-inch Super AMOLED panel that&apos;s a visual delight.</p><p>If you&apos;d rather go with an unlocked device, the Nokia G100 is what we suggest. The display looks good enough, the performance is great for most apps and light games, the three rear cameras are fun to use, and that 5,000mAh battery is a lifesaver. That said, the G100 is a bit old at this point. If you&apos;d rather go for something newest, look no further than the Moto G Play (2024). It has Android 14, a 5,000mAh battery, and the software experience is clean and minimal, even if it probably won&apos;t get much in terms of updates.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-right-phone-under-200-2">How to choose the right phone under $200</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3805px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="k6oxj6v9mDynYQy5nDLhMj" name="Moto-G-Play-2023-review-phone-box-2.jpg" alt="The Moto G Play (2023) and the retail box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k6oxj6v9mDynYQy5nDLhMj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3805" height="2140" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you’re on a tight budget, buying a new phone isn’t the easiest thing to do. Most phones in the under-$200 category look very similar, but what brands can you trust and what should you look out for?</p><p>At under $200, it’s uncommon to get a phone that isn’t made of plastic. There’s just no way around this as it’s a huge cost-saving measure most manufacturers take. Otherwise, you’ll be spending more for an expensive phone body and the company will have to cut back elsewhere.</p><p>It’s also very common to find phones with a standard HD display — also known as 720p — instead of a Full-HD 1080p or higher resolution. Some phones, such as the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G, offer a 1080p display that looks substantially better than others in this class.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>At under $200, you're almost certainly getting a plastic phone with a 720p display. However, quite a few newer devices now come with better 1080p panels.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But, in most cases, that lower resolution is preferable for two reasons. First off, most phones under $200 don’t have a powerful processor. Without that extra processing power, a higher-resolution display will end up making the phone feel a bit laggy when a lot is going on. Second, a lower-resolution display helps keep the phone’s battery going for a long time on a single charge.</p><p>Most phones in this category only feature 3-4GB of RAM, which is often fine with those lower-resolution displays. The lower-power processors can’t multitask particularly well, so having a ton of RAM isn’t going to help things much. But, in certain cases, having extra RAM could help make your phone feel a bit speedier. A lot of phones can also use some part of their internal storage as a &apos;virtual&apos; RAM that can be used to make things slightly better.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung’s promised four years of security updates for the Galaxy A15 5G are miles ahead of what you'd get with any other manufacturer's device, at any price range.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Now, with all that said, you should never expect to get lots of major operating system updates on a phone in this price category. While most phones see a single big OS update some phones will just get security updates for a few years and be done. While major OS updates are a nicety, they don’t always make sense for a phone with a lower-power processor as new features often require more processing power to actually be nice to use.</p><p>Those security updates are what you should <em>actually</em> pay attention to, and that’s why Samsung got the pick of the litter in this category. Samsung’s promised four years of security updates for the Galaxy A15 is <strong>double</strong> that of any other manufacturer on this page. While lower-power processors don’t always hold up well for that long, it’s great to know that your phone won’t be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or malware for as long as you own the phone.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-choose-a-sim-free-or-contract-phone-2">Should you choose a SIM-free or contract phone?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UBaNaRZSMVyNpkhgqnftq" name="TCL-Stylus-5G-back-hold.jpg" alt="TCL Stylus 5G back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UBaNaRZSMVyNpkhgqnftq.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At under $200, many phones offer the easy option to choose between buying them outright — also known as SIM-free since they don’t come with a carrier’s SIM card — or just adding them to your phone plan as part of your monthly bill. While many phones on this list won’t cost anything at all from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us" target="_blank">great wireless carriers</a> such as T-Mobile, it might be worth just buying them outright for a number of reasons.</p><p>First off, at under $200, all of these phones are quite affordable. Many of the phones in this list are available at around $150, making them even easier to afford outright — especially when compared to flagship smartphones, which often cost $600 or a lot more to buy outright.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Putting a sub-$200 phone on a contract means you’re stuck with it for 24 months until the contract is up.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Second is the fact that putting a sub-$200 phone on a contract means you’re stuck with it for 24 months until the contract is up. While your carrier might offer a way to pay it off early, it’s likely for a higher price than it would have cost to buy it outright from Amazon or Best Buy.</p><p>Third is the fact that most sub-$200 phones tend to get a bit slow over a 24-month period, and that’s assuming you purchased the phone right when it came out. Case in point, if you were to choose the older Moto G Play right now, you would be using a phone that’s already over two years old, meaning it’s probably not going to be nice to use for all that much longer, much less 24 months <em>from now</em>.</p>
<h2 id="are-android-phones-under-200-any-good-2">Are Android phones under $200 any good?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qHSPCZdRV9YPwGS5UJSVVH" name="nokia-g20-review-4.jpeg" alt="Nokia G20" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qHSPCZdRV9YPwGS5UJSVVH.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="0" height="0" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, $200 (or less) Android phones can be good for many different types of people. But just how good can a phone be if it’s one fifth of the price of premium phones like a Samsung Galaxy S24? Obviously, you’re missing out on something by saving a ton of money, right?</p><p>Buying an Android phone under $200 is a bit like buying a cheap car for your daily commute. That car’s entire goal is to get you to and from your home or place of work or school and not much more. Similarly, a sub-$200 phone is going to accomplish your daily needs and probably not a whole lot more.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Don't buy a smartphone under $200 thinking you'll get the world. Super affordable cars won't give you features like autopilot or a backup camera, either.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In both scenarios, you should expect to forego fancy features and other bells and whistles when you opt to save money. Don’t go into a smartphone purchase expecting a screen that’s super bright in direct sunlight or to be amazed by every photo you take with its cameras. You won’t get autopilot or a backup camera with a super affordable car, either.</p><p>Likewise, ensure you’re setting yourself up for performance expectations when moving into either category. An affordable car isn’t going to reach highway speeds right away, and you should never expect to race one. Likewise, a $200 or less phone won’t play games very well and will not multitask between apps very well, either.</p><p>In a nutshell, you should expect that listening to music, scrolling through social media, watching a video on YouTube, or just browsing Android Central on the go will be a good overall experience on one of these phones. Almost all of these phones get multi-day battery life, too, which is a huge advantage of this lower-priced, lower-power category.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-do-android-phones-under-200-last-2">How long do Android phones under $200 last?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TWiCsXSwTvG7uWQFTtCfF8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-A13-home-screen-display.jpg" alt="The default home screen of the Samsung Galaxy A13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TWiCsXSwTvG7uWQFTtCfF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On average, users who spend less than $200 on an Android phone will find that their purchase can last them around two years before the phone begins to feel a bit slow or old. That’s most often why manufacturers only promise one major OS update, as some new features could end up slowing the phone down too much.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Because most sub-$200 phones will only get one major Android update and two years of security updates, it’s most important to choose a newer phone that still has many months of support left.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>During that two-year ownership period, it’s important to choose a manufacturer that promises regular security updates. Oftentimes, manufacturers in this price range will promise to deliver quarterly security updates to ensure that no big security vulnerabilities crop up on your phone. Phones with recent security patches are far less likely to fall prey to malware or other types of cyber attacks.</p><p>Because most sub-$200 phones will only get one major Android update and two years&apos; worth of security updates, it’s most important to choose a newer phone that still has many months of support left.</p><p>When taking these measures into consideration, the weakest link on our list is the Blackview BV5200 Pro, which will likely never see another update. While that’s fine in some circumstances, you’ll need to be extra mindful to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/five-tips-avoiding-viruses-and-malware-your-android" target="_blank">avoid scenarios</a> that could end up putting malware on your phone.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-consider-an-older-model-and-or-used-phone-2">Should you consider an older model and/or used phone?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yZAzPgfdfk2whb456a5Scb" name="One-UI-5.1-hero-Galaxy-S22-Ultra.jpg" alt="One UI 5.1 logo on a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yZAzPgfdfk2whb456a5Scb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>An alternative to buying a budget phone is to get a premium phone that&apos;s either an older model or that is available used. The benefit with this is that you&apos;re getting a better phone with more premium specs for the same price (or a bit more) than a budget phone. However, the older the phone is, the shorter the timeframe for software and security support.</p><p>With that said, with brands like Google starting to offer upwards of seven years of software and security updates for its Pixel devices, you could potentially go back a few years and still have a phone you can hang on to for the foreseeable future. It just might not support <em>all</em> the latest features and functions.</p><p>Buy/sell websites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://swappa.com/buy/phones">Swappa</a> have tons of premium phones on sale for under $200. At the time of this writing, for example, there are several good condition used Samsung Galaxy S22 phones for under that cap. With four years of software updates for that device, the phone, which was introduced in February 2022, would still last you through 2026. That&apos;s actually longer than some of these budget phones.</p><p>There are Google Pixel 7 models selling for under $200 on Swappa as well, and even several older OnePlus models that do not exceed this price threshold, like the OnePlus 8 Pro and OnePlus 9 5G (though it&apos;s already maxed out for software updates this year). </p><p>Check out all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-places-buy-used-phone">the best places to buy a used phone</a> as well as local marketplaces and private sales to see if there are hidden gems. Many retailers also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-places-buy-refurbished-phone">sell refurbished</a> or open box devices for a steal, with a reasonable warranty. </p><p>If you go the used, refurbished, or open box route, proceed with caution. Make sure to run a detailed inspection of the phone, testing all of its features, functions, ports, buttons, and screen, before forking over your hard-earned money. For older models, verify how many more software upgrades and security updates you get and double check the specs against the ones in these budget devices. In some cases, you might find it&apos;s worth going this route instead.</p>
