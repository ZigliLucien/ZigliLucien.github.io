<ul><li>Pixel watch users who installed the latest June feature update have been seeing their battery decrease to single digits, within 24 hours of use.</li><li> Both generation Watch users seem to be experiencing this issue right after installing the update.</li><li>It remains unclear what's causing the issue, however users speculate that it could be the new crash detection feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It has only been a few days since the Pixel Watch&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-and-pixel-watch-2-feature-drop">June feature drop</a> came through, and users have already started seeing some concerning issues with it. Several users took to Reddit to report massive battery drain, so much so that their Pixel Watch died sooner than usual (via<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-watch-users-report-excessive-battery-drain-june-2024-update/"> Android Authority</a>).</p><p>One user stated that, before the June update, their Pixel Watch 2 battery lasted longer. "After charging fully, I&apos;d be left with around 40% battery after approximately 24 hours."</p><p>Following the update, they stated that they&apos;ve seen a drastic decrease in their Watch&apos;s battery, even though they haven&apos;t changed the way they use the watch. </p><p>"After 24 hours, I am only left with a single-digit charge (usually 6-7%). I haven&apos;t changed the way I use the watch. I don&apos;t use GPS or tilt to wake up. It doesn&apos;t even have LTE."</p><p>This update seems to be impacting both generations of the Pixel Watch, according to multiple users. Another such frustrated Pixel Watch 2 user stated that their device got "pretty bad" after the June update. </p><p>"I can hardly make it 24 hours with the pw2. I hardly do anything on it either. I thought maybe it was 3rd party watch faces so I uninstalled all of them."</p><p>The user even tried to change their usage by uninstalling Spotify, however, that didn&apos;t work either.</p><p>"I still end the day with less than 15%," they added.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1dg6iih/june_update_draining_battery_faster_any_tips">June update draining battery faster - any tips? </a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch">r/PixelWatch</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The new update patch came with the highly anticipated crash and fall detection feature, that seems to be taking up more battery than usual. According to Android Police, turning this feature off has helped couple of users save their battery life.</p><p>While some users even stated that factory re-setting their wearable &apos;sort of&apos; worked for them, but didn&apos;t really fix the issue. Some users talk about turning off "Hey Google" detection which seemed to save their Watch.</p><p>It still remains unclear, which part of the update is causing the watch to have this unwanted battery discharge. However, it is best to steer clear from the June patch for now, if you haven&apos;t already updated your wearable. If you&apos;re seeing the same issues as many of these Reddit users, you can try the above workarounds for now. </p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google about this and it did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite launched in India with the same Snapdragon 695 SoC that powered its predecessor.</li><li>It comes in exciting blue, orange, and silver colorways accompanied by a flat design.</li><li>The device has a 50MP primary camera and a significant 5500mAh battery capacity.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus just released a new phone in India dubbed the Nord CE 4 Lite, and it packs some interesting features despite being catered for an entry-level midrange handset.</p><p>Firstly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/nord-ce4-lite-5g">Nord phone</a> comes in exciting new colors, which the company calls Mega Blue, next to Ultra Orange and Super Silver. The design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phone</a> includes a fairly flat design on all sides, including the display, which measures 6.67 inches and is an AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. It features a peak brightness of 2100 nits, which sounds promising.</p>

<p>Under the hood, however, it is powered by the reputable Snapdragon 695 from Qualcomm, which also powered the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-ce-3-lite-5g-launch">Nord CE 3 Lite</a>, the phone dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">Nord N30</a> for the U.S. region. The device further features 8GB of RAM (an additional 8GB of virtual RAM is also available) and up to 256GB of onboard storage. Then, the good old microSD slot can give you 2TB of storage.</p><p>The Nord CE 4 Lite draws power from a massive 5500mAh battery capacity, further supporting OnePlus’ proprietary 80W SuperVOOC charging tech and 5W reverse-wired charging.</p>
<p>The phone carries dual cameras at the back, with a Sony LYT-600 50MP camera acting as the primary one, and it is aided by another tiny 2MP secondary lens. The rear camera can capture up to 1080p videos; the same goes for the front, equipped with a 16MP selfie shooter.</p><p>The other highlights of the Nord phone include Wi-Fi, support for Bluetooth 5.1, and the return of the 3.5mm headphone jack. It also has a dual speaker system with noise cancellation support. The device ships with Pure Oxygen OS (aka <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-oxygenos-14">OxygenOS 14</a>).</p><p>Lastly, the Nord CE 4 Lite comes in two variants: 8GB+128GB, priced at Rs 19,999 (~$240), and the larger 256GB model is priced at Rs 22,999 (~$275). It is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/uk/oneplus-nord-ce4-lite-5g">available</a> to users in the UK. However, the device will likely be dubbed the OnePlus Nord N40 for the U.S., considering the launch of the previous iterations in the country.</p>

<p>Comparing the Motorola Edge 2024 and Samsung Galaxy S23 FE was inevitable, with Motorola recently launching its latest model. Samsung&apos;s phone may have launched at the tail end of last year, but like the Edge 2024, it teeters on the edge (see what we did there?) of a premium midrange and low-end flagship. Meanwhile, the latest Motorola Edge phone has some changes compared to its predecessor, but other specs remain the same.</p><p>Of course, these two relatively mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are not at the same level as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, but they are good options for regular daily use. With any luck, this Motorola Edge 2024 vs. Samsung Galaxy S23 FE guide will help you decide what specs matter most to you and which phone offers those specs.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="69zrFHcCepZsmtVLvYpDEo" name="motorola-edge-2024-back-logo-02.jpg" alt="The gorgeous vegan leather back of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/69zrFHcCepZsmtVLvYpDEo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The two smartphones&apos; designs share a centered hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera and are made of premium materials. The Motorola Edge 2024 has a vegan leather back that looked great on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-launch">Moto G Stylus 5G (2024)</a>. On the other hand, the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE comes with a glass finish with the three camera modules without the border you can find on the S21 FE.</p><p>In terms of design, the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE features an aluminum frame and measures 6.3 x 2.8 x 0.31mm. It&apos;s 30 grams heavier than the previous model, and the bezels are a little thick. The phone is available in Mint, Cream, Purple, Graphite, Indigo, and Tangerine. </p><p>The Motorola Edge 2024 is available in one color: Midnight Blue. It measures 158 x 76.5 x 8.2mm, keeping it slim, and has Gorilla Glass 3 for protection. The display features an endless-edge design and a vegan leather finish, which keeps the fingerprints at bay.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hJGR9muP7wdZCM4QXRA3YU" name="motorola-edge-2024-display-home-01.jpg" alt="The homescreen of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hJGR9muP7wdZCM4QXRA3YU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the competitive smartphone market, display quality is essential when choosing a phone. With that in mind, the Motorola Edge 2024 features a 6.6-inch pOLED (plastic, organic light-emitting diode) panel with a 144Hz refresh rate, a 1080 x 2400 FHD+ (20:9) resolution, and a 360Hz touch rate. It also comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and a peak brightness of 1300 nits. The advantage of having a pOLED display is that it makes the screen shatter-resistant since it&apos;s made of plastic, unlike OLED displays, which are more fragile because they are made of glass.  It&apos;s also important to note that Motorola normally does a great job with flicker prevention for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> users.</p><p>On the other hand, the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE offers a slightly smaller 6.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED display (which gives you higher peak brightness) with a 1080 x 2340 resolution, boosting decent sharpness and color accuracy. It also falls short in terms of the refresh rate with a 120Hz refresh rate (60Hz when idling). The S23 FE does win regarding the type of Gorilla Glass it has since it features the newer GG5, which is more scratch and drop-resistant than its competitor&apos;s version. The S23 FE has more brightness, which is great outdoors at a 1450 nits peak.</p><p>Both phones share features that enhance user experience, such as an in-display fingerprint reader for quick and secure access. Which phone has the better display depends on what you&apos;re looking for. Dynamic AMOLED might be a better choice if you value HDR content, eye comfort, and outdoor visibility. However, pOLED also has strengths such as flexibility and durability.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nvfZNRZ5sUCyTZDYEr3x65" name="samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-green-in-hand-alt.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S23 FE green in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nvfZNRZ5sUCyTZDYEr3x65.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How long can the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE last on a single charge? It has a 4,500mAh battery and supports 25W wired and 15W wireless charging, allowing up to 36 hours before you need to grab a charger. While it may not have the best battery capacity, the Galaxy S23 FE compensates with a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, which was found in 2022 flagship phones such as the Galaxy S22 or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-12s-ultra-review">Xiaomi 12 series</a>. This processor, however, has been reported to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">heating issues</a> under heavy use.</p><p>If you love taking pictures, the Galaxy S23 FE has a 50MP primary camera (OIS), 12MP ultrawide, and an 8MP telephoto (3x optical zoom). It also has a 10MP camera for selfies. These cameras can record in 4K resolution with a 60FPS frame rate and HDR support. This model also offers 128GB or 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2024&apos;s 5000mAh battery is bigger than last year&apos;s model, plus it has 68W TurboPower and 15W wireless charging. The processor on this phone is a less powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 7s Gen 2</a> processor coupled with 8GB of RAM (LPDDR4X) and 256GB of storage.</p><p>The Motorola phone&apos;s camera is a 50MP primary camera (OIS) with a Sony LYTIA 700C image processor to add more light to its pictures. There&apos;s no telephoto lens, but the 13MP ultrawide can double as a macro sensor. Like its Samsung competitor, both cameras on the Motorola Edge 2024 can also record 4K at 30fps. It also promises adaptive stabilization, and there is an improvement with the Auto Night Vision since Motorola claims a 15x speed improvement compared to previous versions.</p><p>Both phones offer dual SIM but with a difference. The Motorola Edge 2024 gives you one physical slot for the SIM card and one eSIM. The Galaxy S23 FE provides the same but offers two nano-SIM card slots and eSIM in some regions. It&apos;s best to check which models are available in your area.</p><p>Finally, the Edge 2024 has a new Quick Button that acts sort of like the Action Button on newer iPhones. This can be programmed to open various apps or quickly start an action.</p>

The Galaxy phone can be used with various US mobile carriers, such as Verizon, Xfinity Mobile, AT&T, Cricket, Metro, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2024 will support two Android OS updates, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, which is scheduled to be released later this year, and three years of bi-monthly security updates. Motorola uses My UX, which has a simpler interface and a focus on stock Android features. If you buy the phone unlocked, you can choose from carriers such as Metro by T-Mobile, T-Mobile, Consumer Cellular, Spectrum, Straight Talk, Total by Verizon, and Visible.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2024 will feature the Pixel&apos;s Magic Editor, Google Auto Enahnce, Magic Eraser, and Photo Unblur. Adding these features may make users think twice about getting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>. </p>

<p>The phone you choose will depend on various factors, such as price and the specifications that matter most to your tech needs. The Samsung Galaxy S23 FE is available for $599, while the Motorola Edge 2024 is available for $550.</p><p>If gaming is more important to you, you might want to go with the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE since it has a processor with superior performance (although thermal management may be an issue). The Motorola Edge 2024 does have an arguably more premium design and a bigger battery that will help you avoid going for your charger anytime soon. Ultimately, it all comes down to what specs matter most to you.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Internet Browser app gets a new 3.2.0.0.8 version via Google Play Store.</li><li>It highlights the "back and forward feature" for the Internet browser app, which translates to getting swipe gestures for the browser navigation.</li><li>It is reportedly seen working for other Wear OS-powered smartwatches like the Pixel Watch 2.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Using a browser on a smartwatch can sometimes be tricky as it involves navigating between pages back and forth. It applies to Galaxy Watch models and other WearOS-powered smartwatches. To make that experience smoother, Samsung is updating its Internet Browser app, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-internet-browser-wear-os-back-forward-feature/">SamMobile</a>.</p><p>According to the publication, Galaxy Watch users usually use their physical buttons on the smartwatch to navigate to the previous page while using the Internet Browser. And there is no action or button to go forward on a page in a similar manner. </p><p>Further, the option to go to the previous page through hardware buttons was limited to Galaxy smartwatches and not to other WearOS-powered watches like the Google Pixel Watch. It is likely to change with the new update for the Internet Browser app.</p>

<p>Per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/samsung-internet-browser-wear-os/samsung-internet-browser-wear-os-3-2-00-8-release/">changelog (via APK Mirror)</a> of the Samsung Internet Browser app on the WearOS bearing the 3.2.00.8 version number, the update highlights bringing the "back and forward feature" for the browser app.</p><p>As the name implies, users will be able to switch between pages, likely by gestures like swiping from the right to left to return to a page and vice versa or by using the top and bottom physical buttons on the smartwatch.</p><p>While it&apos;s still unclear if users can use the new swipe motions on a Galaxy Watch, folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/19/samsung-wear-os-internet-browser-gesture-update/">9to5Google</a> were able to test it on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, and the most recent version of the Samsung Internet Browser app seems to be functioning smoothly. As implied, if the feature is functioning well on the Pixel Watch 2, its users, as well as those of TicWatch and Montblanc&apos;s Wear OS watches, may find it to be helpful to navigate.</p><p>If you are a Wear OS smartwatch and an Internet Browser app user, it is time to check for the latest version of the app through the Google Play Store and take advantage of the new gestures to have a smoother browsing experience.</p>

<ul><li>Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 design showcased through new dummy units.</li><li>The design appears quite similar to what we have seen in the previous renders.</li><li>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 looks sharper like the Galaxy S24 Ultra model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 are anticipated to release at an Unpacked event in Paris on July 10. As we near launch, both devices were spotted in their dummy units, revealing what they would look like in real life.</p><p>These new images of both foldables, shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/20/galaxy-fold-6-flip-6-leaked-dummy-photos/">9to5Google</a>, fully showcase the devices, revealing their squared-off designs for the first time. Seeing the images doesn’t entirely feel new because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>&apos; were earlier shared through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-renders-leak">leaked renders</a>, which showed off a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-renders-leak">new design</a>.</p>

<p>The same design has been reflected even with the dummy units shared by the publication. This means that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> will feature sharp edges instead of rounded ones, as seen in the predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>. It is very akin to what we are used to on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-now-comes-titanium-yellow">recently released</a> in Titanium Yellow. </p><p>Aside from that major change, the rest of the Z Fold 6 appears the same. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-likely-to-opt-for-wider-cover-screen">earlier reports</a> indicated that there would be a slightly wider cover screen on the Z Fold 6, with minimum bezels compared to before. </p><p>The dummy unit image of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 also showcases a significant amount of crease on the foldable screen, which may or may not be reflected on the official unit when it arrives sometime later in July after the launch event.</p>

<p>Unlike the bigger foldable, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> looks identical to the Z Flip 5 without any significant design changes like squared-off edges; instead, it will still have rounded corners. The camera setup also seems to be the same as the previous iteration. </p><p>Another recent marketing image leak confirmed that the Z Flip 6 will still sport the folder-shaped cover screen. The clamshell is also expected to see significant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-leak-hints-at-a-bigger-battery-and-improved-camera">internal improvements</a> like a bigger battery, a 50MP primary sensor, and a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</p><p>We should be able to see the Galaxy Z Fold 6 formally and Z Flip 6 in roughly two weeks, at which point we should also be able to learn more about their design and other upgrades and how they compare to these dummy units.</p>

Last year, Motorola blew me away with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a>, a phone that not only exceeded my expectations but became my daily driver after becoming severely affected by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">PWM sensitivity last May</a>.</p><p>But it feels like Motorola forgot some of the lessons learned from last year&apos;s phones. While the Motorola Edge 2024 still offers super fast 68W charging and excellent battery life, the camera is as mediocre as ever. Worse yet, the slow processor is on-par with ancient phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-v60-thinq-5g-review">LG V60</a>, making everything feel old and slow even though this is a brand-new phone.</p><p>That&apos;s particularly sad because Motorola seemed to have finally figured out its groove in smartphone design again. The vegan leather back on my review unit is an absolute joy to use all day and it offers a level of grippiness and classic chic design we don&apos;t often see in devices like smartphones. The phone is immediately identifiable from the pack of iPhone clones on the market, yet because of some poor decisions, it&apos;s immediately forgettable from the moment you use it.</p>

<p>The Motorola Edge (2024) became available in the U.S. on June 20, 2024 for an MSRP of $549.99. It can be purchased unlocked at motorola.com, Best Buy, and Amazon. The usual suite of U.S. carriers will have the phone as well, including T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Spectrum, Consumer Cellular, Straight Talk, Total by Verizon, and Visible.</p><p>Canadian customers will be able to purchase the phone later this year, but Motorola hasn&apos;t given a specific release date yet.</p><p>The Motorola Edge (2024) ships in a single colorway, Midnight Blue, which is the vegan leather-clad model we used for review. I&apos;ve used the Motorola Edge (2024) on T-Mobile&apos;s 5G network as my main device for 10 days as of the publishing of this review.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FXWvyXFj3YuLhGvQJxiVY" name="motorola-edge-2024-back-04.jpg" alt="The gorgeous vegan leather back of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FXWvyXFj3YuLhGvQJxiVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From the moment I took the Motorola Edge 2024 out of the box, I loved it. Motorola&apos;s phone design absolutely shines through every square inch of the phone, from the high-quality metal frame to the gorgeous and slip-resistant vegan leather back. This is a really good looking phone and it feels as good to use as it looks, too.</p><p>So many phones use slippery plastic or glass backs and it makes holding on to them a chore. The Motorola Edge 2024 is so pleasantly grippy I think many people will feel like they can go caseless without feeling like it&apos;s going to fall to the floor at a moment&apos;s notice.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The design is impeccable, impressively thin, and clad in grippy, high-quality vegan leather.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The phone is also surprisingly thin, coming in at 1mm thinner than the Pixel 8a and feeling incredibly sleek because of it. I&apos;m not a person who usually advocates for thinner phones because it normally means that the battery is smaller or other concessions had to be made, but that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case here.</p>

<p>This may seem like a silly thing to gush about, but think about how many times you put your phone down only to watch it slide off that surface right away. When I make a phone call and put it on speaker, I don&apos;t have to worry about resting it in my lap for fear of it sliding off. When I put it on the counter while I cook, the sound emitted is a soft, comfortable tone rather than the scary crunch of glass—something especially true if you have stone countertops.</p><p>The one thing missing from this (and every other Android phone so far) is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">Qi2 with MagSafe</a>. On the bright side, because this uses vegan leather and not slippery or fogged glass, popping on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Magnetic-MagSafe-Compatibility-Compatibility-Non-MagSafe/dp/B0BYMJ3M29/">MagSafe ring adapter</a> without a case is completely possible. Other kinds of phone backs often don&apos;t work well with these adapters as the adhesive doesn&apos;t stick well to those surfaces.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Windows PC users are going to love Motorola Smart Connect, which makes your phone work like a second monitor.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In addition to a lovely textured back, Motorola brought another one of my favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/thinkphone-review-the-best-motorola-phone-you-wont-buy">ThinkPhone</a> features to the Edge 2024: the side button.

I set mine to open the Google Keep notes app when single-pressed as I find myself jotting down notes and thoughts throughout the day. This little button streamlines my usual routine, and I learned to love its existence <em>very</em> quickly.</p>

<p>PC users are going to <em>love</em> Motorola Smart Connect. There&apos;s something truly magical about controlling your smartphone with the same keyboard and mouse that simultaneously controls your PC. The best part is that all you have to do is move your mouse cursor over to your smartphone&apos;s display as if it were another monitor hooked up to your PC, and <em>it just works</em>.</p><p>I have a smartphone stand on my desk that sits right below my center monitor, making this particular setup effortless, but it&apos;ll also work just fine with plenty of other setups, too. If I&apos;m already on a computer there&apos;s almost no reason I want to pick up my phone to do anything because of the screen size and awkwardness of typing/navigating on a smartphone versus a computer. This fixes a lot of that.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Battery life is excellent, and 68W wired charging ensures that you'll only need a few minutes to top it up.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Speaking of using your phone often, this is a phone you can use all day (and then some) without ever worrying about battery life. Plus, even when you do need to top up the battery, the 68W charging speed ensures that just a few minutes get you plenty of battery for the rest of the day. I use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Anker-Adapter-Foldable-Compact/dp/B08T5QN2TR/">Anker nano charger</a> for this job as it provides plenty of watts without taking up much space.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 7s Gen 2</a> is a very efficient processor that doesn&apos;t get particularly hot—even when playing games like Call of Duty Warzone for an hour—and it sips battery even through these processing-intensive tasks.</p><p>And while this <em>is</em> a more mid-range processor, it still plays modern games just fine. I played everything from the aforementioned CoD Warzone to Diablo Immortal and even Genshin Impact without any performance issues. That said, games won&apos;t run at as high of detail settings, resolution, or framerate as a more expensive phone but so long as you don&apos;t mind that, this was a surprisingly great experience.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The pOLED display is gorgeous and has options to completely disable PWM dimming.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Motorola&apos;s software and features also make the experience truly sublime. Features like per-app volume adjustment makes it easy to keep listening to your own music while playing a game or doing something else that usually emits music-interrupting audio.</p><p>The phone&apos;s pOLED display is generally excellent and not only gets plenty bright under sunlight but also offers an important flicker-reduction setting for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> people. This ensures that the phone never uses PWM dimming, even at low brightness levels that usually cause quality issues with other types of OLED displays.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u2uRHQNh_is" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The phone utilizes 720Hz PWM at low brightness levels with this setting turned off, though, so if that&apos;s more comfortable, you can always leave it at the default setting. The only downside I found is that the display has some potential dithering when using the natural and radiant color modes. The default vivid color mode appears to have no dithering.</p><p>As is the case with a lot of Motorola&apos;s flavor of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, customizability means this phone will look and feel the way <strong>you</strong> want it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nVgoQC8RrC4MPhAMY6E7uU" name="motorola-edge-2024-display-wallpaper-01.jpg" alt="The homescreen of the Motorola Edge (2024) with custom wallpaper from the Backdrops app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nVgoQC8RrC4MPhAMY6E7uU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I use <em>a lot</em> of phones in any given year and can immediately tell the difference in haptic quality when I turn on a phone. This phone, unfortunately, still uses really low quality haptics that make it feel inherently cheap compared to something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> or OnePlus 12R, two phones that are in the same price range.</p><p>And the processor is also slower than both of those phones by quite a wide margin. According to Geekbench 6.3, the Google Pixel 8a is 140% faster in multicore performance, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> is nearly 200% faster. Even just playing games or doing normal tasks on the phone feels substantially slower than those phones. Imagine what it&apos;ll feel like in 2 years from now? Not good.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Google Pixel 8a is 140% faster in multicore performance, while the OnePlus 12R is nearly 200% faster.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The overall camera quality of the Motorola Edge 2024 is fine enough, but it&apos;s not going to win any awards. In many situations, I found that it traded blows with the OnePlus 12R despite using a newer Sony sensor than that phone.</p><p>But the quality really isn&apos;t the issue with the camera. It&apos;s the speed. Launching the camera is slow and clunky feeling, as it not only takes a few seconds for the camera to appear but it&apos;s initially laggy in a very unflattering way. Photo capture, likewise, was quite slow and often had a lot of odd shutter lag.</p>

<p>It doesn&apos;t handle motion capture particularly well, nor does the OnePlus 12R. If you take lots of pictures of your kids or pets, get a Pixel 8a, instead. It&apos;s the same price and has a <em>much</em> better camera.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>That slow processor means the camera performance is quite slow, often feeling laggy and stuttery while the competition is buttery-smooth.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The list of "things I don&apos;t like" isn&apos;t exactly lengthy but, even with that said, the negatives make the price feel way too high. The use of a slower Snapdragon 7-series processor isn&apos;t a good look on a $550 phone, and Motorola only guarantees two years of software updates on the phone. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 12R gets 4 years of software updates and Google offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-many-updates-will-the-pixel-8a-receive">7 years of updates on the Pixel 8a</a>.</p><p>That substantially slower processor affects a lot and it doesn&apos;t feel like there&apos;s much making up for those lacking pieces. Sure, it&apos;s got faster charging than the Pixel 8a but so does the OnePlus 12R. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 12R has the fastest processor of the bunch by a wide margin, while Google leads on the camera front.</p><p>What does Motorola offer uniquely here? I&apos;m not sure, other than a nice vegan leather back and a different type of eye-friendly display.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5057px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="zGSkRHnqKk46sKBJPCcv8R" name="google-pixel-8a-blue-with-flowers-03.jpg" alt="The blue Google Pixel 8a on a tea tray with blue hydrangeas above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGSkRHnqKk46sKBJPCcv8R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5057" height="2848" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 8a is a better value from almost every angle. It&apos;s got a far better camera that&apos;s lightning-fast to launch and snap pictures from. Video recording quality is higher, and Google&apos;s Tensor G3 processor is both more powerful and sports more AI processing power, ensuring that all the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-june-2024-feature-drop-detailed">Pixel features</a> are at their best. Plus, Google guarantees seven years of software updates for the Pixel 8a which is several more than Motorola.</p><p>Motorola still holds the edge in display quality and comfort, and anyone who is PWM-sensitive should never consider a Pixel because of Google&apos;s harsh flickering display tech, anyway. Plus, the vegan leather on the Motorola Edge 2024 is even nicer than the matte back on the Pixel 8a, and there&apos;s no getting around the fact that Motorola&apos;s 68W charging speed is substantially faster than the Pixel 8a&apos;s anemic 18W.</p><p>But I&apos;d personally rather buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> over both of those other phones for many reasons. The price is lower, the processor is faster, the display is the best of all three, and the charging is faster. The camera is better than the Motorola Edge (2024) but not as good as the Pixel 8a, so that&apos;s certainly worth mentioning. While OnePlus only offers four years of software updates, I prefer OxygenOS over either Google or Motorola&apos;s flavors of Android for its design and features.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sLaK3D6EgDVZi7JARCbqT3" name="motorola-edge-2024-back-02.jpg" alt="The gorgeous vegan leather back of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sLaK3D6EgDVZi7JARCbqT3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Edge 2024 is a pretty good phone in its own right. The design and the vegan leather back are simply stunning to look at <em>and</em> to hold, delivering a classic elegance not expected from a smartphone. The display looks great in any light and it&apos;s incredibly eye-friendly thanks to Motorola&apos;s flicker-reduction option. Plus, it charges fast, has great battery life, and sports Motorola updated UI, powered by Android 14.</p><p>But at $550, it&apos;s impossible to recommend over the competition for almost any reason. Sure, Motorola Smart Connect is a great utility that you won&apos;t find on a OnePlus or Google Pixel phone but that&apos;s about where Motorola&apos;s advantage ends. With a slower processor, worse camera experience, and fewer years of software support, I can&apos;t recommend the Motorola Edge 2024 at its full price.</p><p>If this phone was even just $100 less, it would be a lot easier to consider but that price is simply too high. Carriers in the U.S. often offer phones like this for <em>a lot</em> less, though, and that&apos;s where it starts to make more sense, especially if you&apos;re like me and find the displays of Google, Apple, and Samsung phones highly uncomfortable to look at.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>UGREEN is one of the largest charging accessory brands globally, and while its primary business is still around GaN chargers, it has branched out into power banks and power stations. The latter didn&apos;t see much momentum, so the brand has decided to not launch new products. However, it took the learnings from that category to create the 48000mAh Power Bank — its largest power bank yet.</p><p>What I like the most about the power bank is the size; it is larger and heavier than the 145W 25000mAh Power Bank, but considering you get nearly double the battery size, UGREEN did a phenomenal job with the overall design. The 48000mAh Power Bank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-300W-000mAh-Power-Bank/dp/B0CJY37RT3\">costs $199 on Amazon</a>, and there&apos;s an introductory deal that lets you buy the power bank at $139. UGREEN is running the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ugreen.com/products/ugreen-300w-48000mah-portable-charger-power-bank">deal on its website</a>, and you can get it for just $139 by using code <strong>PB300W</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bg8jes4U29u3WYPYim325e" name="ugreen-300w-power-bank-13.jpg" alt="UGREEN 300W 48000mAh Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bg8jes4U29u3WYPYim325e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Portability is a key selling point of this power bank, and that&apos;s assisted by the large carrying handle located up top — it allows you to easily take it anywhere. It isn&apos;t as versatile as a normal power bank, and you can&apos;t just throw it in a bag — the 48000mAh Power Bank weighs 4.1lb (1.8kg). That said, you don&apos;t notice the heft as much, and the carrying handle makes a difference in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pg3vmbJovhhxNYNDVsMZdd" name="ugreen-300w-power-bank-11.jpg" alt="UGREEN 300W 48000mAh Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pg3vmbJovhhxNYNDVsMZdd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power bank has rubber feet at the bottom, and it stays planted on a desk. Just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-revodok-max-213-thunderbolt-4-dock-review">Revodok Max 213</a>, you get rubber feet at the back, and you can use the power bank facing up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="K6rbQXzonCBX7hao3ufngb" name="ugreen-300w-power-bank-4.jpg" alt="UGREEN 300W 48000mAh Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6rbQXzonCBX7hao3ufngb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design is similar to what you get on most UGREEN products, with the power bank decked out in a dark grey color scheme that looks good. The chassis is made out of plastic, and the build quality is outstanding — as you&apos;d imagine for a product in this segment. The front is dominated by a panel that shows battery charge level, and you get indicators for in and out — these show real-time charging stats.</p>

<p>The 48000mAh Power Bank includes two USB-A ports — with each going up to 22.5W — but it&apos;s the three USB-C ports that will get the most amount of use. All three are based on the USB PD 3.1 standard, and two ports go up to 100W. The main USB-C port is the default way to charge the power bank, and what&apos;s great about this port is that it hits 140W. You can not only charge the power bank at 140W, but also use the port as an output, giving you the ability to charge just about any device.</p>

<p>You get a button at the front to manually switch the unit on or off, and on the whole, UGREEN nailed the design and build quality. A particularly useful addition is a large LED light that&apos;s located to the left, and it has three modes: medium, high intensity, and strobing. The light is definitely handy if you&apos;re using the power bank outdoors, and it gets <em>very </em>bright.</p>

<p>The biggest differentiator with the power bank is the 48000mAh battery, and it is able to charge any gadget several times over. I used it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, Honor MagicBook 16, and to charge another power bank, and it was terrific throughout.</p>

<p>I didn&apos;t pay much attention to efficiency figures in the past, buy that&apos;s something I&apos;m changing with the 48000mAh Power Bank. Because of the way charging works in general, power banks aren&apos;t inherently efficient, so in this instance, even though you get a 48000mAh battery, the efficiency is around the 55% figure. The battery went down by a margin of 8500mAh to charge a 4500mAh device, and 10500mAh to charge a phone with a 5500mAh battery.</p>
<p>This is true of all power banks in general; you usually get an efficiency of 60% to 65% at most, and that&apos;s down to factors like charging voltages and heat transfer. Other recent power banks I&apos;ve used went up to the 60% mark, but not beyond that.</p>

<p>To UGREEN&apos;s credit, the brand is using LiFePO4 batteries on the 48000mAh Power Bank, so they should last a long time without noticeable degradation. They also have better density, and that&apos;s what allows the power bank to be smaller than its alternatives. UGREEN notes that the batteries can hold up to an 80% charge after 3,000 charge cycles, and that&apos;s nearly three times as durable as traditional Lithium-ion batteries.</p>

<p>There are five charging ports in total, and you can use the 48000mAh Power Bank to charge up to five devices at the same time. The power budget varies significantly based on how many devices are being charged simultaneously, and with all ports in use, you get a total 130W of addressable power. The best use case is to use the three USB-C ports at once, and in this scenario, you get 300W — 100W via each port.</p>

<p>As you can use 140W to charge the power bank itself, it doesn&apos;t take as long to charge the 48000mAh battery. In my testing, the battery hit a full charge in just over 100 minutes, and that&apos;s more than adequate. The only issue I have in this area is that there isn&apos;t much in the way of accessories; you get a single 240W USB-C to USB-C cable, and that&apos;s it. UGREEN makes some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-gan-chargers">best GaN chargers</a>, and while including the 140W Nexode would have increased the cost of the power bank, the brand should have at least bundled more cables in the package.</p>
<p>If you need a power bank with a particularly large battery and want a product with portability in mind, the 48000mAh Power Bank is now the go-to choice.</p>

A few brands do it, except Jabra is the only one on the higher end that consistently does so. Its Active earbuds continue to provide excellent results, and that&apos;s very much the case with the Elite 8 Active Gen 2.</p><p>By their name, these earbuds carry on from their predecessors and add a few new improvements to the mix. However, a solid pair of ruggedized earbuds gets overshadowed by Jabra&apos;s decision to move on from its earbuds business, but that still doesn&apos;t really change how viable these are.</p>

They start at $230, though discounts aren&apos;t out of the question down the line now that Jabra is pulling out of its consumer business and will no longer make earbuds. Jabra confirms it will keep supporting its existing lineup of Elite earbuds with updates and warranty commitments for years to come. They come in black, navy, coral, and olive.</p>

<p>The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 may not have everything their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-gen-2-review">Elite 10 Gen 2</a> siblings do, but they may be the more appealing of the two for a couple of reasons. First is durability. While the Elite 10 Gen 2 boast an impressive IP57 rating for any pair of flagship earbuds, the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 take both dust and water resistance further with IP68 protection. It&apos;s rare enough to find rugged earbuds, but it&apos;s another to find a pair that does so many things well. You could be hiking up a mountain or splashing into a pool, and there wouldn&apos;t be a problem. Dealing with sweat is just part of the deal here.</p><p>That&apos;s where the second reason comes in: the durability makes the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 more compelling as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout earbuds</a>. Much like their predecessors, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-review">first-gen Elite 8 Active</a>, Jabra wisely chose to stick with a design formula that simply works. A rubberized matte finish handles water so well that it slides off the coating. </p><p>I wish Jabra applied 100% coverage with this material but it basically took the same approach as it did with the first-gen Elite 8 Active and left a sizeable inner portion more exposed. Granted, that doesn&apos;t necessarily pose a danger because dust and water resistance apply equally here, but it still would&apos;ve been nice to see here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ezJiHueGcaESSy4BdgCCkc" name="Jabra-Elite-8-Active-Gen-2-wearing.jpg" alt="Wearing Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ezJiHueGcaESSy4BdgCCkc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sticking with a familiar design bodes well for fit and comfort. These are some of the most comfortable and stable earbuds available, in my opinion, having worn and tested hundreds of wireless earbuds at this point. You get three ear tip sizes to choose from to find the best, snuggest fit for your ears. One more size would&apos;ve been nice, like an extra-large or extra-small, though.</p><p>A tighter seal is critical to getting the most out of the onboard active noise cancelation (ANC), and that&apos;s no different here. It&apos;s also crucial to the sound, especially if you&apos;re looking to wear these during a run or workout and want to trap in as much bass as possible. </p><p>The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 have smaller 6mm drivers compared to the 10mm ones in the Elite 10 Gen 2, so they work harder to play the same tunes. However, the tuning isn&apos;t different, and you can always tweak the EQ in Jabra&apos;s Sound+ app to deliver a balanced sound. </p>

<p>Truth be told, there&apos;s no major difference in how music generally sounds through these buds, though changes do occur under certain circumstances. Improved ANC, particularly in lower and mid-range frequencies, helps drown out more background noise to let audio playback feel more resonant. </p><p>It largely works efficiently. I can&apos;t tell you the ANC is twice as good as Jabra claims, but it is more refined this time. It does better with street noise and wind, though phone calls in windy conditions still pose a challenge sometimes. I was more impressed with HearThrough, where ambient sounds come through much clearer than before, making it more natural to hear an announcement or chat with someone without removing the buds. </p><p>The bigger deal is the fact the charging case also acts as a Bluetooth LE smart case. It works with the LC3 codec, so once you use the included cable and plug in via USB-C or 3.5mm to a playback device, it streams the audio to the earbuds. On a plane, this feels like magic, even if Jabra is hardly the first to ever do it. Same with a TV, where keeping quiet could mean the difference between happiness and misery. It&apos;s also gold with laptops or tablets where latency and audio/video sync might be a concern. It doesn&apos;t even need any setup; just plug in, hold the button on the case until a white light appears, and you&apos;re good. </p>

<p>As always, Jabra offers a significant level of granular control in the Sound+ app, letting you adjust the controls (which still work well as physical buttons), set up Spotify Tap, and update the firmware, among other things. You just have to dig a little to see where everything is if you&apos;re new to Jabra&apos;s earbuds.</p><p>Spatial sound is more front and center as a feature, and it&apos;s OK. Not great, nor terrible. One reason is that it&apos;s Dolby Audio rather than Atmos, giving you Dolby&apos;s more general spatial audio tech. As such, there&apos;s no head tracking as the Elite 10 Gen 2 have, and the effect feels less substantial here, anyway. I chose to leave it off most of the time, particularly for music, and I only tried it again when watching a show or movie.</p>

<p>Jabra gets other things right, like the wear sensors, where taking an earbud off pauses playback or mutes a call, or using only one earbud automatically turns on HearThrough. Multipoint connections also let you pair with two devices simultaneously, making the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 buds just as useful in an office situation. </p><p>On paper, battery life is rated at up to eight hours per charge with ANC on or up to 14 hours with it off. That&apos;s all based on default volume levels, so if you crank these up, you&apos;re never hitting those numbers. I easily got above seven hours at about 60% volume—and spatial audio off—so the batteries in both buds hold up well. The case offers an extra three full charges, and since it also supports wireless charging and a five-minute quick charge, the conveniences add up.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-what-s-not-good"><span>Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2: What's not good</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1690px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BnbubVXMiWe9jNkXZ2xmqa" name="Jabra-Elite-8-Active-Gen-2-close-up.jpg" alt="Close-up of Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 earbud in ear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BnbubVXMiWe9jNkXZ2xmqa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1690" height="951" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I still don&apos;t understand Jabra&apos;s motivation for not supporting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res audio codecs</a>. Here, you only get SBC and AAC. Still no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">aptX</a>, LDAC, or LHDC, to name a key few. You could argue hi-res tracks are less relevant for more active-focused earbuds, but I don&apos;t see why running or working out suddenly negates such a feature. Jabra did the same with the Elite 10 Gen 2—a missed opportunity for both pairs.</p><p>Perhaps it&apos;s a moot point anyway, considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/gn-kills-jabra-elite-and-talk-products">company is leaving its consumer business behind</a>. The shocking exit comes at a time when it seemed Jabra was still top-class in the category. Its hearing aid and enterprise businesses make more money, so in a tighter and tighter consumer market for wireless earbuds, Jabra&apos;s decision-makers made what was very likely a pure business decision. </p><p>It&apos;s just odd for a brand to launch a key product and then step away from the entire business altogether. On the bright side, Jabra will continue to support its consumer audio products for "years" to come with updates and warranties, and given its track record that way, I&apos;m inclined to believe it.</p>

<p>Despite Jabra&apos;s surprising move, the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 deserve to be mentioned along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>. Certainly, if you were looking at the best earbuds for workouts, they would be at the top of the list. If you feel you could do without the improved ANC and HearThrough, you&apos;ll find similar comfort and durability with the previous Elite 8 Active. If you wanted good durability with additional features and the same fit, the Elite 10 Gen 2 are an excellent choice. </p><p>When it comes to other brands, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a> don&apos;t have dust resistance but their IPX7 protection is pretty rugged for sweat and water. For a pair with ear hooks and much cheaper price, you could look at the Treblab X3 Pro or JBL Endurance Peak 3. </p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want rugged durability.</li>
  <li>You want good sound with ANC support.</li>
  <li>You want a comfortable fit with physical buttons.</li>
  <li>You want an EQ to work with.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You really want hi-res audio codecs.</li>
  <li>You don&apos;t need spatial audio.</li>
  <li>You&apos;re on a tighter budget.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>As I already pointed out, it&apos;s strange for a brand to launch a key product and turn away from the entire business at the same time. That&apos;s where we are with the Elite 8 Active Gen 2—putting consumers in a tough spot. But despite the unusual situation, I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to recommend these earbuds simply because they don&apos;t have many rugged competitors. And definitely not of this quality. Plus, Jabra is still manufacturing them to accommodate retail demand. </p><p>They are a very iterative upgrade over their predecessors, though. Unless you&apos;re really particular about noise cancelation, HearThrough, and really want the Bluetooth LE feature in the case, you won&apos;t go wrong with the previous pair, either.</p>

The first look shows that green bubbles are still used to identify texts from Android users despite RCS—as<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone#section-update"> expected</a>. Apparently, Android users can send RCS messages to iPhone users in individual and group chats. Additionally, the X user states that higher-quality audio files, photos, and other forms of media can be shared via these chats. </p><p>However, it appears Apple has a lot of work to do when it comes to RCS. Firstly, there is a lack of E2EE (end-to-end encryption) in group chats, something that was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-rcs-group-chat-e2ee">implemented in Android last year</a>. Emoji reactions continue to be an iPhone user thing, as only they get to see a "proper" reaction to messages. If an iMessage user reacts to an Android user&apos;s message, the green bubble user will receive a new message saying "Liked," followed by their text in quotes.</p><p>Replying to a specific message continues to be a challenge for both Android and Apple users, as they don&apos;t have the option to do so. Another thing to note is that RCS is limited to iPhones on T-Mobile and AT&T networks at the moment.</p>

A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1di5mz5/comment/l91rrqr/" target="_blank">thread on Reddit</a> highlighted that these cancellations were linked to users resorting to VPN services in order to score cheaper rates by taking advantage of regional pricing loopholes.</p><p>To illustrate the price difference, a Premium subscription costs Rs.129 ($1.54) per month in India, whereas it normally costs $13.99 in the US. Some use YouTube Premium for a fraction of the cost in their home market. Although the subscription worked fine after the initial VPN trick, Google seems to be aware of this loophole and is going after these users.</p><p>In response, Google indirectly confirmed to Android Central that it&apos;s tightening its reigns and that "to provide the most accurate plans and offers available, we have systems in place to determine the country of our users," the spokesperson said. "In instances where the signup country does not match where the user is accessing YouTube, we&apos;re asking members to update their billing information to their current country of residence."</p>

Google is now allowing enrolled testers to have single-step sign-in capabilities through biometrics like facial recognition, fingerprint, or screen lock. Previously, users were given two sub-menus: one asking about a "saved passkey" and another for their biometrics. Users will now see one unified sub-menu detailing the service they&apos;re signing into, a prompt for their fingerprint, or the option to use a PIN.</p><p>Android 15 Beta 3 wants app developers to prepare their products, libraries, tools, and game engines for Android 15. Google hopes this will prepare their apps for the new "FLAG_STOPPED" changes that ensure apps don&apos;t run until a user&apos;s manual input is detected. Support for 16KB pages, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/gmail-gets-predictive-back-feature-on-android-14">predictive back animations</a>, and support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">Private Spaces</a> are items to keep an eye out for. </p><p>Android 15 Beta 3 is rolling out now to all enrolled testers and supported devices.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There&apos;s been a thought bouncing around in my head about the state of tablets. I&apos;ve talked about how stale the category is and how there&apos;s a definite need for a change in the space. It&apos;s part of the reason why I decided to upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-should-think-different-with-ipad-pro">M4 iPad Pro</a>, just because I thought Apple would have something to blow our minds with iPadOS 18 at WWDC.</p><p>Since then, I have been thinking that Samsung got the formula right, specifically with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a>. If you want smaller tablets, there are plenty to choose from. They probably won&apos;t have all the bells and whistles, but they&apos;ll get the job done for whatever you need.</p><p>So, while I&apos;ve been on the hunt for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablet</a>, maybe it&apos;s been right in front of me this whole time. It&apos;s not perfect, not by any means. For one, using it as in vertical orientation in any scenario is laughable. I&apos;m also still scratching my head and wondering why a tablet of this caliber doesn&apos;t include an option for cellular connectivity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Kbsrw9dS4aUQ8j8Mx28EHP" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-in-lap-in-car.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra in lap" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kbsrw9dS4aUQ8j8Mx28EHP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And I&apos;m still not the biggest fan of the keyboard case, as it just isn&apos;t great to use in my lap. If I can set it up on a table or at a desk, then it&apos;s perfect, but Samsung needs to borrow some notes from Apple or Microsoft for its next tablet keyboard.</p><p>Setting all of that aside, there&apos;s nothing that can rival the versatility of what the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra offers. It&apos;s fantastic as an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-samsung-phone-tablet-second-screen-windows">extra monitor</a> for my desktop PC thanks to the <em>huge</em> AMOLED screen. I just prop it up below my main monitor, and everything pretty much just works.</p><p>Using it this way also makes it easy to just use it as an Android tablet if I need to try something out or if I want to just watch a video while I&apos;m eating lunch. The Tab S9 Ultra is also arguably the ultimate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handheld</a>—and yes, I mean handheld.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fr8qS98NFcVBhfm5hidqJh" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-gamesir-galileo-g8.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra with the GameSir G8 Galileo controller attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fr8qS98NFcVBhfm5hidqJh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For one, it&apos;s powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, has plenty of RAM, and plenty of storage thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot. This makes everything so much easier, as I don&apos;t need to worry about not having enough storage for everything at a time when companies are stripping away expandable storage on more and more devices. As for being a handheld, I usually keep the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-galileo-review">GameSir Galileo G8</a> nearby so I can use it as an oversized screen to play games without relying on a Bluetooth controller. Sure, it looks goofy, but who cares if it works?</p><p>What really made me realize that the Tab S9 Ultra is the perfect tablet for me is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a>. Apple&apos;s implementation of a multi-window interface is just downright awful. Don&apos;t get me wrong; it definitely works, but only within the confines of what Apple deems the proper way to use multiple apps.</p><p>I don&apos;t have to fiddle with anything or try to jump through a bunch of hoops to use my tablet as a laptop. Just tap the button or connect the keyboard, and I&apos;m there. All of the apps that I install work just as I&apos;d expected, even the ones that didn&apos;t want to work with adjustable windows in the past.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4F4fxe5rmX8heyzJtRijaM" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-dex-mode-standalone.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra in DeX Mode on desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4F4fxe5rmX8heyzJtRijaM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If I&apos;m away from home and my desktop is turned on, I can turn the Tab S9 Ultra into a proper laptop, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://parsec.app/">Parsec</a>. There are a bunch of other apps that do the same thing, but Parsec has been the most stable for me. When I&apos;m done, I just close Parsec and go back to whatever I was doing.</p><p>Usually, it&apos;s just transferring files that aren&apos;t stored in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">NAS</a>, but it&apos;s nice having this flexibility. Meanwhile, you can&apos;t even get Parsec on the iPad, and the other solutions don&apos;t work nearly as well for me.</p><p>This is to say that sometimes, it&apos;s better to take a step back and reevaluate the devices you already have before trying to make reasons for replacing them. The M4 iPad Pro is great, but what I already had with me is just as great and perhaps even better.</p>
