<ul><li>Google introduced the Google Developer Program earlier this year at Google I/O 2024, offering a free tier for development and learning.</li><li>Now, there's a Google Developer Program Premium tier available at a cost of $299 per year.</li><li>Among other things, the premium membership gives developers up to $1,000 in Google Cloud credits and one-on-one consultations.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google launched the Google Developer Program at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">I/O 2024</a> developer conference this year, and it already has millions of free members. Now, the company is adding a paid Google Developer Program Premium tier to its offerings, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-the-google-developer-program-premium/" target="_blank">blog post</a> Wednesday, Nov. 25. The new tier costs $299 per year and builds off of the free, standard tier that is still available.</p><p>The standard Google Developer Program membership is still a great starter option for developers. It offers Gemini developer documentation and tools, 35 Cloud Learning credits monthly, three additional IDX workspaces, progress tracking, and badge-unlocking. Meanwhile, the paid premium tier is an add-on for developers who find themselves using a lot of Google Cloud and AI tools, some of which are already pay-to-access.</p><p>Specifically, the $299 membership provides a $500 credit for use in Google Cloud, for services like Gemini Code Assist, Firebase, and Vertex AI. Paid members can earn an additional $500 in credits, for a total of $1,000 for year, by earning a Google Cloud certification. The membership itself includes a Google Cloud certification voucher, which Google says has a $200 retail value, that will let you earn the certification without paying more than your membership fee.</p>

<p>The tier includes access to all the training paths available through Google Cloud Skills Boost. Finally, paid members can book half or full-hour consultations with Google's specialists, which the company says may be a good option for when developers want help or expert feedback.</p><p>Google's Developer Program Premium tier may seem expensive, especially when compared with Apple's $99 membership fee for the Apple Developer Program. However, the two membership offerings couldn't be more different. The standard Google Developer Program membership, which is free, should provide everything developers need to learn and build their apps. The premium tier may be better viewed as a more affordable way to access Google Cloud services, certifications, and learning tools at a discounted rate.</p>

<p>Raycon is venturing into uncharted territories with some of its new releases. The brand's Magic Flex Cable 6-in-1 and Magic Spin Cable try to re-invent the wheel by adding moving parts to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cable</a>. Crazy as it may sound, it works!</p><p>I didn't expect a brand that usually makes budget-friendly audio accessories like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> and headphones to make good cables. Yes, it's a tech company, but the audio and charging sectors are quite different.</p><p>Anker seems to manage and excel in both sectors. Raycon is no Anker in terms of audio gadgets, but the brand's USB cables are just as good as those of the well-established charging and audio accessory brand.</p>

<p>I'm not going to lie; I wasn't immediately impressed with the Magic Flex Cable 6-in-1. At first, I thought it was just an ordinary nylon braided USB cable. I didn't read the instructions and kept wondering why Raycon sent me a Lightning cable. Then, I looked at the instruction manual.</p><p>The clever Magic Flex Cable 6-in-1 comes in 6.6ft and 0.5ft lengths. I was sent the longer variant for testing. It is rated 100W so you can easily fast charge a laptop, smartphone, or literally anything without worrying about charging speeds or power load compatibility issues, so long as you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">wall charger</a> that supports such speeds.</p>

<p>The insanely cool part comes in when you look at the connectors. At first, you'd think the Raycon Magic Flex Cable 6-in-1 is a typical USB-A to Lightning cable. However, each of the connectors' heads pop out to reveal a Type-C connector on the bottom. The cable comes with built-in converters, and they can slide on or off as quickly as blinking. If you're wondering, it's impossible to lose the swappable connectors because they're attached to the base USB-C connector.</p><p>On top of that, the nylon braided 100W cable has a flat shape, much like fettuccine pasta. This makes it easier to tuck away the flat cable. Since both connectors are magnetic, they automatically stick together and prevent tangles.</p><p>Every aspect of the cable's design is so well thought out, from the changeable connectors to their magnetic nature.</p>

<p>Raycon also launched another interesting USB-C cable called the Magic Spin Cable. This cord comes in either 3ft or 6.6ft sizes and is also rated 100W. I love that this cable has the same rugged nylon braided exterior layer as the Raycon Magic Flex Cable 6-in-1.</p><p>The Raycon Magic Spin Cable doesn't have exchangeable connectors. You can choose between a USB-C to USB-C cable or a USB-C to Lightning cable. I tried both and they're identical in every way, except for the connectors of course.</p>

<p>Each head of the Raycon Magic Spin Cable has a little lightning bolt-shaped LED light that lights up when in use. The connector has an extremely rare mechanism that allows for 180-degree rotation without breakage.</p><p>It prevents your phone from getting stuck at awkward angles while charging or while transferring data. There's even a smart chip inside the cable to enable intelligent heat management.</p><p>The moving USB-C connector blew my mind. In fact, I'm still not over it. Raycon's concoction made me ask myself why isn't every cable like this. With specs like these, you wouldn't need to upgrade your cable for many years to come.</p>

<hr>
<p>Both cables are exceedingly well-designed and priced competitively. The build quality is on par with the best-name brands like Anker and UGREEN. Nylon braided cables easily last years at a stretch. If you want a new USB-C cable, either one will fulfill your needs.</p><p>If push came to shove, I'd give the Raycon Magic Flex Cable 6-in-1 the edge over the Raycon Magic Spin Cable, though. This is because it comes with swappable connectors, making it more versatile. You can use the Magic Flex Cable with a lot more devices.</p><p>I had good fun playing around with these cables. If anything, it was enjoyable looking at my friends and family's reactions to these swappable and spinning USB cables. With the holidays around the corner, these are excellent stocking stuffers.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Gemini version 1.0.686588308 adds a new Android share screen shortcut.</li><li>It lets users share at least ten files directly from the app with the AI assistant to analyze them and give summaries.</li><li>Previously, users had to open the Gemini app every time they added documents via the "Plus" icon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The latest update to Gemini is making it easy to share files with the assistant from any app.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-gemini-android-share-sheet-3502006/">Android Authority</a> notes that Google has recently updated the Gemini app, which allows users to share documents or relevant files even easier with the AI assistant to analyze them. The documents here can include long-form PDF files, spreadsheets, text documents, and several other formats.</p>
<p>Previously, users who wanted to share files with Gemini to analyze them and get summaries had to open up the Gemini app and hit the "Plus" icon to add files from their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>'s file library or Google Drive.</p><p>The new update, however, makes the process easier as users can hit the share button directly from their respective files app. That's because the latest app version adds a Gemini shortcut directly to the Android share sheet, to which files can be added quite easily. The functionality can be seen live in action per the video shared by the publication:</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MaAsMzcVt1g" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Additionally, users can add multiple files with the new share screen, and the publication notes that they can add at least ten files simultaneously to the Gemini app. It has also listed the attachment types/ extensions that are supported for Gemini to analyze, which comprises TXT, CPP, PY, JAVA, PHP, SQL, HTML, DOC, DOCX, PDF, RTF, DOT, DOTX, HWP, HWPX, CSV, TSV, XLS, XLSX, and documents and spreadsheets created via Google Docs and Google Sheets, respectively.</p><p>If you are a Gemini app user and want to try out the new functionality, ensure you are on the latest Gemini <strong>v1.0.686588308</strong> version, as the feature is believed to be live on the respective version.</p><p>While the new ability is a welcome addition, it comes right after the Gemini app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-on-iphone-dedicated-app-launch">ventured into iPhones</a> recently with Imagen 3 and app extensions.</p>

<p>Viture One is still my favorite pair of smart display glasses to this day as I find them to be the most comfortable for my eyes, and being more cost-efficient than Viture Pro helps a lot, too. These come with a handy USB-C cable that you can plug into any device with USB-C display output support, which means most laptops, smartphones, and even devices like the Steam Deck.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You do a lot of work away from a desk or play a lot of handheld games on a Steam Deck or similar system. Better than most other smart display glasses because they use DC dimming at high brightness and have built-in myopia adjustment wheels for each lens.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You work on spreadsheets most of the day. Viture Pro are better for this kind of work because they fix the edge blurring these glasses have.</p><p>I've used Viture One glasses more times than I can count for work and play alike. I've worked on a plane for hours without neck pain and then used the handy gaming dock to plug them into my Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck, adding hours to each console's battery life.</p><p>As I said before, these will work natively with the Steam Deck's USB-C port on the top but you'll need a mobile dock to make it work with a Nintendo Switch. Thankfully, that mobile dock is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Nintendo-Switch-Handheld-Consoles-Chromecast/dp/B0CG65NRPL"><strong>on sale for $79</strong></a> for Black Friday, making it nearly 40% off. If you don't have the glasses yet, it's cheaper to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM8MGX9F/?th=1">mobile dock + glasses bundle</a> than to buy them separately.</p><p>It's a huge battery, so it not only gets you the highest resolution output for a Nintendo Switch by tricking it into thinking it's docked on a TV, but it also adds a few hours of extra battery life for long flights.</p><p>If you're looking for the cream-of-the-crop from Viture, though, look no further than Viture Pro smart glasses.</p>

<p>Viture Pro upgrades the Viture experience with a brighter 120Hz OLED display that's got much clearer edges. This pair is designed for the person who will only settle for the best, but getting $100 off during this Black Friday sale makes them a lot more budget-friendly than usual.</p><p>Viture has also just launched at Best Buy, making these the <em>first</em> smart display glasses ever carried by the company's many physical stores. That means you can drive over to a location and grab a pair <strong>today</strong>. Better yet, they're also on sale for the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/viture-pro-xr-glasses-black/6607570.p?skuId=6607570"><strong>$399 price</strong></a> that Amazon is offering.</p><p>All of Viture's glasses work with the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academy.viture.com/xr_glasses/spacewalker_android">Spacewalker app</a> which is available for all major computing platforms today. That app makes it possible to "float" the virtual monitors so you can look around without the display being in front of your face all the time. Some people like this better than others, but it's a cool option to have that doesn't cost anything extra.</p><p>While we're on the topic of add-ons, Viture just opened up preorders for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://neckband.viture.com/">Viture Pro Neckband</a>. This comfy accessory turns any pair of Viture glasses into a full fledged computing device. It's even Google Play certified, meaning you can download any Android app to it and run it in 3D space, freeing up your phone or laptop battery to do other things.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="chfimmXduWQT7mPbpgY9Kj" name="Viture-pro-glasses-ultimate-pack-neckband-battery-controller" alt="Official promotional imagery for Viture Pro and Viture Neckband" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/chfimmXduWQT7mPbpgY9Kj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Viture)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Viture Pro Neckband's design is similar to Viture's other neckband and features comfortable nonslip padding to keep it on your neck. It's also got a big battery that provides hours of entertainment as well as hand tracking support for convenient use.</p><p>This one's a direct answer to Xreal's phone-like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreals-new-ar-glass-companion-brings-android-apps-to-life-in-3d">Beam Pro</a> and provides a more hands-free experience than Xreal's design. Given that the neckband sits around your neck instead of taking up room in another pocket — plus a shorter cord — it might be the superior option when it launches in the coming weeks.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I don&apos;t generally use external storage that much — I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/i-set-up-the-ultimate-home-nas-with-over-100tb-of-storage">100TB home server</a> — but I&apos;ll admit that having an external SSD is the easiest way to carry plenty of data on the go. In fact, that&apos;s what I did when I traveled earlier in the month; I downloaded about 300GB of data onto an SSD, and it was significantly easier than having to transfer said data into my phone.</p><p>I have over a dozen external drives, and while I&apos;m keen on stick-based SSDs like SK Hynix&apos;s Tube T31 (which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-1000MB-External-Compatible/dp/B0CQZCWHTQ">is on sale</a>, by the way), Orico&apos;s latest product may just be one of the best I&apos;ve ever used. It&apos;s called the A20 Plus, and it is basically a standard external SSD with a unique difference: it has strong magnets on one side, and attaches to the back of your phone.</p><p>The addition of magnets makes it a great choice if you&apos;re looking to extend the storage of your phone. I used the external SSD with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and didn&apos;t run into any issues whatsoever. The best part is that there&apos;s a magnetic ring bundled with the package, so you can attach it to any case (or phone back) with relative ease.</p><p>I&apos;ve been using the 1TB model of the A20 Plus, and it usually costs $109 — it&apos;s now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D95LJ6XB">down to $87 ahead of Black Friday</a>, and you can get an additional 15% by using the code <strong>FRZQS9NQ</strong>, bringing it down to just $73. That&apos;s a fantastic deal on what is a standout SSD, and if you need more storage, there&apos;s a 2TB model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D95LL835">that&apos;s down to $135</a>. If you don&apos;t want as much storage, the base 512GB edition is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D95KH1ZL">just $46 right now</a>.</p>

<p>Orico's external SSD is just as small as other external SSDs, and you get a strong magnetic connection that ensures it doesn't dangle when used with a phone. It's available in 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB variants, and you can save an additional 15% when you use the code <strong>FRZQS9NQ</strong>.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D95KH1ZL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="092d592e-dd25-46d8-b636-1af7462bb184" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Orico A20 Plus Magnetic SSD (512GB): $69 $46 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Orico A20 Plus Magnetic SSD (512GB): $69 $46 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The biggest differentiator with the A20 Plus is that it uses a USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 connector, so it is able to deliver 20Gbps bandwidth — double that of most external SSDs. The standard isn&apos;t widely used, and there aren&apos;t many Windows machines that leverage it. That said, I was able to easily get 10Gbps bandwidth when connecting the drive to my Windows gaming rig, and it held its own against the likes of Crucial&apos;s X10 Pro.</p><p>But the key use case with this drive is to extend your phone storage, and given the bandwidth, you can easily shoot ProRes video on the iPhone 16 Pro Max at 4K60 and save footage onto the drive without any issues. I didn&apos;t see any problems connecting the drive to Android devices, and having used it with the Pixel 9 Pro XL and the Find X8 Pro, it does a great job in this regard.</p><p>The A20 Plus has a plastic chassis, and it weathered tumbles without any problems. The drive is lighter than its rivals, and that makes a difference in mobile use — and the fact that you can attach it to the back of your phone makes things tidier. The bundled cable has a decent amount of flex, and it has no issues with bandwidth.</p><p>Overall, the A20 Plus is one of the best ways to extend the storage of your phone, and with the Black Friday sale now live, this is the best time to pick up the drive. If you don&apos;t need that much storage, the 500GB model is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D95KH1ZL">stellar deal at just $45</a>.</p>

<p>It might seem odd to compare Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra at this point in time, considering that the former isn't even official yet. However, thanks to a steady stream of leaks and rumors, we have a fairly good idea as to what to expect from the S25 line-up. As the next standard-bearer of Samsung's slab-style flagship family, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to pack a number of noticeable design improvements over the soon-to-be previous-gen model. And, of course, you can expect the latest and greatest in terms of hardware, cameras, and software as well.</p>

<p>But just how significant are all these speculative upgrades? Are they really worth waiting until January 2025? Or should you simply go ahead and get the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is—and is likely to remain, at least for a few years—one of the most feature-packed Android smartphones out there? Let's find out.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra: Design and display</h2>
<p>Over the last few years, the design language of all three members of the Galaxy S series has remained quite consistent. Furthermore, the 'Ultra' model has always been easily distinguishable from its two younger siblings, primarily because of those right-angled corners and a slightly curved frame. However, things could finally change in 2025 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cJgunLzMZSirHU5Rxjmk7N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-back-titanium-03.jpg" alt="The back of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in the Titanium Grey colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJgunLzMZSirHU5Rxjmk7N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design" target="_blank">recently leaked renders</a> are to be believed, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will come with more rounded corners, even though they won't be nearly as rounded as the corners of the Galaxy S25 and the Galaxy S25 Plus. Add a fully flat frame to the mix, and the Galaxy S25 trio could finally have a unified design language across the board. The renders also highlight changes to the rear camera array, with the individual lenses now being surrounded by thicker, ribbed rings similar to the ones on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. However, according to another leaker, the design of the primary camera setup could see some tweaks.</p>
<p>Samsung's Ultra phones have always been big (at least when compared to the other two members of the line-up) , and the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be no different. That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-dimensions-leak" target="_blank">another rumor says</a> that the phone will be not only be slightly taller, but also a little narrower and thinner, as well as lighter in comparison to its predecessor.</p>

<p>The display is likely to remain unchanged, but considering that the 6.8-inch LTPO Dynamic AMOLED screen of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> is one of the most gorgeous-looking panels on any smartphone in the market, that's not a bad thing. All other goodies such as Corning's Gorilla Armor protection and an anti-reflective coating are expected to be carried forward as well, albeit with minor improvements.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra-hardware-and-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra: Hardware and cameras</h2>
<p>A smartphone this 'Ultra' needs equally 'Elite' innards, which is why it's all but certain that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be driven by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, Qualcomm's newest top-of-the-line chipset. The company could also use its own Exynos 2500 SoC for some regional models, as has been the case in the past. That said, there are a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-models-to-opt-for-flagship-exynos-soc-again" target="_blank">conflicting reports</a> going around regarding this, so we'll only know for sure once Samsung makes things official.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Infographic" alt="The final Qualcomm infographic for the Snapdragon 8 Elite showing its overall performance gains compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even though the Exynos 2500 is likely going to be quite a capable chipset when it launches, we're not sure if it'll be any match for Snapdragon 8 Elite, which is a whole different beast altogether. Undeniably the most powerful mobile SoC ever made for Android smartphones, the platform uses a custom Oryon CPU with prime cores that can hit up to 4.32GHz of clock speeds.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip" target="_blank">According to Qualcomm</a>, this should result in a performance boost of up to 45 percent in comparison to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> platform, which powers the Galaxy S24 Ultra. It's also expected that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be offered with up to 16GB of RAM, a noteworthy upgrade over the 12GB that the previous-gen model maxes out at. Onboard storage configurations are likely to remain the same, with 1TB being the highest option.</p>
<p>While all that's great, it's worth mentioning that Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is—and will remain for quite some time—a powerhouse capable of handling everything you throw at it without breaking a sweat. The performance gains from the new hardware will primarily come in handy for things like faster on-device processing of AI-based tasks. It goes without saying that we'll only be able to comment on the Galaxy S25 Ultra's real-world performance improvements after it's launched and we put it through its paces.</p>
<p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra's quad-lens rear camera system makes it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera" target="_blank">best Android camera phones</a> you can buy right now. You get a 200MP wide-angle sensor with OIS, a 10MP telephoto module with 3x optical zoom, a 50MP periscope telephoto unit with 5x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide lens. Of course, there's also a diverse range of shooting modes, Galaxy AI-powered editing capabilities, and whatnot thrown into a mix.</p><p>In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review" target="_blank">dedicated Galaxy S24 Ultra camera review</a> of the device, Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich called the setup even better than what you get with a Google Pixel, which is arguably the highest praise any Android smartphone's camera(s) can get.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mvdmWH8T9nD4m2e9gW9nVQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-with-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-case-back-angle" alt="Comparing a Fiberborne Galaxy S25 Ultra case with a Galaxy S24 Ultra case and the Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mvdmWH8T9nD4m2e9gW9nVQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And you know what's the best part? The rumors claim that the Galaxy S25 Ultra's primary camera system is going to be largely the same, complete with Samsung's very own ISOCELL sensors. That's quite interesting, considering that the camera arrays of the other two members of the Galaxy S25 family <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-rumored-to-use-sony-sensors" target="_blank">are expected</a> to come with Sony sensors.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1073px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.92%;"><img id="53xsrHgfAhYnTg8D9Lvd7d" name="one-ui-7-quick-settings-panel-sdc-2024-demo.jpg" alt="Samsung had a demo of One UI 7 on an S24 Ultra, which showed off its revamped Quick Settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/53xsrHgfAhYnTg8D9Lvd7d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1073" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has been quite late to the software update party this time, with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review" target="_blank">Android 15</a> rollout yet to commence. This is primarily due to One UI 7—the next version of the company's custom UI overlay—which is going to be a massive overhaul packed with a plethora of cosmetic and functional changes. The wait is almost over, though, as One UI 7 will be finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-wont-hit-beta-until-end-of-this-year" target="_blank">making its debut alongside the Galaxy S25 trio</a> in January 2025.</p>
<p>Set to introduce a redesigned quick settings panel, updated icons, better animations, and even more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>-powered features with integrated parental controls, One UI 7 will surely go a long way in making the Galaxy S25 Ultra a productivity powerhouse. However, it's pointless to get the new phone just for its software, as the Galaxy S24 Ultra will eventually get the exact same experience via a future update. And thanks to Samsung's excellent support policy, both phones will likely be getting seven years of OS and security updates, so longevity is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Coming to endurance, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to have a 5,000mAh battery with support for 45W wired, as well as 15W wireless charging. If these numbers look familiar, it's because they're exactly the same specifications that the Galaxy S24 Ultra comes with.</p><p>Considering that you can get similar (or better) charging speeds even on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" target="_blank">Android phones costing hundreds of dollars less</a>, that's underwhelming. However, with the Galaxy S24 Ultra already having a two-day battery life, we're certain that the Galaxy S25 Ultra—with its power-efficient hardware—won't disappoint us, even if we take the slow charging speeds into account.</p>

<p>It's true that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is shaping up to be a solid upgrade over the device it'll eventually succeed. With a refreshed and slightly more compact chassis, top-of-the-line hardware, feature-laden software, and much more, it'll undeniably end up at the top of the mountain as far as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> are concerned, just like its predecessor.</p>
<p>But here's the thing! Samsung's upcoming top-tier smartphone will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-rumored-price-hike-sour" target="_blank">likely end up being more expensive</a> than the Galaxy S24 Ultra—which already costs a fortune—but might see a reduction in its price once the newer model is launched.</p>
<p>So, if you're in the market for a premium Android smartphone and can't wait until January 2025, we suggest getting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. It's a high-end device that'll continue to serve you well for years to come, even when it's no longer the newest thing in town. If you buy one during festive-season sales like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024">Black Friday</a>, you can even save a lot of cash.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you must have the freshest Android flagship and money is no object, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-should-you-wait">waiting for the Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is absolutely going to be worth it.</p>

<p>OPPO has followed up the Pad 3 Pro with a non-Pro variant, featuring the new MediaTek Dimensity 8350 SoC with an octa-core CPU.</p><p>The tablet's Pro variant debuted earlier this month, but the standard model was delayed because the official announcement of its chipset got pushed back.</p><p>The Pad 3 is the first worldwide to feature MediaTek's new Dimensity 8350 chipset, as per OPPO's announcement on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1710173801/P1Y6Jh74e" target="_blank">Weibo</a>. It’s paired with up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Oppo-Pad-3-launches-as-affordable-Android-tablet-with-new-Dimensity-SoC.923359.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>).</p><p>The MediaTek Dimensity 8350 is a powerhouse 4nm octa-core chip. It has a 3.35GHz Cortex-A715 core for heavy tasks, three more A715 cores for multitasking, and four A510 cores.</p><p>The SoC features MediaTek's StarSpeed Engine, which boosts gaming while saving power. It cuts overall power use by 10% and drops 24% during heavy gaming, making the Oppo Pad 3 a solid pick for gamers.</p><p>It sports an 11.61-inch 2.8K LCD display with a 2800 x 2000 resolution. It’s got a 144Hz variable refresh rate, 700 nits peak brightness, and a 7:5 aspect ratio.</p><p>The tablet also supports a stylus with a paper-like texture, making it feel just like writing on real paper.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I get to use dozens of earbuds over the course of the year, ranging from entry-level choices to high-end buds that cost well in excess of $1,000. What's interesting about the state of the audio category is that you don't need to pay much to get great sound — that's clearly the case with Tagry's X08 earbuds.</p><p>Tagry is a brand you won't be familiar with, but the Chinese manufacturer is gaining momentum thanks to the X08, a pair of budget earbuds that have a lot going for them. They include a 13mm driver that delivers an engaging sound, and they're available in nine vibrant color options.</p><p>You get additional extras: IPX5 water resistance, great battery life, seamless pairing, and even wireless charging. The X08 earbuds usually cost $35, but they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TAGRY-Bluetooth-Headphones-Earphones-Waterproof/dp/B09LD44NW6">down to $25 for Black Friday</a>, making them an instant recommendation. They're affordable enough that even if you don't need earbuds, they'll make the ideal stocking stuffer.</p>

They're easily one of the best budget earbuds around, and coming in at just $25, you're getting an unbeatable value.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/TAGRY-Bluetooth-Headphones-Earphones-Waterproof/dp/B09TZY6B27" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4ed40126-52f4-493f-91c9-15da6def5862" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$25 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$25 at Amazon" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Let's start with the sound, because that's where the X08 truly deliver their value. While you get great sound out of most $100 earbuds, that isn't always the case in the budget segment, but the X08 manage to produce a clean and vibrant sound signature with a good bass and mid-range clarity. The treble extension is decent as well, and at no point do you get the feeling that you're listening to a budget product.</p><p>I also like that the case has a tiny LED panel that shows real-time battery status of each earbud, and it shows when the buds are charging. I got just under six hours of battery life between charges, and the case's battery charges the buds four times over. And when you need to charge the case itself, you get wireless charging, which in itself is a big deal.</p><p>The earbuds have a lightweight design, and I didn't see any issues with the fit. The stalk-like body ensures they don't nuzzle into your ear too much, and while there's no noise isolation, the earbuds create a good seal, so ambient noise doesn't filter in that much.</p><p>Connectivity was great, and I had a solid signal in the time I used the buds with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>. There's no AptX or LDAC, but that isn't as big a limitation in this category, and you get IPX5, allowing these earbuds to be used during workouts. Another highlight is that you get to choose between nine exciting colors, allowing you to customize the outward design to a greater extent than most products in this category.</p><p>Ultimately, the fact that these earbuds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TAGRY-Bluetooth-Headphones-Earphones-Waterproof/dp/B09TZY6B27">cost just $25 right now</a> makes them an instant buy if you need new earbuds or are looking at budget-friendly gift ideas this holiday season.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A new Google Calendar update adds a full-screen task view, making it easier to manage and prioritize tasks.</li><li>The new Tasks icon in Calendar’s top bar lets you access your task list directly and mark tasks as done.</li><li>This update is rolling out to Google Workspace users, subscribers, and personal Google account holders, but only on Android for now.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/8-best-google-calendar-tips-hacks-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Calendar</a> update introduces a full-screen view for managing tasks, making it easier to prioritize and check off your to-dos.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/11/release-notes-11-22-2024.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Calendar app on Android now includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-calendar-tasks-full-screen-view">web version's task management features</a>, offering a full-screen view of all your tasks. This update helps you easily prioritize and track tasks, no matter when they’re due.</p><p>This means a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tasks">Google Tasks</a> icon now sits in the top bar of the Calendar app, between your profile icon and the Today button. Tapping it takes you to the standalone app’s home screen, where you can view undated tasks and lists, and mark them as done.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:470px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:207.66%;"><img id="bZz7emPUzhtjXB3iqbSa3V" name="Google-Calendar-full-Google-Tasks-integration" alt="full Google Tasks integration with Calendar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bZz7emPUzhtjXB3iqbSa3V.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="470" height="976" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Prior to this update, you could manage your to-dos in Tasks through Calendar, but the app had a big flaw on mobile: it didn’t let you see all your upcoming tasks in one view. Plus, it only showed tasks with due dates, leaving the rest hidden.</p><p>Now that Google Calendar has task and list views, the standalone Tasks app isn’t as needed. But it’s still handy for those who like the Tasks widget, giving quick access to lists and easy task creation right from the home screen.</p><p>While this deeper integration might add fuel to speculation that Google plans to shut down Tasks in the future, there’s no hint that it's going to be the case soon.</p><p>That said, Google isn’t exactly shy about ditching apps and products it’s lost interest in, so we can’t completely rule out that possibility.</p><p>After all, Tasks has been around for a while but still feels pretty basic. You can’t create smart lists, use tags, or add collaborators. Its only real perk is its seamless integration with Calendar, but that’s where it ends.</p><p>Google Calendar’s task integration is being made available to Google Workspace customers, Google Workspace Individual subscribers, and personal Google account owners. Right now, it’s only available on Android, with no immediate plans for an iOS release.</p>

<p>Samsung needs a win with the upcoming Galaxy S25 series. The company is facing major issues and delays with its One UI 7 update, based on Android 15. It's also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">apologizing for failing to innovate</a>. While we don't know exactly what the Samsung Galaxy S25 will look like, we do know a whole lot based on leaks and rumors ahead of the phone's expected mid-January launch.</p>

<p>With a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a bigger display, slight design tweaks, and a software overhaul, the Galaxy S25 could indeed be a massive victory. The question is, will the upgrades be tempting enough to make people still rocking a Samsung Galaxy S23 want to upgrade, especially with all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024">Black Friday Samsung deals</a> currently floating about?

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s23-design-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Galaxy S23: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3699px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="DzgsjUdUBJbMPWDkgoyaKP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S23-review-rear-outdoors.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S23 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DzgsjUdUBJbMPWDkgoyaKP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3699" height="2081" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you've been keeping a close eye on new Samsung phones recently, you probably have a good idea of where the Samsung Galaxy S25's design is headed. With the Galaxy Z Fold 6, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>, the company moved to a flat and more rectangular design language. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">Based on the latest renders</a>, we expect the Galaxy S25 to follow a similar pattern. It'll likely be a boxy phone with matte aluminum rails and a new lens covering around the rear camera system, closely resembling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>The exact dimensions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> are up in the air, but rumors suggest the phone could have a chassis measuring 146.94 x 70.46 x 7.25mm. That would be slightly smaller than the current Galaxy S24 and the older Galaxy S23. The phone's weight could be around the 168-gram mark. As far as durability is concerned, an IP68 water and dust-resistance rating and Gorilla Glass coverings are near locks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-side-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="Another alleged angled rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest change to the Galaxy S25 could be the display size. The older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-i-just-cant">Samsung Galaxy S23</a> features a 6.1-inch AMOLED display, but the Galaxy S25 could receive a bump to a 6.3-inch panel. That would follow industry trends, which are consistently shifting to favor larger displays. For example, Apple made the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max</a> larger this year.</p><p>Although the Galaxy S23 will have a smaller screen, it'll likely keep up with the newer model in terms of display specs. We expect both phones to have a 120Hz AMOLED panel with variable refresh rates and high brightness capabilities.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dKDSMyFkuHBoPJcHRZAFY8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S23-review-display-outdoors-1.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S23 outdoors next to a pillar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dKDSMyFkuHBoPJcHRZAFY8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of colors, the latest leaks reveal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-color-options-tipped">the Galaxy S25 should come in at least four colors</a>: Moon Night Blue, Silver Shadow, Sparkling Blue, and Sparkling Green. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S23 came in many more colors: Cobalt Violet, Amber Yellow, Onyx Black, Marble Grey (Samsung exclusive Jade Green, Sapphire Blue, Sandstone Orange). In all likelihood, Samsung still has a few online exclusives up its sleeve for the Galaxy S25 series.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s23-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Galaxy S23: Hardware and specs</h2>
<p>Those looking for a major camera upgrade on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series may end up once again disappointed. Top rumors indicate that the Galaxy S25 will have the same camera hardware as the Galaxy S24, which, unfortunately, would also be the same as the Galaxy S23. However, there are also leaks that predict Samsung could make a major camera hardware switch to Sony sensors, but this is something that leakers can't agree on yet.</p><p>If the Galaxy S25 indeed sticks with the same camera hardware, both phones in this comparison would feature a 50MP main shooter, a 12MP ultrawide lens, and a 10MP telephoto lens supporting 3x optical zoom. There could be some quality improvements, even with the same hardware, based on improved image-signal processing and computational photography features.</p>

<p>The exact memory and storage configurations are unknown, as are the connectivity options. However, we're looking for the Galaxy S25 to get 5G support, Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 5.3, which would make it competitive with recent flagship releases.</p>

<p>The key things to watch on the Samsung Galaxy S25 are the phone's performance and software. It's tabbed to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip, which you can think of as a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 successor. It's called 'Elite' because it now uses the same custom Oryon cores that power Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite laptop chips. In other words, the Snapdragon 8 Elite will be the most performant chip ever in a Galaxy phone.</p><p>However, we don't know what effect that will have on thermals, performance, or battery life. Some rumors suggest the Galaxy S25 will get a 5,000mAh battery to help make the phone longer-lasting. Additionally, reports indicate that the Snapdragon 8 Elite is an expensive chip, and its inclusion could drive the price upward.</p><p>On the flip side, the Galaxy S23 still sports the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy processor. It's going to be two years old when the Galaxy S25 debuts, but it's still plenty capable. It'll eventually get the jump to One UI 7 and currently supports a wide variety of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features. Plus, there are still a few years of software upgrades left.</p><p>One UI 7 is expected to launch on the Galaxy S25, but it's a bit of a wild card. There have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-pushed-back-again">extensive delays to One UI 7's development and release</a>, partly because it's an ambitious update. If Samsung pulls it off, it'll be a key reason why the Galaxy S25 sets itself apart. However, if its struggles continue, the phone could be a buggy mess at launch.</p>

<p>As we look toward the Samsung Galaxy S25's expected mid-January launch, it's time to start thinking about whether Galaxy S23 owners should upgrade. Buying the Galaxy S25 two years after purchasing the Galaxy S23 could be a tough sell. That's especially true if the design is lackluster and the cameras are unchanged. But the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a bigger screen, and new software features might be tempting.</p>
