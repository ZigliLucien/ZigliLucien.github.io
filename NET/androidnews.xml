<ul><li>Google recently sent emails to Pixel Buds owners, detailing a coming update that will add Gemini's AI smarts to the small devices.</li><li>Gemini will be offered as an alternative to the standard Assistant for hands-free, personalized help when needed.</li><li>The update will also change the "Hey Google" voice command, which will soon function based on your phone's settings.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest AI model is preparing to slide into Assistant&apos;s turf and do more for you when you&apos;re working or on the go.</p><p>The company started sending emails out to Pixel Buds owners this week, highlighting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini&apos;s</a> upcoming addition to the earbuds (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/25/google-gemini-is-coming-to-all-pixel-buds/">9to5Google</a>). Android Central has also received this email, which states users can leverage Gemini&apos;s assistance if it&apos;s been set as the "default" helper on their phone. Google warns that some features "may work differently" if Gemini is chosen over the Assistant.</p><p>Moreover, Google states, "Your Android phone needs to be unlocked and connected to your Pixel Buds while you’re wearing them." The email adds that this prevents the necessity of constantly unlocking your phone whenever you want to talk to Gemini. Additionally, if your buds are disconnected from your phone, you will lose Gemini&apos;s hands-free assistance.</p><p>Users can get around that by altering the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/7685360?utm_source=msa&utm_campaign=GS204129&utm_medium=email_service&utm_content=110854178&utm_term=oneunlock">Only Require One Unlock</a>" option in your Pixel Buds&apos; assistant settings. What&apos;s more, Google states Gemini does not recognize the "On Headphones" option in the "Personal results" settings. However, the standard Google Assistant will still adhere to that setting.</p><p>The company is also changing how the "Hey Google" command will work for the Pixel Buds. Google states your "Hey Google" settings on your phone will now control whether the AI can assist you via your Pixel Buds. This will reportedly affect Gemini alongside the regular Assistant.</p><p>The publication states the updates bringing Gemini and "Hey Google" command changes involve the Pixel Buds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a>, and the Pixel Buds A-series.</p>

<p>Google launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> in August and those tiny devices feature a rich integration with Gemini. Shifting the rest of the Pixel Buds lineup toward Gemini seems like an expected approach — especially since it&apos;s been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gains-more-google-assistant-features">moving in on the Assistant everywhere else</a>.</p><p>In other news, the notification capabilities of the original Pixel Buds Pro went through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-assistant-notifications-gone">some turbulent times</a> recently, as detailed by user reports. Users attempting to have the Assistant read out their notifications were met with an error and a lack of audible information. This was concerning the device&apos;s touch-and-hold capability.</p><p>The Assistant informed users that they would need to say "Hey Google, read notifications" aloud if they needed such information. After questioning, Google confirmed to Android Central that the change would remain as it was done based on user feedback. The press-and-hold function will no longer work, but it now seems like the change was in light of bigger plans.</p>

<ul><li>The Amazfit Helio Ring is getting a permanent discount from $299 to $199.</li><li>The Zepp Aura ($69/year) and Zepp Fitness ($29/year) subscriptions are now available to Helio Ring users "for free, for life."</li><li>A redesigned Zepp app is launching next month with new features like exertion score and food camera diary.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amazfit has permanently discounted the Helio Ring to $199 and made its two hidden subscriptions free to all new and existing Helio Ring owners, eliminating one of our biggest complaints about the smart ring.</p><p>Amazfit claimed at launch that the Helio Ring had "no subscriptions required," which we called "disingenous" in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Amazfit Helio Ring review </a>because certain sleep insights, fitness summaries, and chatbot conversations did require expensive subscriptions. </p><p>"We heard the feedback and are now offering all of the Zepp Aura and Zepp Fitness features to new and existing ring users for free, for life," an Amazfit rep told us on Thursday.</p><p>Zepp Aura will assess possible issues like sleep apnea, insomnia, and general sleepiness while analyzing your Helio Ring sleep data, as well as offer wellness coaching and an "AI audio engine" that plays relaxing music through your phone for better sleep. The Zepp Fitness sub lets you see in-depth weekly or monthly Fitness Reports and a fitness-focused chatbot to help you with your training.</p><p>Combined, the Zepp Aura and Zepp Fitness subs cost $100/year with annual passes, more than the $70 annual fee for an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> membership. Now, Helio Ring owners will get these tools for free.</p><p>We&apos;ve asked Amazfit if Helio Ring owners who previously subscribed to Zepp Aura or Fitness will get a refund or rebate, and we will update this post if we hear back.</p>

<p>Compared to the Oura Ring ($300–550 + $6/month subscription), the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> ($399), the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring</a> ($299), and most other smart rings we&apos;ve tested, the Amazfit Helio Ring ($199) is now significantly more affordable. It still has other issues like short battery life and limited ring size options, but they&apos;re easier to swallow at this price point.</p><p>Amazfit also announced that it&apos;ll launch the new version of its Zepp app on October 14, available to all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch">Amazfit watch</a> and ring owners. It&apos;ll have "an entirely new and improved redesign," along with new features like a workout exertion score, a health monitoring section, and a food camera diary.</p><p>Specific to health monitoring, the Zepp app will lump together key stats like physical/mental recovery, RHR, HRV, deep sleep total, exertion load, and training status and warn you which stats "need attention." If everything is where it should be, the Health Monitor will say you&apos;re "Within Range" in the main Today view.</p><p>The lower price, combined with this Zepp app revamp, have us more optimistic about the Amazfit Helio Ring as a budget smart ring option, even if plenty of people will pay extra for other brands.</p>

<ul><li>Google detailed a few updates preparing to arrive for Google Maps, like an expansion of Street View and sharper satellite imagery thanks to AI.</li><li>Google Maps users will find improved Street View imagery for nearly 80 countries.</li><li>Those in Google Earth on the web will soon experience "historical imagery," which lets users go back roughly 80 years to see how the planet and cities have changed.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is preparing a few updates for Google Maps and Google Earth that may help users understand the ever-changing world.</p><p>Kicking off the changes is an update to Street View on Google Maps. The company detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/earth/3-imagery-updates-to-google-earth-and-maps/">Keyword post</a> that users can expect to find "new imagery" in nearly 80 countries. This expansion in Google Maps brings better virtual adventures to places like Bosnia, Nambia, Liechtenstein, Paraguay, and more.</p><p>The company&apos;s cars and trekkers were stated to utilize a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/street-view-15-new-features/">new camera technology</a>, which it first revealed in 2022. With the ability to mount on any vehicle, Google states it&apos;s made creating better Street View imagery a breeze in more places. The company will continue to update Maps&apos; Street View for better virtual insight into countries like Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, the Philippines, and more.</p><p>The Street View expansion launched on September 25, meaning users should keep their eyes peeled.</p><p>Google&apos;s update also focuses on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps-google-earth-whats-difference">Google Earth</a>. The company states its users will soon have an easier time turning back the clock on a portion of the planet. A new "historical imagery" feature will soon become available on Google Earth&apos;s web version.</p><p>Users will find around 80 years of stored "satellite and aerial imagery" of the planet&apos;s geography to understand the changes it experienced. While 80 years ago from 2024 pits us in the 1940s, Google states some places will send you back to the 30s — like London, Berlin, or Paris.</p><p>Alongside this update for users, Google states researchers and companies will soon gain custom map creation. Projects will also be displayed directly on the Google Earth homepage to improve collaboration efforts.</p>

<p>Lastly, images viewed in Google Maps and Earth will benefit from sharper quality, courtesy of AI. The post states users can expect to see sharper imagery in both apps "this week" due to its Cloud Score Plus AI. The software can better recognize clouds, mist, fog, and haze while keeping the earth&apos;s weather patterns consistent.</p><p>Over the summer, Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-ui-overhaul-stable-rollout">a major U overhaul for Android</a> users that brought a "sheet-based" style. This new style gives users more agency over the information they see on their display to ensure they don&apos;t miss what&apos;s important. Of course, Google plans to plug more AI into Maps to assist with finding locations with pre-made questions and the option to write your own.</p><p>Other updates like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wildfire-alerts-europe-africa-expansion">wildfire alerts</a> arrived in July for Maps and Search. The feature piggybacks off satellites and Google&apos;s AI models to display the range and intensity of a wildfire so users can get to safety in time.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Google TV Streamer, a $99 set-top box, doesn't come with a high-speed HDMI cable in the box. </li><li>Although this practice isn't unusual, it is a stark difference from the Chromecast with Google TV it replaces, which featured a built-in USB-C cable. </li><li>Google is offering $10 off an HDMI cable to TV Streamer buyers, which gets you an HDMI 2b cable.</li><li>Unfortunately, this deal seems to be limited to people who pre-ordered the Google TV Streamer and previously owned a Chromecast. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Product boxes are shrinking, and it&apos;s not just because of eco-friendly packaging. We&apos;re also getting less in the box with each and every release. The days of a smartphone including a case, earbuds, and chargers are long gone. We&apos;re lucky to get a cable or two, and if you pre-ordered the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">Google TV Streamer</a>, you&apos;ll get exactly one cable: a USB-A to USB-C cord. </p><p>Google also throws in a USB-A power adapter, two AAA batteries, and a Voice Remote to get you started. However, the Google TV Streamer is missing one thing in the box, and it&apos;s required to connect the set-top box. That&apos;s the HDMI cable, which you&apos;ll need to purchase separately if you don&apos;t have one lying around. </p><p>There&apos;s a good chance Google TV Streamer buyers don&apos;t have an HDMI cable handy, for a few reasons. TVs usually come with an HDMI cable or two, but if that&apos;s used up by a cable box or another media player, you&apos;re out of luck. Users that were accustomed to the streaming stick lifestyle, using products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-announces-chromecast-google-tv-its-first-tv-stick-years">Chromecast with Google TV</a> or the Fire TV Stick, will miss their built-in HDMI cable. </p><p>The reason we always get from tech companies as to why we don&apos;t need new cables, earbuds, or power adapters in the box with products is that we already own them. Adding new ones would just create e-waste, and that&apos;s a fair point in some situations. But in the case of the Google TV Streamer, it doesn&apos;t make sense. You don&apos;t want to pick up any old HDMI cable with this streaming box, because it supports HDMI 2.1. Using a random HDMI cable that came with a TV or console would be wasting the performance of the $99 TV Streamer. </p>

<p>Google seems to be aware of the potential problems, because as of this week, it&apos;s offering a discount to select TV Streamer buyers for an HDMI cable on the Google Store (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/24/google-tv-streamer-hdmi-cable/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The HDMI 2b cable available on the store costs $10, and with a $10 off coupon, you can buy one for just $10. That&apos;s probably more than you&apos;d pay for a basic HDMI cable at your local Best Buy, but it&apos;s also HDMI 2b, so it can maximize your Google TV Streamer&apos;s performance. </p><p>Consumers pay for everything in the box, <em>including the box</em>, when they buy a product. That&apos;s why offering a discount toward needed cables or accessories isn&apos;t such a bad idea. Sure, it&apos;s annoying to have to buy a required HDMI cable separately, but would you prefer Google sell the TV Streamer for $110 and give a cable to everyone? This way, users who already have an HDMI 2.1 cable or want to buy their own aren&apos;t paying for something they don&apos;t need (and creating e-waste).</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t look like this is a standing promotion. Here&apos;s what people who pre-ordered the Google TV Streamer received in an email this week: "Take $10 off a Google HDMI cable. It’s perfect for your Google TV Streamer," it says. "Because you recently pre-ordered the Google TV Streamer, we’re giving you a discount on the new Google Ultra High­-Speed HDMI Cable. Thanks for being with us since the Chromecast days." </p><p>There could be two qualifiers to unlocking this promotion: pre-ordering the TV Streamer <em>and</em> owning a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast">Chromecast</a> device in the past. It also expires at the end of November. </p>

<p>Google&apos;s cable credit may be the closest a big tech company has gotten to solving the cable problem. This should&apos;ve been a standing promotion that allowed any Google TV Streamer buyer to add an HDMI cable to their purchase for an extra $10. Some people would surely take their TV Streamer at the $99 price point and use their own cord, but many who need an HDMI 2.1b cable surely would&apos;ve taken Google up on its offer. </p><p>Now, it&apos;s more likely that someone buys a Google TV Streamer, realizes they need an HDMI cable, and buys a cheap one for a few bucks at a big box store. This doesn&apos;t benefit Google or the user, because the buyer gets a worse experience by not using the right specification of HDMI cable. They could be less likely to buy another Google TV product or recommend one to a friend. </p><p>Surprisingly, I think tech companies could look to an unlikely company for a solution to the growing cable problem: Otterbox. The longtime rugged case brand had a history of shipping select cases with holsters, so you could mount them on your hip. However, they weren&apos;t used by everyone, and I personally had a tendency to toss them aside without much thought. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NnaRmkmDG4azFjQ8MkgcFT" name="Otterbox-Holster.jpg" alt="An otterbox defender series xt holster against a green background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NnaRmkmDG4azFjQ8MkgcFT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Otterbox)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, Otterbox doesn&apos;t ship Defender Series XT or Defender Series Pro XT cases with holsters in the box. Not everyone needs or wants one. However, buyers of either of those cases can redeem a free holster with a code that comes in the box. Otterbox found a way to reduce costs and wastes without the consumer losing out. Anyone who wants a case holster can absolutely still get one with their case, completely free.</p><p>Google, Samsung, Apple, and every other tech company could learn from this approach. I don&apos;t fault these brands from not including cables in the box by default for a variety of reasons. With that being said, some people do need a cable, and those who do should be able to get one for free, or at the very least at a discount. </p>

<ul><li>While the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra launch remains months away, a Geekbench performance test has already appeared.</li><li>The leaked benchmark reveals the device's single and multi-core scores, 3069 and 9080, respectively, running on Android 15 with 12GB of RAM.</li><li>Leakers recently created renders of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, showing flatter sides and new cameras.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s next big flagship is the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is more than a few months from its launch. However, that hasn&apos;t stopped the device from appearing on benchmark sites, and the latest one reveals some interesting parameters alongside the details about the upcoming Snapdragon flagship chipset.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra bearing <strong>SM-S938B</strong> and <strong>SM-S938U</strong> models has hit the latest Geekbench, revealing its single- and multi-core scores. The test results were shared by Ice Universe and Tarun Vats, two prominent tipsters on X.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking News❗️Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra spotted on Geekbench with Snapdragon 8 Gen4 Processor and 12GB of RAM!😱Single-Core: 3069Multi-Core: 9080Share this awesome news with everyone! 🥳🥳#GalaxyS25#Samsung#OneUI7 pic.twitter.com/ofGuNni9DM<a href="https://twitter.com/tarunvats33/status/1838408841840509116">September 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Both indicate scoring more than 3,000 for single-core performance and around 9,700 for multi-core. The leaked benchmark further indicates that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> and equipped with 12GB of RAM.</p><p>The other interesting element from the benchmark test is, however, the upcoming Qualcomm chipset, which is all set to be unveiled at Snapdragon Summit next month.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy S25 UltraSnapdragon 8Gen4 for GalaxyCPU：2 x 4.47GHz+6 x 3.53GHzGPU：1250MHz pic.twitter.com/eJguFf53Fv<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1838901773542543654">September 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>It is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 — the octa-core chip with two powerful cores featuring whopping clock speeds of 4.47GHz and another six cores with 3.53GHz clock speeds. These speeds are for the SM-S938B Galaxy S25 Ultra. On the other hand, the SM-S938U features slightly similar clock speeds, rocking at 4.19GHz and 2.90GHz, respectively. </p><p>The impressive Geekbench score isn&apos;t just limited to the Galaxy S25 Ultra; earlier this month, the same chipset was witnessed on a OnePlus phone, likely the OnePlus 13 — also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-hits-benchmark-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4">on a Geekbench test</a>. It also scored significant single and multi scores, 3,236 and 10,049, a noticeable bump over the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>For context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> scored 2,308 / 7,283 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> scored 943 / 4,859 in their respective Future Labs Geekbench 6.2 tests this year, each using the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. So the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 looks to be a significant power boost.</p>
<p>Thanks to this Samsung benchmark, we know that Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 will be a promising addition this year — thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-specs-leak">new Oryon CPUs</a>, which are being implemented for the first time.</p><p>Earlier this month, prominent leaker OnLeaks produced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">Galaxy S25 Ultra renders</a> that indicated a significant design change, including flatter sides over the predecessor and cameras similar to those of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, including a 200MP main camera. Now that we have the Snapdragon benchmark and RAM, the picture of what to expect from the Galaxy S25 Ultra is becoming much clearer.</p>

<p>Starship Home changed my point of view. The moment the walls of my living room became windows on a spaceship, I was hooked.

<p>When Quest 3 debuted, Meta and several other developers released short mixed-reality games that helped showcase how convincing mixed-reality could be. Of course, the problem with these is that they&apos;re short, so even the best experiences end in just a few minutes.</p><p>That&apos;s what makes Starship Home so special. It&apos;s a 4-6 hour adventure, depending on how long you take to discover everything, which is exponentially longer than most other games that rely entirely on mixed reality.</p><p>The game begins and ends in exactly the same place: whatever room you&apos;re playing in. At the start, you receive a package from what&apos;s clearly a galactic Amazon, bringing you an entire starship in one big, giant box.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iuQMC9PZNvAXowaEwqrjYe" name="starship-home-gameplay.gif" alt="Mixed reality gameplay of Starship Home as played on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iuQMC9PZNvAXowaEwqrjYe.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="320" height="180" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creature)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This clever intro kicks off the setup portion of the game, allowing you to place portholes, windows, the terrarium, storage depot, airlock, and, finally, the helm of the ship. Each of these pieces snaps believably to the walls of your room, except for the storage depot and the projector, which both reside somewhere on the floor.</p><p>Looking through portholes and windows is incredibly convincing in every way. The glass subtly refracts the view of the outside, and you can get up close and see around the edges of space as you might expect to be able to in a real spaceship.</p><p>The concept is quickly kicked off as an alien appears on the helm’s display, informing you that this is actually his spaceship, but Amazon brought it to the wrong planet, so you&apos;ll have to take it off and bring it back to him ASAP. What follows is an impressive trip through hyperspace, beginning with grabbing an energy crystal from the in-ground storage depot, sliding it into the fuel tube, choosing the destination from the projector, and, finally, pushing the hyperspace lever forward to engage engines.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XqbTxoD7XcZuGYRx63thkM" name="starship-home-screenshot-01.jpg" alt="Mixed reality screenshots of Starship Home on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XqbTxoD7XcZuGYRx63thkM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creature)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During this entire exchange, you have a full view of your room, ensuring that everything around you begins to blend in with the objects in the game. During hyperspace, your entire room will change color, glowing convincingly from the hyperspace tunnel light emitted from space.</p><p>More than once, after I was done playing, I&apos;d take off the headset and expect the windows and portholes to still be on the wall. It was a fascinating effect that reminded me of the dreams I used to have when I first tried VR many years ago.</p><p>As the planet comes into view, you quickly realize something&apos;s wrong. No, hostile aliens aren&apos;t there to abduct you or anything. Rather, the friendly alien reveals that his planet is covered in a deadly blight that will soon erase their existence if something isn&apos;t done to stop it, revealing the real plot of the game.</p>
<h2 id="a-plot-that-fills-the-gaps-2">A plot that fills the gaps</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Zj6jagxFtB44AWB5S7H9PM" name="starship-home-screenshot-05.jpg" alt="Mixed reality screenshots of Starship Home on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zj6jagxFtB44AWB5S7H9PM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creature)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you venture forth toward other planets in search of a cure — namely, other plants that are blight-resistant — you&apos;re met with the most interesting flora you&apos;ll likely ever encounter. But it&apos;s not enough that these plants have eyes and can freely move. They also have dreams that you can explore with the help of a unique machine introduced on the second planet.</p><p>Each plant you acquire has its own unique dreams, all of which are presented in the form of a puzzle or mini-game. Dreams change the room around you in a psychedelic way, sometimes changing the color of the room while other times might remove the ceiling entirely. One game had me bouncing a plant&apos;s tears on floating platforms, while another had me hitting balloons into the sky, keeping them along long enough for them to grow into floating islands.</p><p>Each is creative and unique, drawing from a wide range of play styles that feel purpose-built.</p><p>All of these interactions were made better by the close attention the team paid to controller haptics. Few games do it this well, and it&apos;s wonderful to feel the difference between a gentle vibration while petting plants and a more solid one when pulling open the storage container, for example.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ebdu66XN6Mavumaa6w26BM" name="starship-home-screenshot-04.jpg" alt="Mixed reality screenshots of Starship Home on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ebdu66XN6Mavumaa6w26BM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creature)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, in all of this, your physical room is visible. I assumed this would get boring after a while but was pleasantly surprised when it still felt new and fresh after four or five hours.</p><p>It&apos;s proof to me that mixed reality gaming can be more than a way to safely see the room around you. It&apos;s a fantastic way to get you used to a future where we wear AR glasses exist and these types of games and encounters can happen more organically. As I wrote in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/virtual-pets-in-the-era-of-ai">previous thVRsday article</a>, a future where we have a virtual pet that comes along for the ride with us is a very real possibility, and I can now see that extend to the plants and other objects around us.</p><p>The sense of palpability of each of the virtual objects in my room while playing Starship Home was surreal. It&apos;s funny how something that doesn&apos;t actually exist can feel so real. The feeling is more than a fleeting memory of a vivid dream. It&apos;s an expectation that I can go back to the place on command and experience them whenever I want.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DqqiNGYYZLNTZiFauEUu7N" name="starship-home-screenshot-03.jpg" alt="Mixed reality screenshots of Starship Home on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DqqiNGYYZLNTZiFauEUu7N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creature)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I once thought that having virtual objects fill bare walls sounded kind of sad. But after experiencing Starship Home and realizing how authentic they could feel, I can&apos;t wait for the future of shared virtual spaces just like this. I can imagine coming into a room that&apos;s been seasonally decorated in something new without having to go down to the nearest Hobby Lobby to drop a bunch of money for it.</p><p>That future is still a ways off, and while I think there&apos;s a distinct possibility that we&apos;ll see another great full mixed-reality game come along before too long, the concept isn&apos;t as easy to work with as a full VR game. Plenty of Quest 3 games use the concept to enhance the experience — like Demeo putting the game board on a table for a bunch of people to play in the same room — but Starship Home’s concept is a unique one that won&apos;t be quickly replicated in another brilliant way overnight.</p><p>Still, I can&apos;t wait to see what some other brilliant developer comes up with, especially now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Meta Quest 3S</a> is making full-quality mixed reality more affordable for everyone.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is looking to give consumers a "good morning" as it launches its latest FE series addition to the Galaxy S24 lineup.</p><p>Today (Sept 26), Samsung has launched the Galaxy S24 FE, a slightly tweaked variant of the flagship trio from January. The device features a larger 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a 120Hz refresh rate. This brings the latest FE to the same size as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>. Overall, the design of the S24 FE remains extremely close to the flagship models as the front delivers thin bezels on top and its sides.</p><p>However, the phone sports a visible chin at the bottom of the device, which is a noticeable contrast from the others.</p><p>Internally, Samsung has packaged the S24 FE with the Exynos 2400e chipset. A few of the original trio sported the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400</a> SoC overseas, but this variant for the S24 FE is slightly stronger as it provides a small boost in performance. Samsung didn&apos;t opt for Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 within the FE like the flagship S24. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">that shouldn&apos;t really matter</a>.</p><p>The back of the phone features a vertical, triple camera array consisting of a 50MP primary lens with OIS (optical image stabilization), a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and an 8MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. The front of the device features an Infinity-O selfie camera that clocks out at 10MP.</p>

<p>A Galaxy S24 FE camera highlight is Samsung&apos;s "ProVision Engine." According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/galaxy-s24-series-expands-with-s24-fe-a-premium-experience-that-makes-full-galaxy-ai-capabilities-attainable-for-more-users/">Samsung</a>, this "AI-driven camera engine" leverages AI algorithms to boost your photography&apos;s detail and create "subtle" textures.</p><p>Samsung states consumers can expect Nightography and an "Adaptive Pixel Sensor" to assist the 50MP capabilities. The latter helps ensure the camera&apos;s quality during 2x and 3x zoom alongside AI zoom for even closer shots. Galaxy AI enters the S24 FE&apos;s camera array with features like Generative Edit.</p><p>Users can "reimagine" themselves as cartoon characters or add a bit of flair to profile icons with Portrait Studio. "Edit Suggestions" is said to help users weed out annoying flaws and other artifacts within their images to ensure a crisp final memory.</p><p>Galaxy AI&apos;s on-device assistance makes itself available for users elsewhere as it provides Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. Several more AI features include Interpreter (live, in-person conversation translations), Live Translate for phone calls, Composer, and Note Assist.</p><p>The company noted during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/galaxy-s24-series-expands-with-s24-fe-a-premium-experience-that-makes-full-galaxy-ai-capabilities-attainable-for-more-users/">its highlight post</a> that the Galaxy S24 FE fits perfectly within the Galaxy ecosystem for file transfers, extended displays, and more. Additionally, the device benefits from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/tag/knox/">Samsung Knox</a> security for E2EE (end-to-end encryption) on your device and other vulnerability safeguards.</p>

<p>One (happy) upgrade for the S24 FE is a 4,700mAh battery. This is slightly larger than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">S23 FE</a>; however, it&apos;s 700mAh more than the vanilla S24 provides. Additionally, the company adds the device can deliver up to 28 hours of "watching" time and 81 hours of listening.</p><p>Samsung states the latest FE delivers 8GB of RAM and three storage options: 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. Color-wise, consumers can find the phone in the following options: Graphite, gray, blue, and mint.</p><p>With pre-orders beginning today (Sept 26), Samsung states U.S. consumers can secure their Galaxy S24 FE for a starting price of $649 on its main website (Samsung.com). The device will hit a wider market release on October 3.</p><p>One final surprise: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-with-advanced-health-monitoring-technology/">Galaxy Watch FE LTE</a> is set to debut on October 3, as well. The company states the device will begin at $249 on Samsung.com. Pre-ordering the device will receive a "free light-weight fabric watch band." Additionally, Samsung teased that the watch will pick up Galaxy Watch 7/Watch Ultra features "later this fall."</p>

<ul><li>Samsung just announced the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra, with both models sticking to the design of the Tab S9 series.</li><li>The prices are unchanged—$1,000 for the Plus and $1,200 for the Ultra model.</li><li>Both models feature OLED screens; the Plus has a 12.4-inch display (2800 x 1752), while the Ultra boasts a 14.6-inch screen (2960 x 1848).</li><li>This year, Samsung switched to the MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus chip, promising a 10% boost in AI performance.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung announced today its newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">high-end Android tablets</a>, the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra. As the rumors previously suggested, the usual 11-inch standard model is missing from this year’s lineup.</p><p>The new models build on last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9</a> series, keeping a similar design and features. Prices haven’t changed either, with the Plus starting at $1,000 and the Ultra at $1,200. Preorders are open today, September 26, and they’ll officially hit stores on October 3.</p><p>Just like the previous models, all the new tablets come with OLED screens. The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus features a 12.4-inch display with a 2800 x 1752 resolution, while the Ultra boasts a 14.6-inch screen at 2960 x 1848. Both models support a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother visuals.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.29%;"><img id="j773fnUgdrTHKscvB2iR57" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-series.jpg" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j773fnUgdrTHKscvB2iR57.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The difference in screen sizes means different battery capacities, with the Tab S10 Plus packing a 10,090mAh battery and the Ultra getting 11,200mAh. All models support charging speeds of up to 45W.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus features a 12MP front ultrawide camera, along with a 13MP rear camera and an extra 8MP ultrawide on the back. On the other hand, the Ultra model ups the ante with a second 12MP front camera.</p><p>In a big shift from past models, Samsung has replaced Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon chipset with the MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus in both versions. Launched earlier this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">this chip features a four-core APU</a> and claims to deliver 10% improved performance for AI tasks.</p><p>This performance boost comes from the chipset&apos;s support for MediaTek&apos;s NeuroPilot Speculative Decode Acceleration, which allows it to handle large language models (LLMs) with seven billion parameters at 22 tokens per second. MediaTek claims this capability outperforms similar chipsets by two times.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="KVnbv7kka7EpJubwX9orBG" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-Ultra.jpg" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KVnbv7kka7EpJubwX9orBG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="533" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung also claims that the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra shows off some serious performance upgrades over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a>. You’re looking at an 18% boost in CPU performance, a 28% jump in GPU power, and a 14% increase in NPU efficiency.</p><p>When it comes to memory capacity, the Tab S10 Plus has 12GB of RAM, while the S10 Ultra packs up to 16GB. For storage, the S10 Plus offers 256GB or 512GB options, and the Ultra can be equipped with up to 1TB. Additionally, both models allow for storage expansion with microSD cards.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S9 series came loaded with a full range of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features, and that trend carries over to the Tab S10 Plus and Ultra. This means users can enjoy a variety of productivity, communication, and creative tools, including Circle to Search, Note Assist, Drawing Assist, Sketch to Image, and Air Command with AI for the S Pen stylus. These features are now at your fingertips thanks to the new Galaxy AI Key, included in the Book Cover Keyboards. This makes it super easy to customize your AI assistant with just a few written prompts.</p><p>The hardware lineup is rounded out with the S Pen stylus, a quad-speaker system boosted by Dolby Atmos, and handy in-screen fingerprint scanners. You can pick between Moonstone Gray and Platinum Silver for the tablets, but keep in mind that you’ll need to get a compatible charging brick separately.</p>

Now that the Pixel Watch 3 is on store shelves, Amazon and other retailers are selling the Pixel Watch 2 at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Best-Fitbit/dp/B0CCQ6SWQN"><strong>$100 off its original price</strong></a>. </p><p>All versions of the watch are now $100 cheaper than they were a few weeks ago, which means you&apos;re getting the user-friendly Wear OS, a wide range of Fitbit features, and up to 24 hours of battery per charge at a much lower price than before. </p><p>You can also find a number of other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">early deals ahead of Amazon Big Deal Days</a>, including a few other great smartwatch options.</p>

<p>Although it's more of a permanent price drop than an actual deal, grabbing the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> for $100 off is still a pretty big deal. With 32GB of memory, heart rate and fitness monitoring, and up to 24 hours of battery life per charge, the Watch 2 was an easy pick for one of the industry's leading smartwatches when it came out. Now, with the Watch 3 freshly released, it's still a good option—especially at this new price.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Best-Fitbit/dp/B0CCQ6SWQN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d76f562a-5f37-4f40-b956-1a72298bbb03" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you don&apos;t mind going with a previous-generation smartwatch; you&apos;re looking for a good deal on a high-performance fitness watch; you want compatibility with a wide array of Fitbit features and accessories.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;d rather upgrade to the new Pixel Watch 3; you think you might like a Samsung Galaxy Watch better; if you want something that feels similar to the Apple Watch.</p><p>When the Google Pixel Watch 2 came out in 2023, it was definitely a top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatch</a>. Even if you don&apos;t have a Pixel phone, it&apos;s still a worthy option to consider with its accurate heart rate monitoring, long battery life, small, comfortable build, and its many useful Fitbit features. Earlier this month, Google also released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, which might be worth considering if you have a little extra money to spend.</p><p>Nonetheless, fitness enthusiasts and casual users will likely get what they need with the Watch 2, and this might be the best price you&apos;ll see for a while.</p>
