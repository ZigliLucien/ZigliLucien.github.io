<ul><li>Google previously announced it is bringing Gemini to Gmail for Google One AI Premium subscribers.</li><li>Now, it appears that Google is trying out AI-generated replies from Gemini in the Gmail app for Android.</li><li>Users can tap a reply to edit and send it or let Google know if the responses are bad. Currently, the feature is hidden behind a few developer flags.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After experimenting with Gemini integration in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a>, Google appears to be testing AI-generated replies in the Gmail app for Android. Earlier this year, Google announced it was making AI-based features available to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> subscribers in beta. A new implementation of Gemini in the Gmail app has now surfaced, offering three reply suggestions from Gemini for each of your emails.</p><p>Android code expert AssembleDebug was able to enable the feature in the Gmail app, and shared the findings with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/03/google-gemini-gmail-reply-suggestions/" target="_blank">PiunikaWeb</a>. Google refers to the tool as "reply suggestions from Gemini," the feature works after flipping some developer flags in Gmail. Once enabled, Gemini can analyze the contents of the email a Gmail user received and come up with three reply suggestions that make sense in context. In some cases, these AI-generated responses from Gemini can be as long as a full sentence or two.¬†</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Gemini-powered reply suggestions coming to Gmailüìù More info - https://t.co/AD6wWcEHX1#Android #Gmail #Google pic.twitter.com/c5fVGjWRdd<a href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1775375003971981509">April 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>You can act on the suggestions by tapping one of the AI-generated options, which will move its contents to the compose field. After that, you can press the send button to finish your reply. However, you might want to edit the message or add more, possibly after the Gemini-suggested response is moved to the compose field.¬†</p><p>Gemini has already appeared in Gmail but in a different way. Google One AI Premium subscribers can get help creating an email with Gemini, although this functionality is in beta. Help me write in Workspace Labs is another way for users to leverage AI to write messages in Gmail. Compared to these two options, the "reply suggestions from Gemini" serve a different purpose entirely. These suggestions are intended to be quick, pre-written replies that can be sent in as little as two taps in the Gmail app for Android.</p><p>Like many implementations of Gemini, Google wants your feedback when using its AI tools. In some cases, Google will show a "bad suggestions?" action item underneath the suggested replies from Gemini. Tapping on that text will give you the chance to let Google know when the AI-generated replies in Gmail have missed the mark.</p><p>Though the suggested replies from Gemini are available now after manually enabling developer flags, we don&apos;t know when they might be publicly released.¬†</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I went all-in on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/using-google-chromecast-audio-whole-house-audio-alternative-sonos">Chromecast Audio</a> when Google introduced it nearly a decade ago. I didn&apos;t want to buy smart speakers as that would add another layer of complexity, so I just bought an eclectic mix of speakers and connected everything via Chromecast Audio. While the $35 dongle continues to be terrific, Google moved away from the idea altogether, and curtailed key features.</p><p>That&apos;s where WiiM comes into the picture. WiiM made its debut with the introduction of the Mini, a hockey puck-sized streamer that integrated with all major music streaming services. It would have been the ideal Chromecast Audio alternative, but that product didn&apos;t have the Cast protocol. Thankfully, WiiM introduced the Pro at the same time, and it had Cast integration, a terrific DAC, and all the extras you need in a network streamer.</p>
<p>The WiiM Amp takes things to a whole new level. It has a lot of the same features as the Pro, but you get a better-quality ESS DAC, and there&apos;s built-in audio amplification, making it the obvious choice if you need to power passive speakers. The WiiM Amp is an all-in-one solution that just needs speakers, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Amp-Multiroom-Streaming-Chromecast/dp/B0CGCLXH4H">coming in at just $299</a>, it is a phenomenal value ‚Äî there really isn&apos;t anything else in this segment that gives you anywhere as many features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nQQsDznVckCzxxztjBhKrL" name="wiim-amp-9.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nQQsDznVckCzxxztjBhKrL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As always, let&apos;s start with the design. The WiiM Amp is different to the rest of the brand&apos;s products in that it has an all-metal chassis, and the aluminum enclosure exudes elegance. The minimalist design is terrific, and it belies the fact that the WiiM Amp costs just $299. The brushed metal enclosure has rounded edges, a large volume knob at the front, a status LED, and volume indicator.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mvV8giuZFcMVBeW2wmuriL" name="wiim-amp-8.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mvV8giuZFcMVBeW2wmuriL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The volume knob doubles as a control button for music playback, and a long press puts the WiiM Amp into pairing mode. Other than the WiiM logo at the top, you don&apos;t get much in the way of branding. If anything, the WiiM Amp looks more like a Sonos product than the Sonos Amp.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vN47JPeCAJMBpzMotmdNnK" name="wiim-amp-2.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vN47JPeCAJMBpzMotmdNnK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s at the back where things get exciting, with WiiM offering all the ports you&apos;ll need. There&apos;s optical and analog inputs, along with HDMI ARC, connectors for hooking up passive speakers, USB, Ethernet, and subwoofer out. The inclusion of HDMI ARC makes it a breeze to connect the Amp to your TV, and while there isn&apos;t a headphone out, you get two-way Bluetooth, giving you the option to pair with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JLTuYt3984Tp6K7PgekB7L" name="wiim-amp-4.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JLTuYt3984Tp6K7PgekB7L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honestly, the connectivity on offer is leagues ahead of everything else in this segment, and that extends to the services the Amp integrates with. You get Chromecast integration along with AirPlay 2 and AirPlay Cast, and you can seamlessly slot it into an existing multi-room audio configuration, whether you use Chromecast or Alexa-enabled devices. It&apos;s this versatility that gives the Amp a distinct edge, and you can set it up as a cast target, giving you the ability to play music via Google Assistant, Alexa, or Siri.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AfvsYga47ugMTeB3Byv6wK" name="wiim-amp-3.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AfvsYga47ugMTeB3Byv6wK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The features don&apos;t end there; you also get DLNA, Spotify Connect, Tidal Connect, and even Roon integration. The latter is of particular interest to my own use case, as I use Roon extensively to stream music to various devices in my home. More than any other feature, Roon integration allows the Amp to stand out in this segment, and I don&apos;t believe there&apos;s any other network streamer that offers the same at $299.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GqEwzagUH3Wchv4Hc6GaML" name="wiim-amp-6.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GqEwzagUH3Wchv4Hc6GaML.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Setting up the WiiM Amp is about as straightforward as it gets, and it has a Class D amp that provides 60W per channel at 8Œ© and 120W at 4Œ©. That&apos;s more than adequate for most passive systems, and I daresay we&apos;ll see another variant of the Amp with better power output, so if you&apos;re using audio gear that&apos;s a bit more demanding, you should hang tight.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="b7PZ5NqRPkp5ttFn2bTSzL" name="wiim-amp-10.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b7PZ5NqRPkp5ttFn2bTSzL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The WiiM Home app is what you&apos;ll use to control music playback and set up the device, and it has a polished interface with plenty of features. You get a 10-band EQ with 26 preset options, and a 4-band parametric EQ. What&apos;s great is that you can set individual EQ profiles to each input. You can also control music playback with the bundled remote.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="krEmoBqx5Ppms4dodRN4GM" name="wiim-amp-11.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/krEmoBqx5Ppms4dodRN4GM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the audio side of things, the WiiM Amp features an ESS 9018 DAC that is a stalwart in this segment. It does a terrific job with a variety of genres, delivering a sound that&apos;s detailed and engaging. You&apos;ll get a more vibrant sound out of a dedicated amp, but considering all the other features on offer, the WiiM Amp definitely hits well above its weight class in this area.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the WiiM Amp achieves something that very few products manage in the high-res audio segment: offer meaningful differentiation. There isn&apos;t another product in this category that gives you anywhere close to the number of features, and the elegant design is just an added bonus. If you need an amp to drive your existing speakers and want one that looks as good as it sounds, the WiiM Amp is the obvious choice.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing just launched its budget smartphone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">Nothing Phone 2a</a>, early last month. However, the company is already looking ahead to its next product launch, which looks to be a new set of earbuds. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/nothing/status/1775478389740015880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1775478389740015880%7Ctwgr%5E8365da155f97f685a7df3a803a2b3daf022e28e7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2024%2F04%2F03%2Fnothing-earbuds-april-teaser%2F" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter), Nothing posted a cryptic message alongside an image of a black beetle staring at a yellow frog. To find out more, Nothing tells us to wait for the company&apos;s next community update slated for April 18.¬†</p><p>On its own, the post doesn&apos;t give us much to go off of, but this isn&apos;t the first time we&apos;ve seen the black beetle. It appeared in teasers and promotional material related to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Nothing Ear 2</a>, which were released in March 2023. Nothing has a history of using bugs to market earbuds, with a ladybug representing the original Nothing Ear. We don&apos;t know what the yellow frog means yet, but it&apos;s reasonable to expect that this teaser has something to do with a new pair of earbuds.¬†</p>

<p>Nothing could be hinting at a successor to the Nothing Ear 2 or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-stick-review">Nothing Ear Stick</a>, as well as a new audio product altogether. Those are the two earbuds currently available from Nothing, but the company also sells <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/cmf-neckband-pro-and-new-buds-announced">Buds, Buds Pro, and Neckband Pro</a> through the CMF by Nothing sub-brand.</p><p>Separately, Android expert and leaker Dylan Roussel on X posted the codenames of two upcoming Nothing smartphones. One device is codenamed "PacmanPro," while another is known as "Tetris." The Nothing Phone 2a was known internally as Pacman, so the PacmanPro moniker could be referencing a variation of the Phone 2a. Nothing has already publicly revealed that at least one Phone 2a variation is coming through the company&apos;s Community Edition contest, where fans can help design the new model.¬†</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PacmanPro - Tetris.Hi Nothing team üëã https://t.co/fTp4p5UutE<a href="https://twitter.com/evowizz/status/1775589958624973253">April 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>We&apos;ll likely learn more about Nothing&apos;s new audio product later this month at the community update scheduled for April 18. The phones are likely further out, but a prior leak from Roussel claims they will both launch sometime this year. At least one of those devices is expected to be a flagship successor to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a>, which will probably be called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-qualcomm-chip-price-rumors">Nothing Phone 3</a>.¬†</p>

<ul><li>A report claims that Spotify is interested in raising the prices of its "basic" by a dollar and its duo plan by $2 in certain markets worldwide.</li><li>Alleged sources state Spotify will also introduce a new basic tier, which will include music and podcasts minus access to audiobooks.</li><li>Spotify's "supremium" tier is still on the way as a brief mention shows it's still under development.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new report suggests Spotify is preparing to increase prices for its streaming services and develop new Premium plans.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/spotify-is-changing-how-it-charges-customers-with-new-plans-and-prices?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> states that Spotify is interested in raising the price of its "basic" plan by $1 and its duo service by $2 in certain markets worldwide. Sources claim that the UK, Australia, and Pakistan consumers will see these increases take effect by the end of April.</p><p>The U.S. is also participating in the price hike wave, though it will allegedly take place "later this year."</p><p>The report adds that Spotify is also looking into adding more subscription plans for consumers to drive revenue. Those familiar with the matter said the company is preparing a new "basic" tier with music and podcasts but forgo audiobooks. This plan may cost $11, which is the cost of a Premium plan for a single user.</p><p>There are more "new pricing options" that Spotify is working on, but nothing further was detailed.</p><p>Spotify&apos;s "supremium" plan was briefly mentioned, and it looks like the tier is still under development. Users who grab that subscription would be granted HiFi audio for a steeper price.</p><p>Bloomberg states Spotify&apos;s reasoning behind its alleged impending price hike is to "cover the cost of audiobooks." The audio service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify-premium-challenges-audible-monthly-audiobooks">launched audiobooks</a> for Premium users in November 2023. The feature came with over 200,000 titles that users could listen to for "free" for 15 hours per month. You would then have to spend an additional $12.99 to give yourself an extra 10 hours of listening if you exceeded the initial cap.</p><p>Sources state Spotify has only generated revenue from users who have exceeded the initial allotted time for listening per month. The service then added an "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-audiobook-access-tier-rollout">Access</a>" tier that was cheaper for bookworms.</p><p>We&apos;ve been waiting on Spotify&apos;s "supremium" plan for a while, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-supremium-logo-features-rumor">the latest leaks</a> came in October 2023. It was suggested that not only would users receive HiFi (high fidelity) audio, but "Your Sound Capsule," "Highlights," and 24-bit lossless audio would join in.</p>

<p>We&apos;re virtually a week into the reception of One UI 6.1 for Samsung&apos;s past-gen devices, and a couple of glaring problems are appearing.</p><p>Users have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1bql7sw/fingerprint_issue_after_one_ui_61_update/">taken to Reddit</a> to report problems with the biometrics (fingerprint) reader of their Galaxy S23 Ultra following One UI 6.1 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/03/galaxy-s23-fingerprint-sensor-one-ui-6-1-update/">9to5Google</a>). The user states that their "fingerprint sensor randomly doesn&apos;t register my input" when attempting to unlock their device.</p><p>They add that no apparent error is appearing. They are forced to lift and press their finger against the screen again to restart the process.

This doesn&apos;t appear to happen <em>all </em>the time but is instead sporadic.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1brbbel/oneui_61_s23_bug_with_fingerprint_scanner/">Another thread</a> discussed the same problem but involved a base Galaxy S23 model.

<p>There could be some good news here as we&apos;re just getting into April, which means Samsung will start pushing this month&apos;s security patch to its slew of devices. The Galaxy S24 started receiving it quite early, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/some-samsung-devices-are-already-getting-the-april-update-with-camera-improvements">at the end of March</a>. Perhaps Samsung will delay its April patch for the Galaxy S23 series to work in a fix. If not, users may have to wait until May before seeing relief.</p><p>Samsung started rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-ai-announcement">One UI 6.1 update</a> packed with Galaxy AI features to its past-gen devices on March 28 in the U.S. The entire Galaxy S23 series was eligible for the update, which notably involves the devices users have reported problems with since the update became available. Galaxy AI&apos;s features also graced the Galaxy Z Flip 5, Fold 5, and Tab S9 series.</p><p>Users of these devices can now access Google&apos;s "Circle to Search," Live Translate, Chat Assist, and more.</p>

<ul><li>Hidden features in Android 15's latest developer preview suggest a potential revamp for icons like battery and Wi-Fi signals.</li><li>Google may introduce a horizontal battery icon to accommodate the battery level indicator within it.</li><li>There might also be improvements in haptic feedback for various interactions in Android 15.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is not expected to have major visual overhauls, Google appears to be brewing some nice tweaks for the next mobile update, such as snazzier status bar icons and more.</p><p>Android expert Mishaal Rahman, writing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-new-status-bar-3430578/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, did some digging and unlocked some hidden features in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">Android 15&apos;s second developer preview</a>. Apparently, Google might be revamping the icons at the top of your screen, like the battery and Wi-Fi signals.</p><p>Instead of the usual smooth icons, these new ones would be broken into segments, making it easier to see how strong your connection is at a glance.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google might flip the battery icon on its side, going from vertical to horizontal. This change means the battery level indicator can fit right inside the battery icon instead of next to it. But if you&apos;re not feeling it, you can always turn that off.</p>

<p>These tweaks might seem minor, but for users who prefer getting quick and clear information at a glance, they could come in really handy.</p><p>In the current version of Android, the icons for Wi-Fi, cellular signal, and battery life are just simple bars that fill up depending on how strong they are. They also turn white or dark, depending on your phone&apos;s theme. A separate spot shows the battery percentage, but you might have to turn that on in your settings.</p><p>Rahman also mentions that Google is stepping up the haptic feedback game in Android 15. So, when you tap or hold down on a quick settings toggle in the notification shade, you&apos;ll feel a slight vibration. And it doesn&apos;t stop there‚Äîwhen you slide the volume up or down using touch, thanks to the brightness adjuster, you&apos;ll feel that feedback, too.</p><p>These new features are currently hidden in a special testing version of Android 15 meant for developers (it is not super stable, so avoid putting it on your main phone). We&apos;ll have to wait for the official Android 15 release to see if Google decides to include these tweaks.</p>

<hr>
<p>Oura is bringing its users behind the curtain with a new app that lets their feedback directly impact the future of its development for new features.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240403398484/en/%C5%8CURA-Introduces-Oura-Labs-A-New-In-App-Innovation-Hub-for-Members">press release</a>, the company is introducing "Oura Labs," an in-app experience interested parties can access to test experimental features. The post states this new testing environment has been added to the Oura Membership experience.</p><p>With its introduction, Oura members can playtest "Symptom Radar." The feature is designed to help users understand how their bodies react to fatigue, high activity levels, and illness. Symptom Radar is said to alert users to these changes in their bodies as they appear in their biometrics before we physically notice them.</p><p>The feature bases its judgment on a user&apos;s baseline when their biometrics are in the green. If the numbers begin to deviate, Oura states it will notify users to activate "Rest Mode" or adjust their previously set daily goals to avoid excess strain. After, Symptom Radar is said to deactivate to give users time to rest properly.</p>

<p>The Finnish brand states that all features wrapped in its Labs experience are subject to be removed, reworked, or added permanently to the main app. Oura Labs is available on all of its smart rings for iOS members. The post doesn&apos;t state when (or if) Android users can expect to see its test environment.</p><p>If you have an iOS device, you can experiment with Labs by tapping the hamburger menu at the top left of the Oura app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/26055991315859-Oura-Labs">to get started</a>. The company&apos;s support page states that if a feature users are testing is removed, they will receive a notification and a prompt to deliver feedback.</p><p>Alongside new features, Oura states its "Labs" environment will let users gain deeper insight into published research studies made possible by its devices. Additionally, Oura adds that its members can participate in its research studies and those conducted by its partners or academic institutions.</p>

In 2024 (so far) we&apos;ve seen AT&T tell us about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/73-million-atandt-accounts-leaked">a massive breach</a> of over 70 million customer&apos;s info, and we&apos;ve also seen the same from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-2023-data-breach">T-Mobile</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">Verizon</a>. Other companies aren&apos;t immune, of course, but there&apos;s a good chance you&apos;re a customer of one of these carriers because they provide service for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a>. You should be concerned.</p>
<p>Amazingly, this doesn&apos;t happen more often. Huge companies hold data about hundreds of millions of customer accounts, and that&apos;s a juicy peach for bad actors looking for a quick way to get data. At the risk of sounding like a corporate apologist, most companies are doing a lot to prevent data breaches. They can&apos;t get it right every time, though.</p><p>You don&apos;t have any control over your data once it&apos;s in the hands of another. You&apos;re at the mercy of the practices and security of companies like AT&T, who try to keep it safe. That doesn&apos;t mean you <em>shouldn&apos;t</em> do anything, though.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-data-breach-2">What is a data breach?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1151px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="PAR9KhoatfG9aLtnhpNYyi" name="hacker.jpg" alt="A computer hacker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PAR9KhoatfG9aLtnhpNYyi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1151" height="647" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Kaspersky)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A data breach is the unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive information. This could include anything from your name and address to your Social Security number or credit card details.¬†</p><p>This can happen in many ways; someone may gain unauthorized access to a company&apos;s internal network through an exploit, an employee could decide to go rogue, enterprise-grade malware can be injected into a server, or employee devices can be stolen and used to gain access.</p><p>None of the how matters to you and me because we can&apos;t do anything about it. We have to trust that the companies we do business with are doing everything they can to prevent it. But you should still care and do your part.</p>
<p>A data breach can have a dramatic impact and the consequences are far-reaching. As a customer of a business which has experienced a data breach, you could face:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Financial Loss:</strong>¬†Hackers can use stolen financial information to make unauthorized purchases or open new accounts in your name.</li><li><strong>Identity Theft:</strong>¬†Data breaches can be a stepping stone for identity theft, where criminals use your information to impersonate you and potentially rack up debt or even commit crimes.</li><li><strong>Damaged Credit Score:</strong>¬†Fraudulent activity can wreak havoc on your credit score, making it difficult to secure loans or rent an apartment.</li><li><strong>Emotional Distress:</strong>¬†Dealing with the aftermath of a data breach can be stressful and time-consuming. Don't discount this aspect even though it's not very "technical".</li></ul>
<p>None of that sounds good. And to be honest, none of it may happen even when your data is leaked out. A company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-sued-over-recent-data-breach">required by law</a> to report a breach of customer data, no matter how small, and most of the time customers see no immediate impact when it happens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="4spABXLZQoBv4T9qd8mPVj" name="credit-karma.jpg" alt="Credit karma" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4spABXLZQoBv4T9qd8mPVj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The issue is that your data is out there and available. There are websites and forums where this sort of data is bought and sold every day. You hear crazy stories about the "Dark Web," and some are real. If I had the desire and the money, I could buy a bundle of names and credit card numbers this afternoon. So could you. So could someone who wants to try and use them to steal money from people like us.</p>
<p>This is why you need to pay attention and do your part when it happens. The affected company will have some guidelines you should follow, so be sure to follow what they suggest. In the most recent example as of writing, AT&T has forced all customers to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/support/article/my-account/000101995?">create a new passcode</a> and suggests that you monitor your credit report. If a breach is severe, a company may also offer free identity and credit monitoring services. Please take advantage of them.</p><p>Other steps worth considering are changing all your account passwords, contacting your bank and credit card companies so they can flag your accounts for monitoring, or even placing a freeze notice on your credit report so no new accounts can be opened in your name.</p>
<p>That said, the best things you can do happen <em>before</em> a data breach. They&apos;re things you should be doing anyway, and they can dramatically limit the damage from a data breach. They&apos;re also pretty easy:</p>
<ul><li>Be cautious online, and never click any link from someone you don't trust.</li><li>Use 2FA (<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">two-factor authentication</a>) for every account or service offering it.</li><li>Use a VPN if you need to use public wi-fi regularly.</li><li>Keep the software on all your connected devices up to date.</li></ul>
<p>Data breaches are a concern in today&apos;s digital age and will only become more commonplace. Understanding the risks and taking preventative measures can minimize the damage and protect your personal information, even when billion-dollar companies don&apos;t get it right.</p><p>For further insight into data security and breach response, visit the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Identity Theft Resource Center</a> (ITRC) webpage for information and up-to-date notices of data breaches.</p>

<p>Motorola unveiled its next mid-range smartphone today (Apr. 3), the Edge 50 Pro, for the Indian market. Although it falls in the cheaper Android phone segment, it has some interesting features.</p><p>They start with the exciting colorways accompanied by a finish on the rear. Aside from the conventional black colorway, the Motorola Edge 50 Pro comes in Luxe Lavender with a vegan leather finish and a pearl finish for the tofu color variant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="7esqVprQeVc7wuRZAn9BuE" name="motorola-edge-50-pro-01.jpg" alt="Motorola Edge 50 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7esqVprQeVc7wuRZAn9BuE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Edge 50 Pro sports a 6.7-inch pOLED curved display that supports smoother 140Hz refresh rates. Additionally, the display is validated by Pantone, which claims to represent natural skin tones truly.</p><p>Under the hood, the Motorola Edge 50 Pro is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phone/snapdragon-7-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 3</a> SoC, the latest from Qualcomm tuned for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range Android phone</a> segment. The chipset with promised clock speeds up to 2.63GHz ‚Äî and was also recently seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-ce-4-announced-in-india">OnePlus Nord CE 4</a>, which debuted in the Indian region.</p><p>The device has up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage. It further ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>-based Hello UI out of the box. The Edge 50 Pro is promised with at least three OS upgrades and five-year security updates.</p>
<p>The Edge 50 Pro&apos;s decent 4500mAh battery capacity is paired with 125W TurboPower charging support that keeps the device going. The mid-range phone also supports 50W wireless charging and 10W reverse charging. The company provides 68W in the box for the base storage and charges an additional amount for the 12W charging adapter, which also gives an additional storage variant.</p><p>The Edge 50 Pro has a triple rear camera system with a 50MP primary camera aided by a 13MP ultra wide-angle and another 10MP telephoto sensor. On the front, another 50MP selfie shooter comes with AI-powered enhancement modes similar to the rear camera system. The Pantone certification also applies to the camera system, promising accurate natural skin tones of the subject.</p>
