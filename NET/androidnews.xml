<p>If you take one look at Google&apos;s lineup of smartphones, it might be a bit overwhelming to some. At the time of this writing, there are a total of eight phones available for sale, I can&apos;t help but feel like it&apos;s a bit unnecessary.</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that Google should have stuck to releasing just one or two phones a year, but, the lineup is more convoluted than ever. Not to mention that Google is expected to add one more phone into the mix as last year&apos;s Pixel Fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/past-gen-pixel-availability-following-pixel-9">should be back</a> "soon."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1502px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="e7dtnSjMJUcEvWFAVnHiUF" name="current-google-pixel-phone-lineup-8-22-24.jpg" alt="Current Google Pixel phone lineup as of 8/22/24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e7dtnSjMJUcEvWFAVnHiUF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1502" height="845" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, Google might want to think about overhauling its lineup when it comes time for the Pixel 10. As it stands, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-vs-pixel-7a">Pixel 7a and Pixel 8a</a> are listed, both of which are priced at $499. This alone makes me wonder what&apos;s going on, as the 8a was released in May, and it&apos;s not like the 7a has seen a permanent price drop.</p><p>Then there are the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, which are still listed on Google&apos;s online storefront. Presumably, these may eventually be replaced by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-pixel-9-or-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 and 9 Pro</a> altogether, but that probably won&apos;t happen until some time down the road. But here&apos;s another idea — ditch the "Pro" moniker completely.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="N9Tp2Zhx5PPyKgEuw6AEVH" name="google-pixel-9-pro-obsidian-and-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-in-cases-02.jpg" alt="A Google Pixel 9 Pro in a Thinborne aramid fiber case and a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in an official Google case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N9Tp2Zhx5PPyKgEuw6AEVH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This delineation is something that all smartphone makers have taken to over the years, but it&apos;s becoming a nuisance. Instead, I suggest that Google should simplify things, and this is how it might look:</p>
<ul><li>Pixel 10a</li><li>Pixel 10</li><li>Pixel 10 XL</li><li>Pixel 10 Fold</li></ul>
<p>My reasoning for this shakeup goes beyond just naming conventions, which have always been pretty awful with smartphones (don&apos;t get me started on TV names).</p><p>There&apos;s already a clear difference in what&apos;s possible between the Pixel 9 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, but you won&apos;t be able to notice until you look at the rear camera bar. The Pixel 9 has less RAM (12GB vs. 16GB), one less camera, and a lower screen resolution. Almost everything else is the same, including the screen size, dimensions, and build quality.</p><p>Both of these phones are also powered by the same Tensor G4 chip, and the 12GB of RAM should be more than enough for most tasks. However, the $799 price tag is rather steep considering that the Pixel 9 lacks a few "defining" features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nQQVtS85orDKfD5Gc7LP24" name="google-pixel-9-pro-gemini-live-02.jpg" alt="Using Gemini Live on the Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nQQVtS85orDKfD5Gc7LP24.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first of which is that while the other three Pro models include a year of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini" target="_blank">Gemini Advanced</a> for free, with the Pixel 9, you only get a six-month trial for the 2TB Google One plan without the Premium AI benefits. It&apos;s rather odd, especially considering that practically all of the Gemini Advanced features work with the non-Pro model, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">Gemini Live</a>.</p><p>Next up is the idea that Google wants you to pay $800 for a phone that lacks a telephoto camera, which is present on the similarly-priced Galaxy S24. This could be a superficial explanation as to why the Pixel 9 doesn&apos;t have the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/lesson-learned-with-google-zoom-enhance-feature">Zoom Enhance</a> feature. Ignoring that it was announced as a key Pixel 8 Pro feature, either Google is gate-keeping features, or there&apos;s some tangible reason that hasn&apos;t been shared.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AmYusEJKqzkxPdvKfgmPk5" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-camera-viewfinder-01.jpg" alt="Taking a photo of a gate with the Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AmYusEJKqzkxPdvKfgmPk5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last but certainly not least, something that&apos;s left us scratching our heads is how close the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-vs-pixel-8">Pixel 8 and 8a</a> are in price. Sure, $150 isn&apos;t <em>that</em> close, but when comparing the features of the two, the Pixel 8 really doesn&apos;t seem like it offers $150 more in value.</p><p>Google is trying to prevent the same thing from happening again, but it is doing so by just raising the price. The Pixel 9 starts at $799, while the Pixel 8a comes in at $499. Sure, the cameras are better, and there&apos;s more RAM on board, but that&apos;s pretty much it. It really just feels like the Pixel 9 doesn&apos;t offer a whole lot of value when you look at the entire Pixel portfolio.</p><p>It&apos;s a corner that Google backed itself into by adding a third phone into the mix with this lineup. While it doesn&apos;t make much sense to get the Pixel 9 over the Pixel 8a, Google could rectify the situation by ditching the Pro moniker altogether.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6tcayRk63cRY9xtVSBnnQQ" name="google-pixel-8a-blue-with-flowers-01.jpg" alt="The blue Google Pixel 8a on a tea tray with blue hydrangeas above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6tcayRk63cRY9xtVSBnnQQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because the "A" series signifies a more budget-friendly offering, it&apos;s probably worth keeping around. Here&apos;s what I had in mind if Google were to make some kind of changes now:</p>
<ul><li>Pixel 9a: $649</li><li>Pixel 9: $899</li><li>Pixel 9 XL: $999</li><li>Pixel 9 Fold: $1,799</li></ul>
<p>And really, if Google wanted to, it could keep the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> around for another year but drop the price to something like $399. That leaves enough of a price gap to warrant upgrading from one model to the next. Want a phone that&apos;s all that and a bag of chips? Get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>. Need a bigger screen that doesn&apos;t fold? It&apos;s only $100 more.</p><p>Something else that this does is leave room for one more device to enter the fray. It&apos;s one that some of my counterparts here at Android Central have been hoping for. And now that Google has solved its design woes with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, it opens the door for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-flip">Pixel Flip</a>. </p><p>But honestly, I&apos;d rather see Google push the competition with Samsung and drop the price of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> down a few hundred dollars.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Gemini Live is one of the stars of the show on the Google Pixel 9 series, bringing with it a new "more human" conversational model to Google&apos;s powerful AI assistant. Gemini Live packs in 10 different voices that all sound <em>extremely</em> human, with impressively accurate inflection, natural pauses, and other humanlike speech qualities.</p><p>But while it&apos;s fun to experiment and chat with an AI model, many of us have wondered how this could actually be <em>useful</em> in our daily lives, so I sought to use it to solve one of my biggest pain points in any given week: making a grocery list.</p><p>See, I <strong>love</strong> cooking. Always have. It&apos;s a great way for me to unwind after work and get some great food in the process. But to get to that point, I have to have the list and the ingredients to make it. Since I can&apos;t afford a human personal assistant in my life, maybe Gemini could take the burden. Turns out, that&apos;s at least somewhat true.</p>
<h2 id="the-chat-2">The chat</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/euRgJMKNN78" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>For the sake of this article, I re-recorded the chat above so you can get an idea of how the original one went.</p><p>In the original test, I left the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> on my counter and talked to Gemini Live while I made dinner. I don&apos;t have a large kitchen by any means but I didn&apos;t hover over the phone while I ran the experiment. Rather, the idea was that I wanted to talk to Gemini Live as if it were a real person as I was cooking an evening family meal.</p><p>I was left pretty speechless (not literally) at how impressive Gemini Live&apos;s conversational skills were. The AI model not only heard me perfectly over the sounds of chopping and cooking food, but it didn&apos;t arbitrarily pause any time a noise was made. I&apos;ve had this happen countless numbers of times when on a call with an automated phone system and it&apos;s beyond annoying when it happens.</p><p>Interrupting Gemini Live is totally possible and you can do it as naturally as you&apos;d like. Normally, I&apos;d start by saying "Gemini," then follow with my request, but even taking out the niceties and just barreling into your new request will work.</p><p>And all of Gemini Live&apos;s responses sounded impressively humanlike. If you put this voice on a video, I&apos;m not sure I would even know it wasn&apos;t being spoken by a person.</p><p>Once you end a session, Gemini Live gives you a full text transcript of the conversation, making it easy to share or export each section into a Google Keep note, email, or something else.</p>
<h2 id="making-a-list-and-checking-it-twice-2">Making a list (and checking it twice)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8bCUGcKHwkrXYYYUozT6G4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-gemini-live-01.jpg" alt="Talking to Gemini Live on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8bCUGcKHwkrXYYYUozT6G4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I started off by asking Gemini to make me a meal plan for the week including three meals a day plus three snacks. I specified that I wanted a Keto-friendly diet to keep carbs low and protein high, and followed up with letting it know that I&apos;d rather not eat oats, soy, or drink protein shakes. It&apos;s a complicated list but someone&apos;s got to make it.</p><p>Things started off rather well, with Gemini giving me quick examples of what to eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as a handful of snack ideas that I can use interchangeably. But this was only a meal plan for a day, not an entire week like I had asked.</p><p>Gemini Live finished up the list and asked if I wanted recipes, so of course I responded yes, I&apos;d love that. The response I got felt as lazy as possible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.22%;"><img id="UJzePD2TYYGQiWJc3GExKA" name="google-pixel-9-pro-gemini-live-grocery-list-screenshots-01.jpg" alt="Making a grocery list with Gemini Live" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UJzePD2TYYGQiWJc3GExKA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of giving me actual recipes — you know, a breakdown of items I need with measurable amounts, followed by preparation or cooking steps — I more or less got a slightly more detailed version of the previous response. If I&apos;m looking for a silver lining here, at least it gave me a short breakdown of the ingredients even if it didn&apos;t give me proper amounts of each.</p><p>Alright, so that wasn&apos;t <em>exactly</em> what I asked for but it&apos;s pretty close. I have a brain and know how to cook so I can guess at the right amounts since these are pretty simple recipes. I still don&apos;t have a week&apos;s worth of food but let&apos;s try to make a list next and go from there, shall we?</p><p>After requesting a shopping list for the previous response, Gemini asks me about food allergies so it can make a good list. I already said this in the initial request but didn&apos;t use the word "allergies," so I&apos;ll give it a pass. I decided to add no yogurt to the list of allergens just to be sure nothing I can&apos;t eat doesn&apos;t get added to the list. Better safe than sorry.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.22%;"><img id="ypUFDNPK3g9ezkzMeEGJXA" name="google-pixel-9-pro-gemini-live-grocery-list-screenshots-02.jpg" alt="Making a grocery list with Gemini Live" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ypUFDNPK3g9ezkzMeEGJXA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The response was annoying, to say the least. Gemini repeated nearly everything it just said, although it changed dinner plans around, then finally got into the proper grocery list. I wish it would have just started there.</p><p>The resulting list is in paragraph form, which isn&apos;t particularly useful at the grocery store but, thankfully, you can ask it to change the list into bullet points. I didn&apos;t know this until my second attempt — the one that&apos;s on video above — so I moved on to asking for a list for the rest of the week.</p><p>Remember, I&apos;m not looking at the screen at all this entire conversation. I&apos;m cooking dinner. Gemini Live doesn&apos;t give you a live transcript of the conversation, anyway, so looking at the screen is entirely useless. That transcript comes after you end the session.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>In the end, it only gave me recipe ideas for three days and seemed to forget about food allergies I previously told it I had.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Getting a grocery list for the rest of the week was largely unsuccessful. Gemini Live gave me a two-day grocery plan (instead of a full week) and then proceeded to forget a few of the things I told previously. First, it recommended a full-fat yogurt smoothie for breakfast. If you recall, I told it no yogurt just two steps ago.</p><p>Then, of course, it seemed to forget that I asked for the rest of the week. I could continue to ask for recipes for Thursday through Sunday, but at this point I got a little tired of trying to make it work. The suggestions it gave me weren&apos;t bad, per se, but I&apos;d get pretty bored if I only made these things every few days.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3556px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gbE7NDe2Rut6zCprCEjsVE" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-24.jpg" alt="Gemini Live UI on the Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbE7NDe2Rut6zCprCEjsVE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3556" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m primarily concerned with the fact that it can&apos;t seem to remember important things like allergens just two steps after it specifically <em>asked me </em>about them. Obviously, as someone who has issues with certain foods, I&apos;m not going to blindly buy everything that&apos;s on a list it gave me. But if Google built in some sort of feature that asks about allergens when making a meal plan, I expect the AI to remember what I told it.</p><p>At this point, Gemini Live can&apos;t export much in the way of usable data to other apps. Google is working on a feature it calls "extensions" that&apos;ll enhance Gemini&apos;s ability to interact with other apps, but the current list of available extensions is pretty small. Right now, Gemini extensions include Google Flights, Google Hotels, Google Maps, Google Workspace, YouTube, and YouTube Music.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.37%;"><img id="GiR2uxMCETmMUmKm2XFWiA" name="google-pixel-9-pro-gemini-live-grocery-list-screenshots-03.jpg" alt="Exporting a grocery list generated by Gemini Live to Google Keep" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GiR2uxMCETmMUmKm2XFWiA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1523" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many Gemini extensions are mainly used to gather information from associated Google services rather than add information to those services. I can&apos;t ask Gemini to export the grocery list to a Google Keep document, for example, because there&apos;s no extension for Keep or Google Tasks at the moment.</p><p>I can, however, end the Gemini Live session and tap the share icon underneath the list section, then share it to Keep to make a new document. That&apos;s not as hands-free or effortless as I might expect from a super smart AI assistant, but there&apos;s at least a manual way to get the job done in a few clicks.</p><p>But if I&apos;m paying $20 a month for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> tier that gets me Gemini Advanced, I expect the thing to be able to store and remember data I asked it to remember. That not only includes lists of allergens or other important information like that, but anything else I say or do that&apos;s notable while interacting with it.</p><p>I imagine Google is working on a way to enhance this and make that sort of stored data more private but, until then, I&apos;m not convinced I should be paying for Gemini Advanced. Whether it makes sense for you — based on the myriad of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">other things Gemini Advanced can do</a> — might be a different story.</p>

With its latest release, Google&apos;s flagship wearable has become even more of a viable option, but does that mean you should upgrade to the Pixel Watch 3?</p><p>After Google purchased Fitbit, there were plenty of questions about when Google would release a non-Fitbit smartwatch. Some of those questions were answered when the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> launched alongside the Pixel 7 series. Despite the fact that we&apos;re now on our third iteration, there are still reasons for, and against, making the switch to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-should-upgrade-to-the-pixel-watch-3-2">Why you should upgrade to the Pixel Watch 3</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5111px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7CYB4VkaSFhmKx45pLQhJ3" name="google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-45mm-fitbit-quick-start.jpg" alt="Fitbit Quick Start buttons on Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7CYB4VkaSFhmKx45pLQhJ3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5111" height="2875" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For those out there with big wrists, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-bigger-size">our wishes</a> have been granted as there&apos;s finally a larger Pixel Watch to enjoy. The Pixel Watch 3 now comes in two sizes, with a 41mm and 45mm case size to choose from.</p><p>Not only that, but Google also slimmed down those chonky bezels from the previous two models. With this, even the 41mm version has a larger screen, sporting a 1.27-inch screen, up from the 1.2-inch screen of its predecessors. Meanwhile, the 45mm Pixel Watch 3 is equipped with a 1.4-inch display, all while keeping the same svelte design.</p><p>Google also seemingly went the "extra mile" for those who pick up the 45mm version. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS</a> has been fine-tuned to take advantage of the extra screen real estate, as some menus will have more options to choose from, or you&apos;ll just be able to see more content than the 41mm model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="aFo87rpy8zfzMobPVrbe3U" name="google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-45mm-with-pixel-buds-pro-2-3.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 with Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aFo87rpy8zfzMobPVrbe3U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It shouldn&apos;t come as much of a surprise that the 45mm has a larger battery, but so does the 41mm option. Really, the only downside here is that no matter what size you get, both of these smartwatches are rated to last for up to 24 hours, which can be stretched to 36 hours with Battery Saver mode enabled.</p><p>While we would have liked to see the 45mm offer more battery than the smaller version, it&apos;s just a good thing to see longer battery life available over the Pixel Watch 2. Google also improved the charging speed for its latest wearable, as the 41mm model can go from 0-100% in about an hour. Meanwhile, Google estimates the 45mm version will take "about 80 minutes" to get a full charge.</p><p>Physical differences aside, Google is completely overhauling the Fitbit integration, as Google is seemingly setting its sights on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin</a>. There are a lot of new features with the Pixel Watch 3 designed for runners. Not only can you build "custom runs," but you&apos;ll also receive "real-time guidance" to help you reach your goals.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zaB27nt4BWm8WbpMsWsuy4" name="google-pixel-9-fitbit-app-stride-length-overview.jpg" alt="Stride length in Fitbit app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zaB27nt4BWm8WbpMsWsuy4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After using the Pixel Watch 3 for a few workouts, Google AI will be able to analyze running sessions and then provide personalized recommendations. This is great if you aren&apos;t really sure how to push yourself further, in the event that you&apos;re feeling kind of stagnant in your workouts.</p><p>Some of this is made possible with the implementation of "advanced motion sensing." With the Pixel Watch 3, you can get feedback on how to improve your running form, relying on measurements such as stride length, cadence, and more. Apparently, this is something that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">Fitbit owners</a> have been asking for, and it&apos;s finally here with the Pixel Watch 3.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-shouldn-apos-t-upgrade-to-the-pixel-watch-3-2">Why you shouldn&apos;t upgrade to the Pixel Watch 3</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Q6xqoT5qyTQT3BVKyYE9Fg" name="fitbit-sense-2-vs-google-pixel-watch-16x9-hero.jpg" alt="Fitbit Sense 2 vs Google Pixel Watch comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q6xqoT5qyTQT3BVKyYE9Fg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a lot to be excited about if you&apos;re looking to upgrade to the Pixel Watch 3, but there are a couple of key reasons why you might want to skip Google&apos;s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a>. Those who care more about specs won&apos;t be too happy to learn that there aren&apos;t very many "under the hood" improvements this time around.</p><p>Google is still relying on the Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 SoC, which has been around for more than two years at this point. On the bright side, you likely won&apos;t notice any performance limitations thanks to the continued inclusion of the Cortex M33 co-processor. Plus, the Pixel Watch 3 continues to provide 2GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="TWnsNiFHb4PY4SbwxWeqEa" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-heart-rate-range.jpg" alt="Daily rate rate ranges on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TWnsNiFHb4PY4SbwxWeqEa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although Qualcomm hasn&apos;t introduced a true successor to the W5 platform, we can&apos;t help but wonder about Google expanding its Tensor series into the smartwatch scene. The company has shown that it&apos;s willing to bring Tensor to other devices, as evidenced by the introduction of the Tensor A1 found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-launch">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>.</p><p>This sentiment can be felt beyond just the performance of the Pixel Watch 3. Google is still using the same health tracking sensors that were introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a>, back in September 2022. The Pixel Watch 3 marks the fourth device to include these sensors, starting with the Sense 2, and spanning across all three Pixel Watch generations.</p><p>On one hand, this might be seen as a benefit, as the included sensors are so good that they don&apos;t actually warrant an upgrade. However, it falls a bit short when considering that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> introduces the ability to track both snoring and alert you if there&apos;s a chance that you suffer from sleep apnea.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="o7JXfP3syzrv9LqmuykoRn" name="google-pixel-watch-3-custom-run-activity-2.jpg" alt="Custom Run Activity on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o7JXfP3syzrv9LqmuykoRn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the more obvious reasons why you might want to skip the Pixel Watch 3 has to do with all of those helpful new running features. Simply put, if you&apos;re not a runner, plan to start running, or can&apos;t run, why would you care about your stride length or running posture? </p><p>Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s really impressive to see everything that Google is bringing to the table with the Watch 3. But, none of those fancy changes matter if you&apos;ll never take advantage of them. </p><p>So while Google is leaning heavily on machine learning and AI to provide its health tracking improvements, it&apos;s not exactly on the bleeding edge of innovation. Not to mention what potential changes the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch</a> might be introduced, which is rumored to be announced in the near future.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's new book-style foldable, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim, is rumored to launch in South Korea on September 25 and soon after in China.</li><li>It’s rumored to be Samsung’s thinnest foldable yet, at just over 10mm thick, compared to the standard Z Fold 6's 12.1mm.</li><li>The foldable is tipped to come in black and cost around 2.8 million won (about $2,100), which could be pricey for many.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has been rumored to be developing a new book-style foldable smartphone, dubbed the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim, and a new leak suggests the device will launch in South Korea in September.</p><p>According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2024/08/21/GGIYIGY43VHHVA2J74VAVWLEDQ/" target="_blank">The Chosun Daily</a>, Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim will be available only in South Korea and China (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/22/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-slim-release-date-report/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). It’s tipped to launch in South Korea on September 25, with a Chinese release coming soon after.</p><p>Rumor has it that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim will be Samsung&apos;s thinnest foldable yet, coming in at just over 10mm thick. This is a noticeable trim down from the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, which measures around 12.1mm.</p><p>The upcoming foldable is also rumored to sport larger screens than the standard version. While exact sizes aren&apos;t confirmed yet, reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/leaks-suggest-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-slim-might-be-worth-waiting-for">hint at a 6.5-inch external display and an 8-inch internal screen</a>, compared to the regular Z Fold 6&apos;s 6.3-inch and 7.6-inch displays.</p><p>The phone might come in black and is rumored to cost about 2.8 million won, or roughly $2,100, which could be a hefty price for many considering a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>.</p><p>A separate report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/nieuws/samsung-z-fold-6-slim-eerste-camera-specificaties/" target="_blank">GalaxyClub</a> reveals that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim might feature an upgraded Under Display Camera (UDC) technology.</p><p>Since 2022, Samsung has kept the same camera setup for its flagship foldables: a 50MP main, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto lens. The front-facing selfie camera and Under Display Camera (UDC) have also stayed at 10MP and 4MP, respectively.</p><p>GalaxyClub suggests that the device will likely keep the 12MP ultrawide and 10MP front-facing cameras from the standard model. However, it’s rumored to get a 5MP UDC, up from 4MP in the regular version. This small boost might slightly improve image sharpness and detail.</p><p>It’s uncertain how the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim will stack up against the Galaxy Z Fold 6. One guess is that Samsung might have slimmed it down by ditching the digitizer layer, potentially making it S Pen-free.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Instagram is rolling out a MySpace-inspired feature where you can add your favorite song directly to your profile.</li><li>You can add a track to your profile bio, and visitors can play or pause it as they wish—no autoplay like on MySpace.</li><li>You can choose from a wide range of artists and even pick a 30-second clip to feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Instagram is rolling out a nostalgic throwback to the MySpace days, letting users highlight their favorite songs right on their profiles.</p><p>According to Meta&apos;s recent post on X (formerly Twitter), the new feature lets you add your favorite songs right into your profile bio. It stays put until you decide to change it.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🎵You can now add music to your @instagram profile (karaoke skills not included) 🎤 pic.twitter.com/H1tJ9PiwWS<a href="https://twitter.com/MetaNewsroom/status/1826635289240248818">August 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Unlike MySpace&apos;s autoplay, however, people visiting your profile can play or pause the track whenever they want.</p><p>Before, users could personalize their profiles with their name, pronouns, bio, links, and banners. But the static text and links made it all feel a bit dull.</p><p>The new update adds a dynamic twist to profiles by letting you include music. It’s a cool way to show off your personality and give a peek into your current music tastes on the Meta-owned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">social app</a>.</p><p>The library offers a ton of artists to pick from, and you can also choose a specific 30-second clip to feature on your profile. But keep in mind that, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225247/instagram-song-on-profile-myspace-sabrina-carpenter-teaser" target="_blank">The Verge</a> points out, Instagram limits you to just that short segment.</p><p>To set a song on your profile, open Instagram, go to "Edit Profile," and scroll down to the new "Music" section. Tap it, then search for your favorite artist or track to feature.</p><p>To swap out or ditch the song, head back to "Edit Profile" or just tap the song on your profile. A menu will slide in where you can either remove the track or pick a new one.</p><p>Music <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagrams-new-stories-stickers-let-you-turn-your-story-into-a-music-template">has been part of Instagram for a while</a> with Stories and feed posts. Now, the platform has upped the game by letting you add a song to your profile, so you can show off your musical taste even more.</p><p>Instagram&apos;s new profile music feature might just tickle your MySpace nostalgia. MySpace might have long faded from the scene, but its old-school profile jams are back on Instagram, bringing a mix of nostalgia and giggles to your feed.</p>

<ul><li>Google posted on Reddit that old and new Android 15 users can start downloading the software's QPR1 Beta 1 build.</li><li>The patch reportedly weighs around 490MB, though Google doesn't state the specifics behind everything users are downloading.</li><li>The company rolled out its final Android 15 beta build earlier this August, leaving users to speculate that a full release could happen in September.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Time to get excited. Google is rolling out the first QPR beta test for its Android 15 software to enrolled testers.</p><p>The company posted its announcement for the arrival of Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1eyqjlx/android_15_qpr1_beta_1_now_available/">on Reddit</a>, alerting users to the enrollment period. Google states users with a Pixel 6 series, Pixel 7 series, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 series</a> device can begin signing up. The QPR&apos;s beta extends to the Pixel Tablet and the original Pixel Fold.</p><p>The post reminds users that if they were a part of the Android 15 beta, and <em>did not</em> opt-out, they will automatically receive this OTA update.</p><p>Users getting into things will find the QPR1 Beta 1 build listed as version <strong>AP41.240726.009</strong>. Moreover, Google states the download includes its recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-august-2024-update">August 2024 security patch</a>, which solved an alarming reboot problem. Users are already picking up the update and say the build is around 490 to 500MB.</p><p>Google didn&apos;t get into the nitty-gritty of what this first QPR beta entails. However, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes-qpr1">detailed a few things</a> users should be aware of:</p>
<ul><li>This release might have various stability, battery, or performance issues.</li><li>For users with accessibility needs, this release might not be appropriate for daily use.</li><li>Some apps might not function as expected when running on this release. This limitation includes Google's apps as well as other apps.</li></ul>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1eyqjlx/android_15_qpr1_beta_1_now_available">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>If you&apos;re not in the beta, Google has published a page packed with the appropriate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/get-qpr1">Android 15 QPR beta builds</a>.</p><p>This QPR1 Beta 1 builds off the stable version of Android 15, which might seem odd considering we don&apos;t have it yet. Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/final-android-15-beta-4-2-rollout">the final beta test</a> for its next major OS earlier this month. The patch minor patch was fairly minor as the company implemented a few fixes for issues that caused UI flickering, a YouTube app crash, and more.</p><p>Additionally, with the beta final update already in our hands, speculation suggests September could hold the full release. Google has worked to bring a few new features to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> alongside better optimization for a better system experience.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-it-mean-if-both-google-and-samsungs-android-15-updates-are-delayed">Google and Samsung&apos;s Android 15 delays</a> have concerned plenty of long-time Android fans. The timing is especially odd, as Google chose to release the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> months earlier than usual but didn&apos;t have Android 15 ready, so it launched with last year&apos;s Android 14. Perhaps this beta test on post-stable software is a good sign.</p><p>While we&apos;ve yet to test the QPR1 Beta 1 ourselves yet, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/22/android-15-qpr1-beta-1-everything-new/">9to5Google</a> has spotted a long-press Quick Settings tile and a new loading indicator.</p>

<ul><li>Google Essentials is a new app that gathers all its services in one spot on Windows PCs.</li><li>It’ll be preinstalled on HP laptops, including Envy, Pavilion, and Omen models, with plans to expand to other brands soon.</li><li>You can access Google Photos, Messages, Sheets, Drive, and other tools right from your start menu.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out a new Windows app called Essentials, which bundles its services into one handy spot. It also offers quick access to a full range of other Google services that you can download whenever you need them.</p><p>Google’s new app is basically a way of getting all its services into one place. It’s part of the search giant&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-chrome-windows-arm-optimization-rollout">plan to win over more Windows users</a> and spread its reach.</p><p>The company revealed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/google-essentials-windows-pcs/" target="_blank">blog post</a> that the Essentials app will come preloaded on a bunch of upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-laptop">Windows laptops</a>, starting with HP.</p><p>HP is set to roll out Google Essentials on its lineup of computers, including Envy, Pavilion, and Omen models. Google highlights how handy Essentials will be but also makes it clear that you can uninstall any of its services or the whole app if you want.</p><p>The Essentials app will act as a hub, letting you access various Google services right from your PC’s start menu. For example, you’ll be able to browse <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> and chat through Google Messages without leaving the app.</p><p>Google hasn’t revealed all the apps that Essentials will support yet, but its promo shows icons for Google Sheets, Drive, Quick Share, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a>.</p>

<p>Essentials will also give you quick web shortcuts to Google’s productivity tools, like Docs, Drive, and Calendar. Plus, eligible Google One users will get a free two-month trial of 100GB of cloud storage.</p><p>Essentials also includes Google Play Games, letting you download and play <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">popular Android games</a> like Clash of Clans right on your PC. You can access these games through Essentials or the HP Omen Gaming Hub and sync your game progress with your Android devices.</p><p>Although the Essentials app will initially be exclusively available for HP devices, Google plans to roll it out to more brands in the coming months.</p>

The Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 for the 128GB version, and there&apos;s also a more-expensive 1TB version if you need additional storage. The Google Pixel 9 Pro is set to hit store shelves on <strong>September 4th</strong>. </p>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s satellite SOS emergency feature on the Pixel 9 is available now. Testing it would actually trigger an emergency response, but you can (and should) see how it works with Google&apos;s interactive demo.</p><p>Pixel 9 owners can head into <strong>Settings > Safety & emergency > Satellite SOS</strong>. You can then tap the "Try a demo" button. For this demo, your device will skip all of the usual on-screen questions while also shutting off your mobile, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connections. The questions involve crucial bits of information like how many people are lost, how long have you been lost, and the nature of your emergency.</p><p>The company states that users can message and share their location with authorities to seek help.</p><p>To get started, users are met with a fun graphic instructing them where they should turn to be in line with a nearby satellite. The more you turn and approach the right angle, the more the satellite&apos;s graphic will shift until it&apos;s in the center of your screen. Users are advised to remain outside and in clear view of the sky until this process is completed.</p><p>Once the graphic shines green, keep your phone still until it has established a stable connection. After, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> will automatically submit the answers to the on-screen questions (if this were a real scenario) to the Garmin Response Team. It may take a moment, but someone from your team should respond with some more follow-up questions.</p><p>After enough is received, they will then dispatch 911 to your location.</p>

<p>In a real scenario, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z7GuHsiV5s&ab_channel=GoogleHelp">Google states</a> that after your initial contact with emergency services and you still need help, users should tap "yes, I still need help." This option will appear during the "End Satellite SOS?" screen. The company states that tapping "no" will end communications and call off the authorities.</p><p>Additionally, the feature&apos;s page in Settings will state that users <em>must </em>set Google Messages are their default SMS app. It adds that Satellite SOS is included with your device for free for two years. Google has not stated what such pricing will look like after this period ends.</p><p>Google&apos;s Satellite SOS feature on the Pixel 9 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> helps users feel like they&apos;re never truly alone, especially in critical moments. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-satellite-sos-explained">How it works</a> seems reminiscent of Apple&apos;s version; however, Google leverages tech from Skylo and Garmin to get things going.

<hr>
<p>Motorola is ramping up its teaser engine, bringing awareness to an upcoming launch of what could be a mid-range smartphone.</p><p>Motorola posted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Moto/status/1825925883670221193">short video on X</a> that takes users through an assortment of colors. Aside from the aesthetics, Motorola&apos;s video continuously teases two things: Lytia and Pantone. The latter references a company Motorola has leaned on for colors for various devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-special-edition-peach-fuzz-color">Razr Plus and the Edge 40 Neo</a>.</p><p>The teaser clip may have clued us into at least two colors we might expect: Peach Fuzz and Latte. Then there&apos;s "Lytia," which references the mobile imaging sensor within the device.</p><p>The post&apos;s teaser states Moto is gearing up for a launch on August 29, but doesn&apos;t spill the name.</p><p>However, we may have an inkling, as a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/moto-edge-50-neo-launch-imminent-new-renders-leaked/">YTECHB</a> suggests the device in question is the midrange Moto Edge 50 Neo (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/new-motorola-phone-launching-globally-august-29th/">91Mobiles</a>). According to a Ukrainian listing, the phone may arrive with a 6.4-inch POLED, 120Hz refresh rate display. Internally, Moto may pack MediaTek&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">Dimensity 7300</a> SoC alongside Android 14.</p><p>Other alleged specifications include a 50MP primary lens, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 10MP telephoto camera. The publication reportedly picked up on another listing from Hungary, which claims the device will arrive in four colors: Nautical Blue, Latte, Poinciana, and Grisaille.</p>

<p>If this device is the next iteration of Moto&apos;s Neo, it will offer a slight upgrade in terms of photography. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-40-launch">Edge 40 Neo</a> launched with a vertical, dual sensor array on its rear panel with a 50MP primary lens and a 13MP ultrawide lens. This year&apos;s rumors claim that a new telephoto will join the fray, turning things into a triple configuration.</p><p>Elsewhere, the device&apos;s display may shrink to 6.4 inches instead of continuing with its predecessor&apos;s 6.5-inch screen. There&apos;s also the fact that Motorola launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/we/smartphones-motorola-edge-40-neo/p?skuId=539">Edge 40 Neo</a> in mid-September last year, meaning an August 29 debut of the next version (sort of) makes sense.</p><p>Motorola launched another mid-range earlier this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-pro-announced-in-india">the Edge 50 Pro</a> with a passable 4,500mAh battery and a 6.7-inch display. The phone features Qualcomm&apos;s 2023 mid-range specific <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phone/snapdragon-7-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 3</a> SoC with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p>
