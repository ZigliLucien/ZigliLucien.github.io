<ul><li>Users have started reporting experiencing problems with their Pixel 9 series device when rooting/unlocking its bootloader.</li><li>Many of Google's new AI features for the Pixel 9 stop working when one of these methods is applied to the device.</li><li>It's not clear why this is happening, though it's unfortunate, considering unlocking the bootloader and rooting a device can help solve problems users may have.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Attempting any sort of deeper customization on your Pixel 9 might result in some faulty or non-functioning features.</p><p>A few users on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xdaforums.com/t/pixel-screenshots-other-ai-features-dont-work-with-unlocked-bl.4688190/">XDA forums</a> started a thread to mention that the Pixel 9&apos;s AI features break with an unlocked bootloader (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-ai-features-unavailable-bootloader-unlocked-3475527/">Android Authority</a>). The original poster states that Pixel Screenshots stopped working on their Pixel 9 Pro/Pro XL when using a bootloader. Instead, their device displays a persistent "downloading model" message.</p><p>The user managed to get it to work, though they had to "disable on-device AI." Pixel Weather&apos;s AI reports suffer when using an unlocked bootloader, similar to Call Notes on the latest series.</p><p>Regarding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio</a>, the user states it initially displayed a "something went wrong" banner with an unlocked bootloader. However, a follow-up edit states that it <em>can </em>work, but it requires users to either "not spoof the device fingerprint with PIF or you&apos;re spoofing to an A15 Beta print for any of the Pixel 9 family devices."</p><p>One user with an unlocked and rooted Pixel 8 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xdaforums.com/t/pixel-screenshots-other-ai-features-dont-work-with-unlocked-bl.4688190/post-89673364">reportedly got Pixel Studio to work</a>, but it didn&apos;t last long, as it soon stopped functioning.</p><p>It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xdaforums.com/t/pixel-screenshots-other-ai-features-dont-work-with-unlocked-bl.4688190/post-89677519">seems certain</a> that unlocking the Pixel 9&apos;s bootloader causes many of the recently described features to fail. It seems that users&apos; best bet is to lock and unroot their device if they&apos;re experiencing problems with its AI features.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google about these issues with an unlocked bootloader/rooting. We will update this article when we hear back.</p>

<p>Rooting a device has been known to hinder certain services (like streaming), but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-display-upgrade">some goodÂ comes from doing it</a>. Users sensitive to the flickering of a display, also known as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, are a prime example. Naturally, the Pixel 8 features a low 240HZ flicker rate, which can cause nausea, headaches, and other adverse feelings to some users. However, rooting the device and installing a custom ROM can let a (very intuitive) person rewrite the code to alter this frequency. Android Central&apos;s Nicholas Sutrich received some help and boosted the PWM rate to 4800Hz, ridding himself of those terrible feelings.</p><p>The specific reasoning behind these bootloader/rooting issues on the Pixel 9 isn&apos;t clear, leaving users wondering if there&apos;s a bug Google needs to squash. Moreover, the ability, or lack thereof, to root/unlock the device&apos;s bootloader seems to turn off many in the thread.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out some updates today (August 28) for its AI model, Gemini, for image generation and custom Gems.</p><p>Users seeking assistance through Gemini apps are being treated to an Imagen 3 upgrade. Google reiterates that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-imagen-3-is-now-open-to-everyone-in-the-us">Imagen 3</a> is its new "standard" for "generating images in just a few words." The company states users can create photorealistic landscapes and images that mirror oil-based paintings.</p><p>Additionally, Google touts Imagen 3&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights#:~:text=A%20new%20wave%20of%20video%20and%20image%20generation">ability to understand</a> a user&apos;s natural speech to understand the intent behind their description.</p><p>Imagen 3&apos;s rollout in Gemini apps will remain fixed on animals, plants, and other objects at the start. Google states that "in the coming days," it will work to bring the ability to describe and have Gemini create images of people. This is slated to arrive in early access for Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users in English.</p><p>Despite Imagen 3 giving the user full control over their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/14286560?visit_id=638603118036201008-476356290&p=b_gen_img&rd=1">text-to-image generation</a> process, Google has set limits for photos of people. For example, the software will not support photorealistic photos or "identifiable individual" creations.</p>

<p>The final update, which involves Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users, brings "custom Gems" for the AI model. The press release states that these users can soon begin "creating and chatting" with their custom-made Gemini variant. This was a feature Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini#:~:text=GOOGLE%20GEMINI%20VERSIONS%20AND%20SPIN%2DOFFS">teased during I/O 2024</a>, which lets users fine-tune Gemini for a specific need.</p><p>As it rolls out over "the coming days," Google says users will find a few pre-made custom Gem options for Gemini. "Learning Coach" is said to help break down information for users who are learning a new or difficult topic for the first time. The "Brainstormer" option is geared toward offering inspiration for a range of topics.</p><p>The remaining pre-made options are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Career guide: unlocks your career potential with detailed plans to refine your skills and achieve your career goals</li><li>Writing editor: can elevate your writing through clear, constructive feedback on everything from grammar to structure.</li><li>Coding partner: levels up your coding skills and can help you build projects and learn as you go.</li></ul>

<p>More importantly, those creating a custom Gem should be as descriptive as possible. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-update-may-2024/#personalize-gems">Google explains</a> that users can instruct the custom Gemini variant on its purpose and "how it should respond."</p><p>Users can head into the Gemini app on desktop or mobile to find Gems and the ability to create their own. Most languages are supported as Google kickstarts its global rollout.</p><p>Those interested in trying what&apos;s new for Gemini before anyone else can sign up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google/advanced/">Gemini Advanced</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/solutions/ai/">Gemini for Workspace</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>This is why we love iFixit. We recently got to see a cool <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/v9uwCt59_yI?si=OaR8u6mAYYy3hLkA">teardown video from iFixit</a> for the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-teardown-shows-some-promising-changes-under-the-hood">reporting</a> surrounding this is about how Google designed the 9 series to be more durable and how it does better in drop testing, but for me, that&apos;s not the real story here.</p><p>The device gets a mediocre repairability score of 5, which is generous from what I see. A trained professional with all the right tools wasn&apos;t able to open the phone without breaking the display. Removing the battery was a nightmare for the very same professional. And this phone is supposed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-pixel-8-update-promise">last for seven years</a>?</p>
<p>Look, anything will last seven years (or longer) if you&apos;re willing to spend money on it. But <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-pixel-8-update-promise">Google has made a big deal about</a> supporting its devices for seven years, so now it needs to build them in a way that is designed to be easy to keep alive for that long. I just ain&apos;t seeing it here.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> design has a few (almost) saving graces. You don&apos;t have to remove the display to change the battery. That&apos;s good because the display will break while trying to remove it, and the battery will need replacing long before your seven years are up. Unfortunately, removing and replacing the battery is going to be unnecessarily difficult.</p>
<p>That doesn&apos;t account for all the other things that can easily wear out during the rated life of the phone. A great example is that your USB port is going to get loose and might need replacing. If you use the phone â or any phone â for seven years you&apos;ll probably need to replace or repair something.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t have to be this way.</p>

<p>The idea of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">using a phone for seven years is a bit silly</a> anyway. For some people (like me), having to only spend money and buy a phone every seven years is awesome. New stuff will come, and I might want some of it, but as long as it still does what it does today, I&apos;m good.Â </p><p>Most people don&apos;t see it that way. That new thing Google shows off that isn&apos;t going to work on your old phone is all the reason you need to buy a new one. That&apos;s how this works â even on the iPhone. New features will require new hardware, and you&apos;re going to be left out.</p>
<p>Google (and Samsung and Apple and every other phone maker) knows this. They count on it and show you things only to tell you that you need something newer to use them. I appreciate that companies support their products longer, but I don&apos;t pretend they do it because they are the good guy. They will get you to part with your money one way or another.</p>

<p>Google doesn&apos;t have to invent anything here. I recently looked at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD Skyline</a>. It&apos;s a pretty good mid-range phone with a cool camera. One thing special to me is that it&apos;s built so that you can open it and change the battery yourself. My problem is that it has a very short three-year support window.</p><p>Then there&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-wish-the-fairphone-5-was-coming-to-the-us">Fairphone</a>, which makes phones with a 100% repairability score. If you follow instructions and have the right tools, you can easily keep them running when parts break.</p><p>Even if you don&apos;t want to swap the battery or the USB port yourself, any shop is going to be able to do these repairs without breaking anything else or charging you more than it&apos;s worth.</p>
<p>A big reason why Google makes Pixel phones is to show everyone what it thinks a smartphone should be. They are the definition of a halo device.</p><p>Why not go a step further and design them so that your seven-year support promise means a little more? I probably won&apos;t drop my phone and break the screen, accidentally leave it in the sun, or do anything else to "break" my phone. I <em>will</em> use it enough that I&apos;ll need a new battery in a few years.Â </p><p>If it were easy to swap and something anyone could do themselves, it&apos;d be another selling point of a pretty damn good line of phones.</p>

<p>The cat&apos;s finally out of the bag with the squeaky new Pixel 9 family of smartphones. Google gave us not two, not three, but four new flagship phones in one go. That&apos;s quite a lot to process. While our final verdict is still pending, it&apos;s easy to say that the Pixel 9 series gets a lot right. There are plenty of upgrades and AI magic to make the devices enticing for anyone. Yet, despite all that, there&apos;s one problem with the Pixel 9 series that bums me out, and it has to do with the pink color option.</p><p>I won&apos;t lie; the biggest draw for me was purely superficial at first. My inner Elle Woods screamed in dignified delight when the leaks first showcased a pink Pixel. To top it off, it turned out to be an all-pink lineup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> with pink accessories to match! How can a girl say no to that?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HdM9m3JvCLfJq2LSvZT75d" name="Elle_Woods-google-pixel-9-pink-2.jpg" alt="Elle Woods holding a Pixel 9 in Peony wearing all pink to match the pink phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HdM9m3JvCLfJq2LSvZT75d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that we know for sure that three of the four Pixel 9 models come in pink, all I needed to decide was which model to buy. To me, Rose Quartz is the most interesting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-google-pixel-9-pro-or-9-pro-xl-should-you-buy">shade of the upper-tier Pixel 9 Pro</a> series, followed by the deeper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-google-pixel-9-should-you-buy">Peony hue of the basic Pixel 9</a>. The Pixel 9 Pro stood out as the obvious choice since it has practically no other difference compared to the 9 Pro XL in any aspect other than size. I prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">smaller phones</a> as they&apos;re easier to use one-handed.</p><p>My mind was pretty much made up about bumping my Pixel 8 over to the 9 Pro, but that&apos;s when I ran into an unexpected problem. When I&apos;m looking to buy a phone, naturally, I value other specs as well. Storage is a very important factor, especially because Pixels are famously superior photographers. So it was shocking to me that Google does not offer the Pixel 9 Pro or the 9 Pro XL in Rose Quartz with more than 256GB of storage.</p><p>That&apos;s a major roadblock for me because I&apos;ve already got around 200GB of images and videos on my current phone. If I were to upgrade to 256GB â not all of which is usable â I&apos;d run out of space on my brand-new phone in a few short months. It&apos;s not like I can use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">nice microSD card</a> to fix that issue, seeing as most flagships like the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL have ditched expandable storage slots.</p>

<p>Even with the underwhelming performance of the Tensor G4 and the stuttering fingerprint sensor, I was onboard with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. The cameras and the Pixel UI are what I was willing to pay for, and of course, the sweet coat of pink paint. All things considered, storage simply isn&apos;t something I can compromise on.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> is one possible solution here, offering additional online storage and a few bonus features for a monthly or yearly fee. However, this requires you to be connected to the internet at all times. Additionally, relying on a cloud storage solution also means that any of the files that don&apos;t fit on your Pixel will have to be stored in the cloud fully, with no on-device availability. In areas with poor or no connectivity, this is a big drawback.</p>

<p>I don&apos;t know why Google passed on a 512GB option for the pink Pixel 9 phones, but based on experience and my gut, I&apos;m assuming it&apos;s because someone doubted the popularity of this color. When a brand doesn&apos;t have enough confidence in color, they don&apos;t offer larger storage options for it because it assumes that the demand will be low. I reached out to Google for clarification regarding color and storage options but did not get a response in time for publication. I will update the article if I hear back.</p><p>But let&apos;s be honest, 256GB doesn&apos;t cut it anymore. Each colorway should have enough storage to last for a phone that&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">promised seven years of upgrades</a>. Samsung offers more than twice as many colorways on its phones, and you can go as high as 1TB on many of them. If Samsung can do it, why can&apos;t Google?</p>

It&apos;s a new app powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-need-to-try-googles-imagefx-ai-image-generator">Google&apos;s Imagen 3 model</a>, giving users the ability to generate impressive images on-device just by typing in descriptive prompts. That includes being able to render text pretty accurately, something that seemed difficult for text-to-image models until now.</p><p>The idea is to create fun or interesting images straight from your phone, either from scratch or by using any of the samples present in the app. If you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series phone, you&apos;ll have access to this feature out of the box without needing to subscribe to any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> subscription. Here&apos;s how you can get started creating your own images with Pixel Studio.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-and-using-pixel-studio-2">Getting started and using Pixel Studio</h2>
<p>1. Open the app and follow the prompt to <strong>download the AI model</strong>. Once downloaded, you can scroll through the app to view the different example images, with different categories presented at the top.</p><p>2a. <strong>Select an image</strong>, then <strong>tap the</strong> <strong>text field</strong> to edit the prompt and begin changing it to your liking.</p><p>2b. When you&apos;re done, <strong>tap the checkmark</strong> and wait for the updated image to generate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.37%;"><img id="QdRaNpxVJVAK6qJF79bqXD" name="Using-Pixel-Studio-1.jpg" alt="Using Pixel Studio to edit an existing image generation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QdRaNpxVJVAK6qJF79bqXD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2524" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>3. Alternatively, you can also create your own image from scratch by tapping the <strong>Create button</strong> on the main <strong>Pixel Studio home screen</strong>. Once an image is generated, you can press the <strong>circular arrow button</strong> at the bottom to regenerate an image. If you&apos;ve generated multiple images from the same prompt, you&apos;ll be able to scroll back to see what you&apos;ve already generated.</p><p>4. You can change the style of the image by <strong>tapping the middle icon</strong> in the text field. You can also add stickers, add captions, or edit images by tapping the <strong>Stickers and tools</strong> button at the bottom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.37%;"><img id="n72saUJW8vY8ut7oWz9jCH" name="Using-Pixel-Studio-2.jpg" alt="Using Pixel Studio to generate a new image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n72saUJW8vY8ut7oWz9jCH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2524" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>5. Once you&apos;ve generated an image you like, you can select from the options in the top right corner to: copy the image, share it, download it, or delete it.</p><p>6. From the main <strong>Pixel Studio home page</strong>, tap the <strong>folder icon</strong> in the top left corner to access your previous creations.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.37%;"><img id="r8JrC65HjRjXALoA4mFhKF" name="Using-Pixel-Studio-3.jpg" alt="Viewing your image generations in Pixel Studio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r8JrC65HjRjXALoA4mFhKF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2524" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You also have the option to import your own images for editing, although this function is much more limited, as it only lets you move or erase objects and add captions or stickers.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-bad-pixel-studio-image-generations-2">Reporting bad Pixel Studio image generations</h2>
<p>1. Tap the <strong>three dots</strong> in the text field bar.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Bad generation</strong>.</p><p>3. <strong>Fill out the form</strong> by choosing a reason you selected the image as bad and provide any additional feedback in the text field. <strong>Tap the check mark box</strong> at the bottom to agree to send a copy of the image and related content (i.e., the text prompt) to Google.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.37%;"><img id="Mb98fpLqiPQ5WjMMh9AYpB" name="Pixel-Studio-bad-generation.jpg" alt="Reporting a bad generation in Pixel Studio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mb98fpLqiPQ5WjMMh9AYpB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2524" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alternatively, you can follow the same steps to report a good generation and provide Google feedback on why you think so.</p>
<h2 id="pixel-studio-is-a-work-in-progress-2">Pixel Studio is a work in progress</h2>
<p>Pixel Studio is intended to be a fun feature that allows a user&apos;s imagination to run wild. However, given that this is a preview, it&apos;s important to note that the results won&apos;t always be perfect. The company notes that it is working on the ability to generate humans. It also warns that Pixel Studio "might misinterpret your prompt" and that you should be as specific as possible.</p><p>Additionally, while Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15236074?visit_id=638599394150771349-2108561604&p=pixel_studio_restrictions&rd=1#image-restrictions">safeguards</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy">in place</a> to help keep Pixel Studio from generating potentially offensive content,Â <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-not-the-only-way-to-create-unhinged-ai-photos" target="_blank">some things may slip through the cracks</a>. Google is continuously working to address this with the app, but fortunately, you can rate individual generations and report ones you think are bad for whatever reason. This way, Google can better filter out certain types of content from being generated in Pixel Studio.</p>

Despite Google completely overhauling the design of its second-generation foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold does not support the use of a stylus.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="no-stylus-support-here-2">No stylus support here</h2>
<p>Although it was a bit of a long shot, there was still hope that the original Pixel Fold would offer the ability to use the phone with a stylus. That same sentiment held true after rumors began picking up that Google was working on a new iteration of its book-style foldable phone.</p><p>Unfortunately, Google didn&apos;t answer the call with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, as the company&apos;s latest foldable doesn&apos;t support stylus input. That leaves the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phone</a> for those who want to use a stylus.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/using-oppo-pen-with-oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a> can technically be included, the only way you can acquire a stylus that works is by importing an Oppo Pen from abroad. This is due to the fact that while the OnePlus Open and Oppo Find N3 are practically identical, there&apos;s no official stylus support from the OnePlus side of things.</p><p>That being said, it&apos;s still a bit disappointing to see the Pixel 9 Pro Fold miss out on such a useful capability. However, Google is continuing to put more of a focus on keeping its foldable phones as slim as possible. In order to make its phone compatible with a stylus, the company would have to rely on a different type of digitizer layer.</p><p>For example, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 uses an "active digitizer," which recognizes the tip of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">S Pen Fold Edition</a>. So while we&apos;re talking about extremely thin layers of materials, even making this one change could result in Google needing to take a different approach.</p><p>There is hope for stylus support in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, provided that Google follows a similar path to Samsung. S Pen support didn&apos;t arrive for Samsung&apos;s foldable phones until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a>, but this also required a different type of S Pen to be created and released. With any luck, Google will make similar improvements with its next foldable phone.</p>

<p>â<strong>Recommended if:Â </strong>you want to buy a new phone outright, and you don&apos;t mind spending a good amount of money; you&apos;re looking for a premium foldable phone that offers a large set of screens; you want a versatile phone with easy multitasking options.</p><p><strong>âSkip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t want to spend this much money on a new phone; you&apos;d prefer to go for something more affordable and might consider other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-deals-pixel-9-pro-discounts">Pixel 9 deals</a>.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is no joke when it comes to price, especially considering that you can save over $700 going with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> or the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Still, if your heart&apos;s set on a foldable phone that dwells in the Pixel-sphere, and you&apos;ve got the money to spend, the latest foldable effort from Google will give you what you pay for.</p><p>This phone includes a ton of useful and fun Gemini AI features, design improvements from the last-generation Pixel Fold, and a few slight upgrades for the camera suite. The base model comes with 256GB of RAM or you can upgrade to 512GB for an extra $120.</p><p>Sure, the outright price on this phone is pretty daunting, and a $350 gift card can only go so far (although it could easily get you a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-cases">Pixel 9 Pro Fold cases</a>).

POCO decided to limit the F6 Pro to just a few global markets, and the device didn&apos;t make its way to India and most Southeast Asian regions. Instead, POCO offered the F6 as the default option in these countries.</p>

<p>In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO F6 review</a>, I called it one of the best value-focused phones of the year, and that&apos;s down to how affordable it is in India, where it retails for just â¹27,999 ($336). That said, POCO doesn&apos;t quite offer the same value in other regions; the F6 is available for Â£359 ($457) in the U.K., and that isn&apos;t nearly as enticing.</p><p>Thankfully, there&apos;s a better option available: the F6 Pro. The phone is now down to Â£449 ($572), and that makes it worthy of consideration if you&apos;re interested in a new mid-ranger. I didn&apos;t use the F6 Pro when it came out, but I switched to it after using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-sunset-dune-hands-on">OnePlus 12R Sunset Dune edition</a>; it didn&apos;t take long to realize that POCO is onto something special with its 2024 flagship.</p><p>The F6 Pro has a much better design than the standard model, and the white color variant in particular looks striking. I don&apos;t usually prefer phones with flat sides, but POCO added beveled edges, and that makes a big difference in daily use. The glass window around the rear camera housing has been a mainstay on POCO phones going back four years now, and it ends up looking elegant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ddDr5r9ex4XT8zjddqd49K" name="poco-f6-pro-12.jpg" alt="POCO F6 Pro home page against white background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ddDr5r9ex4XT8zjddqd49K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO didn&apos;t shortchange users with material choices either; the F6 Pro uses an aluminum frame that&apos;s sandwiched between panes of glass, and it looks just as premium as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> â if anything, I like POCO&apos;s design more. The only drawback in this area is that the phone has IP54 ingress protection, and that isn&apos;t adequate; even the regular F6 gets an IP64 rating, so I&apos;m not really sure what POCO was thinking.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GNMfigPxwZHmyh5zXv9GwM" name="poco-f6-pro-10.jpg" alt="POCO F6 Pro bezels highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNMfigPxwZHmyh5zXv9GwM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than that and an in-screen module that sits a little too low on the screen, there&apos;s nothing to complain about the design; the F6 Pro has ideal weight distribution, and the textured pattern underneath the glass looks fantastic. There&apos;s a lot to like about the panel too; POCO went with a 120Hz AMOLED panel with QHD+ resolution, and it is easily the best screen of any of its devices to date.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CSJrHWKsNu8k8iC6eTfNZM" name="poco-f6-pro-9.jpg" alt="POCO F6 Pro selfie lens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSJrHWKsNu8k8iC6eTfNZM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The panel doesn&apos;t get quite as bright as other mid-rangers I used this year â the 12R is noticeably brighter outdoors â but it is still a strong showing. On that note, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> is absolutely the right call; Qualcomm&apos;s 2024 chipset still has a lot to offer, and it is just as fast in daily use.</p>

<p>Considering that the 12R is also powered by the same silicon, the F6 Pro is on an equal footing. I didn&apos;t see any issues in the week I used the phone as my daily driver, and it handles demanding games with ease; the only tangible gain you&apos;ll see with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-3-vs-8-gen-2-vs-a17-pro-benchmarks">8 Gen 3</a> is better battery life.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eGFpkfkpfhHdZkgn8bJmEL" name="poco-f6-pro-3.jpg" alt="POCO F6 Pro camera module with all sensors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eGFpkfkpfhHdZkgn8bJmEL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s a similar story with the cameras; the F6 Pro manages to take better shots than the F6 in just about every situation, and it holds up incredibly well in low-light scenarios. The 12R has a slender edge in this area, but on the whole, the F6 Pro isn&apos;t far behind.</p><p>That said, the biggest issue with the cameras is that the auxiliary 8MP wide-angle lens isn&apos;t anywhere as good as the main camera, and I still don&apos;t understand why POCO can&apos;t deliver two usable sensors at the back. This is true of the 12R as well, and only Google manages to deliver a mid-ranger with a wide-angle camera that&apos;s actually decent.</p>

<p>POCO didn&apos;t change any software features from the standard F6, and while I still believe that the software is in need of a visual overhaul, it is much better optimized this year. The interface is fluid, there&apos;s a good amount of customizability, and it doesn&apos;t have any annoying bugs. There&apos;s still a lot of bloatware out of the box, and POCO isn&apos;t good at delivering updates on time â these are things it needs to actively change.</p><p>Overall, the F6 Pro is one of the best phones currently available in the mid-range segment. POCO&apos;s decision to not launch the device in most global markets is puzzling; it is the ideal alternative to the OnePlus 12R and Galaxy A55, and with the manufacturer setting lofty goals this year, wider availability of the F6 Pro would have highlighted the brand&apos;s ambition in this segment.</p>

<p>Late Tuesday, many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-att-wireless">AT&T</a> customers faced a service disruption while trying to connect, which also affected 911 services in several cities. AT&T attributed the issue to a software glitch but has since resolved it.</p><p>There has been a major 911 outage nationwide, with a huge spike in reports popping up on Downdetector around 5:00 PM PST.</p><p>An AT&T spokesperson told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/27/business/att-outage-software-issue-tuesday/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a> that the network carrier had fixed a software glitch that affected some customersâ connections.</p><p>"We apologize for the inconvenience, and we appreciate our customersâ patience as we worked to resolve this issue," the spokesperson added.</p><p>The outage didnât affect everyone, just a portion of AT&T&apos;s user base, according to the spokesperson. On Tuesday evening, police in Pinole, California, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PinolePD/status/1828602202006737400" target="_blank">warned on social media</a> that some AT&T wireless users might have trouble calling 911, but landlines and other carriers werenât affected.</p><p>In Florida, Seminole Countyâs X account <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/seminolecounty/status/1828598590643589293" target="_blank">mentioned</a> a 911 service disruption on Tuesday night.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Pixel 9 Pro XL has big design improvements for durability and repairability, such as the new dual-entry design lets you replace the screen or battery more easily.</li><li>The phone is also tougher now, spreading impact better to protect the screen and back panel.</li><li>A nice touch is the USB-C port on a separate daughterboard, making it simpler to replace.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent teardown of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> by iFixit shows Googleâs major upgrades in durability and repairability, showcasing a big leap in its smartphone design, though there are still a few areas that could use some fine-tuning.</p><p>One notable improvement is the dual-entry design, which lets you remove either the display for screen fixes or just the rear panel for battery replacements (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/27/pixel-9-pro-teardown/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>This design also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-durability-test-results">makes the phone tougher</a>, so it handles drops and bumps better by spreading out the impact away from the screen and back panel.</p><p>Even though itâs easy to start taking apart the Pixel 9 Pro XL from the front or rear, the display can get damaged during removal, with some delamination happening. The iFixit team had a tough time getting it off without hurting it. And while the top glass panel is a bit delicate, itâs not too hard to remove.</p><p>There are just a few stickers hiding some screws, but other than that, getting to the battery is pretty straightforward.</p><p>On the other hand, removing the battery from the Pixel 9 Pro XL turned out to be a real struggle. The iFixit team couldnât get the battery pull tab to work, so they had to forcefully pry it out. Itâs a tricky situation also seen with the Pixel 8 Pro.</p><p>On a brighter side, Google has moved the USB-C port to a separate daughterboard, making it easier to replace. This design change allows for smooth removal and replacement of the port, which is great considering how prone USB-C ports are to damage.</p><p>To sum it up, the Pixel 9 Pro XL brings some impressive design upgrades for better repairability and durability. However, there are a few hiccups, like the fragile display and tricky battery pull tab, where Google could have done better.</p>
