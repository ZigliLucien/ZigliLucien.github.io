<ul><li>Users will be able to access their camera's history from the web, which has been optimized for mouse and keyboard.</li><li>The ability to create custom clips and download them is now available.</li><li>Users can opt-in to Public Preview to test out new features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Home for Web just got a lot more comprehensive as part of a new update. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Google-Home-Access-camera-history-and-download-clips-from-the-Web-and-more/ba-p/605573">Announced by the tech giant on Wednesday</a>, many requested features are making their way to the web. In particular, users will be able to view full histories and create custom clips. </p><p>Per the company, over the next several days, home.google.com will now allow users to take advantage of having access to a larger screen. The newly updated experience, which has been optimized for use with a traditional mouse and keyboard, will allow users to access their entire camera history. From there, users can view specific events and timelines or search for specific dates and times to review. It’s important to note that a Nest Aware Plus subscription will be required for 24/7 playback on the web as it is required on the app. </p><p>Another noteworthy feature rolling out is the ability to create custom clips. Users will be able to designate the duration of the clip on the web by using the added clip editor. Additionally, previous events can be trimmed via the Home app. Nest Aware Plus subscribers can go a step further and export those clips as downloadable files to then be shared or saved. </p><p>The last – and potentially biggest – update is the ability for users to participate in a version of Public Preview for the web. This will allow users to sample features before they become widely available to the public. Interested users can opt in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12494697?hl=en#zippy=%2Chow-to-join-public-preview">here</a>, per the company. </p><p>Some unique features available in the preview include a script editor for home automation, garage door detection, and expanded first-generation camera support. In the first feature, users can see, create, delete, or deactivate scripted automation via home.google.com. </p><p>Garage door detection, available only to Nest Aware subscribers, will notify users if they happen to leave their garage door open. The feature uses “advanced AI-powered image detection and improved built-in on-device intelligence” to help users keep their homes secure. Finally, first-generation Nest Cam indoor or outdoor users can use a new camera history experience in the Google Home app as part of the public preview. </p><p>Overall, Google Home continues to demonstrate why it is a must-have for those who want to make their homes smart. </p>

<hr>
<p>A huge new UI upgrade is coming to the Meta Quest some time this year, and Meta CTO Andrew "Boz" Bosworth gave us the first details in his March AMA <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/boztank/">on Instagram</a>. The CTO said he didn&apos;t want to "give too much away" before the big reveal but talked about how the company was working to make the Quest UI feel more personalized than ever.</p><p>Bosworth said this new personalized UI would be designed to go wherever life takes you, including the ability to pin windows to you or your head. That would make it possible to walk around and have windows follow you while you do chores or walk around the house.</p><p>Bosworth also said the company is working on allowing users to anchor windows in real space, giving the headset similar abilities to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3">Apple Vision Pro</a> even though it&apos;s 1/7th the price. This means you could pin a display to your wall and make it look and feel more like a TV resting in actual space, among other examples. It would also enhance the headset&apos;s multitasking capabilities by running more windows in the same physical space.</p><p>While the current Meta Quest UI can replicate some of these things with its panel design, Bosworth says that "fluidity with how you interact with these two things is of tremendous opportunity to make things feel really comfortable and clear."</p><p>The new UI will also allow users to interact better with other nearby devices. Bosworth talked about how "casting and streaming present a lot of opportunity" for Meta. Still, we&apos;ve also seen use cases where users can interact with smart home appliances and lighting right in mixed reality. In other words, if Meta is working on integrating nearby device connectivity, we could very well be able to adjust lights and other smart home devices right from the headset.</p>

<p>The upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3 Lite</a> was rumored to drop the color pass through at one point, but Bosworth confirmed that "mixed reality...platform capabilities will be the same" for "several generations of headsets to come."</p><p>Bosworth also talked about user comfort including bringing back the ability to use the Meta Quest 3 while lying down. Currently, the Smart Guardian doesn&apos;t properly track furniture walls safely when users are lying down stationary, but the company says this oversight will be ironed out soon.</p><p>Lastly, the keyboard is getting some impressive improvements with multitouch capabilities. That means you could pin the virtual keyboard to a table and type with all your fingers at once, just as you would on a physical keyboard. That would go quite nicely with the upcoming Airplane mode, as it could mean the virtual keyboard would fit perfectly on that small airplane tray table on the seat.</p><p>There&apos;s no date for the upcoming UI refresh, but it&apos;s expected that Meta will debut the redesign sometime in 2024, potentially alongside a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2">Meta Quest Pro 2</a> announcement.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube is preparing to roll out a redesign for its TV app in the "next few weeks" that brings a "dual column" view.</li><li>Interacting with a video's title will shift your content to the left, creating space for its description box, comment section, and more on the right.</li><li>The redesign will arrive for YouTube TV subscribers, as well, as the users can check a game's key plays and stats without blocking what they're watching.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube attributes its upcoming TV redesign to user feedback highlighting the need for a "richer, distraction-free" video experience on the large screen.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/designing-a-richer-youtube-experience-for-your-tvs/">YouTube</a>, its TV redesign was crafted on the back of wanting to keep its video content "front and center" at all times. The primary change is that opening a video&apos;s comments, description, or live chat no longer blocks off the right side of what you&apos;re watching.</p><p>YouTube states users found that its previous approach obscured the video too much. So, clicking a video&apos;s title with your remote control will produce the new "dual column" redesign, shifting the video to the left. The right side will host the title, video statistics, description box, and comments section.</p><p>The video users are currently watching on TV will shrink slightly, considering it needs to make room for additional content. YouTube&apos;s addition should help enhance the experience when scrolling through a video&apos;s chapters, key plays, shopping moments, and keeping track of scores.</p><p>Additionally, watching a full-screen video will display the like, dislike, CC (closed captioning), and gear (settings) icons. Sliding back to the video while in this new dual-column view should let users return to full screen.</p>

<p>YouTube prototyped a few different redesign versions before settling on its "dual column" approach. One of its goals was to ensure it struck the right balance between what users want (their video) and YouTube&apos;s interactive controls. Using a remote control should continue to feel comfortable as the platform prioritizes "simplicity over the introduction of lightweight controls."</p><p>YouTube adds that a "one size fits all" approach will likely not work for <em>everything </em>it offers its viewers. An example would be the platform&apos;s live chat, as the post states that it would "benefit from different levels of immersion" moving forward.</p><p>This dual-column TV redesign is set to arrive in the "next few weeks" for the YouTube app. The platform is also preparing to bring this to YouTube TV subscribers so they can explore key plays or game stats without removing them from the action.</p><p>Back in February, YouTube TV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tv-8-million-subscribers-2024-outlook">celebrated its achievement</a> of 8 million subscribers. The company also made it clear that it wanted to place more focus on living room viewers as folks have tallied an average of 1 billion hours watched from a TV. Those watching YouTube on a TV are in line for reworks in 2024, and it looks like this is the start of those enhancements.</p>

<hr>
<p>Spotify is rolling out music videos for Premium users in beta today (Mar. 13), but they won&apos;t be available to everyone simultaneously.</p><p>As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-03-13/music-videos-rolling-out-in-beta-to-premium-spotify-users-across-select-markets/">Newsroom</a> post, Spotify is bringing music videos to its platform for users on Android, iOS, desktops, and TVs. Users should find a "Switch to video" toggle when listening to a song that supports the music video feature. Spotify explains that the video will play directly in the "Now Playing" view on your phone or other device.</p><p>There is a full-screen option; users can turn their phone sideways to view the music video alternately. Spotify&apos;s music videos cannot be played in the background, nor does it seem to have a pop-out option.</p><p>The music streaming service states users should switch back to audio if they&apos;re moving away from the app.</p><p>This beta for Spotify&apos;s music videos for support titles means the platform will look to "continue to innovate and iterate based on feedback from both users and artists." Music videos will be featured for select artists like Ed Sheeran, Doja Cat, Ice Spice, Aluna, and Asake. More titles will likely be available as part of Spotify&apos;s "limited catalog" starting out.</p><p>The feature will arrive in 11 regions: the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Brazil, Colombia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Kenya. The U.S. is notably out of the equation <em>for now</em>. Spotify states as its beta progresses and more work is done, it will look to expand music videos to more countries.</p>
<p>Spotify highlighted its interest in boosting user engagement within its platform and mentioned several features like Canvas and Clips. However, this new music video beta puts Spotify into more competition with YouTube Music. The latter already offers a way for Premium subscribers to quickly swap between <em>listening </em>to a song and watching its music video.</p><p>YouTube Music previously let free users in on its music videos for song titles, but that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music-free-tier-video-limitation">disappeared back in 2019</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Display analyst Ross Young spilled some beans about the display sizes of the upcoming Pixel Fold 2.</li><li>It will have a prominent 8.02-inch foldable screen and a 6.29-inch cover screen.</li><li>Young further shared that these displays will enter the production phase this April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Pixel Fold 2 is Google&apos;s highly anticipated foldable device, which will likely debut sometime during Google I/O later this year. Before the release, new information reveals the foldable&apos;s display sizes that are likely to feature.</p><p>According to the well-known display analyst Ross Young, the Pixel Fold 2 will likely feature a large 8.02-inch foldable display accompanied by a 6.29-inch cover screen. Young notes that display sizes circulating as Pixel Fold 2 aren&apos;t entirely accurate.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The leaks on the Pixel Fold 2 don't have the display sizes right. 8.02" for the foldable display and 6.29" for the cover display. Panel production starts in April! It is coming.<a href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1767687195090161769">March 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2-renders">first renders</a> of the Pixel Fold 2 surfaced last month, revealing the foldable&apos;s design and other details, including display sizes of 7.9 inches and 6.4 inches, respectively. However, these new screen sizes from Young reveal more prominent screens than the predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. The previous iteration had a 7.6-inch foldable screen and a 5.8-inch cover screen.</p><p>Young has further revealed that the panels above will be produced in April. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1767692161217388784">follow-up tweet</a>, Young also shared that the cover screen would be comprehensive, similar to or better than the original Pixel Fold.</p>

<p>According to the recent Pixel Fold 2 renders, however, when compared side by side with the Pixel Fold cover screen, the original appears wider than the alleged one. Since those are early renders, they might change with the phone&apos;s final release.</p><p>The same renders still revealed interesting details of the Pixel Fold 2, which is the new camera housing that has been completely revamped, from the signature bar design to a new rectangular housing. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> will likely carry at least three sensors accompanied by another unknown sensor. There is a selfie camera on the cover screen, and another hidden sensor is expected within the foldable screen, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 spec sheet leaves little to be desired, with the cutting-edge Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, 8GB of RAM, a microSD slot for expandable storage, and durable battery life. Since it&apos;s a Samsung product, you&apos;re getting a best-in-class display — coming in at 11 inches with an ultra-smooth 120Hz refresh rate — and a scratch-resistant aluminum build. You also get extras like excellent quad speakers, an in-display fingerprint sensor, and an S Pen stylus included in the box. Plus, you can attach a keyboard cover to get some work done and then jump into the DeX desktop-style interface for a more laptop-like experience.</p><p>Most importantly, Samsung’s One UI 5.1.1 software makes multitasking on the Tab S9 remarkably easy. You simply drag your favorite apps from the pinned taskbar onto the display, and the UI automatically splits them into resizable windows or squeezes them into compact pop-up windows. Still, with a starting price of around $799, the Tab S9 isn&apos;t exactly cheap, but it&apos;s considerably more affordable than the other tablets in the lineup, the S9 Plus and S9 Ultra. And like all of the best Samsung devices out there, the S9 will receive four years of major Android updates along with five years of security updates.</p>

<p>At 14.6 inches and 1.6 pounds, the Tab S9 Ultra belongs on your desk. Combined with the impressive 90% screen-to-body ratio, the display size makes it the champion for fitting multiple full-sized apps at once; and you can buy a backlit keyboard cover with a trackpad, converting it into a modular laptop.</p><p>The downside of its design is that the Tab S9 Ultra’s tiny bezels leave you no room to hold it without accidental touches, while also exposing a notch that you’ll have to learn to ignore. You essentially have to use it docked, and the official keyboard cover ships separately and costs a healthy amount. Combined with the RAM upgrade, a fully-specced and accessorized Ultra will cost you about the same as a premium laptop.</p><p>If that’s a problem, you could settle for the also-great Tab S9 (described above). But if you can afford it, or you simply want the most powerful Android tablet on the market regardless of price, you’re getting excellent performance and a massive slab for gaming, streaming, and working with the S9 Ultra. You merely have to accept that it’s not at all portable. As stated in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra review</a>, this is the ultimate tablet and laptop replacement, but its size might prevent it from becoming the ultimate couch companion.</p>

<p>To call the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> highly anticipated would be an understatement. We’d been waiting for Google to get back into the tablet game for years, and although it’s far from a dramatic return, the Pixel Tablet certainly doesn’t disappoint. It should basically be a perfect tablet for most people (unless you&apos;re a gamer), complete with a vibrant display, some excellent battery life, and all the Google software support you could ever ask for. It even comes with a Charging Speaker Dock, a useful little stand that converts your tablet into a smart display.</p><p>Now, there are a few quirks with the Pixel Tablet. The bezels, for one, are strangely large, and there’s no 3.5mm audio port to help make up for the weak speaker quality. All in all, though, we found the tablet to be sufficiently powerful for most tasks, and if you’re a Pixel fan, there’s really no reason to skip this device. Holding it in your hands almost feels like you’re using an oversized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a>, and that’s a good thing. </p>

<p>The best Android tablet for most people tends to come from Samsung or Amazon, but don&apos;t sleep on Lenovo, which makes a series of near-stock Android tablets for premium and budget shoppers. Coming in as a successor of sorts to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo-tab-p11-pro-gen-2-review">Lenovo Tab P11 Pro Gen 2</a>, the Tab P12 has a few tricks up its sleeve.</p><p>Notably, the Tab P12 sports a 12.7-inch 3K display, bringing a resolution of 2944 x 1870. The only potential downside here is that Lenovo is using an LCD panel as opposed to an OLED screen. But, if you suffer from issues surrounding PWM, then this is probably seen as a big benefit.</p><p>From a software perspective, Lenovo is implementing different ways to stand out from the pack. This is evidenced by the "Chromatic" and "Mono" modes that turn the Tab P12 into an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">e-reader</a>. Lenovo even includes background songs for you to listen to so you can immerse yourself in the world of whatever books you are reading.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking to buy a tablet for the first time and don&apos;t have any stringent needs, the Galaxy Tab A series is an excellent option for a fraction of the Tab S9&apos;s cost. While you won&apos;t be blown away by its specs or features, the Tab A still manages to offer a metal body. And unlike Amazon&apos;s Fire Tablets, it has a fully functional version of Android with Google services like the Play Store, so you can download any apps you want.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab A8 is a great option for those in the market looking for an entry-level tablet that offers a traditional Android experience. The smaller display and overall design make the Tab A8 extremely portable and comfortable to hold in one hand while still being large enough to consume media from streaming services like Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, and Disney+.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a good chance that when you think about Amazon tablets, you think about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-7-2022-review">Fire 7</a> which can be had for less than $50 on Black Friday. In 2023, Amazon proved that it&apos;s trying to offer more than just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">super-cheap tablets</a>, as evidenced by the Fire Max 11.</p><p>Ditching the build with chonky bezels, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Fire Max 11</a> is sleek and well-built, turning in plastic for aluminum. While the company hasn&apos;t made the jump to OLED panels just yet, this 11-inch IPS screen is quite impressive. Not to mention that it&apos;s great for movies, getting work done, or acting as a smart display.</p><p>Amazon also offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-accessories-for-amazon-fire-max-11">detachable keyboard</a> and USI pen for the Fire Max 11. These, paired with the 14 hours of battery life, ensure that you&apos;ll be able to take notes and finish assignments with ease. The Fire Max 11 Productivity Bundle even includes three months of Microsoft 365 if you need an easy way to share files or access Microsoft&apos;s suite of productivity apps.</p><p>The big caveat to keep in mind with an Amazon Fire Tablet is that you don&apos;t get the Google Play Store or Google&apos;s great apps and services. Instead, you&apos;ll rely on the Amazon App Store, which has a dramatically more limited app selection. But for this price, that&apos;s an OK trade-off for most people, especially for students on a budget.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3>
<p>There are a lot of factors that go into deciding whether the best Android tablet is right for you. Price is likely the most important factor, but that also ties into the value of a tablet. For example, just because the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra is the most expensive Android tablet doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that it&apos;s the absolute best. There are plenty of great tablets that will work for your needs but won&apos;t break the bank.</p><p>Size is another important factor, but this also depends on what it is that you&apos;re trying to accomplish by purchasing a new tablet. If you just want a lightweight media consumption device that&apos;s not your laptop, then devices larger than 10 inches might not be right for you. But if you are planning to get some work done away from your desk or the office, then a tablet with a larger screen will be the better fit.</p><p>With those two factors taken into consideration, you&apos;ll want to look at other features such as battery life, screen resolution, camera quality, and design. There&apos;s also the question of the "intangibles." Does the tablet include a stylus? Is there a detachable keyboard available? Is that included? What about cases? Are case options limited to first-party options, or are there a bunch of third-party solutions to pick from? These are all questions we consider when performing our reviews, along with determining which Android tablet is "the best."</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-we-test"><span>How we test</span></h3>
<p>Along with the questions and factors that we outlined above, when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-review-and-recommendation-process">reviewing and testing</a> these devices, we try to take into account every other possible detail. For example, we look at the build quality and durability of different tablets that come across our desks, short of doing actual bend tests.</p><p>Because we&apos;ll be looking at these screens for long periods of time, we want to know the same things as you, including if you can actually see the tablet under direct sunlight. How does the latest Netflix hit look, and what about HDR or Dolby Atmos compatibility? Speakers are another big thing with tablets since you shouldn&apos;t always have to reach for a pair of headphones if you&apos;re watching a movie.</p><p>And circling back, there are the aforementioned "intangibles" to consider, such as determining whether you can actually use a tablet as a laptop replacement of sorts, depending on the model. Plus, there&apos;s the whole question of battery life, as you don&apos;t want to end up with a tablet that can&apos;t even make it through the latest Marvel movie without needing some juice. All of these factors play an important role in making our final determination and providing a score for the review.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="which-of-the-best-android-tablets-should-you-buy-2">Which of the best Android tablets should you buy?</h2>
<p>Picking a quality Android tablet typically boils down to either Samsung or Amazon models. Samsung dominates the premium and mid-range tablet market while competing with Amazon via its cheaper, budget A-models. So when weighing the best Android tablet for you, specifically, start with Samsung unless you don&apos;t have much money to spend.</p><p>In terms of the “best” without regard to money, it’s a toss-up between the three Tab S9 models. The 11-inch Galaxy Tab S9 is the best mainstream pick, coming in lighter, brighter, and more affordable than its larger siblings while sporting the same flagship Snapdragon chip. It even has the longest battery life of the bunch at about 15 hours.</p><p>Then again, you might want to consider the Galaxy Tab S9+ instead. You’ll trade in the S8’s basic LCD panel for a 12.4-inch AMOLED, giving you richer colors, deeper blacks, and more screen space for fitting in multiple apps at once. It also has a shorter S Pen latency at just 2.8ms, so short that you’ll feel like you’re writing on actual paper. Though more expensive and less comfortable to hold, the Tab S9+ display justifies the upgrade.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra measures a massive 14.6 inches and 1.6 pounds with tiny bezels, making it wholly unsuitable for casual streaming in bed, but perfect as a laptop replacement using Samsung DeX mode. It’s the Android equivalent of the iPad Pro, with the price and power to match. If you want an Android tablet with more than 8GB of RAM, this is your best (and only) choice.</p><p>Dropping into the mid-range category, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9 FE</a> provides the same display size and battery as the S9+ for about half the price, if you can stomach some performance downgrades.</p><p>But for true affordability and value, you’ll want to look at Amazon’s catalog, starting with Amazon&apos;s Fire Max 11. The specs are nothing to write home about, but performance is surprisingly good, and you get a great media consumption device for a highly competitive price. The only catch? The Fire Max 11 runs Amazon&apos;s Fire OS rather than a more typical Android build, meaning you&apos;ll need to download apps from Amazon&apos;s app store rather than Google&apos;s.</p>
<h2 id="is-getting-a-tablet-worth-it-2">Is getting a tablet worth it?</h2>
<p>This is a question only <em>you</em> can really answer, but a better question might be "what do I want or need a tablet for?" If you&apos;re looking to replace an aging laptop with a tablet, there aren&apos;t as many options available, and instead, you might be better suited with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">great Chromebook</a>.</p><p>Determining what it is that you&apos;re planning on using the tablet for is the first step of the equation. Because if you don&apos;t have an actual use case for the device, then it&apos;ll likely end up just gathering dust.</p><p>But the great thing about tablets, regardless of the price, is that they can solve a lot of different problems and come in a bunch of different software flavors. If you&apos;re entrenched in the Amazon Alexa ecosystem, then a Fire tablet might be better suited for your needs. Then there&apos;s Google&apos;s Pixel tablet which arrived in 2023 offering users something different with the included dock. And if you&apos;re a fan of the "stock" Android experience, this might be the perfect tablet for you.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-cellular-and-wi-fi-tablets-2">What is the difference between Cellular and Wi-Fi tablets</h2>
<p>Most of the time, there are no major differences when purchasing a tablet with cellular service compared to a Wi-Fi version. In some instances, there might be a slight weight difference, along with the addition of a SIM card slot, but the overall design and functionality will remain the same.</p><p>Instead, the difference between these tablets comes down to whether you want to have an "always-connected" device, or if you&apos;re fine relying on Wi-Fi connections. The former allows you to have a constant internet connection but comes at the cost of an additional line of data (read: higher monthly bill). Cellular tablets also have a tendency to suffer a bit in the battery life department since they&apos;re always trying to find a suitable network connection.</p><p>As for Wi-Fi tablets, you might not think that there&apos;s much of a cost to consider, but something to keep in mind is when you want to use the tablet and aren&apos;t within range of a Wi-Fi network. In that case, you&apos;ll need to use your phone&apos;s built-in portable hotspot, but that&apos;s not a feature immediately available on every cell phone plan. Going this route will also result in your phone&apos;s battery draining much quicker than normal, along with potentially eating up your mobile data allotment.</p>

There are many more NES and SNES emulators available than for something like the PS1 or PS2. A lot of that has to do with the difference in graphics from what Sony was using back in the day, even compared to other graphics-intensive consoles like the Dreamcast or N64.</p><p>So when you&apos;re searching through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">best emulators for Android</a> looking for a great PS2 pick, there simply just aren&apos;t as many options. And this may come as a bit of a surprise considering just how popular the PS2 was and continues to be for many. Thankfully, if you&apos;re dead set on emulating some of your favorite PS2 games on your Android phone, you&apos;re not completely out of luck.</p>

<p>AetherSX2 swooped onto the scene in December 2021, and the development team has ceased work on the project since then and the project&apos;s since been removed from the Google Play Store after its creator stopped working on the project. Since its delisting, however, modders have revived the reliable emulator with NetherSX2. While it&apos;s also unavailable through the Google Play Store, there are other ways to find and install this reliable emulation tool.</p><p>You&apos;ll need a fairly high-end Android device to play it with the best performance possible since it recommends a Snapdragon 845 (or equivalent). Anything less will cause performance to suffer — though this will vary from title to title. Developer Tahlreth also recommends devices uses Adreno GPUs as opposed to those with Mali or PowerVR GPUs.</p><p>NetherSX2 features settings that can be adjusted on a per-game level, touchscreen and Bluetooth controller support, save states, widescreen patches and upscaling, and a lot more. What makes it even better is that it uses the same code as PCSX2, another well-known PS2 emulator built for PC, so it has a strong support foundation. Tahlreth received permission to use the code and it is licensed under the LGPL. As we&apos;ll go into later, the same can&apos;t be said for DamonPS2.</p><p>There&apos;s no official way to install Aether or Nether, but there are plenty of great guides online that will help you get your favorite PS2 games running on your Android device in no time. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZDbDcASu14">This guide from EZonTheEyes</a> helped me get NetherSX2 up and running Katamari Damacy in no time!</p>

<p>Unlike something like ePSXe for PS1 emulators, Play! doesn&apos;t go down the RetroArch path by being compatible with a bunch of different consoles. Instead, the developers are only focusing on being able to provide a solid emulation experience for those who want to play PS2 games on their Android phones. Playing into that goal, Play! doesn&apos;t require you to download and use a BIOS in order to work.</p><p>The developers do have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/jpd002/Play-Compatibility/issues">list of compatible</a> (and non-compatible) games on GitHub, so you can sift through to see what works and what doesn&apos;t. Best of all, Play! is completely free to download and use, and you won&apos;t have to worry about any in-app purchases.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-recommend-that-you-stay-away-from-damon-ps2-2">Why we recommend that you stay away from Damon PS2</h2>
<p>For years, DamonPS2 has been the default PS2 emulator on Android, as there really haven&apos;t been any other contenders. However, in the past few years, there have been some rather questionable discoveries made by users who have dug deep into the company behind DamonPS2 and the information that is collected on your device.</p><p>Thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/DamonPS2">EmuGen Wiki</a> and some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/he6r4m/delete_damon_ps2_inmediately/">Reddit investigating</a>, there are more than a few privacy concerns to be aware of. First of all, DamonPS2 is closed source, which isn&apos;t strange on its face since there are plenty of apps that go this route versus being open source. However, with the update to version 3.0, DamonPS2 started requiring a constant internet connection and access to users&apos; personal data, such as contacts and location data.</p><p>And if that wasn&apos;t enough, there&apos;s also the matter of whether the DamonPS2 team "stole" code from the developers of PCSX2. This is another PS2 emulator (and a quite popular one) for PC users who want to play their favorite PS2 games. In a blog post back in 2018, the developers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pcsx2.net/286-the-pcsx2-team-s-statement-regarding-the-damonps2-emulator.html">released a statement</a> in regards to the code that they claimed was stolen by the DamonPS2 developers. At the time, DamonPS2 was removed from the Play Store before the requested DMCA takedown was able to run its course, which would have left DamonPS2 banned from the Play Store.</p><p>Finally, there&apos;s the matter of performance. DamonPS2 is only recommended to be used with devices using at least the Snapdragon 835 chipset. This leaves plenty of potential users left with subpar performance, which is just not a great experience, especially if you were to spring for "DamonPS2 Pro."</p><p>The fact of the matter is that while Play! and NetherSX2 are still being actively developed, they&apos;re really the only PS2 emulators that we can recommend in good faith. There seems to be no "funny business" taking place, and since both are open source, this makes it easier for bugs to get squashed and the development process to continue to progress.</p>

<p>While you can easily play emulated PS2 games on Android without a controller since both Play! and NetherSX2 support touchscreen controls, these games were meant to be played with one. It'll take a little work to set up to work with your emulator of choice, but it'll be well worth the task. Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/gamesir-x3-review">Gamesir X3</a> is super easy to set up.</p></p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 is our favorite Android tablet out there, with the above sale price being specifically for the 128GB version. With a vibrant 120Hz AMOLED display, 8GB of RAM, and an especially long battery life, this tablet is a great pick—and at this price, it's an even better one. </p>
<p>You're getting a $100 discount straight out of the gate, plus Samsung is offering up to $650 of trade-in credit if you send in an old or broken device. If you need a case, simply add that to your purchase and get 50% off the Book Cover Slim Keyboard Case (usually $169.99).</p>
<p>Samsung is not only offering this deal with the entry-level Galaxy Tab S9. This bundle deal can also be used with the upgrade-tier Galaxy Tab S9 Plus or the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a> for a little more money. You can also get a bundle deal with the S9 and the comfortable <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a> if you'd prefer earbuds to a tablet case.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you&apos;re hoping to buy both a tablet and a keyboard case in one purchase; battery life is a priority for you; you want a tablet that comes with an S Pen stylus.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you aren&apos;t looking for much in the way of tablet performance and would prefer a cheaper, more entry-level option.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 is a powerful tablet, especially with the book cover keyboard. With the DeX interface option, you can access a laptop-like experience with the S9, and the whole lineup comes with five years of Android security updates. For the S9 basic, you can choose between 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, while the S9+ and S9 Ultra both include 12GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage.</p><p>The only bad thing about the S9 is its price, since the whole lineup is more expensive than most other tablets. Still, you&apos;ll get the performance you pay for out of these, so if one of them is within your budget, it may be worthwhile to take advantage of this keyboard bundle.</p>

<ul><li>Screenshot blocking for profile pictures on WhatsApp is being rolled out.</li><li>The feature hasn’t been officially confirmed by WhatsApp, but it appears on the stable version of the app for some users.</li><li>Users impacted by this update are receiving either a black screen or an error message instead of an image.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Back in February 2024, we reported on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-tests-new-feature-to-help-protect-your-profile-photos-more-effectively">WhatsApp testing a new privacy feature to help protect profile photos</a>. And it now appears that this feature is starting to roll out to users on the stable version of the popular messaging app. </p><p>As we previously wrote, the new feature prevents users from taking screenshots of profile pictures. This will provide users with greater security and more control over who can access their content. In the Beta test, attempts to capture a screenshot resulted in a black screen or the error message “can’t take a screenshot due to app restrictions.” Now, it appears that some users of the stable version of WhatsApp are receiving the same message.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/whatsapp-blocks-you-from-taking-screenshots-profile-pictures/">Android Police</a>, some users of the stable build are now being blocked from capturing profile picture screenshots. This has been corroborated by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-whatsapps-fix-for-profile-photo-problem-may-not-really-help/articleshow/108467197.cms#">The Times of India</a>, and we have found similar during our own tests. When attempting to capture a screenshot of a profile picture, we were presented with a black screen rather than the image we were trying to capture. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BLhSJY8xicUJ4rzryWxHwg" name="WhatsApp tests new feature to help protect your profile photos.jpg" alt="A black screen with an error message at the bottom" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BLhSJY8xicUJ4rzryWxHwg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, this does not appear to be the case for all users, with some still being able to capture screenshots. We also noted that while we couldn’t take screenshots of individual profile pictures, we were still able to capture profile pictures in group chats.</p><p>While this feature is rolling out, there currently appears to be no way to disable it should someone want to allow others to screenshot their profile image. It’s unclear whether it will eventually become an optional feature.</p><p>This is by no means the first feature to help <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-stay-safe-and-secure-whatsapp-android#section-how-to-change-your-profile-photo-privacy-settings-in-whatsapp-for-android">protect your privacy on WhatsApp</a>, with options such as changing your profile photo privacy settings, view-once media, and status privacy settings. It is, though, another step forward in helping to provide users with a more secure messaging app, and the likelihood is that more and more users will start to notice this feature on their devices in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>On Wednesday (Mar.13), the U.S. Congress passed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text?s=1&r=1&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Protecting+Americans+from+Foreign+Adversary+Controlled+Applications+Act%22%7D">bill</a> that would have major implications for TikTok, an app used by at least 170 million Americans.</p><p>The U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. Although the bill mentions TikTok, it is applicable to any app controlled by foreign advisories in the U.S.</p><p>TikTok has been given 180 days to ensure that its China-based parent company ByteDance will have to sell TikTok within the U.S., or it will be banned in the country. This means it will become illegal for any app stores or web servers that host TikTok. </p><p>"We have given TikTok a clear choice," said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash. </p><p>"Separate from your parent company ByteDance, which is beholden to the CCP (the Chinese Communist Party), and remain operational in the United States, or side with the CCP and face the consequences. The choice is TikTok&apos;s."</p><p>Congress alleged that TikTok is being controlled by a company in China, despite several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/delivering-on-our-us-data-governance">reassurances</a> from the social media app that it is privately owned. This week, TikTok sent an in-app alert to U.S. users urging them to call their local representatives to oppose the bill. </p><p>"Your voice can help the TikTok communities you love," the message said.</p><p>This move was taken after the U.S. government raised concerns about risks to national security and the data of users on the platform.</p><p>According to a recent tweet, a spokesperson from TikTok is calling this bill a "ban" and hopes that the Senate will consider facts before taking any action.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">❖ TIKTOK CALLS U.S. HOUSE BILL A "BAN" AND HOPES "SENATE WILL CONSIDER THE FACTS, LISTEN TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS" BEFORE TAKING ANY ACTION - SPOKESPERSON<a href="https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1767929193726169150">March 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>"This bill is an outright ban of TikTok, no matter how much the authors try to disguise it," TikTok spokesperson Alex Haurek said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-house-vote-china-national-security-8fa7258fae1a4902d344c9d978d58a37">in a statement</a>. "This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs."</p><p>The bill is currently being considered by the Senate, and its fate remains uncertain until then. President Biden has indicated that if the ownership issue isn&apos;t resolved, he <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-tiktok-ban-house-china-aaa884d8c974f0a35856af5ee6aa4e99">will sign</a> the bill if it comes to his desk.</p><p>However, TikTok might not disappear from people&apos;s devices anytime soon. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/tiktok-ban-bill-house-vote-03-13-24/index.html">CNN</a>, the bill will face challenges and legal implications if it is signed into law.</p>
