It&apos;s not really surprising because Google was one of the original pioneers of consumer tech AI and it has been hiding it in plain sight for years. Now, because AI is the new hot buzzword, all bets are off.</p>

<p>Much of what Google showed us will be coming soon or is already here. Other things are pie-in-the-sky projects that may never see the light of day. Remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-parent-alphabet-pulls-plug-its-ambitious-loon-internet-balloon-project">Project Loon</a>? Both real products and ones that will never come to market have one thing in common: they are potential privacy nightmares.</p><p>This, too, is nothing new to Google. Because of how the company operates, it <em>has</em> to be a bit on the invasive side. When our data is the force that drives revenue our data is going to be collected and analyzed. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-anything-really-free">Nothing in life is free</a>, even Gmail.</p>
<p>Much of what&apos;s coming will be managed locally thanks to some flavor of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">Gemini Nano</a>. I don&apos;t want Google listening to my phone calls, but as long as it&apos;s done <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">on my phone</a> and not in a cloud server room somewhere, I&apos;m not going to freak out about it. Similarly, the "new" Gmail will use AI to help manage my inbox. That data is already in Google&apos;s cloud, so I don&apos;t care. I might even turn it on.</p><p>Some other examples were a bit more worrying.</p>
<h2 id="google-sees-all-your-stuff-and-google-never-forgets-2">Google sees all your stuff and Google never forgets</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PcHydwgxU4C6AoMQJFsrqg" name="google-io-2024-project-astra-schrodingers-cat.jpg" alt="Google Gemini's Project Astra says "Schrodinger's Cat" while looking at two drawn cats and a box with a question mark on it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PcHydwgxU4C6AoMQJFsrqg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google also showed off a couple of ideas that are privacy nightmares in the making. Soon, we may have to worry about Google&apos;s object recognition just like we (should) worry about Google&apos;s facial recognition.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">Project Astra</a> was possibly Google&apos;s coolest announcement in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-keynote-made-cool-ai-features-look-boring">terrible I/O Keynote presentation</a>. We saw an interactive assistant who could see and hear everything we could and then act on the information it was gathering. </p>
<p>A lot of people got laser-focused on a potential next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-glass-enterprise-edition-2-now-much-easier-buy">Google Glass</a> that was shown in the demo, but I sprung to attention when Astra said, "Your glasses are on the table next to the red apple." 🚨🚨</p><p>I&apos;m not going to lie; this could be a helpful tool in a lot of ways for a lot of people. I jokingly remarked that we&apos;ll never again lose the remote control, but there are real practical uses. Like, where is my EpiPen or emergency inhaler? Finding either of those is a bit more important than finding your keys in most situations.</p>
<p>But — and there is always a but — some serious issues could arise from this. Imagine a subpoena for Google user data asking if Astra ever saw any sort of contraband in your home. Anything from marijuana to ammunition to birth control could be incriminating, and if Google has access to this data, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms/information-requests?hl=en-US">will comply with a lawful subpoena</a>. It has to. </p><p>I&apos;m not condoning anything illegal because it&apos;s just none of my damn business what you do inside your home. I&apos;m also not saying a tool used in this way is always going to be bad — sometimes cops need all the help they can get. I&apos;m just saying that it could happen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VtE2oxfCfwna2R5Ln9hjWJ" name="google-project-astra-pictionary.jpg" alt="Playing Pictionary with Google Project Astra at Google I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VtE2oxfCfwna2R5Ln9hjWJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seemingly more innocent, but potentially far more dangerous, was Google knowing your car&apos;s license plate number. My God, there are a bunch of ways this could be handy and helpful, but of course, it&apos;s also problematic.</p><p>Google can scan all of your photos and see which ones are of cars. It can use location data to see which photos were taken as well as the number of times a specific car appears to determine which car is yours. Then it reads the license plate number and keeps track of it.</p>
<p>That sounds innocent until you think about how this data could be cross-referenced. A judge may <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/law-enforcement-using-google-maps-timeline-feature-cast-wide-net">sign a subpoena</a> for photos or data about any cars in the location of a crime when the crime was being committed. </p><p>That might help catch a criminal, but it&apos;s just as likely to get someone hauled into the police station to answer questions because they popped into Circle K for a snack or a drink right before someone robbed the place.</p><p>This type of object recognition, trained through your photos, isn&apos;t going to stop at car license plates.</p>
<p>Tools like these are powerful, and that means they can be dangerous. Google is really good at developing these sorts of things, and I&apos;m not going to think about how this tech could be used for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lays-off-more-employees-fires-protestors">military or law enforcement</a>, but it would be in high demand.</p><p>That means Google has to do it right. And it can. Exactly what this tech is doing, an overview of how it does it, and clear and concise information about what data is retained and its encryption status is a must. If Google doesn&apos;t start there, nothing else matters. Most of us probably won&apos;t read any of it before we tap the OK button, but it has to be there in plain language.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:969px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8NbA4zL4PXEkD9L6BS7BaM" name="sidewalk-opt-in.jpg" alt="Amazon Sidewalk opt-in screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8NbA4zL4PXEkD9L6BS7BaM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="969" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The next step is making all of this opt-in. Unless you say, "I want it!" you&apos;re not getting it. Google is <em>usually</em> pretty good about this, but there have been "mistakes" where it just dumps new and invasive things onto you.</p><p>Finally, it has to decouple these features from everything else. If <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-ai-image-generation-disabled">there&apos;s a problem</a>, shut it down, fix it, then push the fix to everyone before turning it back on. We can&apos;t afford to wait for Motorola to decide to update our phone to fix something this important.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&apos;m cautiously optimistic. I have no doubt that Google can pull off the cool new tricks it has shown us because it already does things just as intricately and amazingly. I&apos;m also certain that tools like Astra can be useful in many situations, and I&apos;ll probably use them, providing the terms feel good to me.</p><p>Unfortunately, I&apos;m worried that Google will have privacy blunders along the way. It wouldn&apos;t be a Google product without them.</p>

For the calendar year 2023, tablet shipments totaled 128.5 million units worldwide, a decline of 20.5% compared to 2022 and the lowest annual volume since 2011.</p><p>"With no significant improvements to the economy and consumers allocating their money to things beyond consumer electronics, tablets may not be very high on the priority list," said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=PRF004786">Anuroopa Nataraj</a>, senior research analyst with IDC&apos;s Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52105224">Recent numbers</a> suggest that after over two years of decline, worldwide tablet shipments posted a year-over-year growth of 0.5% in the first quarter of 2024; even though this may seem small, the sales were about 30.8 million units, but it doesn&apos;t look good for Samsung and Apple.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-vs-apple-vs-the-world-2">Samsung vs. Apple vs. the world</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tdLsf8yh2ivHqMx4fnp82n" name="apple-stage-manager-ipad-pro-vs-samsung-dex-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra.jpg" alt="Stage Manager vs Samsung DeX - Apple iPad Pro vs Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tdLsf8yh2ivHqMx4fnp82n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung saw a decline in tablet shipments this quarter, with around 6.7 million units sold—a decrease from the 7.1 million units sold in the same quarter of 2023. Research manager Jitesh Ubrani at IDC points out this could be due to the slower economy. "It&apos;s essentially due to a slowdown in consumer demand in the U.S. for tablets, especially the premium tier," Ubrani told me over email. "Beyond that, there&apos;s also been an uplift in PCs, which steals a share of wallet."</p><p>It&apos;s not for a lack of trying on Samsung&apos;s part. Last year, Samsung launched the Galaxy Tab A9, Galaxy Tab A9 Plus, Galaxy Tab S9 FE, and Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus in the last quarter of 2023, later introducing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-announced">Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024)</a> in the first quarter of 2024. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-first-quarter-2024-results">Samsung&apos;s Q4 earnings report</a>, the company seeks to maintain sales momentum by expanding Galaxy AI to existing and new flagship products across foldable devices and tablets.</p><p>However, Samsung might face challenges keeping up with the premium range and the features that users may find appealing on iPads. Additionally, Ubrani says that even in the mid-lower tiers, Samsung faces competition from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-hd-10-2021-review">Amazon</a> and TCL in the U.S.</p><p>"To turn things around, Samsung can resort to bundling, which they have done and continue to do with wearables today. Beyond that, enabling new use cases—which is one of the toughest things to do for tablets—or servicing niche audiences (e.g., What iPad Pro is doing) is likely the only other way out."</p><p>On the other hand, Apple has also seen a similar decline in iPad sales this quarter. Even though it&apos;s at the top of the list, Apple faced a bit of a lull last year as sales declined 8.5% year over year. Per IDC&apos;s report, Apple focused on clearing out inventory of older models before the expected launch of new models. However, it could still ship out 9.9 million units this quarter. Ubrani feels that Apple&apos;s recent refresh of the iPad Air and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-oled-m4-2024">iPad Pro</a> will go a long way and turn things around for the tablet business.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1360px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.12%;"><img id="vxuzHTNv2BymyzfKjPRa9H" name="Xiaomi-Pad-6-02.jpg" alt="Xiaomi Pad 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vxuzHTNv2BymyzfKjPRa9H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1360" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Samsung and Apple may be at the top of the charts, Huawei held third place this quarter with impressive year-over-year growth of 43.6% and shipments of 2.9 million units. IDC interprets that the Chinese tech giant likely benefitted from the resurgence of its smartphone business and grew its market share by 2.8 basis points compared to last year.</p><p>Xiaomi also retained its spot in the top five, with a remarkable yearly growth of 92.6% and 1.8 million units in shipment. According to Ubrani, a few factors have helped the company boost tablet shipments.</p><p>"Xiaomi has been focusing on promotions, and most importantly, demand in Asia is recovering quicker than in the US. Asia also has lower penetration rates, so an uptick in demand is expected." The report stated that even outside China, its largest market, Xiaomi grew by triple digits across almost all regions where it ships.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="J4aMNdT4QDbtbBzVGEPDXf" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-close.jpg" alt="Tab S8 Ultra on desk close" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J4aMNdT4QDbtbBzVGEPDXf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Samsung and Apple continue to dominate the smartphone market, analysts suggest they have to start focusing on consumer spending habits and trends as they seem to be shifting.</p><p>One crucial area of improvement could be innovation, as year-on-year tablet upgrades mainly focus on hardware changes like faster processors, better screens (iPad Pro&apos;s OLED upgrade), or sleeker designs—but these may not be enough for customers to spend the extra money on tablets. </p><p>These tech giants could explore software upgrades like implementing AI features that will address why tablets are bought in the first place—accessibility and ease of multitasking on the go. Integrating features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> into tablets could help benefit students, a demographic that could benefit from more accessible tablet options. This would provide a portable computing option with a smart assistant that summarizes lectures or helps them organize their day.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that this demographic focuses on value. With the surging prices of smartphones, consumers are likely more interested in spending less on a tablet or not buying one at all. This is where bundling and promotions come into play, as Ubrani pointed out, especially for families looking for cost-effective options for kids and teens.</p><p>Finally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ca/tablets/?product1=sm-x910nzaexac&product2=sm-x810nzaexac&product3=sm-x710nzeexac">sheer number of tablet</a> options available could lead to "decision paralysis." By considering users&apos; needs and budgets, Samsung could benefit from simplifying its lineup while ensuring it continues to introduce unique features that make the choice less stressful. Nevertheless, it&apos;s clear that the current strategy isn&apos;t panning out, and Samsung may need to rethink its tablet strategy going forward if it wants to better compete with smaller brands.</p>

<hr>
<p>There have been a few leaks of Motorola&apos;s upcoming Razr flagship, but the latest gives us a possible glimpse at what it might look like alongside information about the successor of the cheaper Razr model.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/motorola-razr-50-ultra-design-specifications-leak-exclusive/">91Mobiles</a>, who received specifications and renders of both models, the flagship Razr 50 Ultra (likely marketed as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> in the United States) will sport a larger 4-inch cover screen with a 165Hz refresh rate. This is quite a bump from the current model, which has a 3.6-inch cover screen and a 144Hz refresh rate.</p><p>As for the design, renders provided to the publication by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Sudhanshu1414/status/1791479694325637586">Sudhanshu Ambhore</a> show a mostly identical design to the Razr 40 Ultra/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus</a>, but the display is noticeably larger, extending to cover nearly the entire front panel with a much smaller bezel. The dual cameras and flash unit appear mostly unchanged, although the sensors seem to protrude a bit more. The hinge also looks smaller, but it&apos;s unclear if these details are just a product of the renders.</p>

<p>From the renders, we can see all the rumored colors for the Razr 50 Ultra/Razr Plus 2024, including green, blue, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-special-edition-peach-fuzz-color">Peach Fuzz</a>, with what appears to be a vegan leather finish on at least one of them. One image also shows a 45W charging adapter, as Motorola will reportedly increase the charging speed to more quickly top up the 4,000mAh battery.</p><p>Other Razr 50 Ultra specs may include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, a 6.9-inch OLED with a 165Hz refresh rate, dual 50MP cameras, and 12GB of RAM. The publication points to 512GB of storage, although other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-motorola-razr-plus-2024-specs-leak">reports</a> seem conflicted on this amount, which has also been listed at 256GB.</p><p>Additionally, 91Mobiles also got their hands on specs and renders of the cheaper Motorola Razr 50/Razr 2024, which will likely be the direct successor to the Razr 40/Razr 2023. From the images, the biggest change will be the cover screen, which will reportedly match the 3.6-inch size of the current Razr Plus. It also looks like it will combine design cues from both the current models, with a vegan leather finish on the back and covering the top section above the cover screen.</p><p>For reference, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Motorola Razr 2023</a> features an all-vegan leather design, but the Razr Plus only features the finish on the back, while the aluminum frame extends above the cover screen.</p>

<p>As for specs, it looks like the Razr 50/Razr 2024 will be a paired-down version of the Razr 40 Ultra/Razr Plus. The leak points to a MediaTek Dimensity 7300x chipset, 120Hz OLED panels on the front and back, a 50MP primary camera with a 13MP secondary sensor, and an 8+256GB configuration. The battery will be unchanged at 4,200mAh, but there&apos;s no word on charging speed, nor does the publication mention wireless charging on either model.</p>

<p>What&apos;s more, the renders were corroborated by known leaker Evan Blass, who posted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1791515612243439873">official-looking images</a> of both Razr phones, showing off their designs and colors.

The Razr 50 Ultra/Razr Plus 2024 appears to have different textures on the green and blue color options.</p>

<p>If these leaks and renders are to be believed, it looks like Motorola is doubling down on the cover screen experience, which is my favorite thing about the Razr Plus and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/choosing-between-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-motorola-razr-plus">why I prefer it to Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. The Razr 2023 had a much smaller external display, which is only good for viewing notifications and a few other functions like selfies and voice recording. Reusing the Razr 40 Ultra/Razr Plus design and screen size would make it a much more attractive phone and give more people a reason to pick one of Motorola&apos;s phones over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5">Galaxy Z Flip</a>.</p><p>Other leaked specs point to IPX8 water resistance, which will also help Motorola compete with Samsung and other popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> on the market.</p><p>That said, the big thing we don&apos;t have much clarity on is the price, which will be a crucial element when the phones are launched, especially the more affordable model. The current Razr 40/Razr 2023 already undercut most other flip phones, and even with the launch of the extremely affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia Flip 5G</a>, the price cuts on the Razr make it a much more attractive pick for just $499. Hopefully, Motorola can retain last year&apos;s pricing for its foldables to help drive sales.</p><p>For now, we just have to take everything with a grain of salt until Motorola officially launches the phones, which we expect could be very soon.</p>

<ul><li>A report alleged that Samsung is interested in increasing the thickness of the Flip 6's UTG (ultra-thin glass) to help reduce the appearance of its screen crease.</li><li>In doing so, rumors suggest this would aid in the device's display durability.</li><li>The report adds that Samsung could continue this trend for the Flip 7, by increasing its UTG thickness even more and developing a new hinge to support it.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A rumor is floating around Samsung&apos;s upcoming clamshell foldable, which could solve the annoying side of these unique devices.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=27911">TheElec</a> (Korean), Samsung is allegedly planning to increase the thickness of the UTG (Ultra Thin Glass) on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-6-screen-crease-reduction-leak/">SamMobile</a>). Reportedly, the thickness will increase to about 50 micro centimeters, up from 30 on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>. It&apos;s suggested that this could reduce how defined the device&apos;s screen crease will appear.</p><p>Additionally, increasing the thickness of the Flip 6&apos;s UTG could also aid in the display&apos;s durability.</p><p>The report adds that Samsung may stick with the same waterdrop-style hinge that it used on the Flip 5 for the Flip 6. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-5-display-durability-testing">previously tested</a> the hinge to withstand almost 200,000 folds, and the hardware was designed to help cut back on the dreaded screen crease.</p><p>However, the Korean publication states a redesigned hinge and UTG could arrive for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 in 2025.</p><p>It&apos;s said that the new UTG for the Flip 7 could become "even thicker" to reduce the appearance of the screen crease even further. To do this, Samsung will supposedly need to revamp the clamshell&apos;s hinge structure to support how thick the UTG will become. Samsung will likely upgrade its waterdrop-style hinge, but we&apos;ll have to wait and see to know for certain.</p>

<p>With improvements rumored for the internal display, previous rumors suggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-display-memory-rumors">its cover display</a> could get some, too. In March, there was speculation that Samsung could boost the Flip 6&apos;s cover display refresh rate to 120Hz. A little more memory could arrive, with rumors suggesting 12GB of RAM.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Flip 6 was rumored to feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-charging-speed-rumor">a larger battery array</a>, which could total 4,00mAh.The following theories don&apos;t excite us, as the device could still sport the same boring 25W charging speeds as its 2023 predecessor.</p><p>Samsung is expected to drop its next wave of foldables and other devices later this year. It&apos;s currently suspected that the company could do so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">even earlier this year</a> on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

<hr>
<p>Another update in the spirit of simplicity is rolling out for Google Maps, which will change the bottom UI nav bar.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/17/new-google-maps-bottom-bar-rolling-out/">9to5Google</a>, the bottom bar of the Maps app is picking up a change that reduces the available options to Explore, You, and Contribute. The "You" tab contains most of the changes whereas the other two remain the same. The new tab features options like Go (Saved Trips), Saved, and Updates.</p><p>The update also seems to feature some other UI changes, as version 11.127.x of Maps removes the search bar from the new You tab. Additionally, there are two new icons: a bell and chat bubbles. The former will house all of a user&apos;s Maps notifications while the latter is for business messages.</p>

<p>Android users are beginning to receive these Maps changes, however, it&apos;s quite slow. The publication highlighted a user reporting the update on their device, which means Google is still pushing it to more devices.</p><p>We might not see it today (May 17), so keep an eye on it next week and beyond.</p><p>Google held its main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">I/O 2024</a> keynote a few days ago, and the discussions were high on AI. Among the talks were details about what&apos;s to come for Maps, which involves <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-geospatial-ar-experiences-android">geospatial AR</a> advancements for the app on Android. The app is preparing to pick up an "AR experiences" button in Maps for supported cities. Interacting with it will allow users to "simulate" their presence in another city. The functionality was said to extend to Street View in Maps, as well.</p><p>Shortly before I/O, Maps started rolling out a polished experience <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-ev-filter-ui-update">for EV drivers</a>. The app debuted a "charging station" filter after a user selects their vehicle type in settings. Doing so will produce an array of available stations in your area, alongside details like charging speed and location.</p>

<p>As the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-us-lawkmakers-want-tiktok-banned">U.S. pushes for TikTok</a> to either sell or face a ban, Canada&apos;s intelligence agency sends a stern warning to all users.</p><p>According to an interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csis-tikok-vigneault-1.7206000">CBC</a>, CSIS director David Vigneault stated, "as an individual, I would say that I would absolutely not recommend someone have TikTok." Vigneault added that China has "a very clear" strategy to use TikTok to obtain data "from anyone around the world."</p><p>During Vigneault&apos;s appearance on the CBC&apos;s show, The House, he stated that TikTok is "risky" for adults and teenagers in Canada. The reason is reportedly China&apos;s usage of "big data analytics" and computer farms for the processing and crunching of data. This could be continuously held as teens become young adults and become involved in other things.</p><p>He adds that China could be using user data captured in Canada and other places worldwide to create artificial intelligence.</p><p>The CSIS director isn&apos;t the only one to have made comments about TikTok as CBC highlights Sami Khoury&apos;s interview last year. Khoury, head of the Communications Security Establishment&apos;s Canadian Centre for Cyber Security questioned "why does an application need to access all of my contact list? Why does it need to access my calendar, my email, my phone records?"</p><p>The issue was aggregation, as there were concerns over China&apos;s ability to compare two users&apos; contact lists and see where the lines overlap.&apos;</p><p>In 2023, the Canadian government <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/government-tiktok-phones-ban-1.6761737">banned TikTok</a> from all federal government devices, citing security reasons. The decision was backed by a review conducted by the Chief Information Officer, which found that TikTok&apos;s data collection methods could lead to cyber-attacks.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear which way Canada will lean regarding TikTok, though concerns continue to mount.</p>

<p>In the U.S., a bill <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-bill-to-ban-tiktok-signed-into-law">swiftly passed through</a> the House and the Senate to President Joe Biden about a potential TikTok ban in the country. The U.S. government is giving its parent company ByteDance a choice: divest the app or app stores nationwide will remove TikTok.</p><p>The platform&apos;s CEO Shou Chew took to TikTok to state "we aren&apos;t going anywhere."</p><p>While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-us-lawkmakers-want-tiktok-banned">security is the headliner</a>, Chew stood firm in saying that TikTok has "built safeguards that no other peer company has made." TikTok&apos;s CEO added that the app has reached over 170 million users nationwide, and 7 million business owners rely on the service for their livelihood.</p><p>Earlier in May, TikTok went on the offensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-is-suing-the-us-government-to-stop-a-law-that-bans-the-app">with a lawsuit</a> against the United States government, stating the recently proposed ban is "unconstitutional." Through its petition, TikTok claimed the government unfairly targeted it through the bill. Moreover, the company claims there is no proof that the Chinese government has misused TikTok to gather user data and over national security-related risks.</p><p>TikTok has less than a year to sell or face a ban in the U.S. Its future is uncertain at the moment as ByteDance <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">would rather ditch the U.S.</a> altogether instead of selling. The company attempted to do so during the Trump Administration, but talks fell through with various companies like Walmart, Microsoft, and Oracle.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>While we anticipated the launch of at least three new Galaxy foldables this year, a new report hints otherwise.</li><li>Samsung might not be bringing the cheaper Galaxy Z Fold 6 model this year; instead, it will stick to the regular Z Fold and Z Flip 6 models.</li><li>The South Korean report states that the lack of differentiation factors and industry uncertainty are likely the possible reasons.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As we approach the second half of 2024, the launch of the next Galaxy foldables is inevitable. It is the event where we expect to see Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6. However, previous rumors have indicated that another variant of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 would likely be a cheaper alternative.</p><p>On the contrary, a new report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=27819">The Elec</a> indicates Samsung is considering ditching its plans to bring a cheaper Galaxy Z Fold 6 for at least this year. Instead, we will see only the highly anticipated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Z Flip 6</a>. The report further indicates that Samsung is starting to assemble the components required to build these foldables beginning this month.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="b2VeDmDE249GGAgQGoEGvY" name="Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-render.jpeg" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b2VeDmDE249GGAgQGoEGvY.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SmartPrix/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It is believed that multiple factors made Samsung reconsider its decision to bring the cheaper Galaxy Z Fold 6. Per the report, one amongst them is the lack of product differentiation factors next to industry uncertainty. Instead of tackling those factors, Samsung will likely invest time and energy in improving the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 instead of tackling those factors.</p><p>Meanwhile, several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-could-make-a-cheaper-galaxy-z-fold-to-bring-foldables-mainstream-finally">previous reports</a> have indicated that we should likely see the cheaper Galaxy Z Fold 6 that would bring Samsung&apos;s foldable technology prowess to the masses. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cheaper-galaxy-z-fold-6-codename-potentially-discovered">indications</a> were spot-on, as it was codenamed "Q6A" right next to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 codename "Q6" while the Galaxy Z Flip 6 codenamed "B6."  The approach appeared similar to what Samsung does with its Galaxy A series phones — bringing more value to the handset at a more affordable price.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-ultra-second-model-rumor">reports</a> of an Ultra version of the Galaxy Z Fold 6, not the cheaper book-style <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>. It was rumored to be more pricey than the current model that retails at $1799. </p><p>On the other hand, Elec indicated that Samsung had plans to launch a cheaper Galaxy Z Fold 6 this year, followed by a Galaxy Z Flip 7 in 2025. These reports hint that this is not a possibility, so they should be considered cautiously. Meanwhile, we still hope to see an affordable Galaxy Z Fold phone soon.</p>

<ul><li>Certain smart TVs, including the Chromecast with Google TV and TVs running Android 14 or higher, will soon function as Google Home hubs.</li><li>Google is launching new Home APIs, allowing apps and services to integrate with your smart home more seamlessly.</li><li>The APIs will connect with over 600 million devices, including any that are Matter-compliant or compatible with Works with Google Home.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>At Google I/O 2024, the search giant announced major updates for smart home and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> users, including turning select smart TVs into Google Home hubs.</p><p>In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/home-apis-enabling-all-developers-to-build-for-the-home/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Google revealed plans to allow devices like Google TV devices and some LG TVs to act as smart home hubs for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> later this year. This will include devices like the Chromecast with Google TV and certain TVs running Android 14 or higher.</p>

<p>Thanks to the new Home APIs Google is rolling out, apps and various services can now interact with your smart home. This means any app, whether it&apos;s specifically designed for smart homes or not, can tap into Google Home’s automation capabilities.</p><p>These APIs offer access to the 600 million devices supported by the platform, including any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> device or <em>Works with Google Home</em> device. Developers can also integrate Google Home devices and automations into their apps on both iOS and Android to create custom experiences.</p><p>Google has disclosed that initial adopters of its Home APIs include companies like ADT and Eve. ADT is rolling out a <em>Trusted Neighbor</em> feature that uses Google smart home products to give neighbors, friends, or helpers secure, temporary access to homes.</p><p>Meanwhile, Eve is tapping into the Home APIs to launch its app on Android, enabling automations such as lowering blinds automatically when it cools down at night. Furthermore, Google Pixel devices are using these APIs to blend digital and physical experiences, so activating bedtime mode can dim your phone&apos;s screen along with dimming your bedroom lights, lowering the shades, and locking the front door.</p><p>The goal is to help developers craft smooth interactions between their apps and users&apos; smart home setups. The cool part is that this isn&apos;t just for smart home app developers. Google mentioned that the Home APIs could link <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">smart home devices</a> with apps related to fitness or delivery, too.</p><p>While you can already set up these kinds of automations in the Google Home app, extending them to other apps could significantly expand the accessibility of smart home features.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>phones with a long-term update guarantee are preferable to you; you&apos;ve enjoyed past Galaxy devices you&apos;ve owned; you want a phone that has some of Samsung&apos;s latest AI features.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a phone with industry-leading charging speeds; you&apos;re looking for a more affordable Galaxy phone model.</p><p>While the S24 Plus isn&apos;t listed on our index of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones#section-best-for-parents">best Android phones</a>, both of its siblings are, and this phone really isn&apos;t all that far off from either of those Galaxy phones. In any case, the S24 Plus offers a great upgrade-level phone experience, even for high-level performance needs like gaming. The basic S24 Plus already includes 12GB of RAM, as upgraded from the phone&apos;s last generation, as well as a super efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor. It also comes with a long battery life, a great suite of cameras, and IP68 dust and water resistance, among other features.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that the S24 Plus leaves a little something to be desired when it comes to charging speeds, though it generally charges fast enough for the average user. Additionally, If a low price is more of a priority for you, you might want to consider Samsung&apos;s entry-level Galaxy A series—though this is a great price for this premium-level phone.</p>
