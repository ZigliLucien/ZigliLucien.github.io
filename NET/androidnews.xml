In a lot of ways, it&apos;s another average mid-range phone but there are some great standout features. I was excited to see them all, but what <em>really</em> caught my eye is what HMD calls "HMD Gen 2 repairability."</p><p>This weekly column is where my bosses kind of let me be me, and you usually won&apos;t see me talk about a phone or give my own type of review here. This week is going to be different because this phone is worth talking about.</p>

<p>The Skyline seems like an average budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">Android phone under $400</a> with some standout features in the camera department. It is, and that&apos;s what a lot of people will think about it.</p><p>It does have one other feature that you won&apos;t find in any other phones: "HMD Gen 2 repairability." I&apos;ll talk a bit more about what that means later down the page, but I&apos;ll give you a teaser: I love it. It&apos;s a standout feature that belongs on every phone we buy, regardless of price.</p>
<h2 id="design-and-specs-2">Design and specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Gi2Fk6VXsqzEAL7T3FY5pY" name="HMD-Skyline-2.jpg" alt="HMD Skyline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gi2Fk6VXsqzEAL7T3FY5pY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you pick up the Skyline, you will think about the Nokia smartphones of the past. It&apos;s a cross between the old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N9">Nokia N9</a> and Lumia phones that ran <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com">Windows Phone</a>, built with a solid metal body and a plastic back. Yes, plastic — Nokia-style "good" plastic. There&apos;s nothing to complain about unless you don&apos;t dig the sharp corners of the metal frame.</p><p>The fit and finish on my unit are awesome, and I&apos;m serious when I say it reminds me of the N9 (a phone I loved) when I&apos;m holding it. Other people say it reminds them of a premium Lumia model, and I can see it. What I&apos;m saying here is that this phone gives a feeling of quality.</p>
<p>A few things stand out, namely the side-mounted fingerprint/power button and a standalone custom button that can be programmed to open your favorite apps or perform phone functions.</p><p>The side-mounted fingerprint sensor is one of those things you will either love or hate. It&apos;s fast; pressing it reads your fingerprint and unlocks the phone in one motion. Of course, it acts as a security feature in apps that can use a fingerprint sensor. I love this design and prefer it over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/business-front-why-i-never-want-rear-fingerprint-sensor-ever-again">in-screen systems</a> because it&apos;s faster and more accurate, and the power button is how I turn my phone screen on. If you are someone who taps the screen and then uses the sensor, you might not care for it.</p>

<p>So, the Skyline is not one of those powerhouse phones that people love to talk about. Its specs are powerful enough to serve the intended purpose, but it won&apos;t match <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">the latest superphone</a> with the latest chip when it comes to raw power.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not going to work well. I&apos;ve found no problems with the phone slowing down during the time I&apos;ve been using it, including playing games, surfing the web, and watching videos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.98%;"><img id="iRniscpcSBSHWVRdY7e5S5" name="Skyline-software.png" alt="HMD Skyline software" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRniscpcSBSHWVRdY7e5S5.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2397" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display is good; the colors look fine, the viewing angle is good, and it has a great way of handling screen refresh. There are four modes: Standard (60Hz only), 120Hz, 144Hz, and Auto. 120 and 144Hz lock your refresh rates to those numbers, and Auto will scale between 60 and 120Hz depending on whether you&apos;re acting with the screen (it ramps up) or playing a full-screen video. If you want to use power and have a 144Hz refresh display, you certainly can, but I found the auto setting to work well.</p><p>The screen isn&apos;t exceptionally bright, and that becomes apparent outside in the sun. It&apos;s bright enough, but just barely.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="n3CVznVANEF2nV3JT7FPC9" name="HMD-Skyline-Qi2-1.jpg" alt="Qi2 charger coil" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n3CVznVANEF2nV3JT7FPC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I purposely didn&apos;t gauge battery life, and I can&apos;t judge network performance because this is not a phone built for North America (at least, not the model I have). Battery life in a phone is very dependent on your network signal strength, so there is no way for me to accurately judge how well the Skyline does. On Airplane mode with Wi-Fi enabled, it lasts about 10.5 hours of non-stop streaming video before it complains that the battery is low.</p><p>The charging speed is average, but I saw no issues. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins" target="_blank">Qi2 wireless charging</a> also works with a standard Qi charger once you align the coils, but it will not charge at the Qi2 15W rated speed when used this way.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2150px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.12%;"><img id="stwaAdST4Ez3qRKxogGSXA" name="Skyline-camera-features.png" alt="HMD Skyline camera features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/stwaAdST4Ez3qRKxogGSXA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2150" height="2389" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera system takes fine photos, but nothing wowed me. The highlights are the 50MP lens with optical zoom, a front-facing camera with true auto-focus, and HMD&apos;s software additions that use AI to deliver good night photos or gesture controls for the selfie camera.</p><p>I found the optical zoom also delivers decent macro shots if you provide plenty of light, with the camera AI turning out close-up photos better than I expected.</p><p>You will take great photos with the Skyline. You&apos;ll also take mediocre photos. The same can be said for most phones.</p>

<p>If you read all this and think the Skyline is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">solid "budget" phone</a> (it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_int/hmd-skyline?sku=HQ50200045X70">starts at just $499</a> for the 8GB/128GB model), you are absolutely right. A lot of people are looking for a phone like the Skyline, and its excellent design pushes it to the top of the budget phone heap if it is available where you live. You should take a close look at it. But it has one more trick up its sleeve, and that&apos;s <strong>real</strong> user serviceability.</p>
<h2 id="user-serviceability-is-a-cinch-2">User-serviceability is a cinch</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B84qefYvQspgvS4uvXdceD" name="HMD-Skyline-3.jpg" alt="HMD Skyline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B84qefYvQspgvS4uvXdceD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is what makes the Skyline great to me. In fact, it makes me question why other phones that sell for hundreds more don&apos;t offer something similar. I&apos;m <strong>not</strong> saying the Skyline is great when it comes to sustainability because you&apos;ll only see two years of software updates, and that&apos;s a shame, especially because you&apos;ll easily be able to keep this phone going longer than two years.</p><p>The Skyline doesn&apos;t have a battery you can swap out when it gets low and I think those days are gone. It does have the next best thing — a battery that&apos;s simple to replace once it reaches the end of its useful life while still keeping the phone water resistant. </p>
<p>Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-ifixit-perfect-repairability-score">Fairphone 5</a> are simple to repair if you know what you&apos;re doing and can offer great multi-year software support. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-wish-the-fairphone-5-was-coming-to-the-us">I love them</a>. But the Skyline is the phone <strong>you</strong> can repair at home on your kitchen table.</p><p>With a T3 Torx screwdriver and a few guitar picks you can open the phone up to replace the battery, the charging board, the display, and the speaker using parts you will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/HMD_Skyline">find at iFixIt</a>. You won&apos;t need heat guns and special tools to crack things open and once inside things are laid out to make replacements easy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7VvyPTykDqE9reWkY2MBvZ" name="HMD-Skyline-6.jpg" alt="HMD Skyline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7VvyPTykDqE9reWkY2MBvZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A small cam is in the bottom corner of the phone, and turning it lifts the corner of the phone&apos;s rear cover. Once you&apos;ve done that, use something like a guitar pick or a plastic spudger to go around the back cover and release the clips that hold it on.</p><p>From there, it&apos;s easy to unplug cables, replace a battery or charging board, or get to other screws that hold the display to the main board. This sounds harder than it is, and anyone with steady hands who can follow a simple guide can do all of this themselves. If you&apos;re not the type who wants to do this, easy repairability also means it should cost a lot less to have a shop fix your phone.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Once the HMD Skyline is opened up, fiddling around and replacing parts is incredibly easy, and that's very important on a phone.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I can&apos;t stress how important this is enough. All of us have had a phone that seems to not hold a charge very long or one where we&apos;ve broken the screen. At that point, you usually don&apos;t even think about fixing it yourself because the phone wasn&apos;t designed to be easy to fix. The Skyline was designed that way, and it is still rated IP54 water resistant. You can&apos;t take underwater photos with your Skyline, but it can survive a spilled drink (or maybe even an accidental dunk, but don&apos;t count on it).  </p><p>And it still has a back that comes off so you can get to the parts without being an electronics tech with a box full of specialty tools. More importantly, everything goes back together just as easily.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="msuGKrYYY8t6DsKYWNncWg" name="HMD-Skyline-4.jpg" alt="HMD Skyline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/msuGKrYYY8t6DsKYWNncWg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="i-want-to-recommend-this-but-2">I want to recommend this, but...</h2>
<p>Since this is my version of a review, I&apos;m going to tell it to you straight. You should buy this phone if:</p>
<ul><li>You want a cheap phone with a good camera.</li><li>You're OK with two years of software support.</li><li>You want a phone you can fix yourself if you break the screen or need a new battery.</li></ul>
<p>You shouldn&apos;t buy this phone if:</p>
<ul><li>You need a support window longer than two years.</li><li>You want a phone with the best specs.</li><li>You spend all day outside in the brightest sun.</li></ul>
<p>I take issue with HMD&apos;s support schedule, especially for a phone where I can change the battery every few years. I also know a lot of people won&apos;t care and buy a new phone every couple of years anyway. There has been talk about HMD offering support for bootloader unlocking, and that would be enough to put me squarely in the "would buy" camp. Until then, <em>I</em> would pass, even though I think the repairability of this phone makes it special.</p><p>Regardless, if you&apos;re in North America, don&apos;t buy the Skyline unless HMD releases a localized version. HMD is not selling this phone here because it hasn&apos;t been designed yet to work here. Hopefully, the reports of HMD releasing the Skyline for the U.S. and Canada in the future will come to fruition, and then you can make that decision for yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>On Monday (Aug. 5), a judge ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly with Search, years after the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit alleging that Google was using unfair practices to maintain its position in the market.</p><p>These practices include paying companies like Apple to set Google as the default search engine on its devices and making it hard for competitors, such as Bing, to reach consumers.</p><p>"For years, Google has secured default placements through distribution contracts," Judge Mehta states in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25032745-045110819896" target="_blank">289-page ruling</a> obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit" target="_blank">The Verge</a>.</p><p>"In exchange for revenue share, Google not only received placement at the key search access points, but its partners also agree not to preload any other general search engine on the device. Thus, most devices in the United States come preloaded exclusively with Google."</p><p>Google responded by saying that the ruling notes that its search engine is the best but "concludes that we shouldn&apos;t be allowed to make it easily available." The company plans to appeal but is preparing for another trial in September over its advertising technology.</p>

The first is the Google TV Streamer, which will ultimately replace older devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">Chromecast with Google TV</a> dongles. It features a new design with an ethernet port and is powered by a "newer" chipset that should boost performance. There is also 32GB of storage, which is 4x as much as Google&apos;s previous devices.</p><p>The Google TV Streamer has a new remote with a customizable magic button and a new Find My Remote function. It also acts as a smart home hub, with access to controls straight from the TV and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> support, and the device doubles as a Thread border router. Lastly, the Google TV Streamer features AI recommendations powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-connect-iq-adds-garmin-pay-premium-watch-faces"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Garmin is adding some useful new apps to its IQ store, and it&apos;s making it much easier to pay for them. The company announced that the Connect IQ marketplace will now accept Garmin Pay for users who wish to purchase apps and watch faces. Users will be able to see the price of content directly within the marketplace, and this will make it easier for developers to make money off of their creations.</p><p>The plus side is that paid apps and watch faces appear to be much more premium than non-paid ones. Garmin has partnered with NASA, Disney, and more for some fun, dynamic watch faces, and there&apos;s also a new camera control app for GoPro devices.</p><p>This came not long after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/youtube-music-is-now-on-compatible-garmin-smartwatches">Garmin added support for YouTube Music</a> on its watches, which is a huge plus for any Garmin smartwatch owner who doesn&apos;t use other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a> like Spotify.</p>

A Meta spokesperson told Android Central that the cuts weren&apos;t being made to "save money," per se. Rather, these cuts are being made to ensure that Reality Labs stays within the new budgetary constraints and that Oculus Studios can make a "better long-term impact" in VR development.</p><p>The closure follows reports that Meta is cutting Reality Labs&apos; budget by 20% as the division <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q2-2024-earnings">continues to lose billions</a> every quarter despite impressive Quest sales. However, Meta assures that it&apos;s still committed to VR development, although it&apos;s unclear if the company plans to port the studio&apos;s Lone Echo games to the Quest.</p><p>Ready at Dawn Studios employees will receive the same severance that previous Meta layoffs offered.</p>

However, having a digital version of your ID could be handy, and California seems nearly ready to join the party.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/google-wallet-california-id/">9to5Google</a>, California has been testing digital IDs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> with some DMV employees. Adding a state ID appears to be fairly simple; users would only need to set it up through the Wallet app, not with the CA DMV Wallet app. Even so, users will be encouraged to carry their physical IDs, as the digital ones may not be accepted everywhere, including at certain airports.</p><p>For now, it&apos;s unclear when this will roll out, but it&apos;s a positive sign as Google looks to eventually make the Wallet app the only thing you need when you leave the house.</p>

Besides, they would also get six months of Fitbit Premium subscription in addition to three months of YouTube Premium subscription.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.39%;"><img id="nc8Cxg6uTg7r25mSeecz2c" name="Google-Pixel-9-pro-promo-leak.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Promo leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nc8Cxg6uTg7r25mSeecz2c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1064" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication further notes that these freebies are not just for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> but also for the other products in the line-up, like the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and the newbie Pixel 9 Pro XL. Yes, provided that they purchase any of these products before October 31, 2025, which is probably up until the next Pixel series launch next year. This means that any users purchasing any Pixel 9 product over the course of the next year can take advantage of these freebies.</p><p>Another leak from last week revealed the pricing and specs of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series and shared the launch offers. The details shared then were more or less the same, per the publication. Since the emphasis is naturally on AI, the Google One AI Premium plan is a good choice that the company wants to offer to Pixel 9 series buyers.</p>
<p>They not only get access to Gemini&apos;s Advanced feature but also benefit from 2TB of Google One storage. The bundled offer is usually charged $19.99 per month if bought separately. Google also offered many freebies with a purchase of the Pixel 8 last year but this Gemini Advanced offer would be something new.</p><p>The company offered a six-month trial of the Google One Premium 2TB plan for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and Pixel 8 Pro buyers, and the offer persists until December 31, 2024. Similarly, the more recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> offers a three-month trial of the Google One Premium 100 GB plan, which ends next year on December 31, 2025.</p><p>These offers truly sound interesting for potential buyers of the Pixel 9 series after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">launch event</a>. It will be encouraging to see what else Google has in its store next week.</p>

<ul><li>A photo of Huawei's former CEO, Richard Yu, has started circulating social media because it seems he's holding a tri-folding phone.</li><li>A Weibo tipster stated the device is similar to a prototype they've seen with a 10-inch inner display alongside speculation that it could launch before Q4 2024.</li><li>An early report claimed that Huawei started "mass-producing" a tri-fold phone in February and that it would feature a display similar to the running theory.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The foldable world could be in for a shake-up as a photo suggests Huawei&apos;s tri-fold device is very real.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/08/09/huaweis-tri-foldable-phone-spotted-in-real-launching-soon/">Gizmochina</a>, a photo of Huawei&apos;s former CEO Richard Yu preparing for a flight shows him supposedly holding a tri-fold phone. Enhancing the image offers a vague look at where the device might bend (or fold) to open/close. Additionally, it looks like the far left of the device is slightly bent, potentially indicating the first hinge&apos;s placement.</p><p>Chiming in is Chinese Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.weibo.com/6048569942/Orr2aF2z9?pagetype=profilefeed">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS), who claims that the device in question is the real deal. They claim the photographed device is similar to a previously witnessed prototype with a double hinge design. More importantly, the device is rumored to feature a 10-inch inner display when open.</p><p>A punch-hole selfie camera is speculated for the "far left" of the internal display. A specification rumor states the tri-fold phone will contain HiSilicon&apos;s Kirin 9 series SoC. Additionally, DCS suggests this tri-fold device will debut "earlier than the Huawei Mate 70."</p><p>The publication states that the Mate 70 isn&apos;t expected to hit the shelves until Q4 2024, which <em>could </em>mean we&apos;re closer to the world&apos;s first tri-folding device than we realize. Take this with a grain of salt, but speculation states we could see anywhere from now until September.</p>

<p>Huawei&apos;s tri-folding phone is expected to debut with a "premium" price tag. Users on Weibo have also started wondering if the company will include a stylus due to its size.</p><p>The idea of a "tri-fold" phone piqued consumer interest reports claimed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-huawei-new-foldable-phone-push">Huawei started developing such a device</a> earlier this year. That post stated the Chinese company started "mass-producing" a device that would fold twice to form a "Z" shape. Similarly, early rumors claimed the device would offer a 10-inch internal display, which continues to be the running theory.</p><p>Unfortunately, the device never arrived during the first half of the year as the report claimed. So, we&apos;ll have to see if this next rumored timeframe pans out.</p><p>The other side of that report dealt with Samsung who were supposedly putting the "rollable" phone idea back on the table. The Korean OEM did show off a prototype of a rolling phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-display-foldable-rollable-tech-concepts-ces-2024">during CES 2024</a>, so maybe that theory holds water.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When Google took the wraps off of the latest iteration of the Nest Learning Thermostat, there was something very familiar about it. After a few minutes of pondering, I finally figured it out — it&apos;s a blown-up Pixel Watch on the wall. Well, it&apos;s missing the crown, but instead, it adopts a rotating dial around the display, something the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch</a> team could adopt from the Nest team.</p><p>Based on the leaks, Google is already aiming to solve one of my complaints about the Pixel Watch, as we&apos;re now hopefully going to see a larger model released. Now, I&apos;m hoping Google will adopt this Nest Thermostat design feature to future Pixel Watch models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uxuyBUSfwF6bNdVougL4km" name="nest-learning-thermostat-4th-gen-changing-temp-promo.jpg" alt="Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) changing temperature lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uxuyBUSfwF6bNdVougL4km.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m no engineer, so I don&apos;t know if it would actually be feasible, but I would love to see a Pixel Watch with the ability to navigate the menus by swiping your finger around the outer casing.</p><p>This is basically the premise of navigating menus or adjusting the temperature on the thermostat. After spending a few minutes playing around with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">4th Gen Nest Thermostat</a>, this kind of interaction makes much more sense than smudging up the screen. I can&apos;t help but wonder why Google hasn&apos;t done this with the Watch, especially when it&apos;s obvious that there&apos;s a bit of "one hand washes the other" going on internally. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PnHSbKEWSgsYou9iZNzpai" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-white-band-purple-watchface-turn-crown.jpg" alt="Turning the crown on the Google Pixel Watch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PnHSbKEWSgsYou9iZNzpai.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, I&apos;d love it if we saw some type of physical rotating bezel akin to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a>, but that&apos;s unlikely. I can&apos;t imagine Google making a watch large or bulky enough for something like that to even be implemented.</p><p>Speaking of Samsung, it has used a touch-sensitive bezel in different Galaxy Watch models over the years. We&apos;ve also seen physical rotating bezels on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review">Galaxy Watch 3 Classic</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Watch 4 Classic</a>, and Watch 6 Classic. Rather disappointingly, Samsung opted against bringing it back with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="wCDxcFpMAiC2vpNqrjhACD" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-5-Pro-03.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wCDxcFpMAiC2vpNqrjhACD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2047" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Admittedly, I&apos;ve found that the touch bezel solution is <em>very</em> hit or miss, seemingly only working when it wants to. But since there isn&apos;t a digital crown on any Galaxy Watch besides the Ultra, the only other way to interact with your watch is to swipe up, down, and around on the screen. </p><p>It&apos;s really not <em>that</em> big of a deal unless you&apos;re someone like me who has sausage links for fingers. My fat fingers get in the way of being able to see everything, and it&apos;s frankly just a frustrating experience, especially when dealing with such small crowns like the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>.</p><p>Perhaps that&apos;s the reason why we have yet to see anything like what the Nest Thermostat offers being integrated into Google&apos;s wearable. Samsung and Google have supposedly been working closely together on the platform ever since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-wear-os-google-smartwatch">partnership</a> was announced alongside Wear OS 3. Because of that, I can only assume that Google has some kind of idea about the benefits and pain points of the touch bezel.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m not expecting anything drastically different from the Pixel Watch 3 series. Hell, I&apos;m just happy that all signs point to Google releasing a larger version, almost as excited as I am about a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel Fold</a> (odd name notwithstanding). </p><p>I also don&apos;t want to go so far as to presume that this is something that Google has in the cards for a future Pixel Watch model. Who&apos;s to say that the company "gives up the hardware goose" after this year and just lets Samsung become the only real choice if you want an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a>? It&apos;s not outside the realm of possibility, especially if Google ends up needing to find more projects to send to the graveyard.</p>

<p>No matter what, seeing the similarities between the 4th Gen Nest Thermostat and Pixel Watch has me a little excited. Instead of "the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing," it <em>feels</em> like there&apos;s some cross-pollination happening. If you need any additional evidence of this, just check out the design of the different screens on the Thermostat. You can&apos;t tell me that they don&apos;t look like Pixel Watch faces. </p><p>Hopefully, this will become a trend with Google devices, as long as it makes sense and is not done just for the sake of it. </p>

<ul><li>Google started rolling out version 7.0 of the Authenticator app, which overhauls its UI to fit its Material 3 design.</li><li>The redesign adds two new features: Privacy Screen and a search option for app security and convenience.</li><li>Google shifted to storing your one-time codes within your account instead of your device last year as it pushes toward a "passwordless" world.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Authenticator, the helpful one-stop shop for your two-factor passwords, just picked up a big redesign with new features, seemingly rolling out soon for all users.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/08/google-authenticator-material-you-redesign/">9to5Google</a> quickly spotted the redesign (v7.0) rolling out on Android, which brings the app up to Material 3 code. Because the Authenticator app holds the (literal) key to our accounts, Google has rolled out a new "Privacy Screen" feature. The company intends to bolster the app&apos;s security with this feature by restricting access using your lock screen credentials.</p><p>Activated within the app&apos;s settings, users can enable Privacy Screen which will use your previously set PIN or biometric as its own. Users can then set how quickly the Authenticator app requires another password entry.</p><p>The app offers the following options: immediately, after 10 seconds, after one minute, and after 10 minutes.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.39%;"><img id="6gxrxwbUdm2X2igMihKB3" name="google-authenticator-privacy-screen-feature-debut.jpg" alt="Version 7.0 of the Authenticator app brings "Privacy Screen."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6gxrxwbUdm2X2igMihKB3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="276" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:274px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:218.98%;"><img id="sY3AzXk7SLVGnGyHvjote9" name="google-authenticator-qr-code-scanner-revamp.jpg" alt="The latest Authenticator version slightly changes the QR scanner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sY3AzXk7SLVGnGyHvjote9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="274" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>The second addition involves the ability for Android users to search for content between Google accounts. Moreover, the publication states the app has now integrated the hamburger menu icon with the account switcher.</p><p>Some smaller changes join the update via the QR code scanning viewfinder. Google added some privacy information, stating the image captured isn&apos;t shared, only the "scan results." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-visual-search-ui-grid-view">Unlike Lens</a>, Google doesn&apos;t keep the image you&apos;ve snapped stored anywhere (or for any purpose). The QR code scanner also adds a flash option at the top right corner for illuminating darker codes.</p><p>Several screens and the accompanying UI across the Authenticator app have been overhauled to fit Google&apos;s Material design. The post states that version 7.0 of the app hasn&apos;t become available for most Android devices. When it does, users can download it via the Play Store.</p><p>Google&apos;s work with the Authenticator app has been kept relatively quiet other than the app&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-authenticator-account-sync">one-time code sync for accounts</a>. The feature aimed to solve user frustration behind losing their device or having it stolen. Google moved the codes used for 2FA (two-factor authentication) to your account instead of storing them natively within the device.</p><p>If users don&apos;t like that idea, they can always disable the sync option or not sign into a Google account. This is all part of Google&apos;s efforts to create a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-fido-passwordless-security">passwordless</a>" world as it introduces new options like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-account-passkey-access-by-default">passkeys for accounts</a>.</p>

<p>Google is making some interesting changes to the Pixel series this year. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> will not only feature a brand-new design, evolved from the current design, but it will apparently come in three variants, marking the return of the XL model. There have long been rumors that Google will give us a Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL, and it seems the rumors are likely true.</p><p>Google itself has already begun teasing its devices, revealing the design of the Pixel 9 Pro. The device will have a very flat frame, a flat back panel, and a free-floating camera visor that protrudes from the back and is no longer attached to the frame. It also appears that the corners will be fairly rounded, and the phone will retain a triple camera setup with the temperature sensor on the rear.</p><p>In the teaser below, the phone also appears in what looks like a Porcelain colorway.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OMVpP-Zam1A" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Based on leaks and rumors, the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro will be roughly the same size, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie900-review">featuring 6.3-inch displays</a>, with the main visual difference being the lack of a third camera lens on the Pixel 9. Meanwhile, the rumored Pixel 9 Pro XL will apparently feature a larger 6.8-inch display, giving you two sizes of Pro phone to choose from.</p><p>All phones are set to be powered by the Tensor G4, which is rumored to offer a mild performance boost over the Pixel 8 series. We also expect to see 50MP primary cameras across the board, with a 48MP ultrawide and a 48MP telephoto for the Pro phones.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jgwCNBLT2zkiKn6VrnzE9i" name="Pixel-9-Pro-Fold.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jgwCNBLT2zkiKn6VrnzE9i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1276" height="718" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Made by Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> is going through a bit of identity crisis, as the successor is switching up its naming and instead going with something a bit longer: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. It&apos;s a bit of a mouthful compared to "Pixel Fold 2" but it will seemingly bring the device closer to its Pixel 9 siblings in name, while the device also adopts a design closer to the other phones.</p><p>We&apos;ve already seen plenty of leaks showing off the design of the phone, but Google has also teased the device, giving us a good look at the new rectangular camera housing. The phone has a flat frame and what appears to be a wider body with more expansive internal display. Official teasers haven&apos;t yet shown the outer display, but rumors suggest it will be identical to the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro at 6.3-inches, while the internal display will measure eight inches.</p>

<p>Like the other phones, it will likely be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-rumors">Tensor G4</a> chipset and come with 16GB of RAM, although it could feature a smaller battery than its predecessor.</p><p>The cameras may be downgraded compared to the rest of the Pixel 9 series. The primary camera is rumored to be a 48MP unit, with two 10.8MP sensors for the ultrawide and telephoto cameras. We&apos;re also expecting 10MP sensors for the inner and external selfie cameras.</p>

<p>While Google has yet to officially tease its next Pixel Watch, we've seen plenty of leaks that tell us what we need to know. It seems that this year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> may finally be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-leaks-again-in-promo-video">offered in two sizes</a>, which should accommodate people with larger or smaller wrists. Not only are the sizes increasing, but so is the display, with the bezel shrinking as a result. The smaller watch may sport the same 1.2-inch panel, while the 45mm variant may come with a 1.4-inch display, both with up to 2,000 nits of brightness.</p><p>As for the chipset, it's rumored Google is sticking to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a>, which proved to be quite performant on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>. The downside, however, is that there won't seem to be much in the way of battery gains, with leaks suggesting we'll see 36 hours per charge when used in Battery Save mode.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Pixel Watch 3 may gain some new fitness features, with an increased focus on running, as well as other capabilities such as a live view of Nest Doorbell feeds.</p>

<p>Google may finally grace us with a new flagship pair of Pixel Buds this year, which could come with a new design. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-leaked-ad-design">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> were recently leaked, showing off the case, which looks more or less the same as before. However, the buds may be offered in some fun new colors, including Raspberry, Porcelain, Haze, and Mojito.</p><p>It's also rumored that these may be the first earbuds to feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-gemini-capabilities-spotted">Gemini compatibility</a>, which would let you talk to the new chat assistant straight without taking out your phone. This would be quite an interesting step as Google is seemingly working to replace Google Assistant, and it could be the first of many Gemini-compatible earbuds.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that AI will have a big presence at the Made by Google event, as it will be injected into just about everything that gets launched. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-new-google-ai-features-claims">According to a leak</a>, the Pixel 9 series is set to gain some interesting Google AI features, including Add Me, Studio, and Pixel screenshots. The first appears to be able to capture a group of people in a single shot, which may include someone not in the photo, like whoever&apos;s taking the picture.</p><p>Studio appears to be some type of image generator, while Pixel screenshots may be some new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-recall-faq-everything-you-need-to-know">Recall</a>-like feature that will be the new home for your screenshots, allowing the phone to analyze and remember information stored on the images to bring up later.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:384px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:160.42%;"><img id="ToduuzxfpBG9SLSbhuZYHV" name="google-pixel-9-google-ai-rumored-overview.jpg" alt="Sources claim the Pixel 9 will receive "Google AI," a collection of AI features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ToduuzxfpBG9SLSbhuZYHV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="384" height="616" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what new capabilities Google intends to surprise us with, as the rumored features sound quite interesting already. Of course, we'll learn more about what these new Pixel devices can do at the event.</p>

<p>One thing that we may or may not get at the Pixel 9 Made by Google event is Android 15. The beta is already on its last legs, having reached <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-3-platform-stability-rollout">platform stability</a> in June. It seems like a matter of time until we get the stable version of the software, but it remains unclear if that&apos;ll be the case, with rumors swirling that the Pixel 9 series may launch with Android 14.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> is expected to arrive on the Pixel Watch 3, and Google has already teased new capabilities and battery-saving features for the update. Samsung smartwatches have had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/first-one-ui-6-watch-beta-hits-us-galaxy-watches">access to the beta</a> for some time, with the company&apos;s One UI Watch flavor sitting on top. Hopefully, Pixel Watch users won&apos;t have to wait much longer to update their devices.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google was spotted testing a new build of Wear OS that supposedly runs off the next major Android version.</p><p>The existence of a test build was reported to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/wear-os-5-1-android-15-3469455/">Android Authority</a> by a rumored "insider," stating Google has started developing a Wear OS 5.1 update. It was stated that the new build swapped out its initial lettering, opting for "AP4A" instead of Wear OS 5&apos;s "AW2A" number.</p><p>This new Wear OS 5.1 build is reportedly based on Android 15, a theory seemingly bolstered by the shift in build ID number. Wear OS 5, by comparison, is still on Android 14.</p><p>More importantly, the unknown insider said that Google was testing the upcoming software on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> internally. The company&apos;s Wear OS software has always lagged behind the <em>current </em>Android software — and was never so consistent. Wear OS 4 debuted in August 2023 and with Wear OS 5 arriving first on the Galaxy Watch 7, it seems that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">Google hit its stride</a>.</p><p>With that in mind, there&apos;s uncertainty about whether or not Google will keep the update as "Wear OS 5.1" or if it&apos;s just testing Wear OS 6 early. Mishaal Rahman writing for the publication states that the specifics of the 5.1 update are unknown. However, if Google were to update its "APIs or app-facing system behaviors," that could warrant a major number increase.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve got a toss-up regarding when Google could launch the Pixel Watch 3 as it has yet to tease it. The company is gearing up for an earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">hardware event on August 13</a>, so we&apos;ll see when the device will launch. Google&apos;s Pixel Watch 3 is expected to arrive sporting Wear OS 5, which was said to come "later this year" during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/versions/5">developer preview</a> in May.</p><p>While we await the "stock" version of Wear OS 5, Google previously clued us into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces">a few of its key upgrades</a>. When running default settings, Google stated the software will utilize 20% less power when compared to last year&apos;s version.</p><p>Additionally, Android Health will deliver improved running data and goals alongside Health Connect upgrades. Another critical aspect of the base Wear OS 5 software is that it runs off last year&apos;s Android 14. With Google seemingly more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">committed to annual Wear OS release cycles</a>, perhaps this 5.1 update is a testament to that. We&apos;re still waiting for the stable launch of Android 15, so maybe the company&apos;s looking to sync up these launches.</p>

We've already seen quite a few <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-deals">Z Flip 6 deals</a>, but this is the first time Mint has gotten involved. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-z-flip6/6473480/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="007612a3-aa31-4506-a5df-cc5f5b078e65" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,100" data-dimension48="$1,100">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Just like the Z Flip 6, if you pair the purchase of the premium Z Fold 6 with any six-month data plan at Mint Mobile, you'll get a $100 discount alongside six free months of coverage. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is like a premium smartphone and tablet all rolled into one, coming complete with a nearly-invisible center crease, a ton of AI features, and top-of-the-line Snapdragon performance. It's also very expensive, which is why <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-deals">Galaxy Z Fold 6 deals</a> should be taken seriously.  <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-z-fold6/6473054/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="76e5e228-460a-448f-8803-28a722f98e08" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 256GB: $1,900" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 256GB: $1,900">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re sick of paying phone bills every month; you want to use one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> in the industry; you have good T-Mobile coverage in your area. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you don&apos;t want to be stuck with a single wireless carrier for a year; you&apos;re already locked into a contract; you can find a good trade-in deal elsewhere. </p><p>If you&apos;re not totally sold on this Mint Mobile deal just yet, let me break it down so you see why it stands out from other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-mvno-deals-of-month-year-is-it-time-to-switch">MVNO promotions</a>. For starters, it&apos;s important to note that Mint Mobile operates with a "buy in bulk" plan system. Customers pay for their wireless service in 3, 6, and 12-month increments of time, picking from four simple data plans powered by T-Mobile&apos;s vast 5G network. Once their time allotment has reached an end, customers have the option to purchase another data plan or cancel their account without penalty. </p><p>The nice thing about this system is that you can simply pay for a year of wireless in advance and not have to worry about another phone bill for the next 12 months. For example, even if you signed up for six months of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a>&apos;s <em>most expensive </em>Unlimited data plan and bought the Galaxy Z Flip 6, you&apos;d make a single payment of $1,180 (or $50 per month with affirm) and be hooked up with a great 2024 device AND an entire year of wireless service. No more phone bills, no confusing eligibility requirements, and once the year is over you&apos;re free to switch carriers again or update your plan with zero hassle. </p><p>It&apos;s basically the perfect deal for anyone who wants to pair an innovative new phone with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carrier</a> in the business, as long as you don&apos;t mind being stuck with a single carrier for a year. </p>
