                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google I/O, one of the most exciting tech events of the year for Android and Pixel fans, is just around the corner. As usual, the event takes place in mid-May, which is fast approaching. As usual, we expect many fun and interesting announcements from this year&apos;s Google I/O 2024 event, with a lot of software and hopefully some new hardware to show off.</p><p>Google will host a live keynote and a number of sessions and workshops that users can pop in and out of. The event will give us the best idea of what Google has in store for Android, Search, AI, Wear OS, and tons more. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2024/explore/">schedule</a> has already been shared, giving us a good look at what to expect, but we don&apos;t have all the details. Still, we can make a good guess about what some of the biggest announcements will be.</p>
<h2 id="when-is-google-i-o-2024-2">When is Google I/O 2024?</h2>
<p>Google I/O 2024 begins on May 14, 2024, with the opening keynote starting at 10 a.m. PT. The event will be presented live from the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California, but it will also be simultaneously livestreamed for anyone who can&apos;t be present at the event. To find out how to watch, check the next section.</p>

<p>To take part in the Google I/O developer conference, you must <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2024/">register on the website</a> to create a developer profile. Doing so is free, and it will allow you to stay up-to-date with relevant news and content. You don&apos;t <em>need</em> to register to view the sessions or the keynote, but it&apos;s recommended if you want the full experience or want to create a developer profile for additional benefits.</p><p>For the keynote, check out the video linked above to set a reminder so that you don&apos;t miss out on the biggest announcements of Google I/O. The sessions will be available on the I/O website and may likely be posted on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Google">Google&apos;s YouTube channel</a> following the event.</p>
<h2 id="android-15-2">Android 15</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg" name="android-15-logo-highlight.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo on Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After a brief developer preview phase, the next version of Android is currently being beta-tested on eligible Pixel smartphones. This gives us a good idea of what to expect in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, but Google will likely go into detail on what features and changes we can expect when the stable update rolls out later this year.</p><p>Don&apos;t expect much in the way of visual upgrades, with the last major change introduced in Android 12 with Material You. Android 15 continues to build on that by further optimizing the software and refining/adding features.</p><p>One new feature we&apos;ve spotted in the beta that has us very excited is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-excited-about-android-15-audio-sharing-feature">Audio Sharing</a>. This feature seems to be based on Auracast and allows users to broadcast their audio from their device to multiple others. Samsung phones have long featured <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-dual-audio-on-a-samsung-phone">Dual Audio</a>, so this should be a fun evolution of that.</p><p>Other features include partial screen recordings that only show an individual app, taskbar and continuity updates for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, a handy notification cooldown function, a higher-quality webcam mode for Pixels, and more.</p>
<h2 id="pixels-2">Pixels</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="vXQfgQcni7RQ8esY58Vk9k" name="google-pixel-8a-colors-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8a all colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vXQfgQcni7RQ8esY58Vk9k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2023-biggest-announcements">Last year&apos;s Google I/O</a> brought with it a few hardware announcements. The Pixel 7a impressed us with its improved display, Tensor G2, and incredible value. However, this year, Google decided not to wait for I/O and instead <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-8a-packs-just-as-much-ai-punch-as-the-standard-pixel-8">announced the Pixel 8a</a> a week before the event. The phone brings an even better display, the latest Tensor chip, and support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, all at the same $499 price tag.</p><p>Google also had new Pixel Tablet news, although probably not what you were expecting. Instead of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-2">Pixel Tablet 2</a>, Google announced that it&apos;s now selling the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-solo-launch-announcement">Pixel Tablet without the dock</a>, bringing the price down to just $399. It&apos;s a small change, and we&apos;re still waiting for a first-party keyboard and stylus, but hopefully, we&apos;ll get more news at I/O and maybe even a glimpse of the next iteration.</p><p>We also got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> announcement at I/O 2023, so it&apos;s possible we could see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Fold 2</a> at I/O, although Google may wait to launch its next foldable later in the year alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>.</p>
<h2 id="wear-os-5-2">Wear OS 5</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6PyGvvbynS4SbCMDtYo4J8" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-wearing-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6PyGvvbynS4SbCMDtYo4J8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One announcement we weren&apos;t expecting is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">Wear OS 5</a>. While we knew it was likely we&apos;d see an update to Wear OS, we didn&apos;t think it would be a full version jump, as we have previously been treated to partial jumps. It&apos;s a pretty big deal, even if we don&apos;t yet have the full details on what to expect from the update. Google says it will talk about the evolution of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/watch-face-format-for-future-wear-os-releases">Watch Face Format</a>, but besides that, we&apos;re in the dark for now.</p><p>We expect the update will first roll out on Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Watch series before the Pixel Watch models get it later this year, and Samsung will likely add its own goodies into the mix. We&apos;ll also be curious to see what other devices will be eligible for the update, although it will likely be those powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 platform</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ai-in-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-2">AI in everything, everywhere, all at once</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum" name="Gemini-Era-Google.jpg" alt="The Gemini Era graphic from Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It seems like yesterday, ChatGPT was the big new thing. Now, generative AI is everywhere, and it seems like we can&apos;t go a day without hearing about it. Rest assured, Google will have a lot to say about it at I/O (in case you&apos;re looking to start a drinking game of some sort). The company will likely have plenty of new AI features coming to Search, Chrome, Maps, and its various other software services. </p>
<h2 id="other-google-i-o-announcements-we-expect-2">Other Google I/O announcements we expect</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wiYEJiEz4z2eKoNkrp89LX" name="Project-Iris-hero.jpeg" alt="Various VR and AR headsets with the Google logo in front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wiYEJiEz4z2eKoNkrp89LX.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The I/O schedule is quite expansive, so there will be plenty to get into during the conference. One of the things we expect to see or at least hear more about is Google&apos;s XR platform, which is expected to power an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">upcoming Samsung headset</a>. It&apos;s unclear if this will actually be talked about during the event, but we feel like it&apos;s highly likely, especially in the wake of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro">Apple Vision Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/accessories/these-ray-ban-sunglasses-have-cameras-and-ai-but-you-should-just-wait-for-apple-glass-instead">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>.</p><p>Google is also said to have its own smart glasses in the works, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-smart-glasses-google-io-2022">showed off the Iris concept</a> at I/O 2022, so maybe we&apos;ll see how that&apos;s evolved since then.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tPpA5xXeGoyYP5xjEfA4hi" name="Google-io-2022-google-glass-translate-02.jpg" alt="The new Google smart glasses teased at Google I/O 2022" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tPpA5xXeGoyYP5xjEfA4hi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We also hope to hear more about Google&apos;s plans for fitness. The company signaled the death of Google Fit when Fitbit was made the de-factor app on the Pixel Watch, and recently put another nail in its coffin with the announcement that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-has-set-a-deadline-to-shut-down-the-google-fit-api">moving away from the Google Fit API</a>. Now, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> and the Android Health Platform, we&apos;re hoping Google can shed some light on how exactly it all comes together, especially as it relates to wearables.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope to learn about what Google is doing with smart home. We haven&apos;t had a new smart display in a while, and rumors indicate we could see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/possible-nest-hub-max-refresh-spotted">new Nest Hub Max</a> and Nest Audio soon, which would help reinvigorate the company&apos;s smart home efforts in a way that the Pixel Tablet couldn&apos;t really do.</p>

<p>Android Central will be present at Google I/O for any firsthand content. We will also have a live blog during the keynote so that you can stay up to date on the latest announcements as they happen. Be sure to tune in on May 14 for our live coverage!</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Messages app in beta brings handy new features from the November 2023 announcement.</li><li>They include voice moods accompanied by an audio recorder redesign.</li><li>Users can also see the new noise cancellation feature as part of the interface redesign.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Beta users of the Google Messages app are seeing voice moods roll out alongside a redesign of the audio recorder interface, which features noise cancellation, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/06/google-messages-recorder-redesign-voice-moods/">9to5Google</a>. </p><p>In November 2023, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-gain-one-billion-active-rcs-users">announced</a> some exciting new features for its messages as part of the celebration of one billion RCS users. The voice moods on the messaging app were part of this, and they are now seeing a broader rollout.</p><p>Previously, users were accustomed to long-pressing the voice memo button, which opened up the traditional “Slide to cancel” interface. However, the new one in the beta version has been revamped with a new Material You-inspired design.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="K6N3FHHaPxCBwtqDxyeqRC" name="google-messsages-audio-recorder-redesign.jpg" alt="Google Messages audio recorder new interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6N3FHHaPxCBwtqDxyeqRC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Dgae4Y6BPiRaMRVcAJR5LC" name="google-messages-audio-recorder-interface-redesign.jpg" alt="Google Messages audio recorder new interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dgae4Y6BPiRaMRVcAJR5LC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Users can notice “Tap to record your voice” aided by the microphone icon, cancel, and attach buttons. When users start recording, they can see the “Noise Cancellation” button, which can be turned on or off, per requirement. </p><p>While the feature helps turn off background noises for recording, Google says the improvements in overall audio quality can also be seen due to increased sampling and bit rate.</p><p>On the other hand, the new voice moods are added from the aforementioned new interface wherein users can pick from nine voice moods accompanied by relevant emojis, which can be added by clicking the attach button.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:939px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="ETZqr4U9PSUHwb5tyQCsum" name="Google-Messages-voice-mood-1.jpg" alt="Setting a voice memo mood in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ETZqr4U9PSUHwb5tyQCsum.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="939" height="939" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:940px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="gGkpAT2qrJXJ8VgWecoJ2n" name="Google-Messages-voice-mood-2.jpg" alt="Setting a voice memo mood in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gGkpAT2qrJXJ8VgWecoJ2n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="940" height="940" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Users then would see a gradient emoji background added to the waveform for the interface, as mentioned. The same card will be sent as a message to the recipient with all the emoji and wallpaper stuff. </p><p>It is encouraging to see Google Messages finally seeing the nifty new interface amongst other announced features from last year. The features, such as the redesigned audio recorder interface, can be seen on the latest Google Messages beta bearing <strong>20240501_RC00</strong> version. </p><p>However, as 9to5 points out, the voice moods rollout doesn’t appear as extensive as the interface. However, we could see the rollout soon, followed by the official rollout in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>Strava is one of the most widely used fitness apps available, and aside from being an excellent platform for tracking your exercises, it also has a great social aspect to it. Pairing all of this with your Wear OS watch helps make the most of every workout then when you are done with your sweat, share it with fellow Strava users.</p>

As amazing as traditional books are, they&apos;re often heavy, expensive, and can take up a significant amount of space in a cramped apartment, so making the transition to e-books is worth it.</p><p>The good thing is that you&apos;ve got a few options, depending on where you want to get your e-books and how you want them to look on your Android phone or tablet&apos;s screen.</p><p>With that said, take a peek at our picks for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps#section-best-reading-apps">best e-book apps for reading</a> on Android!</p>

<p>Amazon Kindle pulls ahead of the pack with a huge library of content, including free e-books and content from indie publishers that you can read on your mobile device or desktop with the Kindle app. There is bound to be a book out there for you, no matter what genre you are looking for.</p>
<p>In the app, you can also customize fonts, margins, line spacing, and also organize the books you&apos;ve downloaded into collections so that it&apos;s easier to find the one you want to read. Kindle will also remember the page that you left reading on when you switch devices. This means that you can switch between your phone, tablet, and PC without ever losing your page in the process. Or you can simply get something like the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">Amazon Kindle Scribe</a>, which is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle" target="_blank">best Amazon Kindle e-readers</a>, and go back and forth between it and your smartphone.</p>
<p>The Kindle app is so versatile that you can even have other reading pieces sent to the app, such as articles saved in Instapaper. You can also sign up for the Kindle Unlimited and get access to more than one million titles for $11.99 per month.</p>

<p>While the ability to purchase books from a major retailer and download them all to your phone is awesome, sometimes the books you want to read are ones that you already have in digital form. Whether you&apos;ve picked up e-books from an independent publisher, or you&apos;ve gotten the files from a now-defunct program, being able to open and read them properly is key, and that&apos;s where Moon+ Reader comes in.</p>
<p>This app is lightweight, easy to use, and very straightforward. I personally prefer this over the Kindle app on my Android devices. It has support for more than 10 different file formats, from RAR all the way to EPUB. On top of that, you can customize the way words look on the screen, back up your library online, and get access to five auto-scroll options apart from plenty of fantastic features. With the ability to view content in various formats, it&apos;s easy to understand why Moon+ Reader is one of the best Android apps, and not just among the best e-book apps for Android.</p>

<p>Many e-book publishers for Android limit you to only using their apps to read and enjoy content. Moon+ Reader throws that out of the window and makes it so you can enjoy just about any e-book, regardless of the format it was downloaded in.</p>

<p>Long gone are the days when you needed to head out to your local library just to get some new books to read. Thanks to the digital world and apps like Libby, your library is now available with you wherever you go.</p>
<p>If you live near a participating library, Libby opens up your world to a variety of new books at your fingertips. There are standard books that can be "checked out" easily along with audiobooks, and both of these can be saved for offline use so you can read them even if you don&apos;t have an internet connection.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy reading on a Kindle, Libby makes it simple to check out a book, and then easily send it over to a reading device. The app has all the expected options for customization, so you can read right from the app and even take notes. Did you just come across a word you&apos;ve never seen before? Libby will be able to even define it for you from the app, making it so you don&apos;t have to open another app in the middle of an intense chapter.</p>

<p>Libby, by OverDrive, is an app that works with your local library to give you access to your favorite books. While it's surely fun to actually go to the library, sometimes it's just not feasible. Also, with Libby, you won't have to worry about those pesky late fees.</p>

<p>Google Play Books gives you access to a wide range of books, some of which are free. You&apos;ll also find some textbooks, although we&apos;d like to see the textbook selection improve. You can read books offline, use a dictionary to look up unfamiliar words, and have your notes and place in a book saved across multiple devices through your Google account.</p>
<p>If you have a family account set up, then you can share books between everybody without having to purchase them multiple times. Staying within the Google ecosystem also makes it easy to share your purchases with family members and keep all of your media in one place.</p>

<p>Google's Play Books app is one of those apps that doesn't get as much attention as other e-book apps for Android. Still, Google has done a wonderful job at combining a catalog of endless selections with a solid reading experience, right on your phone or tablet.</p>

<p>Kobo has been around for quite some time and is now a part of Rakuten, but that hasn&apos;t stopped it from being great. This app is a great way of reading your favorite e-books whether they&apos;re on your phone or tablet. It has a gigantic selection filled with both new and established authors, including magazines and children&apos;s books. The most popular and trending e-books are even updated hourly so you won&apos;t miss an amazing story, even when it&apos;s coming from an author you&apos;ve never heard of.</p>
<p>As you begin to buy books and Kobo learns your preferences, it will build up a list of recommendations having suggestions for new books or magazines. There is also an awesome reading activity feature that&apos;ll show you how much time you&apos;ve spent while reading in the app, what books you are currently reading, a running tally of how many books you&apos;ve read, and even how many pages you&apos;ve turned in the process.</p>

<p>PocketBook is another one of those apps that make it easy to read books, regardless of what format they&apos;re in. The app supports more than 25 different formats, making it possible for you to read magazines and comic books, or even listen to your favorite audiobooks.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit to PocketBook over similar apps has everything to do with cloud syncing. PocketBook Cloud will synchronize your progress for anything uploaded to the app, so you can start reading something on your phone, only to pick it up right where you left off in a browser. You can even sync files from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cloud-storage-service">cloud storage services</a> like Dropbox and Google Drive, if you don&apos;t want to manually upload the books to your phone.</p>

To try and keep up with the times, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/barnes-and-noble-nook-10-inch-hd-tablet-lenovo">unveiled a series of e-readers</a> a few years back. Following that unsuccessful attempt, Barnes & Noble has now largely pivoted to the NOOK app. Like the Kindle app, you can browse a vast library of titles, genres, and much more right from your smartphone.</p>
<p>After finding a new book to settle down with, you can customize different aspects of the reading experience. This includes adjusting the font style, changing the margins, and even switching up the page animations. As you might expect, you can also make notes and add bookmarks that can then be shared with your friends if you come across an inspiring quote or just something funny. The NOOK app is free to use and includes more than 75,000 free e-books, or you can start building your digital library by purchasing e-books.</p>

<p>NOOK comes from a time when the traditional bookstore was still popular, but Barnes & Noble has evolved and recognized our smartphones make for the perfect portable library. NOOK includes thousands of free e-books but can also be used to check out magazines or to purchase new e-books.</p>

<p>Goodreads isn&apos;t an app to read your favorite e-books. Instead, it&apos;s a social community for everyone who enjoys reading and sharing book recommendations and ratings. Sometimes it&apos;s not always feasible for you to be able to catch up with your friends and family about what new books they are enjoying. That&apos;s where Goodreads comes into the foray, as this app makes it easy to see what your friends are reading and what they think of those books. It is an excellent place to find something new to read — something I can vouch for as a decade-old user.</p>
<p>You can create lists however you like, including books that you want to pick up later. You can also find recommendations based on your reading lists and read reviews. Then there are exciting challenges that you can set for yourself to achieve and share them with your community. Goodreads is a must-have app for every dedicated reader.</p>

<p>If you're someone who reads a lot of books, you may run out of ideas on where to find the next one. Goodreads changes that as this is a community-driven app where you can find and share opinions and ratings for books with both family and friends.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola is debuting the new G Stylus 5G for 2024, upgraded with an improved pen experience and a bolstered premium design for $399.</p><p>As stated in its press release, the Moto G Stylus takes its capabilities further with a 6.7-inch pOLED display that rocks a 120Hz refresh rate. Motorola adds that the device&apos;s Full HD Plus resolution makes what you see feel brighter, sharper, and clearer. Moreover, the company is touting the phone&apos;s multitasking abilities, stating users can take notes while binge-watching a show.</p><p>Speaking of the stylus, the device&apos;s larger contact area and improved software is said to enhance the pen&apos;s mobility for a smoother experience. Motorola has implemented a new UI when using stylus-specific features. Additionally, users can add an array of "favorite apps" for the pen that will appear when it&apos;s taken out.</p><p>The overall design of the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is another talking point. The company states that its back panel is crafted with vegan leather. The post adds that those looking for a phone at a reduced price won&apos;t have to "compromise design."</p><p>Shielding the front of the device is Corning&apos;s Gorilla Glass 3, alongside an IP52 water-repellent rating.</p>

<p>Furthering this is the phone&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-6-gen-1-snapdragon-4-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 6 Gen 1</a> SoC from Qualcomm.</p><p>Similarly to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-review">last year&apos;s edition</a>, the 2024 G Stylus 5G boasts a vertical dual-camera array. The post states that the "versatile" setup contains a 50MP primary lens with an f/1.8 aperture and Ultra Pixel technology. The company adds that such improvements should aid the camera&apos;s light sensitivity.</p><p>OIS (optical image stabilization) helps keep our shots steady when moving. The main lens is joined by a 13MP ultrawide camera with 120-degree FOV capabilities. The front contains a 32MP centered punch-hole selfie camera.</p><p>Like its predecessor, the latest G Stylus offers a large 5,000mAh battery expected to give consumers over a day&apos;s worth of energy. Charging cycles are handled by its 30W TurboPower when wired and 15W when charged wirelessly. Motorola suspects the device can obtain enough power "for the day" in just thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Users will find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box. Internally, the device is offered in the following RAM/storage configurations: 8/128GB and 8/256GB. However, the Moto G Stylus features a slot for a microSD card, meaning users can expand their storage by up to 2TB.</p><p>The NFC-capable device sports a 3.5mm headset jack, USB-C port, and Bluetooth 5.1 support.</p><p>For U.S. consumers, Motorola states the G Stylus 5G 2024 is available "universally unlocked" at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and its website (motorola.com). Users can grab the new phone on May 30 for $399 in Scarlet Wave and Caramel Latte. Folks in Canada can grab the phone for CAD 499 on the same date as U.S. consumers.</p><p>The company adds that there are plans to bring the device to more services such as Metro by T-Mobile, AT&T, Cricket, Boost Infinite, Boost Mobile, Consumer Cellular, UScellular, Google Fi Wireless, and more "in the coming weeks."</p>

<p>There&apos;s one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-8a-packs-just-as-much-ai-punch-as-the-standard-pixel-8">key piece of information to know</a> before settling on a single Google Pixel 8a colorway to buy. The phone comes in two memory variants, 128GB and 256GB. Unfortunately, only one shade comes with 256GB and there&apos;s no microSD slot. This means that anyone who wants more than 128GB of storage will have to purchase the Pixel 8a in Obsidian.</p><p>If you&apos;re happy with 128GB, there&apos;s nothing to worry about. You can choose any of the four hues of the Pixel 8a without worries. For people who prefer muted hues, Obsidian and Porcelain are going to be satisfactory. On the other hand, those who like to make a statement will favor brighter hues like Aloe and Bay. Both the green and blue are cheerful colors. Opt for something that aligns with your personal tastes.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve ordered the color that pleases you, you better move on to crucial accessories for your new Google device. A screen protector is essential, so be sure to grab a sturdy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-screen-protectors">screen guard for your Pixel 8a</a>.

<p>If you wanted a modern flip phone in North America, your only viable option for a while was Samsung with the Galaxy Z Flip line, at least until Motorola&apos;s triumphant return to the foldable space with the Razr Plus and Razr 2023 models. Now, Nubia is entering with its first foldable, the Nubia Flip 5G, challenging Motorola&apos;s take on the affordable foldable.</p><p>Both the Nubia Flip 5G and Motorola Razr 2023 have plenty of similarities but are also different enough that Motorola&apos;s phone could still be considered higher-end than Nubia&apos;s. This is evident by the $699 launch price of the Razr, a $200 premium over the $499 Nubia Flip 5G. That said, nowadays, you can find the Razr 2023 for the same price as the Nubia, which might make your decision a little more difficult (or easier) if you&apos;re looking for an affordable flip phone.</p><p>So, which foldable is worth your money? Let&apos;s break it down.</p>
<h2 id="nubia-flip-5g-vs-motorola-razr-2023-design-2">Nubia Flip 5G vs. Motorola Razr 2023: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fXaD4Up6Kp8AEoQXv564Wi" name="Nubia-Flip-5G-vs-motorola-razr-2023-2.jpg" alt="The Nubia Flip 5G next to a green Motorola Razr 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fXaD4Up6Kp8AEoQXv564Wi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Budget phones aren&apos;t really known for having the most premium designs, but these two flip phones sort of flip the script on that narrative. Whether it&apos;s more premium-like materials or a more high-end look, both the Nubia Flip 5G and Razr 2023 offer something that makes you feel like you should&apos;ve paid more for either phone.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia Flip 5G</a> looks like some amalgamation of a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-flip-review">TECNO Phantom V Flip</a>. Essentially, if you took Samsung&apos;s already stellar design and slapped the Phantom&apos;s circular camera/cover screen housing. The result is something that looks rather classy and different from most other flip phones, which usually opt for a square cover screen.</p><p>The cover panels are otherwise very flat, as is the frame of the phone, which is very reminiscent of the Galaxy. It&apos;s a stark contrast to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Motorola Razr 2023</a>, which features a more rounded frame and cover panels that curve slightly into the said frame for a seamless feel.</p><p>But that&apos;s not the only way the Razr 2023 differs from the Nubia Flip. Instead of the typical glass you find on most phones, the Razr has a vegan leather finish that completely covers much of the back panels. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-vegan-leather-phones">We&apos;re big fans of the vegan leather</a> on Motorola phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G Power 5G</a>, even if it can get easily scuffed. It certainly makes me less worried about dropping and cracking it, although there&apos;s still the camera/cover screen housing to worry about.</p>

<p>The Nubia Flip is made of glass, but the company put it through a particular process that gives it a sandy feeling. While I like the frosted, stardust look of the glass, I can&apos;t say I&apos;m a fan of how it feels in my hand. The phone feels incredibly cheap as if it&apos;s really made of plastic, which makes me a bit concerned about the durability of the glass.</p><p>Speaking of durability, the Razr 2023 one-ups the Nubia Flip with an official IP rating of IP52, meaning it can withstand light splashes, rain, and even exposure to dust, the latter of which is still pretty uncommon in foldables.</p><p>The Razr 2023 is a hair thicker, but the curved sides help alleviate that a bit. Meanwhile, the Nubia Flip is wider, which I find I prefer on a phone (I&apos;m not a huge fan of very tall phones). Both also have really sturdy hinges that can hold their positions relatively well.</p><p>These phones are very different in terms of design, so it&apos;s hard to say who wins in this department, but the circular housing may give the Nubia an edge.</p>

<p>Spec-wise, the Nubia Flip and Razr 2023 are very similar. Both are powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 1</a>, which is a rather capable midrange chip from 2022. Opening and juggling multiple apps is handled well with the included 8GB of RAM (although the Nubia has a 12GB option), and performance is overall pretty good on both phones. That includes gaming, with graphic-intensive games like Honkai: Star Rail playing well, even with higher settings.</p>

<p>The phone displays are the same size, and while the Nubia Flip 5G has a higher pixel density, the Razr 2023 has a higher refresh rate at 144Hz, meaning content is extra smooth, especially during gaming sessions. Still, the Nubia display is plenty fast at 120Hz and even has an incredibly high PWM rate for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> individuals (Motorola also handles this well with flicker reduction, a feature you can enable when needed).</p><p>One area where the Nubia wins is in storage capacity, as it comes with double the amount found in the Razr 2023. The Nubia also has a slightly larger battery and faster charging than the Razr, but the Razr is no slouch and both phones can get you through much of the day before you need a top-up. You also get wireless charging with the Razr, which is always a handy feature to have.</p>

<p>Both phones run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a>, and while that makes more sense for the Razr 2023—a phone that was launched while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> was still rolling out on most phones—the Nubia has less of an excuse since it launched in 2024.</p><p>Motorola&apos;s software is very close to the "stock Android" experience you&apos;ll find on a Pixel phone, save for some differences in customizations and additional (and quite useful) gestures. If you&apos;re a fan of the Pixel UI, then you won&apos;t mind Motorola&apos;s flavor of Android.</p><p>Nubia&apos;s MyOS13 is noticeably different, and not necessarily in a bad way. Visually, it&apos;s very unoffensive, and it sort of reminds me of One UI meets Pixel UI. There is quite a bit of bloatware you have to sift through when you first set the phone up, which is a major negative in 2024, and for some reason, the software doesn&apos;t handle notifications very well, as they often won&apos;t appear until much later or not until I&apos;ll open a particular app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3847px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QNQYXXLABxgWtg8HdPucki" name="Nubia-Flip-5G-review-11.jpg" alt="The Nubia Flip 5G in hand with the quick setting shade pulled down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QNQYXXLABxgWtg8HdPucki.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3847" height="2164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nubia also hasn&apos;t been very forthcoming about software updates. We don&apos;t know how many the phone will get or how often it&apos;ll get them, but at a $499 price point, we don&apos;t imagine it&apos;ll be many. Meanwhile, Motorola has promised three OS upgrades and four years of software updates for the Razr 2023, which is a huge step up for the company. Software updates also come roughly every other month, although we are still waiting on Android 14 and don&apos;t know when that&apos;ll appear.</p>

<p>While phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a> have large cover screens that let you use apps and feature a number of panels for quick access to features, this isn&apos;t the case for the Nubia Flip 5G or Razr 2023. Both cover screens are rather small and similarly limited in their usability.</p><p>At 1.43 inches, the Nubia Flip cover screen is the more interesting of the two as it&apos;s a circular display. This makes the cover screen seem larger than the 1.5-inch display on the Razr, but it&apos;s not all that interesting to use. It comes with a handful of panels, including a calendar, daily agenda, pedometer, weather, and camera.</p><p>Unfortunately, they&apos;re not all that useful aside from offering glanceable information and one-touch access to simple phone functions. You can view notifications from the cover screen, but these are equally not as useful as much of what you do on the cover screen requires you to open the phone, even expanding on notifications. Swiping individual notifications or clearing them doesn&apos;t seem to work either, and once again, you are required to open the phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zDDXc6fL9X9bRnk82RogxC" name="Nubia-Flip-5G-review-3.jpg" alt="The Nubia Flip 5G cover screen prompting to open the phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zDDXc6fL9X9bRnk82RogxC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Razr 2023 cover screen is a little more useful, but not by much. You still get a handful of panels with quick access to certain functions, much of which are less visual than the Nubia&apos;s cover screen. Still, notifications are handled better, allowing me to swipe them away or clear them with the press of a button. I can also expand notifications so I can see the entire text, which is nice as it lets me better determine if it&apos;s worth opening the phone. The Razr also has limited access to the quick settings panel, which is a nice touch and something you can&apos;t do on the Nubia.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4126px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kCvXeZAPLvcYnUPUW47z6U" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-15.jpg" alt="A notification on the Razr 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kCvXeZAPLvcYnUPUW47z6U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4126" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both cover screens allow you to take selfies using the main cameras, which is handy. On the Nubia, you can open the camera using the dedicated panel or by double-tapping the power button if you have that gesture enabled (although this doesn&apos;t always work for some reason). When the camera is open, swiping up or down lets you switch between photo, video, and portrait modes. Hitting either volume button takes a photo instantly, or you can tap the screen for a two-second timer.</p><p>The Razr 2023 is similar, but you swipe left or right to access the same modes. The main difference is that the Razr lets you switch between the wide and ultrawide cameras (the latter of which is not present on the Nubia), but tapping the volume button or the screen has the same capture response as the Nubia. Unfortunately, you can&apos;t preview/delete the images afterward on the cover screen like you can on the Nubia.</p><p>Lastly, when taking photos with the phone open, the Nubia lets you use the cover screen as a preview for your subject, something you can&apos;t do on the Razr 2023.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">Flip phones</a> are usually limited in the number of cameras they have, with most featuring only two on the rear. This is the case for both phones here, but the Motorola Razr 2023 has a major leg up here. That&apos;s because Motorola outfitted the phone with a wide and ultrawide setup, meaning you can get a wider shot of your scene with the 13MP camera.</p><p>However, when it comes to photos taken with the primary camera, the 50MP sensor on the Nubia seems to do a better job than the 64MP sensor on the Razr. The colors are just more vibrant, and there&apos;s a bit more contrast, which I like. It makes photos really pop, although it can go a little overboard at times. Meanwhile, photos from the Razr, while bringing in plenty of light for low-light images, can often appear washed out and just overall dull in regular lighting, even if you have the automatic photo enhancement feature turned on. Sometimes, it gets a decent image, but it&apos;s hit or miss.</p>

<p>That said, the Nubia lead sort of ends there, as the 2MP depth sensor doesn&apos;t really help at all. The phone seems to have trouble separating the background from the subject, and you&apos;ll need to play around with it quite a bit to try and achieve the effect you want. The Razr 2023 just gets it without the dedicated depth sensor, although the ultrawide likely plays a part. You also get macro mode, making this secondary sensor much more useful than the Nubia, and you can always edit your images in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> if the output isn&apos;t to your liking.</p><p>Both phones top out at FHD 60fps video, but the Razr 2023 seems to struggle a bit when taking videos, and you&apos;ll notice a number of dropped frames and stuttering, especially when you first start recording. The Nubia seems to handle video capture with aplomb.</p>

<p>Given the Razr 2023 launched at a higher price point, this could have been a pretty easy comparison, but not so much. There are a lot of similarities between these phones, with the main differences being in the design, display specs, and camera setup.</p><p>If you really care about camera quality, then the Nubia might be the option for you, although you&apos;ll have to sacrifice an ultrawide sensor for a rather useless depth sensor. The cover screen is also more visually appealing, but it&apos;s less functional, and you&apos;ll have to deal with a few annoyances when handling notifications. The software update situation is also precarious, especially given that this 2024 phone launched with Android 13.</p><p>The Razr 2023 doesn&apos;t have the best camera, but it&apos;s much more versatile than the Nubia. The cover screen also feels smaller, but it&apos;s less annoying to deal with. It also helps that Motorola seems serious about keeping the phone somewhat up to date, and we at least have a solid software promise.</p><p>So who wins? Well, now that the price of the Razr 2023 has been cut down to match the Nubia Flip 5G, I have to go with Motorola. It&apos;s really the little extras like the unique vegan leather finish, the addition of wireless charging, and the more reliable software that give Motorola an edge here. With the Nubia Flip 5G, the situation feels a lot more like "you get what you paid for."</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2023 is your cheapest way to get a foldable phone while still offering a powerful Snapdragon chipset, an impressive 144Hz display, and all-day battery life. If you're curious about foldables but don't want to spend too much to get one, this is the phone to consider.</p></p>

It has considerable upgrades, including a 120Hz OLED panel, larger battery, Tensor G3, and it will get the same seven years of software updates as the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> models.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>But there&apos;s a problem. All the new features come with an inflated price tag, with the Pixel 8a retailing at $499 — $50 more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a> and $100 more than the Pixel 3a. The Pixel 8a is still a good bargain considering you get most of the same features as the $699 Pixel 8, and if you need a mid-range phone, it is the best overall choice.</p><p>While Google is doing the right things with the Pixel A series, I think it needs to shift its attention to the budget segment. There aren&apos;t as many choices in this category as previous years; other than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G 5G</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">OnePlus Nord N30</a>, and a few TCL options, you don&apos;t get much if you&apos;re interested in a sub-$350 phone. Even the Galaxy A35 starts off at $399.</p><p>This isn&apos;t limited to North America either. I&apos;ve always recommended Xiaomi&apos;s Redmi Note series in the past, but the brand decided to move up a segment with recent launches, and the result is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro+</a> now costs the equivalent of $495, a truly ridiculous state of affairs. The only budget-focused model in the series is the standard Redmi Note 13, and that just doesn&apos;t have the same caliber of hardware.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nWZPhBUMpYx79ZArta3CNT" name="nothing-phone-2a-9.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nWZPhBUMpYx79ZArta3CNT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only budget phone that I&apos;d recommend is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a>; it has a great design, good internal hardware, and clean software with unique extras. The cameras aren&apos;t as good as the Pixel 7a, but you get two usable lenses — which isn&apos;t the case with most budget options.</p>
<p>Google is seeing a lot of momentum with the Pixel A series, but the only way to truly scale its hardware ambitions is by focusing on the budget segment. That&apos;s the only feasible area where Google can meaningfully grow its business in countries like India. While Google sells its phones in the region, they&apos;re significantly costlier than their rivals — the Pixel 8a starts off at an absurd ₹52,999 ($634), and that effectively kills the phone before it even goes on sale.</p>
<p>Ideally, Google needs to introduce a model in the sub-$350 segment to be able to challenge Samsung and Xiaomi. But it is unlikely the search giant will ever do that; in an interview with Austrian publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000189970/warum-google-keine-billig-smartphones-bauen-will-und-wieso-oesterreich-erst-jetzt-drankommt"><em>Der Standard</em></a>, Google&apos;s Pixel division Nanda Ramachandran confirmed that the brand will not release a budget device, stating "we would have to make too many compromises for that."</p><p>A budget Pixel makes sense in a lot of ways. Google&apos;s camera wizardry combined with its unique software features would make a budget Pixel device stand out considerably, but it&apos;s clear that Google has no intention of taking that route. Google says it wants to be a major hardware player, but it doesn&apos;t have a strategy in place that allows the brand to get there. While Pixels are still terrific devices they continue to be out of reach of buyers interested in affordable phones.</p>
