A smart ring focuses on health data, sleep tracking, and some workouts, while a smartwatch gives you a display and apps on top of all that. </p><p>Underneath the surface, there are more smart ring vs. smartwatch differences that you won&apos;t find advertised by wearable brands. You&apos;ll notice differences in heart rate accuracy, step accuracy, and other metrics between the two categories the longer you use them. So, it&apos;s better to know these differences upfront. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> is all but guaranteed to arrive at Galaxy Unpacked on July 10, but it&apos;s just the latest in a series of smart rings. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring</a>, in particular, has become quite popular, but the smart ring category is still niche as people figure out whether they need a smartwatch <em>and</em> a smart ring. So, let&apos;s help <strong>you</strong> decide.</p>

<p>Although it varies by manufacturer, most smart rings track heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), blood oxygenation (SpO2), skin temperature, breathing, and sleep. Specific to heart rate, many smart rings focus on your resting heart rate or stress levels. And for sleep tracking, they&apos;ll measure your restlessness, time spent in sleep zones like REM, and overall energy recharge.</p><p>Most cheap fitness trackers will measure heart rate, sleep, and SpO2. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> measures stress, breathing rate, and temperature, but that&apos;s fairly rare. Otherwise, you&apos;re still getting the same sleep insights (depending on the brand).</p><p>Upgrade to a smartwatch, and you typically get an ECG to measure for atrial fibrillation (AFib); a few brands like Samsung, Google, Apple, and Fitbit passively measure for AFib as well, something we haven&apos;t seen in any smart rings yet. We hope that changes in the future, but given that most watch ECGs measure through your wrist <em>and</em> finger, they would probably remain more accurate.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch</a> specifically has a body composition sensor to determine body fat and muscle, plus a blood pressure sensor that unfortunately couldn&apos;t pass FDA approval for U.S. use. We&apos;ve seen a few smart ring Kickstarters in 2024 promising features like body composition and blood pressure, but we&apos;ll wait to see if any of these unproven brands can deliver on these promises accurately.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SWwUbxKG4Mu4RFkesBRxCd" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-vs-Oura-Ring-Gen-3-1.jpg" alt="RingConn Smart Ring and Oura Ring in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SWwUbxKG4Mu4RFkesBRxCd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Your typical smartwatch with apps and proper phone integration lasts anywhere from 18 hours (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a>) to 100 hours (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>). A (dumber) fitness watch or tracker with a more efficient CPU typically lasts 6–10 days, while brands like Garmin make bulkier watches that last two weeks or more per charge.</p><p>For smart rings, battery life varies from brand to brand, and sometimes, smaller ring sizes correspond with shorter battery life. Here are the battery life averages for a few popular smart rings:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Oura Ring Gen 3: </strong>Up to 7 days</li><li><strong>Amazfit Helio Ring: </strong>Up to 4 days</li><li><strong>Ultrahuman Ring Air:</strong> 4–6 days</li><li><strong>Circular Ring: </strong>Up to 5 days</li><li><strong>RingConn: </strong>Up to 7 days</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Ring: </strong>Up to 9 days (unconfirmed)</li></ul>
<p>Most smart rings last about as long as a budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness tracker</a>. They use small components with minute power demands, but they also only fit batteries with limited capacity. The Galaxy Ring, for example, reportedly has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-fcc-listing-cradle-specs-confirmed">17.5–22.5mAh capacity</a>, depending on the size, while a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> battery is 300–425mAh.</p><p>In theory, larger ring sizes (10+) may correspond with extra room for battery capacity, depending on the brand. The inverse is that people with smaller fingers may have to charge their rings more often.</p><p>Plus, we&apos;ve confirmed that smart rings generally take measurements less frequently than watches due to their limited capacity. This is less of a concern during sleep tracking but more of an issue during workouts where heart rate changes rapidly.</p><p>Ultrahuman estimates that its ring will maintain its battery life for "500 charging cycles" or about 1–2 years before experiencing "degradation." We assume that most smart rings will be similar, with slightly less than a week of charging out of the box and dipping downwards over time. But a one—or two-day smartwatch will have less leeway than a smart ring.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EEHM6ZV3AMdvqHkMw34ZgH" name="Oura-Ring-gen-3-workout-1.jpg" alt="Wearing the Oura Ring (Gen 3) while holding a barbell" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EEHM6ZV3AMdvqHkMw34ZgH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Is a smartwatch or smart ring more accurate for heart rate data? We spoke to a product manager for the Amazfit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-lands-in-us">Helio Ring</a>, who suggested that "the finger is the better location for PPG measuring because there&apos;s a denser network of blood vessels close to the skin surface, versus the wrist." </p><p>They also mentioned that "fingers are less mobile than the wrist," which could make it easier to keep your health readings consistent, but that it mostly depends on how well-fitted your smart ring or smartwatch is to your finger size or wrist, respectively. </p><p>On the other hand, your finger size can swell during workouts due to increased blood flow; that, in turn, can affect the accuracy of higher heart readings. And since a smart ring can&apos;t fit a GPS antenna, you&apos;re dependent on your phone; a smartwatch with dual-band GPS is more reliable.</p><p>A couple of rings, like the Oura Ring, have automatic workout/activity detection, registering whether you&apos;re running, biking, or completing other activities. Unfortunately, we&apos;ve noticed that smart rings have much more trouble tracking steps than smartwatches do. </p><p>In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">smartwatch step-counting tests</a>, they&apos;ll usually be off by about 50–200 steps after walking 5,000 steps, with a few false steps around the house. But a smart ring can over-count <em>thousands</em> of steps at home when your hands move while you sit or type; then, when you walk, they can sometimes underreport your steps.</p><p>This is why some people may want to wear a smart ring and smartwatch simultaneously. Amazfit says it will "de-dupe" your watch and ring data and then "choose the best data per our algorithms." So, if you have both, maybe your ring would provide the heart and sleep data, while your smartwatch would provide the step and workout data.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="heJKFV8NLSybhDoZebpWNM" name="circular-ring-photo.jpg" alt="Close-up of the Circular Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/heJKFV8NLSybhDoZebpWNM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Circular)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We can keep things short here: Smart rings don&apos;t have many traditional "smarts" outside of health, sleep, and fitness tracking. </p><p>You can&apos;t make phone calls or ask Google Assistant/Siri a question because they can&apos;t fit a mic or speaker. You can&apos;t check your notifications because a display on a smart ring would be barely readable (and look tacky as hell). </p><p>One smart ring brand (Circular) has a haptic motor that can buzz your finger as an alarm or to signal a notification; it&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-will-stay-niche-until-missing-features-added">missing smart ring features</a> that we hope becomes more popular. That way, people who use smartwatches for a vibrating wake-up call can switch to a ring for the same purpose.</p><p>Smart rings of the future might have a touchpad or rudimentary gesture controls that trigger an action from your phone, but it&apos;d be tricky to implement without a bunch of false-positive gestures or accidental taps.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-smart-ring-vs-smartwatch-comfort-and-style"><span>Smart ring vs. smartwatch: Comfort and style</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xqh9iSYteNyEm9Sqy79ZYN" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-review-23.jpg" alt="The RingConn Smart Ring on a hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xqh9iSYteNyEm9Sqy79ZYN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This point is fairly obvious but worth spelling out nonetheless: A smart ring weighs between 2–4 grams depending on the brand. A fitness tracker weighs about 20–30 grams, and the lightest models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-inspire-3-review">Fitbit Inspire 3</a> have tiny displays that are barely readable. Meanwhile, a smartwatch typically weighs about 40–80 grams, varying based on strap weight, materials, thickness, and display size.</p><p>Some people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">hate sleeping with a smartwatch</a> because of the distracting weight or feeling of it pressing into your wrist against your pillow. It can also be tricky finding the right fit, so it&apos;s not too loose for accurate readings or too tight to ignore. If any of that applies to you, a smart ring solves these problems because it&apos;s easy to forget at night and won&apos;t lose the seal around your finger if it&apos;s fitted properly.</p><p>That said, smart rings can be tricky for some,, depending on the fit, because your fingers can swell, and they can be uncomfortable or hard to take off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vMPRBuPqBEmv2StvX6UTHa" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-next-to-regular-ring.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air next to a typical ring to show its size, surrounded by other jewelry." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vMPRBuPqBEmv2StvX6UTHa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of style, smart rings are an acquired taste. Unlike your typical skinny, curved ring band, a smart ring band needs to be thick enough to fit all those sensors and wide enough to have enough contact with your skin for a proper reading. Most smart rings are made of lightweight, sturdy titanium and can come in black, gold, and/or silver.</p><p>Smartwatch designs vary too widely to paint with broad strokes. Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> take a "classic" circular watch design, but you still wouldn&apos;t mistake a smartwatch for a luxury watch unless you bought a simpler hybrid watch. Styles with stainless steel or titanium look classier but can be too heavy for some wrists.</p><p>We&apos;ve heard that some people find smart rings too thick to be attractive, whereas they can find a stylish smartwatch with a decent number of features. Other people prefer the subtlety of a smart ring so they can wear a non-smart watch that makes more of a fashion statement.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-smart-ring-vs-smartwatch-prices-and-subscriptions"><span>Smart ring vs. smartwatch: Prices and subscriptions</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3589px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="wGoKZDegpdeQkpNxAwUnFi" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-smartphone-app.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring (Gen 3) and the companion app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGoKZDegpdeQkpNxAwUnFi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3589" height="2019" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart rings are still in their early days, but they all tend to fall into a similar price range of $250–$400. Cheaper rings will lack basic features or reliability. That means they cost about the same as a flagship smartwatch, especially if you splurge for a fancier gold finish.</p><p>Most smart ring brands promise to provide their ring data subscription fee to compensate for the high entry price. The exception is Oura, which charges $5.99/month for most data and insights. That makes Oura slightly more affordable than Fitbit Premium, but it is still costly in the long run.</p><p>Smart rings can&apos;t replace most core smartwatch features. But if you don&apos;t <em>care</em> about notifications and just want health and sleep tracking that&apos;s more comfortable, then a smart ring is the way to go. Otherwise, we&apos;ll see if interconnected rings like the Samsung Galaxy Ring or Amazfit Helio Ring work well enough in tandem for fans of these brands to decide to buy both!</p>

They hinted that the device is lighter (239 grams) and said to have sharper corners, unlike the Galaxy Z Fold 5. The company could be using an "improved Aluminum frame" and will have a bigger 6.3-inch cover screen and the same 7.6-inch foldable screen. For the first time, the phone is said to come with IP48 dust and water resistance. The leak shows that the device will have a triple rear camera setup. Its primary lens will be 50MP, the ultrawide-angle camera will be 12MP, and the telephoto camera will be 10MP with optical zoom. The cover screen is said to have a 10MP selfie camera, and the foldable screen will have a 4MP under-display camera. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>&apos;s marketing images also ended up online in a blue colorway alongside its prominent specs. Design-wise, it looks a lot like its predecessor. According to recently leaked images, the phone&apos;s design includes a 3.4-inch cover screen and a 6.7-inch foldable screen. It could be powered by a larger 4000mAh battery capacity. </p><p>We expect the phone to have a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 camera, a 50MP primary lens, a 12MP secondary camera, and a 10MP selfie lens. Galaxy Z Flip 6 is also rumored to have an IP48 rating, and for the first time, a vapor chamber is expected to debut on this clamshell. </p><p><strong>Galaxy Buds Pro 3:</strong></p><p>If you thought it was just the foldables, another Reddit user who claimed to have bought the new Buds 3 Pro posted images of them on the platform. They sport the new stem design and showcase a Metallic grey finish and a charging case with a similar finish and translucent design at the top. They also sport blue and orange indicators for the left and right earbuds. Regarding performance, the Reddit user who bought the Buds 3 Pro, "Noise cancellation is on par with my AirPods Pro 1st gen. The sound is great, but a little higher on the bass, but I personally love the base. My Z Flip4 and iPhone pick them up, too. It&apos;s crazy how I was able to buy them."</p>

Hani Mohamed Bioud took to X, claiming that Google has already launched the device in the Algerian market, sharing an image of the phone in a pink phone. </p><p>Posting multiple pictures and videos, Bioud revealed that the device has 256GB of onboard storage and resembles multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">renders</a> we&apos;ve encountered earlier. It looks like the device features rounded corners but an overall square-ish design. The new camera visor has dual cameras in place with a matte finish, while the rest of the back has a glossy finish. The user only showed off the phone&apos;s design without turning on the screen. </p><p>Several people in the comments section had mixed reactions to the color, while most of them asked about other colorways that were spotted by the user and if the Pixel had an optical or ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. Bioud said he&apos;d be posting additional details about the device in the days to come.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-cuts-cheapest-ad-free-plan-for-some"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>It looks like Netflix is dropping its least expensive ad-free plan and pushing users to pay more than usual to access the platform without ads. According to several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1dsse4n/cant_finish_netflix_subscription/" target="_blank">Reddit posts</a>, Netflix&apos;s $11.99 ad-free plan will be discontinued for customers on July 13. They must choose between a $6.99 plan that streams ads versus a $15.49 ad-free plan or the $22.99 ad-free 4K. </p><p>The user&apos;s streaming is interrupted by a page that states their "basic plan has been discontinued" and that "you can change your plan at any time." Based on the Reddit complaints, it seems the streaming giant may first be testing out the updated offerings in the UK or Canada before expanding to other regions (including the U.S.).</p><p>This move doesn&apos;t come out of the blue, though.  Earlier this year, during its Q4 earnings call, Netflix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-teases-price-hike-2024-plan">publicly announced </a>that it had begun an effort to push customers to either more expensive or ad-supported plans.  "Scaling our ads business represents an opportunity to tap into significant new revenue and profit pools over the medium to longer term," Netflix said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/NEW-FINAL-Q4-23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf" target="_blank">statement</a>. </p>

According to Google&apos;s blog post, the update doesn&apos;t bring new features but bolsters the July security patch that helps keep your Pixel Watch secure. The update is available for both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch 1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, and it comes with software version <strong>TWD9.240705.001.A1</strong>.</p><p>Just a day after rolling out the above for its watches, Google dropped its monthly software update for Pixel phones powered by Android 14. The company notes in the blog post that Pixel phones ranging from Pixel 5a (5G) to Pixel 8a, along with the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet, will receive carrier bug fixes and improvements. Additionally, some devices can see general improvements to the camera stability "under certain conditions." The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> are said to get system stability and performance improvements along with an interface bug fix which addresses the back gesture navigation issue that wasn&apos;t working in certain scenarios. </p>

However, the Financial Times reports that YouTube is in talks with other record labels, such as Universal Music Group (UMG), Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Records, about a potential deal that would involve YouTube paying “lump sums of cash” for the right to use the labels’ songs for AI music training. YouTube told the Financial Times in a statement that it was “in conversations with labels about other experiments.” </p><p>And here&apos;s why it&apos;s a bad idea. According to our staff writer Brady Snyder, the record labels should back out since "it&apos;s impossible to put a price tag on creativity."</p><p>Synder adds, "Music generation tools can perform a few tricks, and they’re a great way for people who aren’t musically inclined to dabble with song creation. However, the current crop of tools has nothing to do with professional musicians."</p><p>"Most that are available today either rely on the likeness of popular singers or create something that pales in comparison to that which could be made by a human."</p>

Rumors have been swirling about the devices we&apos;ll likely see, and there will likely be quite a few launches during Unpacked, from yearly upgrades to an entirely new product from Samsung. This may be the most interesting Unpacked launch we&apos;ve seen in years.</p><p>The Unpacked event in January gave us a ring-sized surprise right before it ended and set folks off on a wild goose chase to figure out when the Galaxy Ring would release. After that, Samsung was bold enough to show off the ring at the MWC in Barcelona; however, in terms of specs, we didn&apos;t get a lot. This mid-year event will definitely launch the Galaxy Ring, among other rumored wearables like the Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch Ultra. </p><p>And that&apos;s not all; with the summer Unpacked event usually comes the company&apos;s own line-up of foldables, and this year, we&apos;re hoping to see the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy Z Flip 6. On the accessories side, there have been rumors that Samsung would launch the Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. </p><p>Let&apos;s dive into the leaks and rumors that cropped up about these devices. Here&apos;s a breakdown of what we expect to see and how you can tune into Samsung&apos;s Summer Unpacked. </p>

<p>The launch is set to take place on July 10 at 9 a.m. ET in Paris, France. While the guest list for the Summer Unpacked stays exclusive for the in-person event in Paris, Samsung will also have a livestream of the launch on its official website and YouTube platforms. The company has done this in the past, so it&apos;s really no surprise.</p><p>Samsung has already posted the video invite on the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung" target="_blank">official YouTube channel</a>, although we&apos;re still waiting for a live stream link, which should appear any day now. When it does go up, we&apos;ll be sure to link it here so you can set a reminder or hit on the "notify me" button to give yourself a heads-up before the live stream begins. Meanwhile, anyone interested can also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ca/unpacked/">sign up </a>for updates on the latest devices.</p><p>So what can we expect from this mid-year Unpacked event, and will Samsung&apos;s new offerings be just as exciting as the hype they’ve created around their wearables this year? </p>

<p>Samsung will likely fully launch its first smart ring at Unpacked. The company revealed at the MWC that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> will come in black, gold, or silver and could weigh between 2.3g to 3g, depending on your ring size. Leaked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-model-number-sizes-leak">Galaxy Ring ID numbers</a> suggest that it&apos;ll be available in sizes 5–13. </p><p>According to early patents of the device, the Galaxy Ring comes with an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure monitoring. While others show hints that the Galaxy Ring can be used as a controller for other devices, like the smartphone, tablet, or laptop. </p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-lawsuits-samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung&apos;s lawsuit against Oura</a> gave us a good look at some of the ring&apos;s core competencies. The company said that the ring will monitor heart rate, heart rate variability, blood oxygen, movement, and sleep "to provide users valuable insights and offer guidance to improve their health and wellbeing." Documents also note its intention to later include an "Energy score" in the app "based on multiple factors including sleep, activity, heart rate, and heart rate variability."</p><p>Samsung has also revealed that the device should come with up to nine days of battery life. </p><p>One of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-health-tracking-features-leak">most recent leaks</a> comes from an APK teardown that showed features like stress tracking, skin temperature measurement for period detection, and snore detection that were displayed on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-samsung-health-your-galaxy-phone">Samsung Health</a>, presumably after the ring was connected to the phone.</p>

<p>And how will this multifaceted device be charged you ask? A tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/Oji4m2Qqm?pagetype=viewer">Ice Universe</a> posted a supposed rendering of the Ring&apos;s charging case on Weibo and at first glance it looks a lot like a earbuds charging case. However once opened, the case comes with a "cradle" to hold your ring inside it.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve recently been bombarded with leaks of the expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6#section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-wishlist">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6,</a> which gives us a fair picture (pun intended) of what those foldables would look like. There might not be many changes to this year&apos;s edition, but some upgrades are worth checking out. It is obvious that these new foldables will be bolstered with all things <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>. But first, let&apos;s get into the specs.</p><p><strong>Galaxy Z Fold 6:</strong></p><p>A set of marketing images <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-galaxy-z-flip-6-full-specs-leak">leaked</a> on Thursday (July 4), giving us a glimpse of the Galaxy Z Fold 6. They confirmed the device is lighter (239 grams) and said to have sharper corners, which is a bit of a departure from the Galaxy Z Fold 5. The company could be using an "improved Aluminum frame" and will have a bigger 6.3-inch cover screen and the same 7.6-inch foldable screen. For the first time, the phone is said to come with IP48 dust and water resistance.</p><p>Looks like the device will have a triple rear camera setup. Its primary lens will be 50MP, the ultrawide-angle camera will be 12MP, and the telephoto camera will be 10MP with optical zoom. The cover screen is said to have a 10MP selfie camera, and the foldable screen will have a 4MP under-display camera. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 will likely be powered by Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-snapdragon-8-gen-3-for-galaxy">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy</a>. Several other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-s-flip-6-colorways-leak-again">leaks</a> have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6-storage-color-options-leak">spoiled</a> the color options, which are said to be navy, pink, silver shadow, and white.</p><p>However, we have little to no information about the device&apos;s charging speeds; we assume it could come with the same 25W wired charger and 4400mAh battery. We&apos;re also hoping to see some S-pen enhancements and reduced visibility of the crease in the new version.</p><p><strong>Galaxy Z Flip 6: </strong></p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>&apos;s marketing material also reveals the clamshell phone in a blue colorway alongside its prominent specs. Design-wise, it looks a lot like its predecessor. According to recently leaked images, the phone&apos;s design includes a 3.4-inch cover screen and a 6.7-inch foldable screen. It could be powered by a larger 4000mAh battery capacity. </p><p>We expect the phone to have a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> series, and in terms of camera, an upgraded 50MP primary lens, 12MP secondary camera, and 10MP selfie lens. Galaxy Z Flip 6 is also rumored to have an IP48 rating, and for the first time, a vapor chamber is expected to debut on this clamshell. </p><p>With this year&apos;s flip, we hope to see better battery life and displays with higher refresh rates, such as 144Hz or even 165Hz. </p>

<p>Samsung is expected to unveil the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">According to several leaks,</a> the Galaxy Watch 7 will likely come in two sizes: 40mm (1.3 inches) and 44mm (1.5 inches), like the previous model. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-watch-7-spec-sheet-leak">Galaxy Watch 7 specs leak</a> states that the Watch 7 will have 1.3- and 1.5-inch display options, while the Watch Ultra will have a single 1.5-inch display with 480x480 resolution. Regarding the performance of  Galaxy Watch 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1748139565133496357" target="_blank">Tipster Roland Quandt</a> said that the watch could be powered by  an internal name of "Exynos 5535," although more recently, the Dealabs leak indicated both the Ultra and Watch 7 would have an "Exynos W1000 chipset with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage."  The Galaxy Watch 7 will launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/first-one-ui-6-watch-beta-hits-us-galaxy-watches">One UI Watch 6</a>.</p><p>Like previous generations, the Watch 7 could sport a BioActive sensor for heart rate, ECG, blood oxygen, temperature, and body composition readings. One feature that we are excited to explore is Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">sleep apnea detection</a>, which could likely show up on the new watch. </p>

<p>When it comes to the Watch Ultra, we&apos;ve come across <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">one major leak</a> from Steve Hemmerstoffer, aka OnLeaks. It shows the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra from all sides, sporting a new design—with rounded-off square corners and a circular display etched into the square chassis. This version could have a display measuring 1.5 inches in diameter and an additional third button on the side, along with the two buttons we saw in previous Samsung smartwatches.</p><p>The leaked images show a circular array of health sensors, including a temperature sensor at the rear and two buttons next to the sensor array, which could help detach the watch bands. One thing that popped up in the images is a new large speaker grill placed at the left pane of the smartwatch— giving major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a> vibes.</p>
<h2 id="xa0-galaxy-buds-3-and-pro-2"> Galaxy Buds 3 and Pro</h2>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1dvg597/galaxy_buds3_pro">Galaxy Buds3 Pro</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds">r/galaxybuds</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Samsung is set to drop the new-gen earbuds—Buds 3 and 3 Pro—at this year&apos;s summer Unpacked. We speculate that they will look a lot like Apple&apos;s AirPods, rocking a long stem, unlike the rounded design in previous generations, with a wingtip for stabilization. Other leaks reveal that the Buds 3 might lack the silicone tip to help it sit comfortably inside an ear. The long stem could help with better call quality with the positioning of the microphone, and new long-pressing gestures are expected to control the music playback, activate noise cancellation, and much more.</p><p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro also sport the new stem design, which is now evident in the real-life images shared by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1dvg597/galaxy_buds3_pro/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a> who purchased them. They showcase the buds in a Metallic grey finish and a charging case with a similar finish and translucent design at the top. The Buds 3 Pro seen in the images look identical to each other and have the usual silicone tip for in-ear use. They also sport blue and orange indicators for the left and right earbuds. </p><p>Not much has been revealed about the sound quality and battery life of these new earbuds. However, according to the Reddit user who bought the Buds 3 Pro, "Noise cancellation is on par with my AirPods Pro 1st gen. The sound is great, but a little higher on the bass, but I personally love the base. My Z Flip4 and iPhone pick them up, too. It&apos;s crazy how I was able to buy them."</p>

<p>We know the headline is a bit odd, but we thought we should bring your attention to one device that could&apos;ve been released with the usual Samsung foldables this year—<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung XR Headset</a>—currently a nameless product but has been called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses-trademark-approval-spotted">Samsung Glasses</a>. The company was allegedly planning something a bit different for its debut; however, a few setbacks delayed its release.  </p><p>All we know is that Samsung glasses are still in the early development stages and are looking for stable software like Google to power them. According to a Business Insider report on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ar-glasses-problems-behind-scenes">Google&apos;s current XR plans</a>, Google has access to Samsung&apos;s headset in order to develop software for it; it allegedly calls the headset "Project Moohan."</p><p>Another thing to note is that Samsung wants to make its XR device more affordable— <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsungs-apple-vision-pro-competitor-price-rumor">to be one-third the price</a> of the Vision Pro might cost around $1,000. While it may be long before we can get our hands on the company&apos;s XR headset, we hope that Samsung will use a robust XR chip like the Snapdragon X Elite that could go up against Apple Vision Pro. It needs to have a strong battery life that could last longer than 2 hours, and hopefully, it should have motion controllers to go with the headset for an optimal gaming experience.</p>

<hr>
<p>Xiaomi&apos;s Mix Fold 4 is reportedly on the way, and a well-known tipster suggests this new foldable will be hitting global markets, unlike its predecessors.</p><p>Xiaomi&apos;s previous foldable smartphones have been limited to the Chinese market, but that might be changing soon. According to reliable leaker Ice Universe, we could see a global launch for the upcoming Mix Fold 4. There&apos;s also buzz that it might debut alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-teaser-suggests-it-could-shake-things-up-for-foldables">Honor Magic V3</a>, with a potential release date of July 12.</p>

<p>Even if the Mix Fold 3 and the models that came before it were only available in China, it proved to be a strong contender against foldable phones from Samsung, Google, and Motorola. With a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor and up to 1TB of storage, among other premium features, the Mix Fold 3 showed that Xiaomi could compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> worldwide.</p><p>The Mix Fold 4 is expected to be a powerhouse as well, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-mix-fold-4-specs-leak">earlier leaks claiming it will include 16GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor</a>.</p><p>Details about the Mix Fold 4&apos;s design have also leaked. The leaker claims that it will feature an incredibly thin profile, possibly making it the slimmest foldable phone on the market.</p><p>Currently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Honor Magic V2</a> leads the pack with a 9.9mm profile. But rumors hint that the upcoming Magic V3 could be even thinner, possibly dipping below 9mm, according to Ice Universe. However, it&apos;s worth noting that Honor&apos;s foldables have traditionally been exclusive to China.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> is quite chunky at 13.4mm. In comparison, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1775426146185957436" target="_blank">leak</a> from earlier this year suggested that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> would slim down to 12.1mm when folded. However, when unfolded, it might be just 5.6mm thick.</p><p>When it comes to foldable phones, everyone has their own preference, but if you love a sleek design, the Mix Fold 4 might catch your eye. With rumors of it being the thinnest yet, it’s shaping up to be a frontrunner in the ultra-slim foldable market.</p><p>The Mix Fold 4’s supposed ultra-thin design is pretty fascinating.

RingConn is one of those companies hoping to bank off the growing popularity of smart rings, and it seems like it might be able to pull it off.</p><p>The RingConn Smart Ring isn&apos;t the fanciest-looking smart ring around, but it has plenty going on under the hood, bringing a bevy of health tracking features, a fun and functional app, and long battery life that rivals even the Oura Ring Gen 3. But that&apos;s not even the best part, and that&apos;s why the RingConn Smart Ring could be your next (or first) smart ring.</p>

<p>The RingConn Smart Ring retails for $279, making it cheaper than the Oura Ring Gen 3. In addition to the lower price, there is also no subscription needed to access your health insights, which is a major advantage for RingConn Smart Ring owners.</p><p>The ring comes in multiple sizes ranging from 6 to 14, so there should be a size available for most people. It&apos;s also available in three different colors: Moonlit Silver, Midnight Black, and Pale Gold.</p><p>At the time of writing, RingConn is offering a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D148MTWT/">$50 discount</a> on the smart ring through July 10, bringing it down to an even more affordable price tag. The ring can be purchased directly from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ringconn.com/?ref=NOAHGRETSCH&utm_source=website&utm_medium=NOAHGRETSCH&utm_campaign=PR">RingConn&apos;s website</a> or through Amazon.com.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Cg5Rs8fE5qq58tVmfaCTrJ" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-review-18.jpg" alt="The RingConn Smart Ring on a phone with the app open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cg5Rs8fE5qq58tVmfaCTrJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;ve been paying attention to the current smart ring offerings, then you&apos;ll notice that the RingConn Smart Ring has a fairly unique design. Instead of a typical circle, you get a squircle design with a very matte finish, making for a unique but subtle-looking ring. While it doesn&apos;t look as premium as some other smart rings, I actually like the design, as it makes it stand out in a sea of circles. The ring is also not too thick or heavy, measuring just 2.6mm and weighing between 3-5g, depending on the size.</p><p>The ring fits comfortably on my index finger despite the inside being mostly circular, save for a flat bottom where the sensors are. This is really the only way you can tell which side is the right side up, whereas other rings often have some type of divot or design indicator. That said, I don&apos;t seem to have trouble with the ring moving around much on my finger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xqh9iSYteNyEm9Sqy79ZYN" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-review-23.jpg" alt="The RingConn Smart Ring on a hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xqh9iSYteNyEm9Sqy79ZYN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Setting up the ring took no time at all, and the app layout is pretty straightforward, with three tabs at the bottom for Insights, Trends, and a Me tab for managing your profile and the ring settings. The UI may appear a little busy to some, especially on the Insights tab, but the information is laid out pretty well, so you know what you&apos;re looking at. One interesting aspect of the app is the Wellness Balance, which is a beta feature that consolidates your data onto a graph. Not only is it a nice visual way to see what area you&apos;re lacking in, but it will also compare the data to the previous day&apos;s graph so you can see how you&apos;ve progressed.</p><p>Under the graph, you can view quick tips on how to improve your wellness, or you can tap the tile for more in-depth insights on each metric: Sleep, Activity, Stress Management, and Vital Signs. This pulls up a simplistic view with tips on where you can improve, but if you want a deeper look at your sleep, for instance, each of these metrics also has its own individual tile on the Insights tab. You&apos;ll be able to view data such as your sleep stages, skin temperature, blood oxygen saturation, stress index, steps, calories, and more by digging into each tile. And in case some information is more important to you than others, you can rearrange the view inside each tile or even hide some data if you don&apos;t want to see your Standing duration, for example.</p><p>The Insights tab also has a nifty Health Timeline, which I think is a great way to view your activity throughout the day. It gives you a quick view of your sleep schedule, when you hit certain calorie goals when you might need to relax, and when you do certain activities.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3340px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.04%;"><img id="E9dbYv7vrqu54s4qBDNwHB" name="RingConn-app-insights-sleep-health-timeline.jpg" alt="Screenshots from the RingConn app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E9dbYv7vrqu54s4qBDNwHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3340" height="2640" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of activities, there&apos;s an FAB on this tab that lets you quickly jump into workout tracking and select between a few exercise modes. RingConn Smart Ring is able to manually track running and cycling, with more on the way.</p><p>When it comes to accuracy, I find that the step counter can be a bit off, which is often the case for smart rings. On some days, it will overestimate the number of steps I&apos;ve taken by quite a bit, especially when compared to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a>, while on other days, it will come up short. This is to be expected, as devices tend to have different levels of sensitivity, and you&apos;d be hard-pressed to find a wearable that will get this 100% correct.</p><p>That said, heart rate readings seem to be on par with my other devices, like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a>, and sleep tracking has been quite accurate, closely matching my other devices when it comes to determining my sleep stages, duration, and vitals.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The step counter may not be the most accurate, but the RingConn Smart Ring does a good job tracking things like sleep.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It&apos;s worth noting that the RingConn Smart Ring also features menstrual prediction, which uses temperature readings and other information to help you determine the date of your next period, although this is not something I could test myself.</p><p>I really like that the RingConn app for Android features a series of widgets that allow you to view your vitals, health scores, and battery life straight from your home screen.</p><p>The RingConn app will also reward you with badges based on certain metrics you hit or for wearing the ring for a certain amount of time. Honestly, it&apos;s a pretty fun way to turn wearing your smart ring into a game, and you&apos;re even able to go into each badge to see how you&apos;re able to level it up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JKyKmW34LGfuoDayagoMek" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-review-19.jpg" alt="RingConn Smart Ring app widgets on a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JKyKmW34LGfuoDayagoMek.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Charging the ring is pretty unique compared to most others. It comes with a charging cradle, which is pretty nice as it allows you to pack it up and take it with you, charging the ring as you go. That said, you may not even have to resort to that, as the battery life on the RingConn Smart Ring is pretty incredible, rivaling even the Oura Ring. I&apos;ve been able to get an average of seven full days out of the ring, which is pretty impressive. I didn&apos;t even bother taking the charging cradle with me when preparing for a short trip. Days into wearing the ring, I was able to leave for the trip and come back a few days after that without worrying that it was going to die.</p><p>The best part about all of this is that the data is available to me without requiring a subscription. Oura offers very useful insights and plenty of features, but you have to pay $5.99 per month for its most useful features, which is a bit of an ask on top of the $299 starting price. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4214px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NQGZxWR4qJHk7ft6nnrgyQ" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-review-16.jpg" alt="The RingConn Smart Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NQGZxWR4qJHk7ft6nnrgyQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4214" height="2370" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The RingConn Smart Ring has a lot going for it, but it&apos;s not all roses. As a health tracking device, the ring isn&apos;t much of a fitness wearable, and therefor its fitness tracking capabilities are limited. For example, the exercise tracking feature is still only in beta and is quite limited at the moment. You can manually track outdoor or indoor runs, outdoor cycling, and outdoor walking, although RingConn says it&apos;s "working to develop more diverse sports modes."</p><p>This is pretty much par for the course when it comes to smart rings, although it would be nice to see RingConn add some automatic tracking for things like walking, running, etc. That&apos;s one of the best things about the Oura Ring; after an activity, the app will either automatically log a recognized activity (of which there are a surprising amount) or it will ping me to ask if I was doing a specific activity like walking, running, dancing, etc.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SWwUbxKG4Mu4RFkesBRxCd" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-vs-Oura-Ring-Gen-3-1.jpg" alt="RingConn Smart Ring and Oura Ring in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SWwUbxKG4Mu4RFkesBRxCd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another downside is that despite all the vitals the ring tracks, RingConn only supports syncing with Google Fit and not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a>. Fortunately, the Fit app connects to Health Connect, but I would like more granular control over what data is being synced across devices, as well as the ability to better sync data from my watch to the ring and vice versa.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The RingConn Smart Ring's Bluetooth connection can be hit or miss, and you'll have to wait for that connection to stabilize before getting your data,</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Of course, that&apos;s dependent on if/when the ring decides to sync. For some reason, it seems as though the ring won&apos;t automatically sync data in the background, and the app won&apos;t actually update my metrics until after I open the app. And even then, sometimes, it will take quite a while for the ring to actually connect to my phone. I&apos;ll often have to turn Bluetooth off and on again to force the ring to connect.</p><p>Then there are notifications. It&apos;s not a huge deal, but I wish the RingConn Smart Ring would bother me more often. Sure, it supports inactive alerts, but I would like to see bedtime reminders or get notified when I get a badge or when a new activity/entry is added to my health Health Timeline. One of the benefits of having a smart ring over a smartwatch is that there&apos;s no screen to bother me, but that&apos;s also a bit of a downside when you don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on or what the ring is logging.</p><p>Oh, and there isn&apos;t an in-app method for locating the ring in case you misplace it, which, speaking from experience, is a useful feature that I&apos;m sure some users would appreciate.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ringconn-smart-ring-competition"><span>RingConn Smart Ring: Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9szTm994H89RsmcghQJdo" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-vs-Oura-Ring-Gen-3-2.jpg" alt="The RingConn Smart Ring and Oura Ring Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9szTm994H89RsmcghQJdo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest and most obvious competitor is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a>, which was launched in 2021 and remains the most popular smart ring. Both feature lightweight designs, although Oura has more styles and a lead when it comes to features. However, the Oura&apos;s subscription may deter some, and it makes the RingConn Smart Ring look much more attractive since you get plenty of health tracking <em>and</em> insights without the added cost.</p><p>Another smart ring worth considering is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>. This is another ring that has plenty of useful data and insights, particularly around sleep. There&apos;s no subscription, which is a big plus, and the ring has impressive battery life. That said, despite the lack of a required subscription, the ring costs much more than both the RingConn Smart Ring and the cheapest Oura Ring style, so the upfront cost might make you look elsewhere.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ringconn-smart-ring-should-you-buy-it"><span>RingConn Smart Ring: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JLEY82zQrufU5e3wGQSZX6" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-review-13.jpg" alt="RingConn Smart Ring in the charging cradle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JLEY82zQrufU5e3wGQSZX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want helpful insights on your health and wellness.</li><li>You don't like wearing a smartwatch to bed.</li><li>You're looking for a cheaper Oura Ring alternative.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a smart ring for fitness tracking.</li><li>You want a wearable with a reliable connection.</li><li>You prefer to use Health Connect to manage your data across devices.</li></ul>
<p>RingConn was one of the first Oura Ring competitors that I became aware of, and I was always curious about how its smart ring would compare. Would it just be a cheap knockoff to the device that basically started the smart ring frenzy? Well, yes, but I mean that in the best way possible.</p><p>The RingConn Smart Ring is a well-thought-out wearable that has plenty going for it. The health tracking feels about on par with Oura, and the app has an easy-to-use layout that offers plenty of insights into your health and wellness, all without charging you more for the privilege of actually viewing that data. It&apos;s a good-looking ring, to boot, and battery life is phenomenal.</p><p>Sure, some features aren&apos;t as fleshed out as I would like them to be, but the Oura Ring Gen 3 was very much in that position following its launch, promising many features that wouldn&apos;t arrive until later. That&apos;s what it feels like with the RingConn Smart Ring, although it&apos;s at a pretty good place right now, and there&apos;s clearly more on the horizon to look forward to.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for a more affordable alternative to the Oura Ring, this is probably your best bet.</p>

<ul><li>Evidence shows that Google has continued to progress in the development of e-passports in the Wallet app.</li><li>The company explains that an ID pass created from your passport can be used at "select" airline checkpoints, but it is not to be seen as the replacement for the physical version.</li><li>Digital passports in Wallet will arrive as U.S. exclusives and can work through NFC and QR codes for domestic flights.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is preparing to bring digital convenience to our passports, however, it might be wise to carry its physical form still.</p><p>Prominent X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1808827267893612649">AssembleDebug </a>recently posted a screenshot of the upcoming feature through Google Wallet (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-wallet-support-digital-passport/">Android Police</a>). The tagline for the function reads, "create an ID pass with your passport." The feature seems closer to release now, with the photo stating that e-passports will be restricted to U.S. users. </p><p>The tipster then referenced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-wallet-e-passport-support-3444362/">a previous post</a>, highlighting some of the functionality users can expect.</p><p>As spotted in a previous beta, the company stated that an ID pass created for a passport would let users verify their "identity for domestic flights at select airline security checkpoints or online purchases."</p><p>More digging showed that users could tap their phone&apos;s reader (NFC), or the authorities could scan the passport&apos;s generated QR code. Moreover, Google will have some safety rails in place, such as personal authentication before sharing information.</p><p>The beta showed that users will have a chance to "review" any information that&apos;s been requested of them. Also, another layer of security will prompt users to verify their identity by entering a previously set fingerprint, PIN, or password.</p><p>While Google Wallet is preparing to incorporate digital passports, it would be a time saver, but it&apos;s not all sunshine. Even now, the company is still urging users to carry their physical passports with them as this digital variant isn&apos;t a replacement. This is likely due to the "select TSA checkpoint" caveat.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here is a screenshot for the upcoming passport support in the Google Wallet. This is going to be a US only feature. https://t.co/lhXdqLeAcp pic.twitter.com/PiEgjOkfAh<a href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1808827267893612649">July 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>With Google Wallet&apos;s development continuing, it seems likely that e-passport support in the U.S. will roll out sooner rather than later.</p><p>In other news, the company rolled out a feature that lets users double their Android phone as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/your-android-phone-can-now-double-as-a-hotel-room-key-thanks-to-google-wallet">a hotel room key</a>. Participating hotels will let users add their room key to their Wallet via their app or website. The good thing here is that the addition of digital room keys means there&apos;s less chance you misplace them.</p><p>Moreover, the digital version piggybacks off your phone&apos;s NFC for an easy "tap to open" experience. Support for this feature is set to arrive first for The Clarion Hotel Post in Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>

Grab the wonderfully-balanced Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus, for instance, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-s24-256gb-unlocked-marble-gray/6570273.p"><strong>you&apos;ll score a $200 discount</strong></a> when you activate today. Purchase the phone unlocked instead and you&apos;ll still enjoy $100 off, which is a stellar deal in its own right. </p><p>No trade-in is required to take part in the offer, although if you <em>do</em> have an old device to send to Best Buy, up to $600 of trade-in credit is currently available.</p>

<p>Pick up the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus</a> from Best Buy this weekend and you'll score $200 off the phone when you activate today. If you prefer to buy your smartphones unlocked, skip the activation for now and you'll get a $100 discount, which is pretty darn good for a flagship device that's only been out for about six months. </p>
<p>The middle-child in Samsung's S24 series, the Galaxy S24 Plus boasts all-day battery life, the powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, and a compact, nearly bezel-less design that reminds us of recent iPhones. You also get seven years of OS support guaranteed and all of Samsung's latest AI-powered software features. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-s24-256gb-unlocked-marble-gray/6570273.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ced49287-33ce-4c68-94f2-408505d8ca2c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus 256GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus 256GB: $999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<ul><li><a href="https://howl.link/d4ex1o8mjix8w"><strong>Galaxy Reserve: $50 OFF Samsung's new phones before they're announced</strong></a></li></ul>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you like to buy your smartphones through retailers like Best Buy; you don&apos;t want to wait until Prime Day to purchase your new phone; you want the physical feel of an iPhone with the OS of an Android; battery life is important to you. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you can wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-android-phone-deals-2024">best Prime Day phone deals</a> to go live; you have an old device to trade in and belong to a mainstream wireless carrier like Verizon or AT&T. </p><p>Indeed, Amazon&apos;s Prime Day 2024 is set to kick off on July 16th, and the Samsung Galaxy S24 series is almost certain to receive some major discounts during the 48-hour sale. In other words, if you can wait a few more weeks to buy your phone, it may be worth it. It&apos;s also worth mentioning that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/you-can-score-dollar50-off-samsungs-newest-galaxy-devices-before-theyre-even-announced-heres-the-deal">Galaxy Unpacked</a> is July 10th and we expect that Samsung will reveal its latest lineup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> at the announcement event, so if you have the extra cash and you&apos;re interested in those innovative devices, we&apos;d recommend waiting for that too. </p><p>But with that being said, if you simply want a great phone at a great price <em>today</em>, this deal from Best Buy presents an awesome opportunity. </p>

<p>The year is already more than halfway over, and with that, we&apos;re nearing the launch of Samsung&apos;s latest foldable phones. Here in the States, Samsung continues to reign supreme with the Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip lineup, even with Motorola and OnePlus providing some pretty tempting alternatives. The Galaxy Z Fold 5 has been on the market for nearly a year, offering welcome improvements over its predecessors. Yet, as plenty more foldables reach consumers, the Z Fold 5 remains one of our favorites.</p><p>As we near the presumed launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, we thought it would be a good time to reflect on how the past year with the Fold 5 has gone.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-design-and-displays-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5: Design and displays</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HLFPHPFELbhJrMTQGpgmjU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-flex-hinge-01.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 in flex mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HLFPHPFELbhJrMTQGpgmjU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p><em><strong>"From a surface level, the Fold 5 looks identical to the Fold 4. That quickly changes the moment you hold its thinner, lighter chassis though. It&apos;s clear this form factor is the best design on the market at the moment, even with the weird aspect ratio."</strong></em></p><p>There are a lot of reasons for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> being as divisive as it is. Arguably, the biggest reason is the overall design, with the cover screen being about as long and barely wider than a King Size Snickers bar. The screen itself is about as good as it gets, with its 120Hz variable refresh and peak brightness of 1,750 nits.</p><p>However, it&apos;s quite a bit more narrow than practically any other smartphone out there, let alone the best foldable phones. It&apos;s something that I&apos;ve flip-flopped between, seeing as it&apos;s perfect for one-handed usage or doom-scrolling social media.</p><p>It&apos;s even <em>fine</em> for responding to messages or emails in a pinch. However, the moment that you want to try and do <em>anything</em> else, you&apos;ll either think twice or need to unfold it to reveal the inner screen. It&apos;s a stark contrast to the way of thinking when using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and its Cover Screen that is more like a phone on its own.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="v4pUVoVtSGfAnwgioj8ceD" name="standby-mode-pro-picture-frame-galaxy-z-fold-5.jpg" alt="Picture frame in StandBy Mode Pro on Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v4pUVoVtSGfAnwgioj8ceD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After swapping between the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the OnePlus Open for the past nine months, I think I&apos;ve settled on wanting something in the middle. A Cover Screen that&apos;s still great for one-handed usage but is wide enough to do anything besides the most basic of tasks.</p><p>As for the inner screen, my biggest complaint remains the fact that Samsung&apos;s display is looking a bit outdated. It&apos;s not as bad as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>, but after using the OnePlus Open, it&apos;s clear that Samsung has some work to do. Not to mention the improvements that Vivo and others have been making to reduce the crease.</p><p>It&apos;s one thing when you&apos;re using the inner screen just to browse the web, watch a movie, or read a book. However, I&apos;ve actually stopped reaching for my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/slim-s-pen-case-for-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">S Pen</a> as much simply because I feel as though I have to use it on one half of the screen or the other. Trying to split the uprights results in just hopping over it all together to avoid even touching the crease.</p>
<p><em><strong>"This display is simultaneously more vision-friendly thanks to the addition of more accessibility options, but folks sensitive to flickering lights or displays will have an even harder time using this due to the slow flicker rate and high brightness."</strong></em></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="oE56wGsY3j2wZiv48pLTnU" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-display-flicker.gif" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5's flickering AMOLED display captured at high speed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oE56wGsY3j2wZiv48pLTnU.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM issues</a> don&apos;t affect me when it comes to using different types of displays, that&apos;s not the case for everyone. My colleague Nick Sutrich has done an absolutely phenomenal job at shedding light on this problem.</p><p>So, while Samsung might be able to tout that the Galaxy Z Fold 5 has one of the best displays, some of its potential customers can&apos;t even look at them. Unfortunately, this is the category that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pwm-flickering-displays-bothering-our-readers">Nick falls into</a>, as using certain screens for just minutes results in him feeling nauseous, leaving him with a splitting headache, or both.</p><p>The reason why I call this out is that despite his own attempts to find answers, he&apos;s largely been left "on read." It wasn&apos;t until recently that phone makers even started mentioning PWM rates. However, Samsung is not one of them, and from where I stand, it sure seems like these companies don&apos;t care. Instead, it feels as though companies are okay with losing a sliver of their potential customer base as opposed to actually solving the problem.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-performance-and-battery-life-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5: Performance and battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jPB3b9G8hSure3eoBaYqNJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-gamesir-x2-minecraft-02.jpg" alt="Playing Minecraft on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 using a GameSir X2 controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jPB3b9G8hSure3eoBaYqNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"Samsung absolutely nailed both battery life and performance with this phone. It easily lasts into the second day on a single charge and the performance never falters, even when playing graphically-intense games for long periods of time. Plus, it doesn&apos;t even get hot."</strong></em></p><p>What more can you really ask for when it comes to a device that&apos;s as fast and as powerful as pretty much anything else? Although the software section comes next, it&apos;s not like we&apos;re stuck in the TouchWiz days when every update would result in tremendous slowdowns.</p><p>To me, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 is as fast and fluid today as it was when it first arrived in my mailbox. It&apos;s more than capable when it comes to mobile gaming, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">Nintendo Switch</a> and PS2 emulation. And when paired with a controller like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/razer-kishi-ultra-launch">Razer Kishi Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-galileo-review">GameSir G8 Galileo</a>, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 is the "Super Switch" we&apos;ve been hoping for.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="k7SEZeXCXPuacfncTqQGgB" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-cover-screen-in-tree.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 Cover Screen in tree" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k7SEZeXCXPuacfncTqQGgB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>On the flip side, I can&apos;t say the same about the battery. Although my day-to-day life is much different compared to when the Galaxy Z Fold 5 was released, it&apos;s almost impossible to make it through an entire day. For reference, my day begins between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m., and I&apos;m usually not in bed until around 1 a.m.</p><p>That&apos;s a long day, for sure, and it&apos;s probably asking too much for a phone to be able to keep up with my needs. But I find myself needing to make decisions about <em>what</em> I want to do on my phone. Other times, I&apos;ll go to turn on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-light-bulb">smart lights</a> in my bedroom only to find that it&apos;s just given up the goose for the day.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-software-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5: Software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mzWSS4RQpSQwKaDMhRJggJ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-split-screen-alt.jpg" alt="Split-screen multitasking on Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mzWSS4RQpSQwKaDMhRJggJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"No company makes better foldable phone software than Samsung. Even with the handful of small improvements this year, Samsung is miles ahead of the competition."</strong></em></p><p>I can&apos;t help but feel that Nick&apos;s sentiments couldn&apos;t be summed up any better. Even after spending a lot of time with the OnePlus Open, there&apos;s just something that "clicks" with the Fold 5. The multitasking interface works more in line with how my brain works.</p><p>While Google continues to work on its own desktop-like interface, I have little doubt that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX </a>will remain supreme for a while. Really, the only thing that could change that is Samsung itself, as it&apos;s already been tinkering with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">DeX on tablets</a>. I&apos;m just hoping to see DeX left alone, giving people the option to use it as an all-in-one computing device.</p><p>My only real gripe in this department is rather mundane. I just wish Samsung would bake the "Theme Park" plugin from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> into OneUI. Then, make it so icon packs automatically update whenever a new app is installed. All in an effort to get rid of the "squircle" icon that seems to be the inspiration for the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-watch-7-spec-sheet-leak">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="m2Kcau6uMkxdqAt6SSqgVU" name="Galaxy-ai-is-here.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m2Kcau6uMkxdqAt6SSqgVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This brings me to the subject of software and feature updates for Samsung&apos;s flagship foldable. Google and Samsung are pretty much neck-and-neck when it comes to releasing regular updates for their devices, and the Galaxy Z Fold 5 has been no different.</p><p>The bigger question came following the Galaxy S24 Ultra launch, complete with Samsung&apos;s new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>" feature set. Not every feature from the Ultra has come to the Fold 5, simply due to the lack of the NPU paired with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy</a>.</p><p>However, One UI 6.1 brought a bunch of new features, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">Generative Edit</a>, Instant Slow-Mo, Note Assist, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Google&apos;s Circle to Search</a>, and more. All of these features are cloud-based, ensuring that Fold 5 owners don&apos;t miss out on too much. So while a few features are still limited to the Galaxy S24, that likely won&apos;t be the case with the Galaxy Z Fold 6. At least, we hope. </p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WqcczAXyQhrxxxbY5dSbH9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-camera-viewfinder-01.jpg" alt="Taking a photo with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5's telephoto camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WqcczAXyQhrxxxbY5dSbH9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"The Galaxy Z Fold 5&apos;s camera has been marginally improved over the Z Fold 4&apos;s, but the improvements just don&apos;t feel like enough for an $1,800 phone in 2023. Thankfully, video recording quality is excellent and overall photo quality still feels good enough in most cases."</strong></em></p><p>There&apos;s nothing inherently wrong with the cameras on the Galaxy Z Fold 5. They produce solid images, provided that the conditions are right or you&apos;re okay with using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-shoot-and-edit-raw-photos-your-android-phone">Expert RAW</a> app. Many of the same features found in other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> are also found here. And following the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>, even more features are trickling down.</p><p>Both the inner and outer selfie cameras are <em>fine</em>, and get the job done, as long as you only want to snap a quick selfie. You can pretty much say the same thing about the rear camera setup.</p><p>But if you&apos;re even halfway serious about photography, why would you spend more money to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 5 over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>? The former <em>starts</em> at $1,799 and only includes 256GB of storage. Meanwhile, if you max out the latter, you&apos;ll enjoy 1TB of storage, save yourself $140, AND have arguably the best cameras in a smartphone (at least here in the States.)</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ANQEisVLvjhTUh3jRGUWU6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-camera-viewfinder-flex-mode.jpg" alt="The camera viewfinder on the outer display of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ANQEisVLvjhTUh3jRGUWU6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only conclusion that I can come to for getting the Galaxy Z Fold 5 is being able to use it without a tripod. As long as you have a level surface, the Fold 5 doubles as its own tripod.</p><p>On a recent family trip, we wanted to take a group picture before we left the rental property. I tried using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, but as soon as I thought it was steady and level, the phone started to fall. Despite having an inferior camera, I grabbed my Fold 5, propped it open, set a timer, and jumped into the frame. It didn&apos;t fall, and I could easily get everything set up thanks to the split-pane interface in the Camera app.</p><p>It wasn&apos;t a picture that was going to win any awards, but it offered a level of convenience that you just can&apos;t find on slab phones. The bigger problem arises in those times when you want a crisp and detailed photo, only to find that part of the picture gets blown out on the Fold 5 when that wouldn&apos;t be the case on the iPhone or Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-is-it-still-worth-buying-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5: Is it still worth buying?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="HbrWKsJ9CzXy7nUPdvDKsG" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-on-patio.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 folded on patio ledge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HbrWKsJ9CzXy7nUPdvDKsG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rumors and leaks for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 seemingly reveal that Samsung is kind of giving up on foldables. The only two expected changes come in the form of a spec bump and a slight redesign. It appears as though everything else will remain the same.</p><p>Making the decision more difficult is that outside of carrier and trade-in deals, Samsung is still selling the unlocked Galaxy Z Fold 5 for its full retail price. Suffice it to say that if you spent the money today on Fold 5 without knowing that Fold 6 is around the corner, you&apos;d probably be a little unhappy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ccKfeyTdunELrNHpcJSWdN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-with-fold-4-youtube-music.jpg" alt="A Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 running YouTube Music next to a Greygreen Galaxy Z Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ccKfeyTdunELrNHpcJSWdN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If it were my money, I&apos;d wait for Samsung to officially announce the Galaxy Z Fold 6 before making a decision. Not only will we have concrete information, but Samsung also has a tendency to offer some mind-boggling trade-in promotions when new flagship phones are announced.</p><p>I also wouldn&apos;t be surprised if there wasn&apos;t a bit of a "delay" between the announcement and when the Fold 6 arrives in stores. That should give you enough time to make a decision. While ultimately, it&apos;s your money and your decision, I&apos;d probably still avoid buying the Galaxy Z Fold 5 in favor of the Fold 6.</p>

<p>What about third-party watch face apps? Facer is one of the most popular (and largest) offering tons of options for Wear OS watches (as well as Apple Watch and Tizen-based smartwatches).</p><p>Once you download the app from the Google Play Store, you can upload cool and unique watch faces, including official faces from popular franchise brands, like Star Trek, Dungeons & Dragons, or Fallout, real-time 3D watch faces, quirky and stylish ones from independent designers, customizable ones that you can adjust everything from the design to the color schemes, and more.</p><p>New ones are being added all the time, so you can feel like you have a new smartwatch on your wrist from one month, week, or even day to the next. Or change it out for the work or school day to something different at night. There are free options while some require a Premium subscription for a small monthly or annual fee.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Amazon is shifting from full-screen startup ads to static ads before the screensaver on Fire TV.</li><li>These new ads last 30 seconds to a minute and are part of the "Ambient Experience" feature.</li><li>Currently, this seems to be targeting US users with Fire TV models from 2016 onwards.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After easing up on Fire TV full-screen video ads that played when the device starts up, Amazon is now pushing a new ad method using your screensaver.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/amazon-adds-full-screen-ads-on-the-fire-tv-replacing-your-screensaver/" target="_blank">Cord Cutter News</a> reports that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fire-tv-edition-televisions">Fire TV devices</a> now show static ads before the screensaver starts. These ads apparently run for 30 seconds to a minute, as per the report.</p><p>Amazon has since confirmed to the outlet that it is rolling out this type of advert as part of the "Ambient Experience" feature. At the moment, it appears to be targeting US users with promotional messages on Fire TV models made from 2016 onwards.</p><p>However, it&apos;s still uncertain how widespread this rollout is. Cord Cutter News is a reliable source, but the lack of widespread user reports hints that the pre-screensaver ad might only be available to a limited audience for now.</p><p>Amazon has been ramping up its advertising on the Fire TV platform. This includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-prime-video-interactive-ads">adding in-stream ads on Prime Video for non-premium users</a> and briefly using full-screen startup video ads, which were later <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-eases-up-on-annoying-fire-tv-video-ads">toned down and made optional</a>.</p><p>The new pre-screensaver ads fit into this overall strategy. Here&apos;s hoping that Amazon will also provide a way to turn off these ads, although they likely expect many users to keep seeing them.</p><p>Amazon&apos;s move to add pre-screensaver ads on Fire TV is part of a wider industry trend, with competitors like Roku doing similar things to find new revenue streams.</p><p>However, the user experience must stay a top priority. There should be an easy way to turn off these ads since they can be pretty annoying when you&apos;re just trying to watch TV.</p><p>While ads in free or ad-supported content are nothing new, adding ads to streaming devices like Fire TV after people have bought them can be a bit annoying. Users who have already paid for the device might feel like their experience is being compromised by these new ads.</p>
