<ul><li>Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 design showcased through new dummy units.</li><li>The design appears quite similar to what we have seen in the previous renders.</li><li>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 looks sharper like the Galaxy S24 Ultra model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 are anticipated to release at an Unpacked event in Paris on July 10. As we near launch, both devices were spotted in their dummy units, revealing what they would look like in real life.</p><p>These new images of both foldables, shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/20/galaxy-fold-6-flip-6-leaked-dummy-photos/">9to5Google</a>, fully showcase the devices, revealing their squared-off designs for the first time. Seeing the images doesn’t entirely feel new because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>&apos; were earlier shared through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-renders-leak">leaked renders</a>, which showed off a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-renders-leak">new design</a>.</p>

<p>The same design has been reflected even with the dummy units shared by the publication. This means that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> will feature sharp edges instead of rounded ones, as seen in the predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>. It is very akin to what we are used to on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-now-comes-titanium-yellow">recently released</a> in Titanium Yellow. </p><p>Aside from that major change, the rest of the Z Fold 6 appears the same. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-likely-to-opt-for-wider-cover-screen">earlier reports</a> indicated that there would be a slightly wider cover screen on the Z Fold 6, with minimum bezels compared to before. </p><p>The dummy unit image of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 also showcases a significant amount of crease on the foldable screen, which may or may not be reflected on the official unit when it arrives sometime later in July after the launch event.</p>

<p>Unlike the bigger foldable, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> looks identical to the Z Flip 5 without any significant design changes like squared-off edges; instead, it will still have rounded corners. The camera setup also seems to be the same as the previous iteration. </p><p>Another recent marketing image leak confirmed that the Z Flip 6 will still sport the folder-shaped cover screen. The clamshell is also expected to see significant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-leak-hints-at-a-bigger-battery-and-improved-camera">internal improvements</a> like a bigger battery, a 50MP primary sensor, and a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</p><p>We should be able to see the Galaxy Z Fold 6 formally and Z Flip 6 in roughly two weeks, at which point we should also be able to learn more about their design and other upgrades and how they compare to these dummy units.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When Motorola began announcing its 2024 Motorola Edge phone lineup back in April, I was really excited. Last year, Motorola blew me away with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a>, a phone that not only exceeded my expectations but became my daily driver after becoming severely affected by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">PWM sensitivity last May</a>.</p><p>But it feels like Motorola forgot some of the lessons learned from last year&apos;s phones. While the Motorola Edge 2024 still offers super fast 68W charging and excellent battery life, the camera is as mediocre as ever. Worse yet, the slow processor is on-par with ancient phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-v60-thinq-5g-review">LG V60</a>, making everything feel old and slow even though this is a brand-new phone.</p><p>That&apos;s particularly sad because Motorola seemed to have finally figured out its groove in smartphone design again. The vegan leather back on my review unit is an absolute joy to use all day and it offers a level of grippiness and classic chic design we don&apos;t often see in devices like smartphones. The phone is immediately identifiable from the pack of iPhone clones on the market, yet because of some poor decisions, it&apos;s immediately forgettable from the moment you use it.</p>

<p>The Motorola Edge (2024) became available in the U.S. on June 20, 2024 for an MSRP of $549.99. It can be purchased unlocked at motorola.com, Best Buy, and Amazon. The usual suite of U.S. carriers will have the phone as well, including T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Spectrum, Consumer Cellular, Straight Talk, Total by Verizon, and Visible.</p><p>Canadian customers will be able to purchase the phone later this year, but Motorola hasn&apos;t given a specific release date yet.</p><p>The Motorola Edge (2024) ships in a single colorway, Midnight Blue, which is the vegan leather-clad model we used for review. I&apos;ve used the Motorola Edge (2024) on T-Mobile&apos;s 5G network as my main device for 10 days as of the publishing of this review.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FXWvyXFj3YuLhGvQJxiVY" name="motorola-edge-2024-back-04.jpg" alt="The gorgeous vegan leather back of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FXWvyXFj3YuLhGvQJxiVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From the moment I took the Motorola Edge 2024 out of the box, I loved it. Motorola&apos;s phone design absolutely shines through every square inch of the phone, from the high-quality metal frame to the gorgeous and slip-resistant vegan leather back. This is a really good looking phone and it feels as good to use as it looks, too.</p><p>So many phones use slippery plastic or glass backs and it makes holding on to them a chore. The Motorola Edge 2024 is so pleasantly grippy I think many people will feel like they can go caseless without feeling like it&apos;s going to fall to the floor at a moment&apos;s notice.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The design is impeccable, impressively thin, and clad in grippy, high-quality vegan leather.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The phone is also surprisingly thin, coming in at 1mm thinner than the Pixel 8a and feeling incredibly sleek because of it. I&apos;m not a person who usually advocates for thinner phones because it normally means that the battery is smaller or other concessions had to be made, but that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case here.</p>

<p>This may seem like a silly thing to gush about, but think about how many times you put your phone down only to watch it slide off that surface right away. When I make a phone call and put it on speaker, I don&apos;t have to worry about resting it in my lap for fear of it sliding off. When I put it on the counter while I cook, the sound emitted is a soft, comfortable tone rather than the scary crunch of glass—something especially true if you have stone countertops.</p><p>The one thing missing from this (and every other Android phone so far) is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">Qi2 with MagSafe</a>. On the bright side, because this uses vegan leather and not slippery or fogged glass, popping on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Magnetic-MagSafe-Compatibility-Compatibility-Non-MagSafe/dp/B0BYMJ3M29/">MagSafe ring adapter</a> without a case is completely possible. Other kinds of phone backs often don&apos;t work well with these adapters as the adhesive doesn&apos;t stick well to those surfaces.</p>

<p>In addition to a lovely textured back, Motorola brought another one of my favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/thinkphone-review-the-best-motorola-phone-you-wont-buy">ThinkPhone</a> features to the Edge 2024: the side button.

This little button streamlines my usual routine, and I learned to love its existence <em>very</em> quickly.</p>

<p>PC users are going to <em>love</em> Motorola Smart Connect. There&apos;s something truly magical about controlling your smartphone with the same keyboard and mouse that simultaneously controls your PC. The best part is that all you have to do is move your mouse cursor over to your smartphone&apos;s display as if it were another monitor hooked up to your PC, and <em>it just works</em>.</p><p>I have a smartphone stand on my desk that sits right below my center monitor, making this particular setup effortless, but it&apos;ll also work just fine with plenty of other setups, too. If I&apos;m already on a computer there&apos;s almost no reason I want to pick up my phone to do anything because of the screen size and awkwardness of typing/navigating on a smartphone versus a computer. This fixes a lot of that.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Battery life is excellent, and 68W wired charging ensures that you'll only need a few minutes to top it up.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Speaking of using your phone often, this is a phone you can use all day (and then some) without ever worrying about battery life. Plus, even when you do need to top up the battery, the 68W charging speed ensures that just a few minutes get you plenty of battery for the rest of the day. I use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Anker-Adapter-Foldable-Compact/dp/B08T5QN2TR/">Anker nano charger</a> for this job as it provides plenty of watts without taking up much space.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 7s Gen 2</a> is a very efficient processor that doesn&apos;t get particularly hot—even when playing games like Call of Duty Warzone for an hour—and it sips battery even through these processing-intensive tasks.</p><p>And while this <em>is</em> a more mid-range processor, it still plays modern games just fine. I played everything from the aforementioned CoD Warzone to Diablo Immortal and even Genshin Impact without any performance issues. That said, games won&apos;t run at as high of detail settings, resolution, or framerate as a more expensive phone but so long as you don&apos;t mind that, this was a surprisingly great experience.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The pOLED display is gorgeous and has options to completely disable PWM dimming.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Motorola&apos;s software and features also make the experience truly sublime. Features like per-app volume adjustment makes it easy to keep listening to your own music while playing a game or doing something else that usually emits music-interrupting audio.</p><p>The phone&apos;s pOLED display is generally excellent and not only gets plenty bright under sunlight but also offers an important flicker-reduction setting for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> people. This ensures that the phone never uses PWM dimming, even at low brightness levels that usually cause quality issues with other types of OLED displays.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u2uRHQNh_is" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The phone utilizes 720Hz PWM at low brightness levels with this setting turned off, though, so if that&apos;s more comfortable, you can always leave it at the default setting. The only downside I found is that the display has some potential dithering when using the natural and radiant color modes. The default vivid color mode appears to have no dithering.</p><p>As is the case with a lot of Motorola&apos;s flavor of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, customizability means this phone will look and feel the way <strong>you</strong> want it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nVgoQC8RrC4MPhAMY6E7uU" name="motorola-edge-2024-display-wallpaper-01.jpg" alt="The homescreen of the Motorola Edge (2024) with custom wallpaper from the Backdrops app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nVgoQC8RrC4MPhAMY6E7uU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I use <em>a lot</em> of phones in any given year and can immediately tell the difference in haptic quality when I turn on a phone. This phone, unfortunately, still uses really low quality haptics that make it feel inherently cheap compared to something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> or OnePlus 12R, two phones that are in the same price range.</p><p>And the processor is also slower than both of those phones by quite a wide margin. According to Geekbench 6.3, the Google Pixel 8a is 140% faster in multicore performance, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> is nearly 200% faster. Even just playing games or doing normal tasks on the phone feels substantially slower than those phones. Imagine what it&apos;ll feel like in 2 years from now? Not good.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Google Pixel 8a is 140% faster in multicore performance, while the OnePlus 12R is nearly 200% faster.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The overall camera quality of the Motorola Edge 2024 is fine enough, but it&apos;s not going to win any awards. In many situations, I found that it traded blows with the OnePlus 12R despite using a newer Sony sensor than that phone.</p><p>But the quality really isn&apos;t the issue with the camera. It&apos;s the speed. Launching the camera is slow and clunky feeling, as it not only takes a few seconds for the camera to appear but it&apos;s initially laggy in a very unflattering way. Photo capture, likewise, was quite slow and often had a lot of odd shutter lag.</p>

<p>It doesn&apos;t handle motion capture particularly well, nor does the OnePlus 12R. If you take lots of pictures of your kids or pets, get a Pixel 8a, instead. It&apos;s the same price and has a <em>much</em> better camera.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>That slow processor means the camera performance is quite slow, often feeling laggy and stuttery while the competition is buttery-smooth.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The list of "things I don&apos;t like" isn&apos;t exactly lengthy but, even with that said, the negatives make the price feel way too high. The use of a slower Snapdragon 7-series processor isn&apos;t a good look on a $550 phone, and Motorola only guarantees two years of software updates on the phone. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 12R gets 4 years of software updates and Google offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-many-updates-will-the-pixel-8a-receive">7 years of updates on the Pixel 8a</a>.</p><p>That substantially slower processor affects a lot and it doesn&apos;t feel like there&apos;s much making up for those lacking pieces. Sure, it&apos;s got faster charging than the Pixel 8a but so does the OnePlus 12R. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 12R has the fastest processor of the bunch by a wide margin, while Google leads on the camera front.</p><p>What does Motorola offer uniquely here? I&apos;m not sure, other than a nice vegan leather back and a different type of eye-friendly display.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 8a is a better value from almost every angle. It&apos;s got a far better camera that&apos;s lightning-fast to launch and snap pictures from. Video recording quality is higher, and Google&apos;s Tensor G3 processor is both more powerful and sports more AI processing power, ensuring that all the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-june-2024-feature-drop-detailed">Pixel features</a> are at their best. Plus, Google guarantees seven years of software updates for the Pixel 8a which is several more than Motorola.</p><p>Motorola still holds the edge in display quality and comfort, and anyone who is PWM-sensitive should never consider a Pixel because of Google&apos;s harsh flickering display tech, anyway. Plus, the vegan leather on the Motorola Edge 2024 is even nicer than the matte back on the Pixel 8a, and there&apos;s no getting around the fact that Motorola&apos;s 68W charging speed is substantially faster than the Pixel 8a&apos;s anemic 18W.</p><p>But I&apos;d personally rather buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> over both of those other phones for many reasons. The price is lower, the processor is faster, the display is the best of all three, and the charging is faster. The camera is better than the Motorola Edge (2024) but not as good as the Pixel 8a, so that&apos;s certainly worth mentioning. While OnePlus only offers four years of software updates, I prefer OxygenOS over either Google or Motorola&apos;s flavors of Android for its design and features.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sLaK3D6EgDVZi7JARCbqT3" name="motorola-edge-2024-back-02.jpg" alt="The gorgeous vegan leather back of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sLaK3D6EgDVZi7JARCbqT3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Edge 2024 is a pretty good phone in its own right. The design and the vegan leather back are simply stunning to look at <em>and</em> to hold, delivering a classic elegance not expected from a smartphone. The display looks great in any light and it&apos;s incredibly eye-friendly thanks to Motorola&apos;s flicker-reduction option. Plus, it charges fast, has great battery life, and sports Motorola updated UI, powered by Android 14.</p><p>But at $550, it&apos;s impossible to recommend over the competition for almost any reason. Sure, Motorola Smart Connect is a great utility that you won&apos;t find on a OnePlus or Google Pixel phone but that&apos;s about where Motorola&apos;s advantage ends. With a slower processor, worse camera experience, and fewer years of software support, I can&apos;t recommend the Motorola Edge 2024 at its full price.</p><p>If this phone was even just $100 less, it would be a lot easier to consider but that price is simply too high. Carriers in the U.S. often offer phones like this for <em>a lot</em> less, though, and that&apos;s where it starts to make more sense, especially if you&apos;re like me and find the displays of Google, Apple, and Samsung phones highly uncomfortable to look at.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>UGREEN is one of the largest charging accessory brands globally, and while its primary business is still around GaN chargers, it has branched out into power banks and power stations. The latter didn&apos;t see much momentum, so the brand has decided to not launch new products. However, it took the learnings from that category to create the 48000mAh Power Bank — its largest power bank yet.</p><p>What I like the most about the power bank is the size; it is larger and heavier than the 145W 25000mAh Power Bank, but considering you get nearly double the battery size, UGREEN did a phenomenal job with the overall design. The 48000mAh Power Bank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-300W-000mAh-Power-Bank/dp/B0CJY37RT3\">costs $199 on Amazon</a>, and there&apos;s an introductory deal that lets you buy the power bank at $139. UGREEN is running the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ugreen.com/products/ugreen-300w-48000mah-portable-charger-power-bank">deal on its website</a>, and you can get it for just $139 by using code <strong>PB300W</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bg8jes4U29u3WYPYim325e" name="ugreen-300w-power-bank-13.jpg" alt="UGREEN 300W 48000mAh Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bg8jes4U29u3WYPYim325e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Portability is a key selling point of this power bank, and that&apos;s assisted by the large carrying handle located up top — it allows you to easily take it anywhere. It isn&apos;t as versatile as a normal power bank, and you can&apos;t just throw it in a bag — the 48000mAh Power Bank weighs 4.1lb (1.8kg). That said, you don&apos;t notice the heft as much, and the carrying handle makes a difference in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pg3vmbJovhhxNYNDVsMZdd" name="ugreen-300w-power-bank-11.jpg" alt="UGREEN 300W 48000mAh Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pg3vmbJovhhxNYNDVsMZdd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power bank has rubber feet at the bottom, and it stays planted on a desk. Just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-revodok-max-213-thunderbolt-4-dock-review">Revodok Max 213</a>, you get rubber feet at the back, and you can use the power bank facing up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="K6rbQXzonCBX7hao3ufngb" name="ugreen-300w-power-bank-4.jpg" alt="UGREEN 300W 48000mAh Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6rbQXzonCBX7hao3ufngb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design is similar to what you get on most UGREEN products, with the power bank decked out in a dark grey color scheme that looks good. The chassis is made out of plastic, and the build quality is outstanding — as you&apos;d imagine for a product in this segment. The front is dominated by a panel that shows battery charge level, and you get indicators for in and out — these show real-time charging stats.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PuRAtkPEvER8HkEkWdrusb" name="ugreen-300w-power-bank-5.jpg" alt="UGREEN 300W 48000mAh Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PuRAtkPEvER8HkEkWdrusb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 48000mAh Power Bank includes two USB-A ports — with each going up to 22.5W — but it&apos;s the three USB-C ports that will get the most amount of use. All three are based on the USB PD 3.1 standard, and two ports go up to 100W. The main USB-C port is the default way to charge the power bank, and what&apos;s great about this port is that it hits 140W. You can not only charge the power bank at 140W, but also use the port as an output, giving you the ability to charge just about any device.</p>

<p>You get a button at the front to manually switch the unit on or off, and on the whole, UGREEN nailed the design and build quality. A particularly useful addition is a large LED light that&apos;s located to the left, and it has three modes: medium, high intensity, and strobing. The light is definitely handy if you&apos;re using the power bank outdoors, and it gets <em>very </em>bright.</p>

<p>The biggest differentiator with the power bank is the 48000mAh battery, and it is able to charge any gadget several times over. I used it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, Honor MagicBook 16, and to charge another power bank, and it was terrific throughout.</p>

<p>I didn&apos;t pay much attention to efficiency figures in the past, buy that&apos;s something I&apos;m changing with the 48000mAh Power Bank. Because of the way charging works in general, power banks aren&apos;t inherently efficient, so in this instance, even though you get a 48000mAh battery, the efficiency is around the 55% figure. The battery went down by a margin of 8500mAh to charge a 4500mAh device, and 10500mAh to charge a phone with a 5500mAh battery.</p>
<p>This is true of all power banks in general; you usually get an efficiency of 60% to 65% at most, and that&apos;s down to factors like charging voltages and heat transfer. Other recent power banks I&apos;ve used went up to the 60% mark, but not beyond that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jNh7RYG4HxYf92JcHoZKDe" name="ugreen-300w-power-bank-14.jpg" alt="UGREEN 300W 48000mAh Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jNh7RYG4HxYf92JcHoZKDe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To UGREEN&apos;s credit, the brand is using LiFePO4 batteries on the 48000mAh Power Bank, so they should last a long time without noticeable degradation. They also have better density, and that&apos;s what allows the power bank to be smaller than its alternatives. UGREEN notes that the batteries can hold up to an 80% charge after 3,000 charge cycles, and that&apos;s nearly three times as durable as traditional Lithium-ion batteries.</p>

<p>There are five charging ports in total, and you can use the 48000mAh Power Bank to charge up to five devices at the same time. The power budget varies significantly based on how many devices are being charged simultaneously, and with all ports in use, you get a total 130W of addressable power. The best use case is to use the three USB-C ports at once, and in this scenario, you get 300W — 100W via each port.</p>

<p>As you can use 140W to charge the power bank itself, it doesn&apos;t take as long to charge the 48000mAh battery. In my testing, the battery hit a full charge in just over 100 minutes, and that&apos;s more than adequate. The only issue I have in this area is that there isn&apos;t much in the way of accessories; you get a single 240W USB-C to USB-C cable, and that&apos;s it. UGREEN makes some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-gan-chargers">best GaN chargers</a>, and while including the 140W Nexode would have increased the cost of the power bank, the brand should have at least bundled more cables in the package.</p>
<p>If you need a power bank with a particularly large battery and want a product with portability in mind, the 48000mAh Power Bank is now the go-to choice.</p>

A few brands do it, except Jabra is the only one on the higher end that consistently does so. Its Active earbuds continue to provide excellent results, and that&apos;s very much the case with the Elite 8 Active Gen 2.</p><p>By their name, these earbuds carry on from their predecessors and add a few new improvements to the mix. However, a solid pair of ruggedized earbuds gets overshadowed by Jabra&apos;s decision to move on from its earbuds business, but that still doesn&apos;t really change how viable these are.</p>

<p>Jabra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabras-new-elite-earbuds-come-with-a-case-thats-more-than-meets-the-eye">launched</a> the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 in June 2024, and they will be easy to find in retail and online stores for some time. They start at $230, though discounts aren&apos;t out of the question down the line now that Jabra is pulling out of its consumer business and will no longer make earbuds. Jabra confirms it will keep supporting its existing lineup of Elite earbuds with updates and warranty commitments for years to come. They come in black, navy, coral, and olive.</p>

<p>The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 may not have everything their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-gen-2-review">Elite 10 Gen 2</a> siblings do, but they may be the more appealing of the two for a couple of reasons. First is durability. While the Elite 10 Gen 2 boast an impressive IP57 rating for any pair of flagship earbuds, the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 take both dust and water resistance further with IP68 protection. It&apos;s rare enough to find rugged earbuds, but it&apos;s another to find a pair that does so many things well. You could be hiking up a mountain or splashing into a pool, and there wouldn&apos;t be a problem. Dealing with sweat is just part of the deal here.</p><p>That&apos;s where the second reason comes in: the durability makes the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 more compelling as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout earbuds</a>. Much like their predecessors, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-review">first-gen Elite 8 Active</a>, Jabra wisely chose to stick with a design formula that simply works. A rubberized matte finish handles water so well that it slides off the coating. </p><p>I wish Jabra applied 100% coverage with this material but it basically took the same approach as it did with the first-gen Elite 8 Active and left a sizeable inner portion more exposed. Granted, that doesn&apos;t necessarily pose a danger because dust and water resistance apply equally here, but it still would&apos;ve been nice to see here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ezJiHueGcaESSy4BdgCCkc" name="Jabra-Elite-8-Active-Gen-2-wearing.jpg" alt="Wearing Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ezJiHueGcaESSy4BdgCCkc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sticking with a familiar design bodes well for fit and comfort. These are some of the most comfortable and stable earbuds available, in my opinion, having worn and tested hundreds of wireless earbuds at this point. You get three ear tip sizes to choose from to find the best, snuggest fit for your ears. One more size would&apos;ve been nice, like an extra-large or extra-small, though.</p><p>A tighter seal is critical to getting the most out of the onboard active noise cancelation (ANC), and that&apos;s no different here. It&apos;s also crucial to the sound, especially if you&apos;re looking to wear these during a run or workout and want to trap in as much bass as possible. </p><p>The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 have smaller 6mm drivers compared to the 10mm ones in the Elite 10 Gen 2, so they work harder to play the same tunes. However, the tuning isn&apos;t different, and you can always tweak the EQ in Jabra&apos;s Sound+ app to deliver a balanced sound. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PN8Vn2ibWRHcDH9LKNpyJc" name="Jabra-Elite-8-Active-Gen-2-plugged-in.jpg" alt="Jabra Elite 8 Active case plugged into laptop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PN8Vn2ibWRHcDH9LKNpyJc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Truth be told, there&apos;s no major difference in how music generally sounds through these buds, though changes do occur under certain circumstances. Improved ANC, particularly in lower and mid-range frequencies, helps drown out more background noise to let audio playback feel more resonant. </p><p>It largely works efficiently. I can&apos;t tell you the ANC is twice as good as Jabra claims, but it is more refined this time. It does better with street noise and wind, though phone calls in windy conditions still pose a challenge sometimes. I was more impressed with HearThrough, where ambient sounds come through much clearer than before, making it more natural to hear an announcement or chat with someone without removing the buds. </p><p>The bigger deal is the fact the charging case also acts as a Bluetooth LE smart case. It works with the LC3 codec, so once you use the included cable and plug in via USB-C or 3.5mm to a playback device, it streams the audio to the earbuds. On a plane, this feels like magic, even if Jabra is hardly the first to ever do it. Same with a TV, where keeping quiet could mean the difference between happiness and misery. It&apos;s also gold with laptops or tablets where latency and audio/video sync might be a concern. It doesn&apos;t even need any setup; just plug in, hold the button on the case until a white light appears, and you&apos;re good. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.58%;"><img id="D6x6x23L4uBFzudnPqoLLa" name="Jabra-Elite-8-Active-Gen-2-screenshots.jpg" alt="Screenshots for Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D6x6x23L4uBFzudnPqoLLa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1466" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As always, Jabra offers a significant level of granular control in the Sound+ app, letting you adjust the controls (which still work well as physical buttons), set up Spotify Tap, and update the firmware, among other things. You just have to dig a little to see where everything is if you&apos;re new to Jabra&apos;s earbuds.</p><p>Spatial sound is more front and center as a feature, and it&apos;s OK. Not great, nor terrible. One reason is that it&apos;s Dolby Audio rather than Atmos, giving you Dolby&apos;s more general spatial audio tech. As such, there&apos;s no head tracking as the Elite 10 Gen 2 have, and the effect feels less substantial here, anyway. I chose to leave it off most of the time, particularly for music, and I only tried it again when watching a show or movie.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Multipoint connections also let you pair with two devices simultaneously, making the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 buds just as useful in an office situation.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Jabra gets other things right, like the wear sensors, where taking an earbud off pauses playback or mutes a call, or using only one earbud automatically turns on HearThrough. Multipoint connections also let you pair with two devices simultaneously, making the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 buds just as useful in an office situation. </p><p>On paper, battery life is rated at up to eight hours per charge with ANC on or up to 14 hours with it off. That&apos;s all based on default volume levels, so if you crank these up, you&apos;re never hitting those numbers. I easily got above seven hours at about 60% volume—and spatial audio off—so the batteries in both buds hold up well. The case offers an extra three full charges, and since it also supports wireless charging and a five-minute quick charge, the conveniences add up.</p>

<p>I still don&apos;t understand Jabra&apos;s motivation for not supporting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res audio codecs</a>. Here, you only get SBC and AAC. Still no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">aptX</a>, LDAC, or LHDC, to name a key few. You could argue hi-res tracks are less relevant for more active-focused earbuds, but I don&apos;t see why running or working out suddenly negates such a feature. Jabra did the same with the Elite 10 Gen 2—a missed opportunity for both pairs.</p><p>Perhaps it&apos;s a moot point anyway, considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/gn-kills-jabra-elite-and-talk-products">company is leaving its consumer business behind</a>. The shocking exit comes at a time when it seemed Jabra was still top-class in the category. Its hearing aid and enterprise businesses make more money, so in a tighter and tighter consumer market for wireless earbuds, Jabra&apos;s decision-makers made what was very likely a pure business decision. </p><p>It&apos;s just odd for a brand to launch a key product and then step away from the entire business altogether. On the bright side, Jabra will continue to support its consumer audio products for "years" to come with updates and warranties, and given its track record that way, I&apos;m inclined to believe it.</p>

<p>Despite Jabra&apos;s surprising move, the Elite 8 Active Gen 2 deserve to be mentioned along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>. Certainly, if you were looking at the best earbuds for workouts, they would be at the top of the list. If you feel you could do without the improved ANC and HearThrough, you&apos;ll find similar comfort and durability with the previous Elite 8 Active. If you wanted good durability with additional features and the same fit, the Elite 10 Gen 2 are an excellent choice. </p><p>When it comes to other brands, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a> don&apos;t have dust resistance but their IPX7 protection is pretty rugged for sweat and water. For a pair with ear hooks and much cheaper price, you could look at the Treblab X3 Pro or JBL Endurance Peak 3. </p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want rugged durability.</li>
  <li>You want good sound with ANC support.</li>
  <li>You want a comfortable fit with physical buttons.</li>
  <li>You want an EQ to work with.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You really want hi-res audio codecs.</li>
  <li>You don&apos;t need spatial audio.</li>
  <li>You&apos;re on a tighter budget.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>As I already pointed out, it&apos;s strange for a brand to launch a key product and turn away from the entire business at the same time. That&apos;s where we are with the Elite 8 Active Gen 2—putting consumers in a tough spot. But despite the unusual situation, I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to recommend these earbuds simply because they don&apos;t have many rugged competitors. And definitely not of this quality. Plus, Jabra is still manufacturing them to accommodate retail demand. </p><p>They are a very iterative upgrade over their predecessors, though. Unless you&apos;re really particular about noise cancelation, HearThrough, and really want the Bluetooth LE feature in the case, you won&apos;t go wrong with the previous pair, either.</p>

This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape. </p><p>This week saw the first look at RCS messaging on the iPhone, YouTube is tightening its reigns on Premium subscriptions via VPN, Android 15&apos;s Beta 3 launches, Motorola teases its upcoming foldables, and Spotify introduces a new basic plan.</p>

The first look shows that green bubbles are still used to identify texts from Android users despite RCS—as<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone#section-update"> expected</a>. Apparently, Android users can send RCS messages to iPhone users in individual and group chats. Additionally, the X user states that higher-quality audio files, photos, and other forms of media can be shared via these chats. </p><p>However, it appears Apple has a lot of work to do when it comes to RCS. Firstly, there is a lack of E2EE (end-to-end encryption) in group chats, something that was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-rcs-group-chat-e2ee">implemented in Android last year</a>. Emoji reactions continue to be an iPhone user thing, as only they get to see a "proper" reaction to messages. If an iMessage user reacts to an Android user&apos;s message, the green bubble user will receive a new message saying "Liked," followed by their text in quotes.</p><p>Replying to a specific message continues to be a challenge for both Android and Apple users, as they don&apos;t have the option to do so. Another thing to note is that RCS is limited to iPhones on T-Mobile and AT&T networks at the moment.</p>

A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1di5mz5/comment/l91rrqr/" target="_blank">thread on Reddit</a> highlighted that these cancellations were linked to users resorting to VPN services in order to score cheaper rates by taking advantage of regional pricing loopholes.</p><p>To illustrate the price difference, a Premium subscription costs Rs.129 ($1.54) per month in India, whereas it normally costs $13.99 in the US. Some use YouTube Premium for a fraction of the cost in their home market. Although the subscription worked fine after the initial VPN trick, Google seems to be aware of this loophole and is going after these users.</p><p>In response, Google indirectly confirmed to Android Central that it&apos;s tightening its reigns and that "to provide the most accurate plans and offers available, we have systems in place to determine the country of our users," the spokesperson said. "In instances where the signup country does not match where the user is accessing YouTube, we&apos;re asking members to update their billing information to their current country of residence."</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There&apos;s been a thought bouncing around in my head about the state of tablets. I&apos;ve talked about how stale the category is and how there&apos;s a definite need for a change in the space. It&apos;s part of the reason why I decided to upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-should-think-different-with-ipad-pro">M4 iPad Pro</a>, just because I thought Apple would have something to blow our minds with iPadOS 18 at WWDC.</p><p>Since then, I have been thinking that Samsung got the formula right, specifically with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a>. If you want smaller tablets, there are plenty to choose from. They probably won&apos;t have all the bells and whistles, but they&apos;ll get the job done for whatever you need.</p><p>So, while I&apos;ve been on the hunt for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablet</a>, maybe it&apos;s been right in front of me this whole time. It&apos;s not perfect, not by any means. For one, using it as in vertical orientation in any scenario is laughable. I&apos;m also still scratching my head and wondering why a tablet of this caliber doesn&apos;t include an option for cellular connectivity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Kbsrw9dS4aUQ8j8Mx28EHP" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-in-lap-in-car.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra in lap" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kbsrw9dS4aUQ8j8Mx28EHP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And I&apos;m still not the biggest fan of the keyboard case, as it just isn&apos;t great to use in my lap. If I can set it up on a table or at a desk, then it&apos;s perfect, but Samsung needs to borrow some notes from Apple or Microsoft for its next tablet keyboard.</p><p>Setting all of that aside, there&apos;s nothing that can rival the versatility of what the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra offers. It&apos;s fantastic as an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-samsung-phone-tablet-second-screen-windows">extra monitor</a> for my desktop PC thanks to the <em>huge</em> AMOLED screen. I just prop it up below my main monitor, and everything pretty much just works.</p><p>Using it this way also makes it easy to just use it as an Android tablet if I need to try something out or if I want to just watch a video while I&apos;m eating lunch. The Tab S9 Ultra is also arguably the ultimate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handheld</a>—and yes, I mean handheld.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fr8qS98NFcVBhfm5hidqJh" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-gamesir-galileo-g8.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra with the GameSir G8 Galileo controller attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fr8qS98NFcVBhfm5hidqJh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For one, it&apos;s powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, has plenty of RAM, and plenty of storage thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot. This makes everything so much easier, as I don&apos;t need to worry about not having enough storage for everything at a time when companies are stripping away expandable storage on more and more devices. As for being a handheld, I usually keep the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-galileo-review">GameSir Galileo G8</a> nearby so I can use it as an oversized screen to play games without relying on a Bluetooth controller. Sure, it looks goofy, but who cares if it works?</p><p>What really made me realize that the Tab S9 Ultra is the perfect tablet for me is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a>. Apple&apos;s implementation of a multi-window interface is just downright awful. Don&apos;t get me wrong; it definitely works, but only within the confines of what Apple deems the proper way to use multiple apps.</p><p>I don&apos;t have to fiddle with anything or try to jump through a bunch of hoops to use my tablet as a laptop. Just tap the button or connect the keyboard, and I&apos;m there. All of the apps that I install work just as I&apos;d expected, even the ones that didn&apos;t want to work with adjustable windows in the past.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4F4fxe5rmX8heyzJtRijaM" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-dex-mode-standalone.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra in DeX Mode on desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4F4fxe5rmX8heyzJtRijaM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If I&apos;m away from home and my desktop is turned on, I can turn the Tab S9 Ultra into a proper laptop, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://parsec.app/">Parsec</a>. There are a bunch of other apps that do the same thing, but Parsec has been the most stable for me. When I&apos;m done, I just close Parsec and go back to whatever I was doing.</p><p>Usually, it&apos;s just transferring files that aren&apos;t stored in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">NAS</a>, but it&apos;s nice having this flexibility. Meanwhile, you can&apos;t even get Parsec on the iPad, and the other solutions don&apos;t work nearly as well for me.</p><p>This is to say that sometimes, it&apos;s better to take a step back and reevaluate the devices you already have before trying to make reasons for replacing them. The M4 iPad Pro is great, but what I already had with me is just as great and perhaps even better.</p>

That's 50% off a year of great coverage on T-Mobile's vast 5G network, not to mention a huge discount on a stellar Android device. If that's not the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro-deals-of-the-month">best Google Pixel 8 deal</a> on the web today, I don't know what is. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-8/4367987/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="05ce294e-683b-4889-8599-33e2611b0075" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699" data-dimension48="$699">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Since its unveiling last October, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a> has reigned as one of the best flagship devices on the market, pairing the efficiency of the Tensor G3 chipset with AI-powered software features and seven years of OS updates guaranteed. As a Pixel, you can also expect cutting-edge camera technology straight out of the box with one of the best portrait modes that we&apos;ve ever used. Sure, it may not get as much attention as the more-powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, but if you&apos;re looking for something simpler (and more affordable), you can&apos;t go wrong with the base model Pixel 8. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a>, if you&apos;re unfamiliar, is a popular MVNO carrier that sells wireless service in 3, 6, and 12-month increments of time, utilizing T-Mobile&apos;s vast 5G network to bring excellent coverage to users at a much lower cost. In fact, Mint Mobile ranks among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">our favorite MVNOs</a> because of its simplicity, vast coverage area, and bountiful deals. You also get free calls to Mexico and Canada, a mobile hotspot included with all plans, and compatibility with a wide assortment of devices.  </p><p>If this offer sounds familiar to you, it&apos;s probably because it&apos;s just the latest in a string of bundle-focused <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes">Mint Mobile deals</a> that we&apos;ve seen this year. The Pixel 8 Pro and new Google Pixel 8a have received similar deals with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-8-pro/4367961/"><strong>$440 off</strong></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-8a/5777318/"><strong>$100 off</strong></a>, respectively, so if you&apos;re a Pixel fan, take note. </p>

<p><em>If you&apos;re still feeling undecided about Mint, it&apos;s worth noting that Visible comes at a close second when you&apos;re looking at cheap alternative carriers.

<ul><li>A support page for the Galaxy Watch Ultra has been spotted on Samsung Canada's site, confirming its existence and key details.</li><li>The watch is expected to feature LTE connectivity and a 47mm case, likely the only size option.</li><li>The Galaxy Watch Ultra is expected to launch on July 10 during Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event, alongside other new products.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung appears to have accidentally confirmed the long-rumored Galaxy Watch Ultra on its own website, matching up with some of the previous leaks and rumors.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-moniker-confirmed-via-official-support-pages/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a> spotted a support page for the yet-to-be-announced Galaxy Watch Ultra on Samsung Canada&apos;s website. This page not only confirms the smartwatch&apos;s existence but also reveals key details.</p><p>The upcoming model will supposedly feature LTE connectivity and a 47mm case, suggesting it might only come in a single size. On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> comes in two sizes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1423px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.13%;"><img id="C2ZdxZvFGHwcSvJiyTQ8SP" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-website-listing.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra website support page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C2ZdxZvFGHwcSvJiyTQ8SP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1423" height="756" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though the support page has since disappeared, it undeniably confirmed the existence of the upcoming model. Samsung&apos;s next-generation premium smartwatch promises a fresh design aimed at shaking up the market and competing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a>.</p><p>The buzz around Samsung&apos;s next-gen wearable is off the charts. Leaks and rumors have given us a pretty clear picture of its design, features, and possible price.</p><p>This top-tier smartwatch is said to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">sport a unique and tough look with a circular dial in a square case</a>. Rumor has it, it&apos;ll come in white and dark gray colorways, both featuring a vibrant orange side button for a bit of flair.</p><p>As per earlier leakers, the Watch Ultra is expected to feature an orange crown button on the right, flanked by two other buttons. Rumors also point to a grade 4 titanium chassis and a sapphire crystal glass display, indicating a premium build designed to endure an active lifestyle.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra is also rumored to have a peak brightness of up to 300 nits and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techmaniacs.gr/apokleistiko-mathame-ta-panta-gia-osa-erchontai-sto-epomeno-unpacked-tis-samsung/" target="_blank">offer water resistance up to 100 meters</a>, outperforming some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-waterproof-smartwatches">best waterproof smartwatches</a> on the market.</p><p>Rumor has it that the Galaxy Watch Ultra will launch on July 10 during Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Unpacked event. This event is expected to showcase a slew of Samsung&apos;s latest products, including the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Galaxy Z Flip 6, Galaxy Buds 3, and the classic Galaxy Watch 7.</p><p>However, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is expected to come with a hefty price tag, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-alleged-render-pricing-leak">rumored to be around $700</a>. While that&apos;s still a significant amount, it’s a bit cheaper than Apple&apos;s $800. So, if you&apos;re in the market for a high-end smartwatch and want to save a hundred bucks, the Galaxy Watch Ultra could be a great option.</p>

<ul><li>A dive into Google's Device Health Services app shows signs of a new "Adaptive Thermal" feature for Pixels.</li><li>The feature seems designed to help users take the necessary measures if their Pixel is overheating, which the feature will alert them to.</li><li>Adaptive Thermal features various warning states if a Pixel's temperature is rising too high before shutting itself down for protection.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems that Google is working on a way to help users keep their Pixels cool if it&apos;s running a risk of overheating.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-adaptive-thermal-3453215/">Android Authority</a>, version 1.27 of the Device Health Services app on Pixels holds clues about "Adaptive Thermal." Early strings of code in the app suggest that Google&apos;s new feature will warn users if their Pixel is encroaching on those hotter temperatures so they can assist with it.</p><p>It was discovered that Adaptive Thermal will push a "pre-emergency" notification to users if their device is rising toward 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The notification is joined by a tagline reading "phone needs to cool down" and that your Pixel&apos;s performance will slow.</p><p>Google explains within the app&apos;s code that these performance "limitations" include your Pixel&apos;s speed, the disabling of your 5G network connection, "and more."</p><p>The feature will also offer a few suggestions users can use to cool down their Pixel when tapping "See care steps." The code shows that users might see the following options:</p>
<ul><li>Try avoiding direct sunlight</li><li>Put your phone in the open for airflow</li><li>Close any battery-intensive apps like videos, games, and the camera</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL" name="Google-Pixel-8-mint-colorway-holding-back-01.jpg" alt="The mint colorway of the Google Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rahman states that Adaptive Thermal will continuously check on your device&apos;s temperature every five minutes. If your Pixel hasn&apos;t gotten better and instead rises in temperature to 126 degrees or above, this will activate its "emergency" state. While it sounds serious, Rahman adds that he couldn&apos;t see the details of that phase.</p><p>Additionally, if the temperature rises considerably to 131 degrees or higher, your device will warn you of an impending shutdown. The code shows that Adaptive Thermal will warn you that your Pixel shut off in 30 seconds for protection.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when Google plans on rolling this feature out to Pixels, but it could arrive on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/entire-pixel-9-series-live-photos-specs-leak">Pixel 9 series</a> if anything.</p><p>It&apos;s nothing new to say that Google&apos;s Pixel series has a bad history of overheating, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-6-battery-overheating-issues">the problems Pixel 7 and 6 users</a> faced last year. Those issues followed a security patch where users on Reddit reported a severe rise in device temperature, followed by a costly drain on their batteries.</p><p>The Pixel 8 series encountered some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro-battery-drain-and-network-issues">overheating issues</a> later last year, as well. It didn&apos;t appear widespread, however, several users reported that their devices would get quite warm when browsing the internet and while charging.</p>

<ul><li>A new report from alleged sources close to the matter states Amazon is looking to charge anywhere from $5 to $10 for its "Remarkable Alexa" (Alexa Plus).</li><li>Amazon intends for the AI to help users with shopping queries while a stronger variant is being developed for "complicated queries."</li><li>The report adds that Amazon has faced severe problems with its next-gen AI, such as fabricated information, alongside "poor employee morale."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A few more details about Amazon&apos;s proposed future for its AI assistant, Alexa, and how it will impact consumers have surfaced.</p><p>The report comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-mulls-5-10-monthly-price-tag-unprofitable-alexa-service-ai-revamp-2024-06-21/">Reuters</a>, which cites several people close to the project known internally as "Banyan." According to its sources, Amazon is thinking of including "two tiers of service" for this new Alexa. Its sources claim this could involve a $5 monthly charge or a $10 fee for this "Remarkable Alexa."</p><p>Reuters adds that Amazon is facing a "must-win" scenario. The company is reportedly moving toward infusing Alexa with even stronger AI brains to empower users when they visit the website. The publication&apos;s sources stated that working Alexa deeper into Amazon is to help customers with "shopping advice" and other purchase-related queries.</p><p>However, this won&apos;t come without cost, and it seems Amazon is considering two different price points. The company is allegedly considering replacing "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-alexa">Classic Alexa</a>" (its free variant) with a stronger AI version alongside another that leverages AI software for "complicated" tasks. The paid variant of Alexa is rumored to feature email composure, ordering from UberEats, and more from a "single prompt."</p><p>Moreover, it seems that Amazon isn&apos;t considering some sort of AI "bundle" with its higher-priced Prime membership plan.</p><p>It seems that Amazon is feeling pressured due to advances made by Google with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and its many models, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-play-store-launch">Microsoft&apos;s Copilot</a>, and OpenAI&apos;s ChatGPT. The report adds that the unnamed sources who&apos;ve come forward are hesitant about Amazon&apos;s decision to begin charging for a "revamped" version of Alexa&apos;s free services.</p>

<p>There are also rumors that Amazon&apos;s development of this new "Remarkable Alexa" has been hindered by AI hallucinations. The AI has supposedly fabricated information, which was often "false or misleading." Moreover, the company has had to wrangle with "poor employee morale."</p><p>Murmurings about "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-working-on-premium-alexa">Remarkable Alexa</a>" or "Alexa Plus" have been tumbling about since January. Those early reports stated that Amazon had around 15,000 users putting the new AI assistant through the wringer to iron out those problems. Again, rumors of severe development problems and delays were a recurring theme throughout that previous post.</p><p>The company is reportedly interested in launching Alexa Plus on June 30.</p>
