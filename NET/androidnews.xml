<p>There’s a lot to love about the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra, an affordable phone with plenty of premium features and a sleek design that makes it look more expensive than it is. But there are some concessions, most notably the limited software and security updates. But with the gorgeous screen, headphone jack, and AI features, you’ll love it.</p></p>

<p>Introduced in March 2024, the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra comes in four cool colors: Skyline Blue, Eternal Black, Misty Grey, and Desert Sand, but this is just on the back: the sides in each are black. It’s equipped with a 6.78-inch flexible E6 AMOLED display with a 2,400 x 1,080-pixel resolution, a narrow bezel, and a 94% display-to-body ratio. The phone is a stunning sight to behold, thanks to the glossy matte finish featuring the Chinese symbol for “people,” which makes it stand out among the pack. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> screen, meanwhile, makes it durable as well, along with the IP68 certification for water and dust resistance. </p><p>With 1,600 nits brightness and 2,500 nits peak brightness, you can easily view the screen in all types of lighting conditions, including even bright sunlight outdoors. The adaptive refresh rate goes from 1-120Hz to adjust based on what activity you’re engaged in, but there’s also a boost up to 144Hz for gaming. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">his Zenfone 11 Ultra review</a>, however, Android Central’s Harish Jonnalagadda says you can’t manually turn this on, and it only works in certain gaming titles. </p><p>The phone’s dimensions are 6.45 x 3.02 x .035 inches, and it weighs 225 grams, making it slightly bigger and heavier than the Google Pixel 8 Pro, but not by much. Jonnalagadda admits that while the phone is tall and heavy, ASUS “nailed the weight distribution.” It comes with either 256GB or 512GB storage, which is not expandable, so you’ll likely want to opt for as much storage as you can get locally. </p><p>Coming out of the box loaded with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and additional customization options through ZenUI (though you can choose to use only stock Android), it comes with the promise of two major software updates and four years of security updates. If you plan on holding onto the device for longer than a few years, this could sway your decision since Google promises more than three times the number of software updates and almost twice as long a period for security updates. </p><p>Powered by a 5,500mAh battery, the phone supports 65W HyperCharge as well as wireless charging, so you can be confident that it will last all day and will be up and running in no time once you do need to recharge it. </p><p>Additional features you’ll find with the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra include dual stereo speakers that Jonnalagadda says are “among the loudest in this category,” dual mics with ASUS Noise Reduction technology, fingerprint sensor, face recognition, Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi Direct, NFC, dual SIMs, and 5G. A rarity nowadays, it also has a 3.5mm input for connecting wired headphones and earbuds, which is great if you’re in a pinch and only have a backup wired pair on hand.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="47po7vPbimkNg6taSyW5KC" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-back-porcelain-01.jpg" alt="The matte glass on the back of the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/47po7vPbimkNg6taSyW5KC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By comparison, the Google Pixel 8 Pro, introduced in October 2023, can be picked up in the traditional Google colors: Porcelain, Bay, and Obsidian. It has a 6.7-inch Super Actua LTPO OLED display with 2,992 x 1,344 resolution, a peak of 2,400 nits of brightness (1,600 nits), and an adaptive refresh rate from 1-120Hz. The edgeless screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, which is both scratch- and fingerprint-resistant, and the phone is also IP68-rated. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">his Pixel 8 Pro review</a>, Android Central’s Nicholas Sutrich says the matte glass back of the phone “feels so good, it’s ridiculous,” adding that the phone is overall comfortable to hold thanks to its rounded corners. </p><p>The phone is a smidge smaller than the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra at 6.4 x 3 x 0.3 inches and a bit lighter at 213 grams. You can choose from four storage capacities: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB, but this is not expandable either, so keep that in consideration when choosing which version to get. If you want to consider cloud storage, the Google Pixel 8 Pro comes with a six-month trial to Google One Premium with up to 2TB storage. But you’ll have to pay beyond that period of time if you choose to continue. </p><p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro also comes with Android 14, but the big benefit here is that you get up to seven years of OS and security updates, so this phone is a good one if you’re in it for the long haul. It’s also worth noting that it comes with a six-month subscription to Fitbit Premium, which you can use alongside either a Fitbit smartwatch or fitness tracker or a Google Pixel Watch, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2">Google Pixel Watch 2</a>. Additionally, get three months of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> if you’re a new subscriber. </p><p>Equipped with a 5,050mAh battery as well, the Google Pixel 8 Pro also has an Extreme Battery Saver mode that can extend this to up to 72 hours, ideal if you’re traveling and forgot your charger at home. In addition to support for fast wireless charging, the phone can also use battery share to recharge other compatible devices, like a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-buds-2020-review">Google Pixel Buds</a>.  </p><p>Find a similar feature set like stereo speakers, three mics with noise suppression, fingerprint unlock, face unlock, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, and 5G. This phone, however, does not have a headphone jack.</p>

<p>Head-to-head, how do these two phones compare in terms of specs?</p>

<p>The two phones are pretty similar when it comes to the specifications, which each having a leg up in different areas on the other. But let&apos;s dive deeper.</p>
<h2 id="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-power-processing-and-audio-2">ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: Power, processing, and audio</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ueShQmUqKzotPqFVYKgTDT" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-22.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ueShQmUqKzotPqFVYKgTDT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both these phones have powerful processors and other goodies to keep up with your daily tasks. </p><p>The ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra comes powered by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor, so you don’t have to worry that it won’t be zippy and able to keep up with all your multitasking and data-intensive productivity or entertainment needs. Get 12GB RAM up to a blazing fast 16GB, depending on the model you choose. </p><p>The phone is loaded with tons of AI-powered features. You’ll see things like AI noise cancellation to cancel out background noises, but many of the features are still in beta mode. With AI call translator, for example, it will translate your words into text and voice so the person on the other end of a call or message can understand you and vice versa. This makes it pretty seamless to have a conversation with someone who speaks another language. </p><p>Also in beta is AI transcript, which transcribes phone calls in real-time, a dream for a journalist (present company included!), student, or anyone else trying to furiously take notes from a call or recording and transcribe it manually later. Another beta option is AI wallpaper, which is powered by Qualcomm’s NPU. With this feature, the phone crafts personalized images in your preferred style so the device intelligently adapts to a look and feel you’ll love. </p><p>The ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra excels when it comes to audio performance based on its impressive specs. Along with dual stereo speakers, there’s support for lossless audio and Hi-Res audio up to 384kH2/32-bit when listening via wired headphones. There’s also Dirac Virtuo for Headphone spatial sound, so you get an immersive experience when listening to tunes, podcasts, playing games, or watching videos. Indeed, Jonnalagadda says the tuning makes a “legitimate difference” when playing games or streaming content. With the full AptX suite of audio codecs, you can confidently stream high-res tunes through a good pair of headphones. </p><p>Additionally, there’s a PC continuity feature that can be likened to Samsung’s DeX. With ASUS GlideX, you can mirror your phone and share videos and photos across different devices. Along with extending the screen, you can also use the phone’s camera as a webcam, enhancing your desktop set-up. Meanwhile, Phone Link allows for syncing with a laptop or PC to transfer files, take calls, and manage tasks. </p><p>For gaming, there’s the game turbo engine, which Jonnalagadda says is the “best you’ll find on any phone.” A neat feature called Video Genie mutes calls and notifications while you’re playing so you don’t get distracted. But Jonnalagadda notes that sometimes he experienced overheating during extended gaming sessions.</p>

<p>What about the Google Pixel 8 Pro? It is powered by Google Tensor G3 with Google AI and has 12GB RAM, regardless of the storage option, which means you’ll get a fantastic experience across the board. </p><p>Google offers useful features in the AI realm as well, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-call-screen-feature-pixel">Call Screen</a> for automatically screening spam calls, silently answering them for you so you don’t have to deal with them, nor the phone continuously ringing. Sutrich says it’s easily his favorite Pixel feature, but it&apos;s also simple to turn off for those who don’t want it. </p><p>Live Translate works out of the gate, making it easy to connect with colleagues, friends, and family in multiple languages. Use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> to summarize, read aloud, and even translate web pages, as well as compose messages using your voice. There are also useful apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> and Google Maps with upgraded immersive views. Gmail also offers new and useful prompts. For security, the Titan M2 chip and VPN by Google One is an added benefit, as are features like car crash detection. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">AI Wallpaper</a> is another neat addition, allowing you to choose from preset themes that include paintings, terrains, textures, and more. Once you select a term, like glacier or beach, context-sensitive options appear. When you are ready, select Generate, and you’ll see four images created by generative AI from which you can choose or ask for more. </p><p>Gaming is doable on the phone, but framerate dips regularly, Sutrich finds. While he could easily play games like Minecraft, he had a hard time running even simple visual games like Fortnite. If you’re looking for a phone for gaming, then you’ll want to keep this in mind. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-google-pixel-8-pro-temperature-sensor">temperature sensor</a> has proven to be more of a novelty feature than anything else, but it’s still a cool option to have. Hold the phone by an object, like a boiling pot of water or a baby bottle, and it can tell you the temperature. This feature will become more useful if it officially works like a thermometer: Google has applied to the FDA for the ability to use it to take your own temperature (or that of someone else) and store the data in the Fitbit app. But this is still pending. </p><p>While the Google Pixel 8 Pro doesn’t have all the audio features you’ll find on the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra, it does support Spatial Audio, so you can expect a wonderfully immersive sound experience from this device as well.</p>
<h2 id="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-what-about-the-cameras-2">ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: What about the cameras?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d5f9RjKg8RgoUUzmPEB9oR" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-21.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d5f9RjKg8RgoUUzmPEB9oR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The AI-powered features in both phones work with their cameras as well. </p><p>The ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra has a 50MP main camera, 32MP telephoto camera with a 90° FOV, 3x telephoto, and built-in optical image stabilization (OIS), a 13MP ultra-wide camera, and a 32MP front camera for selfies. Jonnalagadda’s verdict: the phone takes great photos in daylight with nice dynamic range and color accuracy, and detailed photos in low light scenarios as well, albeit with some fringing and loss of detail. The 3x zoom lens leaves something to be desired, but overall, he says the camera in this phone are the best of any Zenfone model he has tried to date. </p><p>A portrait video mode uses an AI algorithm to provide a natural depth-of-field effect when capturing videos. It can also recognize focal points in real time and faces, including those of pets as well as people. This is a feature pet owners (and lovers!) will appreciate. </p><p>You’ll purportedly get smooth photos and videos thanks to the 6-axis hybrid stabilizer 3.0 and Super Hyper Steady EIS algorithm. OZO Audio technology, meanwhile, is used for ensuring lifelike audio and 3D sound in recordings. </p><p>With the 10x zoom with HyperClarity AI algorithm, the phone can also handle direct processing of RAW files. AI Object Sense can recognize objects and optimize them using a special algorithm. </p><p>Another cool photo-related feature is for after the photos are captured: semantic search makes it easy to find what you’re looking for via relevant results provided by AI and using natural language. You can search for photos based on parameters like events, times, locations, or even objects that appear in the photos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AriHAnbWjHYfa6q4QWWvVG" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-camera-bar-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 Pro camera bar in the porcelain colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AriHAnbWjHYfa6q4QWWvVG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro is no slouch in the AI photo department either. It has a 50MP main camera, a 48MP telephoto camera, a 48MP ultra-wide camera with improved Macro Focus, and a 10.5MP selfie front camera. With Super Res Zoom, you can get up close and personal with subjects, zooming up to 30x without losing detail, focus, or clarity. Sutrich says the cameras are the best overall of any Android phone he’s used to date. </p><p>There are professional controls, too, with advanced camera settings for shutter speed as well as Night Sight and astrophotography. With any photo, Google AI technology works in the background to reduce noise and boost quality, both in still photos and videos, and in any lighting condition. </p><p>Google’s photo editing features have become favorites, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> for making custom edits and quality enhancements to photos. While Sutrich says it works incredibly well, he also noticed the phone tends to get warm when using it, but it doesn’t overheat. There’s also Best Take for combining similar photos of the same thing to keep the “best take” shot (no more closed eyes or fidgeting babies when everyone else is smiling!), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-photo-unblur-pixel">Photo Unblur</a> and Face Unblur, Portrait Mode, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> for removing unwanted elements from photos. </p><p>AI extends to video as well, with features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> that uses Google AI to reduce distracting sounds when shooting outdoors or in louder conditions, like when a furnace is humming in the background of your dance video.

<p>It’s decision time now. In the showdown of ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro, which should you buy as your next device? </p><p>When it comes to the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra, which is effectively a rebadged ROB Phone 8, as Jonnalagadda points out, it might not live up to expectations. “ASUS went from making the best small phone,” he says in the review, “to a device that doesn’t quite have a distinct visual identity.” He loves the AI features and says ZenUI is one of his favorite Android skins. However, the cameras aren’t as good as those in its class, namely the Google Pixel 8 Pro. </p><p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro might not be as powerful a phone overall, and it doesn’t have as big a battery. But it has better cameras and is supported for longer than you’ll probably even keep the phone. That means when you are ready to upgrade, you have a better chance of getting good money if you want to resell or trade it in. You can also confidently hand it over to a friend or family member, and they’ll still be able to enjoy years of use with it. That counts for a lot. </p><p>Sutrich calls the Google Pixel 8 Pro the “king of the Androids,” and for good reason. With its combination of premium features, AI integration, fabulous cameras, and affordable price, it’s tough to beat. Thus, it makes sense as the top pick between these two. You’ll get more bang for your buck, and it will last a long, long time with solid new features flowing consistently through Feature Drops.

<p>With only two years of software updates, the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra is a solid premium yet affordable device to use for now if you plan to upgrade in a few years. Along with futuristic AI features, some of which are still in beta mode, it has a gloriously bright screen, decent cameras, and offers solid gaming performance. Plus, it has something virtually no phone has anymore: a headphone jack!</p></p>

<p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro remains the Android phone to beat when it comes to premium features yet affordable price.

But it’s the all-around best bang for your buck when it comes to Android phones.  </p></p>

<ul><li>Google Play Points has a weekly program that lets users have a chance at winning a "Weekly Prize."</li><li>This week, there's a "Super Weekly Prize," and it's the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro flagships.</li><li>There are 100 Pixel 8 and another 100 Pixel 8 Pro phones available, with both models featuring the Mint colorway.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Want a new smartphone? If you&apos;re a Google Play Points member, you might be in luck. This week, Google is adding a "Super Weekly Prize," and it&apos;s a Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro phone. Google is essentially raffling off smartphones to Play Points users, and there are 200 phones available in total. The promotion lasts from March 29 to April 4, but who knows how long it&apos;ll be until all the Pixel 8 devices are won, so you&apos;ll want to act pretty fast.</p><p>The Super Weekly Prize is available for Google Play Points members on the Gold, Platinum, and Diamond tiers, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/29/google-play-points-super-weekly-prize/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first spotted. Though 200 phones might sound like a lot, it&apos;s far and away the rarest prize available in the giveaway. There are 100 Pixel 8 and 100 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> phones available, but there are over 34,00 prizes available as Platinum Prizes.</p><p>Over 10,000 users can win 1,000 Google Play Points, and another 23,800 users can net 500 Google Play Points (Android Central&apos;s Derrek Lee was able to score this prize). Then, of course, there are the 200 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series phones, which are all in the Mint colorway that was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-mint-green">recently introduced as a mid-cycle refresh</a>. However, you could also end up receiving the regular weekly prize, not the Platinum Prizes listed.</p><p>The good thing is that you don&apos;t have to risk any Play Points for a shot at the Platinum Prizes; you only have to qualify for one of the three higher tiers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL" name="Google-Pixel-8-mint-colorway-holding-back-01.jpg" alt="The mint colorway of the Google Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here is some of the fine print related to the giveaway that Google shows in the Google Play Points page:</p>
<ul><li>Play to win one prize per week until Friday at 12:00 AM local time</li><li>Prizes may vary by level, and are available to Gold, Platinum, and Diamond levels. Additional eligibility requirements may apply.</li><li>Prizes are subject to availability and may be limited. New prizes are available on Friday at 12:00 AM local time.</li></ul>
<p>Playing for the grand prize is quick and easy. You have to claim the shot at the Super Weekly Prize on the Google Play Points page. Then, a medallion will appear on-screen, and you can tap it to reveal your prize. You&apos;ll learn instantly which prize you&apos;ve won, so there&apos;s no need to anxiously wait in anticipation. </p><p>Google says that prizes are limited in availability and may run out, but you can see how many of each prize are left before you play. </p>

This merger makes it seamless for users to watch all their content in one app rather than switching back and forth. If users aren&apos;t subscribed to the bundle, they can find Hulu&apos;s content available via "upsell options" across multiple devices at an added $2 monthly.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a> also wanted to make the merger visually evident, so it&apos;s launching a new campaign, starting off with a new logo. The company states the rollout will include a new Disney Plus intro color palette that mixes Hulu&apos;s green with the legacy blue.</p><p>Joe Earley, president of direct-to-consumer at Disney Entertainment, said, "[the] official launch of Hulu on Disney+ gives viewers even more opportunities to easily discover and enjoy thousands of titles all in one place, underscoring the extraordinary value of the Disney Bundle."</p>

The post adds the Pixel 9 may offer a completely flat display with four rounded corners around its frame. </p><p>There&apos;s more: in January, a batch of images leaked and were touted as the base Pixel 9, but information now suggests that it was the Pixel 9 Pro with a 6.1-inch flat display. At the same time, some more images of the device leaked, but OnLeaks claims that those were of a third model: the "Pixel 9 Pro XL," and not the Pro model.</p>

This is a big deal for a hollow set of unenforceable suggestions, so let&apos;s break down what this means for you and the world.</p><p>The core message is safe, secure, and trustworthy AI. Co-sponsored by over 120 countries, the resolution emphasizes developing AI that respects human rights and promotes sustainable development. It also says AI systems shouldn&apos;t discriminate or reinforce biases and should be designed to solve problems like climate change and poverty.</p><p>Sounds good enough, right? Even so, we still have a long way to go.</p>
<h2 id="what-apos-s-good-about-the-resolution-2">What&apos;s good about the resolution</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1170px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.30%;"><img id="uQW7JkVWyTjXAc7HsNCRjP" name="UN-general-assembly.jpg" alt="UN General Assembly" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQW7JkVWyTjXAc7HsNCRjP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1170" height="530" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: United Nations)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The resolution acknowledges the "digital divide" between developed and developing countries. Not everyone has equal access to technology, and the UN is calling for collaboration to ensure everyone has the chance to participate in the AI revolution. This could involve sharing resources and knowledge to help developing nations build their own AI capabilities.</p><p>The UN isn&apos;t just pointing fingers at governments here. This resolution is a call to action for everyone—countries, businesses, researchers, and even regular folks like you and me. We all have a role to play in shaping the future of AI. Because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your next phone</a> will be chock full of AI, you are doing your part even if you don&apos;t know it.</p>
<p>The UN&apos;s AI resolution is a positive step towards a future where AI works for everyone. By focusing on safety, human rights, and global cooperation, we can harness the power of AI to build a better world.</p><p>The resolution itself <em>isn&apos;t</em> a set of rules but a framework for future discussions and collaborations. It&apos;s a commitment from the international community to work together and ensure AI benefits all of humanity. We can expect to see more specific guidelines emerge in the coming years.... and that&apos;s its biggest problem.</p>
<h2 id="toothless-tiger-2">Toothless tiger</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="3jE89KMYBLKVFTNuwAe7La" name="kittens.jpg" alt="Kittens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3jE89KMYBLKVFTNuwAe7La.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PetsRadar.com)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This resolution promoting safe and beneficial artificial intelligence was a landmark achievement. It signifies a global recognition of the need to harness AI&apos;s power for good while mitigating potential risks. However, while this is a positive step, the resolution itself has limitations that require us to keep the conversation going.</p><p>The biggest shortcoming lies in the resolution&apos;s non-binding nature. Unlike Security Council resolutions, these don&apos;t hold legal weight. This means countries with vested interests in autonomous weapons development, for example, might not feel compelled to alter course. The resolution relies on "encouragement" for responsible AI development, which has limitations.</p>
<p>The UN is only as powerful as the few "major" countries allow it to be. Countries like China, Russia, and the United States usually only approve and support the UN when a thing aligns with their interests. Since these countries have the power to unilaterally veto any resolution, the good intentions of other member-states mean nothing.</p><p>A nonbinding agreement that was unanimously adopted means nothing. But it&apos;s the only way a resolution like this would pass. Getting "words on paper" is an important first step towards real, meaningful work.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="HXqHuXy6g2gEQ2LxYjRz9n" name="sundar-pichai-oct-2015-5.jpg" alt="Sundar Pichai" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXqHuXy6g2gEQ2LxYjRz9n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Without a global set of rules, each nation or governing body has to step in. We&apos;ve seen this with things like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">Biden Administration&apos;s recent order</a> that ensures the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and Department of Homeland Security are working towards a way to test that AI systems are both safe and secure before they are released. This followed a (nonbinding) agreement between 18 countries declaring that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-britain-other-countries-ink-agreement-make-ai-secure-by-design-2023-11-27/">AI systems be made secure by design</a>.</p><p>The EU has also enacted legislation regulating AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-provisional-agreement-ai-act-regulate-artificial-intelligence">making it the first government to do so</a>. In the landmark act, the EU also has laid the groundwork for enforcement options.</p><p>Another alternative way to self-regulate AI is what we&apos;ve seen in Canada. Before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-canada-launch">the release of Google Gemini</a>, Google met with "experts, policymakers, and regulators across different sectors" to ensure AI was responsible and worked well for the people of Canada, according to Product Manager Jules Walker.</p>
<p>Despite these shortcomings, the resolution is a crucial first step. It fosters international dialogue and establishes a foundation for future, more specific regulations. Here&apos;s what could be done as a next step:</p>
<ul><li>Member states can build upon the resolution by developing supplementary agreements with concrete enforcement mechanisms.</li><li>International bodies can work towards establishing global standards for AI development and deployment.</li><li>Developed nations can assist developing countries in building the infrastructure and expertise needed for responsible AI use.</li></ul>
<p>The UN&apos;s AI resolution might not be a silver bullet; it&apos;s a call to action. By acknowledging its limitations and working towards a more robust framework, we can ensure AI becomes a force for good on a global scale.</p><p>If the world instead chooses to ignore these guidelines, we&apos;ll see an AI free-for-all where a few powerful countries and corporations decide our fate.</p>

<ul><li>Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro smartphones have been facing display stuttering problems that date back to October 2023.</li><li>Now, Google has updated the Issue Tracker listing related to the problem, marking it as "fixed."</li><li>But the actual fix won't become available until Android 15 publicly releases, which is many months away. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A longtime Pixel bug finally has a resolution in sight, at least according to Google. The company updated an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/305195207?pli=1" target="_blank">Issue Tracker report</a> on March 26 related to display stuttering problems on Pixel 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> users (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-just-marked-pixel-scrolling-stutter-as-fixed/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). Google marked the issue as "fixed," but that designation comes with a massive catch. The fix won&apos;t actually roll out to Pixel 8 series device owners until Android 15 is publicly available, and that won&apos;t be for many more months. </p><p>"Ongoing optimizations in performance and power are slated for the next Android release," a Google employee wrote in an Issue Tracker comment. "These include improvements positively impacting overall system UI jank as well as use cases tied to some Android applications."</p><p>This timeline means that Pixel 8 users will need to wait even longer for a proper fix since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is slated for a likely release in late summer or fall. It could end up taking a full year for Google to fix this problem, considering that the first report in this Issue Tracker thread was posted October 14, 2023. </p><p>Users continued posting comments in the thread, with over 100 comments being posted in total. Pixel 8 owners recounted screen stutters in some system and first-party apps, like the Google Play Store. Others also noticed abnormalities in third-party apps, such as Reddit and X (formerly Twitter). </p>

<p>In the days since Google first marked the issues as fixed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> users flooded the Issue Tracker thread with commenters explaining their displeasure. One user called the fixed designation "a bad joke" and said it shows "Google either cannot solve the problem or is not taking it seriously."</p><p>"If we really have to wait till August or longer for this to be fixed...well, it&apos;s seriously going to impact my choice next time I purchase a smartphone," wrote another Pixel 8 user. </p><p>The length of time it will have taken Google to fix this issue is also being considered in light of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-pixel-8-update-promise">Google&apos;s promise of seven years of software support</a>. Apparently, the company is still struggling to fix issues in a timely manner. </p>

<ul><li>Instagram was spotted working on a new feature called "Blend," which would merge your tastes in Reels with a friend's for a thread of recommended short videos.</li><li>The feature is still in development, but its early description states that your Blend is private between you and one other person.</li><li>Instagram's Blend gives strong callbacks to a Spotify feature of the same name, which launched a few years back.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Instagram has been spotted working on "Blend," a way for users to gain a new perspective on Reels.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/alex193a/status/1773268623219396714?s=20">Alessandro Paluzzi</a> on X, Instagram has started developing "Bend" as a set of recommendations based on your Reels share history (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/instagram-is-developing-blend-recommended-reels-for-you-and-a-friend/">TechCrunch</a>). Essentially, a Blend would work by leveraging the sharing history of Reels between you and one other person.</p><p>Its description notes that these Blends are "private between the two of you. You can leave Blend at any time."</p><p>Speculation suggests that this Blend page, which looks like a personal DM thread, would surface a feed of Reels. However, some information remains unknown, like how often Instagram would enable Blend to be updated with new recommended Reels. </p><p>Additionally, it feels likely that Instagram would tuck Blend into its "New Message" option on its DMs page, but we&apos;ll have to wait and see.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">#Instagram is working on Blend: #Reels recommendations based on reels you've shared each other and your reels interests 👀ℹ️ Private between the two of you. You can leave a Blend at any time. pic.twitter.com/1kcssBuf7G<a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1773268623219396714">March 28, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>What&apos;s interesting about this feature is that Spotify launched a version of this back in 2021. The music streaming service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify-blend-now-official-letting-friends-compare-their-musical-taste">introduced Blend</a> as a way for up to 10 people to merge their tastes in music for a continuously changing playlist of songs. Their blended playlist would be updated daily and feature the users&apos; pictures beside songs they feel represent their combined taste.</p><p>The update cadence of Spotify&apos;s version is quite quick — and helps stir in variety and discovery daily. It&apos;s not clear how deep in development Instagram is of its coming iteration, so we might be a ways away from its arrival.</p><p>Meanwhile, a little bit of fun was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-play-pong-with-emojis-in-this-secret-instagram-game">added to Instagram&apos;s DMs</a> earlier this month by way of the classic game "Pong." As a slight change, users can play Pong with a friend using emojis. Users can kickstart this secret DM game by sending an emoji to a friend or receiving one from them. Tapping their emoji (or vice versa) will produce the hidden game of Pong.</p>

<hr>
<p>An email sent out to all Meta Quest developers detailed Meta&apos;s end-of-life strategy for the original Oculus Quest. The email notes that no new apps or games may support the original Oculus Quest after April 30, 2024. Furthermore, apps and games published after April 30 will not show up when searched for on an Oculus Quest 1.</p><p>Meta announced its original plans to sunset support for the Quest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-oculus-quest-1-needs-to-die-but-now-is-not-the-right-time">last January</a>, but the original date for disallowing new apps was extended a few months. Originally, Meta planned to keep new Quest 1 apps from being published starting January 1, 2024.</p><p>This all means that developers can no longer make new games supporting the original Quest after May 1, which means customers will need to upgrade to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-quest-2-vs-quest-3">Quest 2 or Quest 3</a> if they want to continue to play brand new games. Many developers stopped supporting the original Quest in the past year or so, and Meta stopped supporting multiplayer parties on the system in March 2023.</p><p>Beyond that, Meta will send out the last monthly security update in August 2024, signifying the official end of life for the company&apos;s first major standalone VR headset. Users will still be able to access games they own and use the Quest as a PCVR headset, so while it won&apos;t become a paperweight, it would be smart to upgrade to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-128gb-vs-512gb">Meta Quest 3 128GB or 512GB</a> headset to keep playing the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a> in the future.</p>

<ul><li>The Google Home team held an AMA on Reddit, and users chimed in heavily to voice their displeasure and curiosity about the app's development.</li><li>The team teased that there's more to come for Google Home on the web, stating "additional controls" are on the way.</li><li>A Google Home member stated that there is a "vision and roadmap" behind their development of the app and its features, but specifics weren't stated.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google Home team held an AMA (ask me anything) on Reddit, answering questions about its web availability and devices. While many users took the opportunity to complain, the Google Home team provided a bit of insight into the future of the platform.</p><p>Several product and engineering managers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/were_the_team_behind_the_latest_updates_to_nest/?share_id=D99o-RHMpgSW0jKzLr3MR&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1">were on deck to reply</a> to users&apos; questions as things got underway. One user had a lengthy post, asking questions about Google Home&apos;s controls on the web, devices, and the removal of Assistance in favor of Gemini. Jacqueline, a product manager, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/comment/kx16o89/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">responded by stating</a>, "We&apos;re working on bringing additional device control to Google Home for web."</p><p>The team didn&apos;t have much more to say about what sort of controls users could expect, but the new additions would appear in a Public Preview first. The Home team declined to comment any further about AI in its devices.</p><p>Topics turned into questioning about when Google would bring an offline mode to the Home app. Team member Daniel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/comment/kwztl8z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">said</a>, "We&apos;re focusing first on routing more of your interactions locally (thanks to Matter!) to get the reliability and latency benefits." The post added that once Google feels it has a "significant" amount of your traffic operating locally, it will shift to focus on bringing "powerful" offline capabilities through the app.</p><p>Cohesiveness, or lack thereof, was another talking point for one user. Google Home&apos;s Daniel took the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/comment/kwzx5cr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">lead once more</a>, stating that the team has a "vision and roadmap" to help them navigate the process of software and product development.</p><p>Daniel mentioned the Home team&apos;s need to create a brand new UI experience to accommodate its new camera protocols and acknowledged that it could cause "frustration and pain" for the user.</p><p>We&apos;re still left wondering what Google Home&apos;s current roadmap is for app development, as they did not share further.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/were_the_team_behind_the_latest_updates_to_nest">We’re the team behind the latest updates to Nest devices and Google Home for web - ask us anything!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome">r/googlehome</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Despite the Home team declining to divulge its roadmap, mentioning the Matter connectivity standard for smart homes is a good starting point. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-2-upgrade-details">Matter 1.2 upgrade</a> launched in October 2023, bringing with it support for nine device types. Moreover, the Matter standard helps smart devices communicate with one another (locally) instead of running through a company like Google.</p><p>Meanwhile, the latest Google Home update arrived for its web app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-for-web-getting-camera-history-and-clip-editor-in-new-update">earlier in March</a>. The update brought camera history and a clip editor to web users, which were highly requested features the community pushed for. The latter enabled users to chop down and save clips that their cameras have recorded for other uses.</p><p>The update also brought the availability of the Public Preview testing space for Home web users to test new features.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Meta/Oculus Quest 2</a> may be a bit outdated at this point, but it still ranks among the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headsets</a> that money can buy. Now just $199.99, the Quest 2 boasts an ultra-immersive 90Hz display, 6GB of RAM, and up to 2.5 hours of battery life on a single charge. You'll also get access to nearly all of the same <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a> that are available on the Meta Quest 3, but at a much lower cost. </p>
<p>Pick up this acclaimed headset from Best Buy and you'll also get over $150 worth of free extras, including a pair of Logitech headphones that'll make your VR experience feel much more immersive and lifelike. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/meta-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb-gray/6473553.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="82cedc8d-4af7-4b43-8218-9ba14152e29f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.99" data-dimension48="$249.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>I&apos;m no mathematician, but lets break down the numbers here. For a single payment of $199.99, you&apos;ll be getting the 128GB VR headset, a pair of Logitech Chorus Off-Ear Headphones designed specifically for the Quest <strong>(a $99.99 value)</strong>, a three-month subscription to YouTube Premium <strong>(a $41.97 value)</strong>, and one month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate <strong>(a $16.99 value)</strong>. Add it all up and you&apos;re looking at over $150 worth of free stuff, and that&apos;s without counting the Meta Quest 2&apos;s new low price. No kidding. It&apos;s no wonder we&apos;re calling this the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-oculus-quest-2-prices-and-deals">best Meta Quest 2 deal</a> of the month.</p><p>Sure, the Quest 2 is a bit old at this point, but it&apos;s an excellent choice if you&apos;re new to the world of VR gaming and you want to try out a great headset without a major investment. That said, if money is no object, you&apos;ll definitely want to upgrade to the newer Meta Quest 3 for $499. Looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-quest-2-vs-quest-3">Meta Quest 2 vs Meta Quest 3</a>, the Quest 3 improves upon its predecessor in all of the areas where it counts, from speed and responsiveness to its lighter construction. </p><p>But if you&apos;re a casual gamer and you just want a fun VR experience with access to loads of games, this Quest 2 deal is for you. </p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s Care Plus team has started notifying users of the impending availability of unlimited battery repairs for eligible devices and certain plans.</p><p>An email received by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-care-plus-battery-repair-3429615/">Android Authority</a> shows that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/samsung-care-plus/">Samsung Care Plus</a> is planning to introduce support for unlimited battery repairs in May. The email states that those who have purchased Samsung Care Plus with Loss and Theft protection or the standard Care Plus plan are eligible for unlimited battery repairs.</p><p>More importantly, your device is only eligible for a battery repair if its charging capacity drops below 79%. Samsung states this can be confirmed through a diagnostics check and if it&apos;s below that line, your battery will be replaced. Of course, Samsung will only handle repairs during an active coverage period.</p><p>Speaking of, the email adds that users can mail in their devices or walk into a Samsung store for battery repairs. The company adds that your device will remain eligible for a battery repair as part of your plan so long as there is no "additional damage."</p><p>With this new support beginning in May, Samsung states consumers will be charged an extra $2 per month. Your payment method of choice will be charged on May 1, 2024, serving as "confirmation that you accept these changes and that you wish to continue."</p>

<p>Walk-ins for battery repairs are a welcome sight as Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-batteries-plus-expanded-partnership">expanded its partnership</a> with Batteries Plus last October. The expansion saw 35 stores across the U.S. convert into Samsung Authorization Service Centers. This allows consumers to enter and speak to Galaxy device professionals for insight into what&apos;s wrong with their devices. Moreover, the partnership included support for foldable device repairs.</p><p>But this email notifying users of unlimited battery repair goes hand-in-hand with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-brings-back-a-battery-feature-it-had-previously-removed">returning One UI feature</a>. One UI 6.1 has brought back the "since last charge" screen, giving users more insight into what apps are soaking up power and how long their battery has left. The "Today" page has remained, letting users check in and see how apps affect their battery daily.</p>
