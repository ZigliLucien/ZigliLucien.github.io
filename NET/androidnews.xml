<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The second-generation OnePlus Open may not be released in 2024, possibly due to the delay in the launch of the OPPO Find N5.</li><li>Given that OnePlus and OPPO are sister companies, their product launches are often interconnected.</li><li>It is also possible that the OnePlus Open 2 might feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset instead of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a> turned heads as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">fan-favorite foldable phone</a> last year, and many thought OnePlus would quickly follow up with a sequel this year. But it looks like we&apos;ll have to wait a bit longer for its successor.</p><p>As per a post by Kartikey Singh on X (formerly Twitter), it looks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> might not be launched in 2024, supposedly because the OPPO Find N5 is also taking a rain check on its launch for this year (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-Open-2-Second-gen-OnePlus-foldable-will-not-be-released-this-year.835460.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's basically confirmed that Oppo will not release the Oppo Find N5 Series this year thus no OnePlus Open 2 as well!<a href="https://twitter.com/That_Kartikey/status/1788815412882272698">May 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Both OnePlus and OPPO are sister companies under the same parent organization, so their product launches can sometimes be interrelated. If the Find N5 is delayed, it&apos;s possible that the Open 2 might face a similar fate.</p><p>The OnePlus Open 2 is hyped up as the eagerly awaited follow-up to its well-loved predecessor. It&apos;s widely speculated that the Open 2 will probably follow the same path as its predecessor, being essentially a revamped version of the upcoming OPPO foldable device, just as the first OnePlus Open was pretty much a clone of the OPPO Find N3.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/chunvn8888/status/1789148176378974628" target="_blank">reply from another X user</a> seems to confirm the delay. Adding fuel to the fire, the post suggests that the OnePlus Open 2 could be powered by the Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> chipset.</p><p>With the original Open having debuted in late 2023, skipping a year feels like a missed opportunity. Typically, companies refresh their phone lineup annually, so it&apos;s a letdown to consider that the OnePlus Open 2 might not make its debut this year.</p><p>In addition to the OnePlus Open 2, there have been rumors swirling about OnePlus venturing into the clamshell foldable segment. The mysterious OnePlus Flip device has been whispered about, but details are scarce. Speculation suggests it could be a rebranded version of the Oppo Find N5 Flip, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_find_n5_flip_is_canceled_according_to_purported_2024_foldable_launch_lineup-news-61896.php" target="_blank">which has reportedly been canceled</a>.</p><p>OnePlus did seem to take its sweet time before jumping on the foldable phone trend. But if the company is holding off on launching the second model to fine-tune or beef up its features, it&apos;s probably worth the wait.</p>

<p>Google I/O 2024 arrives this Tuesday, and we expect a Wear OS 5 announcement. The last three I/Os gave us a massive Wear OS 3 overhaul (2021), a Pixel Watch reveal (2022), and a Wear OS 4 preview (2023). After two bombshells, last year&apos;s wearable news was more perfunctory, so I&apos;m crossing my fingers for a bounce-back year with a long-overdue fitness fix to Wear OS. </p><p>We know that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">Wear OS 5</a> is on the I/O schedule, with a talk on "Building for the Future of Wear OS." Google might bring up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">new Hybrid Interface</a> that gives Wear OS watches longer battery life, or perhaps it&apos;ll announce plans to bring Wear OS watches into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">new Find My network</a>. </p><p>We might see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> coming to Pixel and Galaxy Watches, given I/O&apos;s likely AI focus. And perhaps we&apos;ll get a glimpse of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, even if it won&apos;t arrive until the fall.</p><p>Those all seem like fair bets for your Google I/O bingo card. What&apos;s less likely, but still important, is that the Wear OS team announces a proper OS-wide replacement for the dying Google Fit. Maybe that&apos;s Fitbit, maybe not; it just needs to be <em>something</em>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:912px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Y4JAHKKcRDawpc4WjfGF5" name="Health-Connect-promo-image.jpeg" alt="The Health Connect promotional image from the Android Developers Blog" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y4JAHKKcRDawpc4WjfGF5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="912" height="513" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-has-set-a-deadline-to-shut-down-the-google-fit-api">Google Fit API shuts down next year</a> in favor of "Android Health," a new API with universal data categories like steps, distance, and calories. Designed to work with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a>, it&apos;ll seamlessly transfer data between apps, with the ability to export niche data like blood glucose or pressure once watches start tracking them.</p><p>Sounds great, in theory! In practice, it still creates a vacuum where Google Fit used to sit as an agnostic option. You can transfer data, but you still need an end destination, and most fitness apps are designed to trap you in their ecosystem and charge you a fee. Yes, the Google Fit app is still available, but the writing is on the wall for the app to get the boot now that Google has turned its attention to Fitbit. Samsung Health is the closest "universal" and unpaid alternative, though that app is only available on Samsung smartwatches.</p><p>One could argue that health and fitness apps are a key way <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> differentiate themselves from one another these days, as it seems to be the big draw for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch</a>. Also, these companies sell your health and fitness data to advertisers, and a universal app might prevent smaller brands from profiting. So, with a universal fitness app experience, how would Wear OS watches stand out from each other?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eNsm2GAuCcwLBfV5CNd8L6" name="Google-Fit-smartphone-smartwatch-wide.jpeg" alt="Smartwatches around a smartphone with the Google Fit logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eNsm2GAuCcwLBfV5CNd8L6.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Samsung joined Wear OS, Google didn&apos;t insist that it abandon its own apps, UI, and unique approach; leaving Samsung Health as the default option is part of that. As for other brands, they might not want their apps to have to compete with Fitbit or Samsung Health. </p><p>That doesn&apos;t change the fact that the Wear OS <strong>brand</strong> suffers from this fragmentation. Every non-Samsung/Google watch has a proprietary app that&apos;s usually stripped down compared to what dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> offer, such as workout recommendations and recovery times. The same goes with Apple Fitness Plus, with its popular workout videos.</p><p>Instead, we saw how OnePlus&apos; first Wear OS offering — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> — had issues with health sampling, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-wear-os-exit-shows-platform-improvements-less-competitive">Fossil abandoned Wear OS</a> for good because it couldn&apos;t keep up on the software front with its woefully lackluster Wellness app. Without more support from Google, I&apos;m not certain how many third-party brands will break out of their small niches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TBQVmTKxkHmcGoHtRtu5eP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-Fitbit-readiness-score-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch next to an Android phone showing a Fitbit Daily Readiness Score." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TBQVmTKxkHmcGoHtRtu5eP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What&apos;s the solution? My first plan is simple enough and would make for a splashy Google I/O announcement: Say Fitbit is coming to all Wear OS watches with Wear OS 5, either via the Play Store or as an alternative "default" option — the same way you can choose between Bixby or Google Assistant on a Galaxy Watch. </p><p>Yes, this makes Wear OS watches more uniform. However, health data is just as vital for a good smartwatch experience as Google Assistant or apps; Samsung prefers its users to use the Galaxy Store or Bixby, but at least there are reliable Google alternatives. </p><p>As far as how Wear OS watches would stand out, there are still other ways to differentiate between different models in their design, displays, UI, and so forth, without leaving health and fitness as this Wild West marketplace.</p><p>This move would also give the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-confining-fitbit-makes-financial-sense-but-missed-opportunity">struggling Fitbit brand</a> a bigger profile with Android users. I&apos;d even suggest that Google compensate partners like Mobvoi or OnePlus by cutting them in on the profits for any Fitbit subscriptions bought on their watches after the trial period ends. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TxCrE5NDybCNSrfW872aV7" name="OnePlus-Watch-2-vs-Google-Pixel-Watch-2-wearing-01.jpg" alt="The OnePlus Watch 2 and Pixel Watch 2 worn on left and right wrists" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TxCrE5NDybCNSrfW872aV7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My other solution would play into Google&apos;s love of renaming services that fulfill the same purpose: Just make "Android Health" an app like Google Fit. Give it some basic goals and coaching, make it free, and let people use it as a waystation between their Wear OS watch and whichever proprietary fitness app they prefer.</p><p>Eventually, I expect Google to offer something like "Gemini Coach AI," which looks at your health data and gives you recommendations on sleep, training, and recovery. But unless that&apos;s another Fitbit exclusive to sell Pixel Watches, then it will still need a uniform Wear OS fitness experience. </p><p>We&apos;ll see if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024">Google I/O 2024</a> has a fitness surprise in store for us this year, Fitbit-related or otherwise. All I know is that, at some point, Google&apos;s choice to leave its Wear OS partners to fend for themselves on health and fitness — the first priority for a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watch</a> buyers — could backfire on them.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Last night, an intense storm gave the world quite a show as it ignited the sky with an array of colors that many south of the Arctic rarely get a chance to see. Many set their sights on the sky, which was ablaze with stunning views of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/15139-northern-lights-auroras-earth-facts-sdcmp.html">northern lights (or aurora borealis)</a>, now vividly emblazoned into all our minds and on our phones.</p><p>I was a bit late to the party, but as soon as I could, I made my way up to my rooftop to try and capture the event. I live in Seattle, so this is definitely not a common occurrence. Fortunately, the skies were much clearer than they were for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-friends-google-pixel-7-pro-april-8-eclipse">recent solar eclipse</a> (save for some light pollution), which was blocked off by the gloomy Seattle weather. So, I grabbed my Pixel 8 Pro and Galaxy S24 Plus and pointed up, curious to see how both phones would capture the event.</p>
<h2 id="pixel-vs-galaxy-2">Pixel vs. Galaxy</h2>
<p>I tried to shoot the exact scene with both phones each time I snapped a photo, alternating one after the other. Since they were both in night mode, I tried to stay as still as possible, and holding both at the same time wouldn&apos;t really work. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> made it easy to see where I was shooting, but the viewfinder on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> wasn&apos;t really doing me any favors, and much of the time, it was just guesswork.</p><p>I also had both phones alternate between auto night mode and max night mode to see if there would be any visual difference (there wasn&apos;t) with the extra few seconds. Eventually I just kept them both on auto to see how they would fare (the Galaxy would usually take one extra second to capture the scene than the Pixel), and I was a little surprised at the differences between the results.</p><p>I chose not to edit the images to compare the raw output from both phones.</p>

<p>The images from the Pixel 8 Pro were much more true to life than what the Galaxy S24 Plus captured. The colors were a bit more muted, and the image was overall much softer, although there was a lot of light pollution where I was, so the auroras were not as vibrant. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S24 Plus seemed quite aggressive with its colors, punching up the saturation more than I personally prefer. </p>

<p>I admit it the punched up saturation could sometimes make for a cooler image, but overall, I preferred the photos from the Pixel for being much brighter, even if I wish they had more contrast.</p>

<p>The Pixel 8 also seemed to do a better job of capturing the stars in the sky despite the auroras and light pollution from the city.</p>
<h2 id="astrophotography-mode-on-the-pixel-8-pro-came-in-clutch-2">Astrophotography mode on the Pixel 8 Pro came in clutch</h2>
<p>Before I grabbed my Galaxy S24 Plus, I took a few images of the sky using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography mode on my Pixel</a> to see if that would provide better results than the default night mode. Unfortunately, they weren&apos;t much better than what night mode captured, but the cool thing about this mode is that it also captures a short timelapse in addition to an image, which made all the waiting around more worthwhile.</p>

Essentially, it&apos;s like skimming through the video instead of manually skipping through slower parts. </p><p>YouTube&apos;s algorithm will pick these key points in a video, and you can skip them. Or, if you&apos;re in the middle of watching a video, you can "jump ahead" to the closest key point in a YouTube video. </p><p>This option likely won&apos;t work for every YouTube video, as it is currently being tested. It could be based on how many views a video gets— because  YouTube needs a large enough viewer sample size to identify those key points. While these are some things we speculate, it is to be seen how YouTube will roll out this feature in the future. </p>

The catch—Motorola claims the device can get enough power "for the day" in just thirty minutes.</p><p>Moto G Stylus furthers its capabilities with a 6.7-inch pOLED display that rocks a 120Hz refresh rate. Motorola adds that the Full HD+ resolution makes the display feel brighter, sharper, and clearer. Moreover, the company is touting the phone&apos;s multitasking abilities, stating users can take notes while binge-watching a show.</p><p>Stylus comes with a larger contact area and improved software, which enhances the pen&apos;s mobility for a smoother experience. Motorola has implemented a new UI when using stylus-specific features. Additionally, users can add an array of "favorite apps" for the pen that will appear when it&apos;s taken out.</p><p>The phone comes with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-6-gen-1-snapdragon-4-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 6 Gen 1</a> chip and Android 14 out of the box. Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-review">last year&apos;s edition</a>, the 2024 G Stylus 5G boasts a vertical dual-camera array. It contains a 50MP primary lens, a 13MP ultrawide camera, and a 32MP centered selfie camera.</p><p>The device has a 5,000mAh battery with 30W TurboPower wired charging and 15W when charged wirelessly. It hits shelves on May 30 for $399 in Scarlet Wave and Caramel Latte. On the same date as U.S. consumers, Canadians can grab the phone for $499 CAD.</p>

That&apos;s nothing new, as Google&apos;s Pixel "a" series of phones has always been of great value, but this year, Google has stepped things up a notch.</p><p>You&apos;re basically getting a Pixel 8 disguised as a "budget" phone, saving you $200. I love to see it. Unless something catastrophic happens once it gets into people&apos;s hands, this one will be the phone to buy if you&apos;re looking for something really good and don&apos;t want to spend too much.</p>

<p>It makes you wonder how Google can afford to do this. Year after year, Google sells an A-series Pixel phone that offers exceptional value compared to anything else out there. However, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Samsung&apos;s Fan Edition models</a>, there have always been compromises. Early Pixel A phones were slippery plastic with underpowered chips inside that performed OK but didn&apos;t pack flagship hardware. </p><p>I&apos;m sure the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> is missing something important to someone, but a glance at the hardware tells me that small differences in the cameras, a lack of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, and a different version of Gorilla Glass are the biggest changes from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>. You still get all the fancy Gemini and camera <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-8a-packs-just-as-much-ai-punch-as-the-standard-pixel-8">software AI tricks</a>, the same services, and the same connectivity options.</p>
<p>Google isn&apos;t losing money doing this. While it&apos;s more expensive outside of the U.S., the Pixel 8a can still be a money-maker at just $499 because it does the most important thing for Google&apos;s business — gets a good phone in your hands and in front of your eyeballs.</p><p>Google is more than a hardware company. I&apos;d say it isn&apos;t much of a hardware company at all and only does it to get devices into as many hands as possible. Google is also an advertising company, a software company, and a services company. That&apos;s why it sells hardware in the first place.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yQGCAJDvQgVwt55RRaFZAW" name="iphone-se-2022-8.jpg" alt="iPhone SE 2022 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yQGCAJDvQgVwt55RRaFZAW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some companies, like Apple or Samsung, also provide software services, but the bulk of their business is hardware sales. </p><p>Both have tried to sell a "flagship-budget" phone and had some level of success before drifting away from the idea. Samsung can make more money selling great midrange phones that are more than good enough for almost everyone, and Apple manages to make most of the money despite having only 20% of the worldwide market because it&apos;s streamlined the manufacturing process — there&apos;s a lot of profit made from a single iPhone.</p><p>This is what works for Apple and Samsung, and both are very successful. Google doesn&apos;t make any money from selling phones or tablets. It makes money from people who <em>use</em> phones or tablets, no matter which brand people are buying from. If you use the internet, Google will probably make money from it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FFvZEBujRzeeVAA4ZSMsMf" name="google-gemini-mwc-sign.jpg" alt="Google Gemini on Android at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FFvZEBujRzeeVAA4ZSMsMf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 8a is also a vehicle for Google&apos;s software and subscription services. If you have a phone with a good camera, you&apos;ll use it more and might be tempted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google&apos;s cloud offerings</a>. If your phone is fast and has a great screen, you&apos;ll watch more YouTube and might buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-use-youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a>. When your phone is better at playing games, you might spend money on Google Play.</p><p>All of this applies to any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a>. It also applies to people using an iPhone. Here&apos;s a shocker though — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/global-smartphone-market-share-q1-2024">most people aren&apos;t buying $1,000 phones</a>. Getting a phone that feels like a $1,000 phone into more hands means more people will be tempted to go all-in with Google&apos;s software because it&apos;s there and it works.</p>
<p>It&apos;s tough to find a new phone that isn&apos;t good enough. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheapest Android phones</a> are pretty amazing compared to how things were a few years ago. Google can afford to sell the Pixel 8a without much per-unit profit because getting a great phone in more hands is more important.</p><p>I think the Pixel 8a is Google&apos;s <em>real</em> flagship phone.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Polar <em>had</em> to make the Vantage V3. Fitness rivals have spent recent years adding AMOLED displays, new sensors for sleep tracking, maps, and other "mainstream" smartwatch tools. Meanwhile, dual-band GPS has become a near-necessity for fitness watches at all prices. Polar needed to bring these features to a flagship watch to keep its loyal fans satisfied. </p><p>Your attitude towards the Polar Vantage V3 will vary based on whether or not you&apos;re a long-time Polar user. You may already have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watch</a> with some of these features, or perhaps you&apos;ve used a GPS-only MIP watch for years and have to decide whether or not the Vantage V3 offers enough for you to upgrade. </p><p>After months on and off with the Polar Vantage V3, I&apos;ll say that it won&apos;t change your current perspective on Polar as a brand. Polar Flow is unchanged. The on-watch UI is the same. The big draws are still the Fitspark workout recs and the training load algorithm guiding your workout calendar and recovery. </p><p>That might be enough for Polar fans, but is it enough to justify the high price and lure fans of Garmin, COROS, or Suunto watches? Let&apos;s dive in.</p>
<h2 id="review-disclaimer-2">Review disclaimer</h2>
<p>I originally received a Polar Vantage V3 loaner in December 2023. This model would crash during long hiking or running activities, showing an endless flashing Polar symbol that could only be solved by a factory reboot. I received a replacement unit after Polar&apos;s support team couldn&apos;t crack the issue. </p><p>After months of use, I haven&apos;t had a single crash or software issue. I, therefore, assume that Polar&apos;s initial batch of watches may have had hardware issues but that any new Vantage V3 models have had the issues fully resolved. That being said, I wouldn&apos;t recommend buying it used to avoid potential issues like mine. </p>

<p>The Polar Vantage V3 launched in October 2023 at $599 / CA$879 / €599 / £519. That puts it on the same pricing scale as other premium multisport watches like the Garmin Forerunner 965 ($599) and COROS VERTIX 2S ($699), though higher than many AMOLED <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> in the $300–$500 range (APEX 2 Pro, Suunto Race).</p><p>The watch ships in three colors: Night Black, Sky Blue, and Sunrise Apricot. It comes with a 22mm silicone band of matching color and a proprietary USB-C charging cable with magnetic contact points. You can buy spare bands in different colors for $35–40. Thankfully, unlike the Vantage V2, you don&apos;t need an adapter to attach standard Quick Release bands. </p><p>Polar lets you bundle in the popular H10 chest strap for $649 total; it normally costs $90 or more. Also, you can get free trials of Komoot or Strava when buying the Vantage V3, though you&apos;ll have to opt into Polar marketing emails first. </p>

<p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-pacer-pro-review">Polar Pacer Pro</a> I reviewed a couple of years back, the Polar Vantage V3 has a UI similar to Tiles on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>. You swipe left & right or tap the Up/Down buttons to move between full-display widgets showing key information like daily step percentage, weekly mileage, nightly sleep and recharge data, cardio load status, Fitspark workout suggestions, and the daily forecast. </p><p>I have a couple of nitpicks with Polar&apos;s overall data approach, but I think this method is very accessible. Most of the watch&apos;s summarized data can be accessed in a few seconds without needing the mobile app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="a9ewMHe9ahUTfB6YdE5HvL" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-post-run-calories.jpeg" alt="Post-run calorie burn and bar graph showing the percentage of fat, carbs, and protein burn." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a9ewMHe9ahUTfB6YdE5HvL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Polar jumped on the AMOLED bandwagon, and I&apos;m grateful for it. MIP displays (like the Vantage V2&apos;s) are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">becoming less popular</a> despite their outdoor readability and lower power demands. As it happens, the Vantage V3 lasts ten days (four more than the V2) thanks to an extra 142mAh capacity, so there&apos;s little trade-off. The pixel-rich Vantage V3 display is as bright, colorful, and readable indoors as any AMOLED watch, with a fairly narrow bezel.</p><p>Polar promises 43 hours of dual-band GPS tracking per charge in its spec sheet. In practice, a normal smartwatch battery drain will bring that number significantly lower in-between daily workouts. Despite this, I&apos;m impressed by the battery life the Vantage V3 offers, among the best out there.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4KTxcEL7drpvpNZkefFgdg" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-running-power.jpeg" alt="Running Power calculation on the Polar Vantage V3 during a run" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KTxcEL7drpvpNZkefFgdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At 57g/2oz with the strap, it&apos;s on the heavier side but on par with most other premium running watches in this range, like the Forerunner 965 (53g) and APEX 2 Pro (66g). The same applies to its 13.5mm thickness: it&apos;s just thin enough to be comfortable compared to many rivals in the 14mm+ range.</p><p>The in-box silicone strap is comfortable enough, though a bit more rigid than I&apos;m used to; it helps prevent any wobbling during runs, but feeding the strap through the lugs can be surprisingly tricky. I do wish Polar let you choose nylon instead of silicone to mitigate the weight a bit, but you can buy one separately.</p><p>Polar made a surprising choice by giving the Vantage V3 an aluminum frame. That&apos;s the default for your typical smartwatch, but some fitness brands default to a durable polymer that&apos;s light but ugly. In this case, the Vantage V3 has a pleasant metallic sheen, accentuated by its long, textured buttons. It still looks like a fitness watch but without the usual plastic brick look to which I&apos;ve grown accustomed. </p>

<p>Aside from the dual-band GPS, the biggest change from the Vantage V2 to the V3 is that Polar caught up to the industry for health data with SpO2, ECG, and skin temperature readings. Of the three, only skin temp is measured passively at night, while you must spot-check for blood oxygen and AFib. It&apos;s a step in the right direction, though I do hope Polar offers overnight SpO2 or altitude acclimation data in the future. </p>
<p>As someone who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">hates sleeping with a smartwatch</a>, the Polar Vantage V3 is decently comfortable to wear, and it provides some useful insights into your sleep zones, restlessness, recovery time, skin temperature variation, and so on. </p><p>I&apos;ve had to go into the Polar app to adjust my wake-up time on certain nights. In one case, it marked me as waking up at 5:30 instead of 6:30, but when I adjusted the time, it still had my sleep zones for that last hour, including some brief REM sleep. </p><p>Polar&apos;s Recovery Pro data, focused on your sleep quality, HRV stress data, recent training, and other metrics, more than competes with the "daily readiness" scores of other brands without needing a subscription. That might lessen the sting of the Vantage V3&apos;s high price.</p>

<p>I&apos;m a big fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-i-love-polars-manual-vo2-max-and-recovery-tests">Polar&apos;s Tests feature</a>, which includes an Orthostatic test — previously requiring an H10 chest strap — and leg stiffness tests. Essentially, you can take HRV readings to spot-check your Cardio Load Recovery and readiness to work out or leap up and down in place to test your Muscle Load Recovery. </p><p>This provides some useful insights I would normally miss out on by refusing to wear my smartwatches for sleep tracking like Recovery Pro.</p><p>Beyond that, the separation between cardio and muscle load is a welcome addition. Polar uses your running power data to judge your muscle soreness, as a separate calculation from whatever heart fatigue you&apos;ll experience from a hard workout. Polar then uses this data to determine your training&apos;s short-term strain on your body and long-term build-up of your tolerance, to decide whether or not you&apos;re improving or overtraining. </p><p>Combining the two, Polar gives you active and passive tools for guiding your fitness routine, with an easy-to-understand widget summarizing your training progress and body status. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CTWET4yLyN2RrcgPqvfkfP" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-fitspark-workout-suggestion.jpeg" alt=""Today's suggestion: Liberate your muscles" screen on the Polar Vantage V3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CTWET4yLyN2RrcgPqvfkfP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Polar&apos;s "Fitspark" algorithm, connected to your Cardio Load data, recommends different types of workouts you could complete in your current state. </p><p>For instance, when I&apos;m fully recovered, Polar recommends I complete a 30-minute bodyweight workout—with a list of exercises like Good Mornings and Bench Dips and little stick figures showing how to complete them—to gain Strength or a 50-minute run in specific zones to improve Cardio, with recommendations for when to fuel or hydrate. </p><p>I love Polar&apos;s recommended indoor exercises, something no other brand offers; Garmin has something similar with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">its indoor workouts</a>, but without the auto-generated routines, its animated exercise examples are harder to find. </p><p>Polar&apos;s outdoor cardio runs are a bit less instructive. They focus on duration and heart rate zones so you hit the right effort level. You won&apos;t get any estimate of how fast Polar thinks you&apos;ll need to run to hit those zones, though. I appreciate that Polar gives you multiple workout options per day, but they&apos;re never quite as specialized as the ones I get from Garmin (aka targeting low aerobic zones or recommending specific intervals).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="EKTMVAndYfRSrCWsYnMDxm" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-heart-rate-zones.jpeg" alt="Post-run heart rate zones on the Polar Vantage V3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EKTMVAndYfRSrCWsYnMDxm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Polar&apos;s personalized running program fills in that gap to an extent. You mark down a target race distance from 5K to marathon, how many times and for how long you train per week, and get weeks of recommended runs, strength training, and rest days. Those auto-generated runs typically recommend Zone 2, 3, and 4 runs at specific points in the week. </p><p>I find Polar&apos;s marathon program a bit simplistic and repetitive, without enough variety in the types of runs, but it&apos;s certainly an effective structure and foundation to improve as a runner. I use them as a guide for the effort level to match, while adjusting them to my preferred mileage and effort level. </p>

<p>The last significant Vantage V3 upgrade is that it has 32GB for offline maps, with your region&apos;s "basic" continental data downloaded by default. You&apos;ll want to connect your watch to your computer and download the detailed maps for your region. You can&apos;t use the storage for anything else (like music), so there&apos;s plenty of room.</p><p>Once you download the maps, you get excellent topographical detail of your trail surroundings and decent speed when zooming out or scrolling around (with the occasional delayed loading).</p><p>You&apos;ll have to make a Komoot account to create routes with turn-by-turn navigation. I wrestled with whether to consider this a positive or negative; Komoot is a great hiking app and is typically free for your local region, and I suppose I&apos;d rather get a great third-party option than a stripped-down first-party alternative. But if you prefer another app for GPX route files like Strava or Alltrails, be prepared to switch brands or frequently export to another app. </p>

<p>Anyone with the Vantage V2 might find the V3 upgrade tempting for the dual-band GPS tracking alone. Otherwise, Polar is best known for its heart rate chest straps, and you might assume its smartwatches would have excellent heart rate accuracy as well. So, I put that to the test. </p><p>First, I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">tested the Vantage V3 against the Forerunner 965 and VERTIX 2S</a> for GPS and heart rate accuracy. In that test, Polar&apos;s GPS map didn&apos;t do especially well at points, shoving my path into buildings or the middle of the street where Garmin and COROS were more on point. However, for heart rate, the Vantage V3 came quite close to the Polar H10 in accuracy and responsiveness, and it did the best of the three for elevation tracking. </p>

<p>I decided to give the Polar Vantage V3 its fair shake and do another GPS run in the same conditions to see if its issues were a fluke or not. This time, it did significantly better, though still imperfectly. You can see in the screenshots above how Polar (<em>blue</em>) compares to Garmin (<em>dark red</em>) for dual-band GPS accuracy. </p><p>Neither stays perfectly on my path, with the left-wristed Forerunner and right-wristed Polar splaying out like I&apos;m a dozen feet wide. That said, in specific instances, Garmin was more likely to be on the sidewalk, while Polar was more likely to stray into the street, though keeping the same line. Ultimately, they were 0.03 miles apart across three miles, compared to 0.04 miles last time. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HfKxYPV8jtNDE9WjgKyZji" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-track-run-GPS-map.jpeg" alt="Polar Vantage V3 track run accuracy test" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HfKxYPV8jtNDE9WjgKyZji.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My one continued complaint with the Vantage V3&apos;s dual-band GPS is with its accuracy during track runs. I spent the entire 2.5-mile training run in the fourth lane, but my GPS map had me...elsewhere.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EtpZZddgiak4LNeWXQnsXK" name="Garmin-vs-Polar-heart-rate-comparison-1.jpeg" alt="A heart rate chart showing how the Polar Vantage V3, Garmin Forerunner 965, and Polar H10 compare." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EtpZZddgiak4LNeWXQnsXK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For most reviews, I use a chest or arm strap as the control group to rate the watch&apos;s optical sensor. Unfortunately, this last test had me questioning whether my Polar H10 chest strap is all that reliable. You can see in the charts above and below how it had my heart rate spiking or dropping at absurd rates, disproportionate to my effort.</p><p>Thankfully, for the first run I also had the Forerunner 965 to compare against, and both watches had the same 142bpm average and near-identical charts throughout. Both watches matched the H10 closely before it started to freak out, then continued to responsively change to my varying effort without the straight-lined dips and crests you get with watches that don&apos;t sample accurately or frequently. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2505px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GwtXJDmxPYERzxge4eGTZJ" name="Garmin-vs-Polar-heart-rate-comparison-2.jpeg" alt="A heart rate chart showing how the Polar Vantage V3 and Polar H10 compare." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GwtXJDmxPYERzxge4eGTZJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2505" height="1409" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the second run, I only compared the two Polar devices. Once again, the Polar H10 had me hitting some absurd highs and lows, including 20 beats above my max heart rate. However, once it calmed down halfway through, it gave a useful baseline to compare against the Vantage V3. At that point, the watch closely trailed behind the chest strap, lagging slightly whenever I switched from sprinting to jogging, but never off by much. </p><p>Overall, I&apos;m quite satisfied with the Polar Vantage V3&apos;s GPS, heart rate, and elevation accuracy in my practical tests. Even if I don&apos;t like the track run&apos;s wild GPS map, it doesn&apos;t seem to affect the tracked distance significantly, so complaining about it feels unfair. </p>

<p>Like any other brand, Polar has a specific vision of what a "premium" fitness watch needs and what features it can skip to save on costs. </p><p>While other premium fitness watches typically use sapphire glass or (at minimum) Gorilla Glass DX with good anti-reflective coating, Polar gave the Vantage V3 Gorilla Glass 3. I&apos;m not thrilled with that choice of a $599 watch for visibility or protection. It makes AMOLED a harder selling point for anyone used to MIP displays.</p><p>I don&apos;t think ANT+ accessories are especially prevalent these days, but you may resent its absence here. If that&apos;s a concern, only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> consistently offer ANT+, while other brands increasingly abandon it. </p><p>More people will find the absence of music storage frustrating, given its 32GB of storage. Even if Polar couldn&apos;t make a deal with music streaming platforms, it&apos;d be nice to store your own MP3 files and connect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout earbuds</a> while leaving your phone behind.</p><p>I also noticed the apparent lack of an ambient light sensor, which means this watch will blind you at bedtime until you turn on DnD mode. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Given its 32GB of storage, it'd be nice to store your own MP3 files and connect workout earbuds while leaving your phone behind.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>To me, the software experience always matters more than hardware. That&apos;s what athletes are paying for. And on that front, I have a few hang-ups.</p><p>Two years ago, I would have loved the simplicity of Polar&apos;s Cardio Load Status widget. You&apos;re either under/overtraining, maintaining, or improving. You don&apos;t need to understand what training load or (an)aerobic effect numbers mean; you just run, follow the Fitspark suggestions, and try to improve. </p><p>More data-driven users — the kind that might buy a $599 watch — will wish they could see more information on the watch itself. There&apos;s a weekly summary widget, but it&apos;s light on data (total miles, total calories, time spent in specific heart rate zones) and doesn&apos;t show weekly targets besides HR zone percentages. If you tap the Cardio Load widget, it doesn&apos;t show anything new, just a text summary explaining why you need to train more or less. </p><p>Polar collects the same data that Garmin Connect or COROS EvoLab offers; every post-run summary shows a performance Running Index, the type of Training Benefit (similar to Effect), and the cardio/ muscle training load. However, the only amalgamation of this data is the Cardio Load Status widget with its 7-day Strain and 28-day Tolerance numbers, along with a graph buried in the Calendar tab of the Polar Flow app with a bit more detail. </p><p>For me, the best way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">improve my VO2 Max</a> is to know how to improve my Tolerance (or Chronic Load) with data on whether my aerobic and anaerobic numbers are optimized. Polar&apos;s data is simply harder to find, making you rely on Fitspark recs to know what you can handle. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fmKNX42pNE6fAzaJFm29J" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-Fitspark.jpeg" alt="FitSpark cardio recommended workouts on the Polar Vantage V3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fmKNX42pNE6fAzaJFm29J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I said above, I like the Fitspark recs, especially the strength training options. But it seems to put more stock in my training status than my body&apos;s fatigue. </p><p>Case in point: I did a three-mile jog followed by 2.5 miles of 100-meter sprints and hard 400-meter laps interspersed with jogging. After a night&apos;s sleep, my Garmin watch recommends 60 hours of recovery, while Fitspark&apos;s two cardio recommendations are 56 minutes of zone 2/3 running or 90 minutes of walking/jogging. That seems ill-advised, and it&apos;s because I&apos;m still "Detraining" according to Polar&apos;s algorithm.</p><p>Thankfully, Polar&apos;s Orthostatic and leg stiffness tests signaled that rest is preferable today. But it&apos;s up to the user to check that for themselves. Anyone trusting Polar&apos;s algorithm to get fitter might get pushed to work out more rigorously than they should.</p><p>Ultimately, I think Polar has a lot to offer athletes, but it could make more information available on the watch and make the Polar Flow app much more accessible. Right now, it can be very difficult to find what you need. </p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> is the Vantage V3&apos;s closest rival in price and features. You get a 1.43-inch AMOLED display with better GG DX coating, a design that&apos;s 0.3mm thinner and 3g lighter, and an extra 13 days of battery life — though about half the dual-band GPS hours. The Forerunner 965 beat the Vantage V3 in GPS accuracy in multiple tests, while they were comparable in heart rate accuracy. Garmin has music storage and all-day SpO2 data but no ECGs or skin temperature.</p><p>I prefer the Forerunner 965 for its more accessible data on training load and status; it&apos;s always clear how my VO2 Max, recent breakdown of workout types, and my overall workload compare to previous weeks, whereas Polar makes you search for that data. Both watches give you workout and recovery suggestions, but Garmin&apos;s recs don&apos;t include strength training. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-pro-review">COROS APEX 2 Pro</a> is another option to consider if you want epic battery life, offline maps, and dual-frequency GPS. You&apos;ll have to accept the MIP display and lack of non-HR sensors, but it&apos;s more affordable and has the upside of EvoLab training load data. </p><p>You may also want to look at the Suunto Race, an AMOLED running watch with similar perks to the Vantage V3 (dual-frequency GPS, coaching, and HRV recovery data). Since I&apos;ve only just received my review unit, I can&apos;t give a more definitive recommendation. </p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Polar Vantage V3 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're a long-time Polar Flow user.</li><li>You need training guidance and data to improve as an athlete.</li><li>You're willing to spend a lot in exchange for a high-end display and sensors.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Polar Vantage V3 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need smarts like actionable notifications, apps, or music storage.</li><li>You're on a budget and can accept a cheaper Polar like the Pacer Pro.</li></ul>
<p>For me, the most important aspect of a fitness watch is that it gives workout suggestions that are both aspirational and realistic. You need something to keep you motivated but also grounded so you don&apos;t run yourself into the ground (figuratively or literally).</p><p>The Polar Vantage V3 is certainly aspirational. It has running programs and Fitspark recs that give you tough workouts to help you improve but also keep you grounded with recovery estimates, tests of your heart and muscle load, and heart rate data that were quite accurate in my tests. At the same time, I&apos;ve found moments where it recommends workouts that are above and beyond what I&apos;m capable of, so the Vantage V3 is best suited to athletes who know their own limits. </p><p>Otherwise, the Polar Vantage V3 is what it sounds like on paper. It&apos;s a big but relatively comfortable watch with a nice AMOLED display, solid battery life, a nice smattering of health sensors, and Komoot maps for hikers. If that all sounds appealing to you, then you&apos;ll certainly like the Vantage V3. </p>

<ul><li>An IDC analyst shared in a Bloomberg newsletter that sales for Sony's smartphone business dropped 40% last year.</li><li>The drops are expected to continue as Sony's Xperia brand struggles to compete with the likes of Apple and Google.</li><li>Sony is teasing the launch of a new Xperia phone during a May 15 announcement, and it is rumored to be targeting more of a mainstream audience. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Sony is just days away from launching a brand-new Xperia phone, and this reveal sounds like it will have a big impact on what mobile offerings from the company will look like moving forward. Per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-vi-marketing-images-leak">rumors and leaks</a>, the smartphone is expected to depart somewhat from Sony&apos;s typical strategy for handsets, which is to lean into the company&apos;s photography prowess and target the niche and premium markets. The strategy shift comes as Sony&apos;s mobile sales continue to take massive hits, according to data shared in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-10/biden-poised-to-impose-tariffs-on-china-evs-strategic-sectors" target="_blank">Bloomberg newsletter</a>.</p><p>Masafumi Inbe, an analyst for IDC, spoke to Bloomberg about Sony&apos;s struggles with Xperia, which have stretched even to its home market in Japan. Apple has a powerful user base in Japan and found success in bringing the iPhone to that market. Now, part of Google&apos;s plan for growing Pixel is to target markets like Japan, too. </p><p>Sony isn&apos;t a household name in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">smartphones</a> anymore, and these developments further worsen its standing in the market. The company isn&apos;t one of the leaders in smartphone shipments, and it&apos;s going backward rather than forward. Part of the reason may be the direction of the Xperia brand, which is only appealing to a small number of people. </p><p>However, switching things up and making the next Xperia 1 VI more mainstream might not be the answer. If Sony can&apos;t compete with the major brands while offering a unique smartphone, why would it compete with a device that feels like a carbon copy of all the others?</p>
<h2 id="sony-apos-s-mobile-sales-are-falling-fast-2">Sony&apos;s mobile sales are falling, fast</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mT9Z3HmPu7MhipoR3E7BCT" name="sony-xperia-1-vi-marketing-images-leak-01.jpg" alt="Xperia 1 VI marketing images leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mT9Z3HmPu7MhipoR3E7BCT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The global smartphone market has experienced frequent dips and peaks over the last few years, largely related to the fluctuating economy and world events. But Sony&apos;s mobile sales aren&apos;t just slightly down compared to past years; they&apos;re down significantly. According to Inbe, Sony&apos;s mobile sales dropped by 40% in 2023 compared to the previous year.</p><p>A similar cratering is expected this year, Inbe says, which doesn&apos;t bode well for the future of Sony&apos;s mobile offerings. If sales were to decline by a total of 80% over the course of two years, it would be disastrous. </p><p>Inbe cites Sony&apos;s poor performance in Japan as one of the bigger reasons to sound the alarm. Sony sells about 1 million phones each year in Japan, Inbe says, where a total of 30 million smartphones are sold annually. </p><p>Sony doesn&apos;t report smartphone sales figures individually in its financial reports, which makes it hard to get a complete picture of the business. However, it&apos;s clear that mobile devices aren&apos;t a core business for the company in 2024. Still, Sony hasn&apos;t shown any signs of backing out of the smartphone market.</p><p>"We recognize that our mobile communications business is not only a handset business, but also a business with important communication technology that contributes to the entire Sony Group," a Sony spokeswoman told Bloomberg.</p><p>"We believe that the communication technology we hone with smartphone technology is a necessary element to connect creators and customers and to provide entertainment regardless of time and place."</p><p>Something has to give, and if the leaks are correct, that something will be Xperia strategy. While it seems Xperia&apos;s current positioning toward the ultra-premium camera lover isn&apos;t working, it&apos;s unclear what <em>will</em> work this late in the smartphone race.</p>
<h2 id="the-sony-xperia-brand-targets-a-market-that-barely-exists-2">The Sony Xperia brand targets a market that barely exists</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2773px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dZqYB9Nha5q8RuWaPAzZGR" name="sony-xperia-1-v-smartphone.jpg" alt="Sony Xperia 1 V phone cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dZqYB9Nha5q8RuWaPAzZGR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2773" height="1560" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In theory, Sony&apos;s plan for the Xperia lineup sounds great. The company already makes industry-leading cameras, so why not bring that down to the smartphone? Although it&apos;s a solid idea, it isn&apos;t working. That&apos;s because the Sony Xperia brand only caters to people in the middle of two big markets. </p><p>People who don&apos;t care much about standalone cameras will just grab any flagship smartphone, as the camera in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a> or an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> will get the job done in most situations. On the other hand, people that really care about cameras will get something like a DSLR or mirrorless camera on top of their smartphone. The number of people who need more than a smartphone but less than a dedicated shooter has proven to be small, if Xperia sales are any indication. </p><p>As an anecdotal example, I&apos;m the exact kind of buyer who <em>should </em>find the Sony Xperia line appealing. I have a mirrorless camera — from Sony, evidently — that I use for work and a bit of play. I&apos;m not a photography buff, so I use my Sony a6400 pretty much stuck on automatic modes. Even with all that said, I wouldn&apos;t replace my smartphone or my mirrorless camera with an Xperia. For my fairly basic needs, a Sony Xperia smartphone would be a worse smartphone and a worse camera than what I currently use. So, what&apos;s the point? </p>
<h2 id="the-zenfone-11-ultra-proves-making-xperia-mainstream-won-apos-t-solve-anything-2">The Zenfone 11 Ultra proves making Xperia mainstream won&apos;t solve anything</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bY6EqfMcMRRDGxEqr6Vv9S" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-26.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bY6EqfMcMRRDGxEqr6Vv9S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&apos;t have a solution for Sony. It feels like, in 2024, there are only a handful of brands that can really compete for the mainstream market. Although it appears Sony will try to do just that with the next Xperia, that might not be the best option.</p><p>We just saw Asus make a similar pivot with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review" target="_blank">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a>, and the general consensus wasn&apos;t positive. Instead, it showed that Asus had given up a small but vibrant niche to become just like all the other flagship smartphones. And despite being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-asus-phones">best Asus phones</a> ever, the Zenfone 11 Ultra couldn&apos;t stand out.</p><p>If Xperia tries to compete on equal footing with Apple, Google, and others, it&apos;ll lose. The brand&apos;s only shot at this point is to stay the course and make niche, unique smartphones that actually cater to a tangible audience, and that&apos;s already turning into a losing battle.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Circle to Search is now available on the Pixel Tablet running Android 14, allowing users to circle items on their screens to search the web instantly.</li><li>Following its announcement in January alongside the Galaxy S24 series launch, Circle to Search has been progressively introduced to Pixel smartphones.</li><li>Currently, the feature does not work in split-screen mode, but support for this is expected in a future update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Circle to Search is now rolling out on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-eyntk">Pixel Tablet</a> with Android 14, meaning you can circle things on your screen to instantly search the web.</p><p>It was inevitable that Google would bring Circle to Search to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> after hints of its upcoming release. Back in January, when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series launched, Google announced plans to expand Circle to Search to its Pixel devices. Since then, it has gradually made its way to the Pixel smartphones.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/10/pixel-tablet-circle-to-search/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> reports that all Pixel Tablet users now have access to the handy feature. Previously, it was only available to users in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> beta.</p><p>During the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-solo-launch-announcement">Pixel Tablet&apos;s re-launch</a> a few days ago, Google confirmed that Circle to Search would be added in late May, so this latest update isn&apos;t too surprising.</p><p>Google has introduced many features over the years, but Circle to Search has really caught everyone&apos;s attention. It offers more control over on-screen information with unmatched ease. Just press and hold on the bottom navigation bar, circle what you&apos;re curious about, and instant web search results will instantly show up.</p><p>For now, the Circle to Search feature only works when you&apos;re not using split screen. However, support for split screen should be available in a future update, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-phones-may-soon-let-you-use-circle-to-search-in-split-screen-mode">as it has already been tested in beta</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Circle to Search isn&apos;t available for iPhone users. However, Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-workaround-for-iphones">offering Apple fans a similar solution</a> that essentially replicates the function.</p><p>Users of the latest iPhone models can now set up a shortcut for the Action Button to take a screenshot of their current screen and open it in the Google Lens app for analysis. Although it&apos;s not the exact same process as Circle to Search, it effectively achieves the same result.</p><p>It&apos;s common to see something on our phone screens that piques our interest, and Google is always looking to streamline how we get information. That&apos;s where Circle to Search comes in, offering a new method to look up information on mobile devices.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola just announced the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-launch">Moto Stylus 5G 2024</a>, which looks like a sweet upgrade with a pretty drastic design change. But if rumors and leaks of the Razr Plus 2024 (aka the Razr 50 Ultra) are to be believed, we may not have to look forward to a new design for Motorola&apos;s upcoming foldable flagship. But who needs a new design when the latest leak points to some welcome internal upgrades?</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealntech.com/motorola-razr-50-ultra-eu-pricing-ram-storage-colors-surface/">A publication obtained a screenshot</a> of some retail listings of the Razr 50 Ultra, which gives us a good look at the configuration and expected pricing (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/09/motorolas-next-razr-leaked/">9to5Google</a>). The next Razr will be offered with 12GB of RAM, up from 8GB on the current model, and 512GB of storage, double that of the Razr 40 Ultra.</p><p>While the Razr 40 Ultra was largely available in the singular 8GB+256GB configuration in global markets, including the U.S., the phone was offered with a model featuring 12GB of RAM and 512GB in China.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1374px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:22.85%;"><img id="y62EkvZLsZqkxSoditBpd9" name="Motorla-razr-50-ultra-leaked-price-dealntech.jpg" alt="Leaked retail listing of the Motorola Razr 50 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y62EkvZLsZqkxSoditBpd9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1374" height="314" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Deal N Tech)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the improved specs, we might expect the phone to cost more than its predecessor, but that might not be the case if the leak is accurate. The retail listing shows the Razr 50 Ultra priced at €1200, which is around the same launch price as its predecessor. Naturally, one might expect the U.S. price to be directly converted, but if last year&apos;s pricing scheme is followed, then the Razr Plus 2024 may stick to the same $999 price tag.</p><p>Lastly, the listing reveals available color options, which include Blue, Green, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-special-edition-peach-fuzz-color">Peach Puzz</a>.</p><p>The presence of a retail listing, along with other leaks we&apos;ve seen of the phone, all point to an imminent launch of Motorolas next foldable, although the company has yet to announce when that will happen.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a lot that can be taken from this leak, especially when you consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-ultra-aka-razr-plus-2024-live-image">previous leaks</a> of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>. We&apos;ve seen that the device may likely retain the same design as the current model, which suggests that Motorola may focus on refining the experience with internal upgrades rather than spending time and money to drastically alter its looks.</p><p>And honestly, I&apos;m perfectly okay with that.</p><p>I&apos;m a big fan of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a>; in fact, I&apos;ve been using it as my main driver since it was launched. It has great performance despite the older chipset and "only" having 8GB of RAM, and the design really stands out among other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>, particularly the more angular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. There&apos;s not much I would change about the design other than the fact that I wish it were wider and not as tall, but that&apos;s honestly a pretty minor gripe for me.</p><p>The biggest changes <em>need</em> to happen internally. We don&apos;t know what chipset will power the Razr Plus 2024, but Motorola shouldn&apos;t rely on last year&apos;s chip and the same configuration if it wants to stay truly competitive. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> will likely launch this year with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and all the generative AI goodies that Samsung and Google have been touting all year long. Motorola should take advantage of the AI capabilities of the latest chip and beat Samsung to the punch with a decked-out flip phone.</p><p>Plus, 12GB seems to be the sweet spot for on-device generative AI features on smartphones, which is why it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">taking so long to reach the Pixel 8</a>.</p><p>Not only would it potentially match or even exceed the Galaxy in terms of power, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/choosing-between-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-motorola-razr-plus">Motorola already has the upper hand</a> with a better cover screen experience. I have a feeling things may play out the same this time around, with Samsung inexplicably limiting the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="yes2Qj9WabbbF44ZBQgoyj" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-moto-razr-plus-cover-screen-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 with the Motorola Razr Plus (2023)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yes2Qj9WabbbF44ZBQgoyj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, there are other upgrades I would love to see, like a better camera and a larger battery, so hopefully, shifting the focus away from design will give Motorola ample opportunity to focus on the upgrades we really want.</p><p>This is a strategy that Samsung has been holding onto for years. Very little changed between the Z Flip 3 and Z Flip 4, and the only major change with the Z Flip 5 was the enlarged cover screen. Samsung took a winning formula and continued to iterate, refusing to rock the boat with any jarring changes and instead giving consumers features and upgrades they wanted each year, like water resistance, a larger cover screen, and bigger batteries.</p><p>Motorola struggled with early iterations of the Razr, but the company has found a winning formula with the Razr Plus 2023. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.displaysupplychain.com/press-release/samsung-led-q423-foldable-market-huawei-expected-to-lead-in-q124-for-the-first-time">Recent numbers</a> show that the company is gaining in the global foldable market as one of the biggest players, which says a lot for a company that only sells one type of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>. Motorola needs to hold onto that momentum and prove that it can keep up with Samsung, even if that means using a similar playbook.</p>
