<ul><li>OnePlus is launching a new mid-range phone in China this week.</li><li>It is dubbed the OnePlus Ace 3V and is likely to be rebranded as the OnePlus Nord 4 outside of China.</li><li>The Ace 3V, with a March 21 launch, looks familiar to the OnePlus Nord CE 4, which is launching in India in April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus has teased its next mid-range smartphone, the Ace 3V, for the Chinese market along with a launch date of March 21, 2024.</p><p>On its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/oneplusmobile">Weibo page</a>, OnePlus released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/tv/show/1034:5013209678020666?from=old_pc_videoshow&mark_id=999_reallog_mark_ad%3A999%7CWeiboADNatural">teaser video</a> of the OnePlus Ace 3V, which revealed the device’s full design. Unlike the previous Nord phones, the Ace 3V will feature a revamped camera module featuring two large sensors, followed by an LED flash also aligned with the rear cameras. </p><p>The device will also sport the popular alert slider, which has been an exclusive feature of the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> lately, so it&apos;s good to see on a mid-range OnePlus phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="uumLrUQPVs5632J5U9D2xW" name="oneplus-ace-3v.jpg" alt="OnePlus Ace 3V" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uumLrUQPVs5632J5U9D2xW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The device is seen showcasing its flat frame on the sides next to rounded corners and a textured finish at the back. It will also be seen in two color variants, one with a purple finish and another with a regular black hue. </p><p>The Ace 3V will sport a punch-hole display on the front, and by the teaser video, the bezels appear minimal. OnePlus also emphasizes the use of the phone as an AI phone for young people (per the translated teaser post).</p><p>Besides that, OnePlus has also confirmed the specifications of the upcoming Ace 3V, which include a Snapdragon 7-series chip and a 5,500mAh battery capacity with 100W SuperVOOC charging support.</p><p>The OnePlus Ace 3V will likely be rebranded as the OnePlus Nord 4 in other regions, including India. However, this design is also seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-ce-4-to-launch-on-april-1-2024">OnePlus Nord CE 4</a>, which is scheduled to launch in the country in April. OnePlus has already confirmed that this phone will be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phone/snapdragon-7-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 3</a>, which also takes advantage of AI catered to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range Android phones</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm's new Adreno Motion Engine helps reduce motion artifacts by using AI.</li><li>Gamers will find that PCVR titles streamed over Wi-Fi with supported apps like Virtual Desktop now look even better in motion.</li><li>The latest Virtual Desktop update, v1.30.3, already integrates the functionality into its Synchronous Spacewarp feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you&apos;re a gamer who uses a headset like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> to play PCVR games over Wi-Fi, a new Qualcomm technology is about to make your games look better than ever while moving. The company&apos;s upgraded Adreno Motion Engine uses a suite of AI algorithms that understand motion better than previous models, resulting in less warping while streaming PCVR games wirelessly with headsets powered by a Snapdragon processor.</p><p>A Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/blog/gpu-motion-estimation-improved-handling-repeating-patterns">blog post</a> details the technique, showing how the algorithm finds patterns in rendered objects and estimates what those objects will look like as you move around. The result is a smoother VR experience that feels like running at a high frame rate even when your PC can&apos;t quite handle all the action.</p><p>But this kind of technology often introduces motion artifacts. These artifacts are extremely obvious to human eyes and brains and can be seen on the left in the example below. Thankfully, Qualcomm engineers have figured out how to minimize this warping and just delivered a new version that you can use today on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vrdesktop.net/">Virtual Desktop</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.67%;"><img id="ZFP5tCdjo9R7XGJBqorMR" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-adreno-motion-example.gif" alt="A demonstration of motion warping before and after enabling the Adreno Motion Endgine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZFP5tCdjo9R7XGJBqorMR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="224" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Virtual Desktop&apos;s Synchronous Spacewarp feature implements this new Qualcomm feature as of version 1.30.3. Gamers who use Virtual Desktop to wirelessly stream their PCVR games will find that games should look cleaner as they move around, particularly as framerates drop and the app needs to create frames to keep the action feeling smooth.</p><p>Just head into Virtual Desktop&apos;s option menu and enable "Synchronous Spacewarp" to get access. Impressively enough, it does all of this without any additional latency or processing overhead on the Virtual Desktop app.</p><p>Some official apps, like the updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/even-the-new-quest-link-software-cant-save-pcvr-for-me">Quest Link software</a>, don&apos;t always provide a seamless experience. Still, wireless streaming apps like Virtual Desktop often do a better job without the need for a cable. You&apos;ll just need a competent Wi-Fi router or a streaming bridge, like this excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Streaming-Compatible-Accessories-Wireless/dp/B0CFDL5Y7F">PrismXR Puppis S1</a>, to wirelessly beam your PCVR games to your Quest headset.</p><p>Virtual Desktop developer Guy Godin has consistently updated the app with the latest in cutting-edge streaming technology, regularly eclipsing Meta&apos;s official streaming methods by offering higher quality streaming and more options to tweak. It&apos;s been the pick of many PCVR gamers for years for a reason.</p>

<hr>
<p>YouTube highlights the arrival of its new AI disclosure creators must adhere to when uploading videos.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/disclosing-ai-generated-content/">YouTube</a>, today (Mar. 18), the platform is introducing a new set of "Altered content" details creators must fill out. The company adds creators must "disclose to viewers when realistic content – content a viewer could easily mistake for a real person, place, or event – is made with altered or synthetic media, including generative AI."</p><p>This new section will ask creators questions regarding whether or not the people, footage, or scenes in their videos were digitally altered. If the answer to the questions is "yes," YouTube states it will apply a label on your video or Short. Additionally, users can find these labels in a video&apos;s description box.</p><p>Disclosing that your video contains altered or synthetic content will not hinder its discoverability on the platform. The platform states creators who have not properly labeled their videos will receive a label "that creators will not have the option to remove."</p><p>If such behavior continues, YouTube states it will look to remove content, suspend a creator&apos;s account, and other penalties.</p><p>Content that is clearly fantastical and imaginative, like animations, color adjustment, special effects, and beauty filters, does not fall within the scope of altered content.

<p>YouTube states that its latest AI and altered content disclosure are part of its efforts to clamp down on misinformation. The company hopes to "increase the transparency" regarding digital content, as well.</p><p>It&apos;s no surprise that YouTube is going down this path as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-others-advance-ai-safety-practices">Google agreed to proceed</a> with measures to help prevent societal risks. The White House urged big tech companies like Google to gain a better handle on AI-generated content and the problems it can have on everyday users. Through its AI safety practices, Google agreed to provide watermarks, metadata tags, and more to inform users when content was synthetically created.</p><p>Users are likely to continue to see these new tags as YouTube is working on several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tv-8-million-subscribers-2024-outlook">generative AI features</a>. The company started rolling out a test for Premium members to test its new conversational AI alongside "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-watermarks-for-ai-generated-music">Dream Track</a>," which lets creators digitally sample popular artists&apos; voices.</p>

<p>It looks like Motorola is preparing to launch its next flagship phone in India in the near future.</p><p>Motorola India has confirmed on X (formerly Twitter) that the Motorola Edge 50 Pro will arrive in India soon. It&apos;s also confirmed to be available on Flipkart.</p>

<p>The post didn&apos;t mention a specific date, but tipster Abhishek Yadav spilled the beans on X, saying the launch is supposedly going down on April 3 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/motorola-edge-50-pro-indeed-launching-in-early-april-latest-leak-suggests_id156384" target="_blank">PhoneArena</a>). The tipster even threw in what seems to be official promo material from Motorola, giving us a sneak peek at the Edge 50 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-pro-design-leak">confirming a set of leaked renders we&apos;ve seen before</a>.</p><p>Motorola India&apos;s post also confirms the phone&apos;s design, but the company is keeping the specs tight-lipped.

Furthermore, it could be shielded by Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for extra protection.</p>

<ul><li>A new rumor suggests Samsung might increase the size of its Galaxy S25 display from 6.2-inches to 6.3-inches.</li><li>The rumor adds the company could implement "overall design and concept" changes for its S25 series' hardware next year.</li><li>Previous rumors suggest the series could feature a camera hardware change, and there's potential for a pricier set of phones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Some new rumors suggest Samsung will produce design changes for its Galaxy S25 series next year.</p><p>As rumored by yeux1122 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223385894570&navType=by">Naver</a>, the base Galaxy S25 model might sport an increase in its display size (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/galaxy-s25-significant-design-changes-base-model-screen-size-increase/">WCCFtech</a>). Citing a Samsung source, the leaker suggests the vanilla model will offer a 6.3-inch display once it launches next year.</p><p>The rumor implies more changes may be expected as Samsung introduces "overall design and concept" alterations for the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>For context, the base Galaxy S24 features a 6.2-inch display. The remainder of the series delivers a 6.7-inch and a 6.8-inch display for the S24 Plus and S24 Ultra, respectively. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> also dropped its curved display, opting for a completely flat display. However, the device retained some of its curvature along its left and right edges.</p><p>More importantly, the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus have continued the same clean, minimalistic rear panel that started with the S23 variants. Both of the smaller siblings moved toward a design that mirrored the Ultra model. It&apos;ll be interesting to see what additional changes (if any) Samsung brings in its upcoming S25 series.</p><p>Previous rumors from December 2023 suggest Samsung could drop its camera hardware in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-rumored-to-use-sony-sensors">favor of Sony</a>. Speculation speaks toward the Korean OEM ditching its GN series sensors on the S25 and S25 Plus, should the rumors prove true. The Ultra model was stated to continue the ISOCELL trend. Speaking of, that ISOCELL sensor might pick up an upgrade next year for its 200MP capabilities with 0.8µm pixels.</p><p>Another rumor stated Samsung&apos;s flagship series could become a little pricier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-rumored-price-increase">thanks to Qualcomm&apos;s</a> planned SoC upgrades. The company is expected to implement more expensive Oryon CPU cores into its upcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset, which could help it achieve "astonishing levels of performance."</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The default cloth Quest 3 facial interface is pretty comfortable, but it has a few obvious flaws. AMVR&apos;s facial interface replacement fixes nearly all of those by using an easy-to-clean and replace PU leather pad, vents to eliminate lens fog, and even a built-in glasses spacer like the default Quest 3 face pad has.</p><p>AMVR was one of the first companies to deliver <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> accessories after the headset launched in October 2023. Surprisingly, the company&apos;s offerings are still among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> despite other companies having longer development times.</p><p>The AMVR facial interface replacement for Meta Quest 3 ships with two main parts: the pad and the facial interface adapter. The adapter itself is plastic and slots right into the headset in the same way the default pad does. Unlike the default pad, however, AMVR&apos;s solution separates the pad from the spacer to make things more convenient.</p>

<p>The adapter is lined with brilliantly designed vents that keep light from entering the headset, yet somehow allow moisture and heat to escape. That last part is crucial for preventing lens fog. I&apos;ve had a few instances where the corners of the lenses would still fog in the first few minutes of play, but haven&apos;t had the Quest 3&apos;s lenses completely fog up with this facial interface as they do with the default pad.</p><p>AMVR uses a similar built-in glasses spacer solution to Meta&apos;s, with three preset spacing options and prongs that keep the interface locked into place. I found these were a little hard to adjust since the adapter uses four anchor points, and I often had to readjust the spacing after plugging the adapter into the Quest 3 headset.</p>

<p>The front of the adapter is lined with Velcro-style hooks that fit nicely with nearly every facial interface pad I own. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oculus-quest-2-face-covers">best Quest 2 facial interface</a> pads fit on AMVR&apos;s design, meaning you won&apos;t need to buy a bunch of new pads if you already won a Quest 2, along with some Velcro-backed face pads.</p><p>That makes it easy to remove the pads and clean them after use. It&apos;s also simple to swap them out when needed, which is handy for when you&apos;ve got friends or family over and want to keep them feeling clean by using separate face pads.</p><p>The biggest regular annoyance with this design is the nose seal. It&apos;s barely held on with one small prong on each side of the floppy seal and easily comes undone when changing out the face pad. It&apos;s also annoying to try to push it back into place, but it does such a great job of blocking out light that I find myself going through the hassle of getting it back on when it falls off.</p><p>Overall, this is the best facial interface replacement you&apos;ll find on the Meta Quest 3 today. A tighter nose seal and adjusted glasses spacer design would make it perfect, but neither problem is big enough to complain about much.</p>

<hr>
<p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/apple-in-talks-to-license-google-gemini-for-iphone-ios-18-generative-ai-tools?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> report, Apple is beginning to work with Google as it looks to integrate Gemini into the foundation of its iPhone software. According to sources close to the matter, Gemini&apos;s array of models would be integrated into Apple&apos;s generative AI features that it&apos;s currently developing for the iPhone.</p><p>These new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">Gemini-backed</a> capabilities will reportedly be available for Apple&apos;s iOS 18 software, which should land on iPhones later in 2024. The publication adds that the "enhancements" would further enhance Apple&apos;s intent to create on-device Gen AI features.</p><p>Such offerings would include AI-based image creation and "writing essays based on simple prompts."</p><p>The report adds that Apple had been testing its own LLM (large language model) since "early last year" dubbed "Ajax." The company has also tested its own AI chatbot called "Apple GPT," but sources claim the software has remained "inferior" to Google&apos;s. Additionally, sources state Apple had once entered talks with OpenAI about using its software, but it appears it will lean toward Google.</p><p>As Bloomberg <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-04/apple-s-tim-cook-says-ai-concerns-still-need-to-be-sorted-out">noted</a>, Apple&apos;s CEO Tim Cook has utilized OpenAI&apos;s ChatGPT previously but stated that "a number of issues need to be sorted." Cook will also look to implement Apple&apos;s version of AI features onto the iPhone on a "very thoughtful basis."</p><p>With such AI possibilities seemingly in line for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/ios/ios-18-is-reportedly-out-in-the-wild-ahead-of-wwdc-reveal">iOS 18</a>, it&apos;s speculated that a formal announcement could happen in June at the earliest during WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference).</p><p>Android Central has contacted Apple and Google for comment about their rumored AI partnership but has not heard back in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p>

<p>Apple is potentially looking to work with Google for AI, which makes sense, as Android Central&apos;s Jerry Hildenbrand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-apple-can-learn-about-ai">once suggested</a> that "if the company execs don&apos;t want to shell out a few of its billions on R&D or hire people who already know how it&apos;s done, it could simply partner with Google or another company in the same way Samsung has done and let the heavy lifting happen in Mountain View or elsewhere."</p><p>While it seems Apple may put more faith in Google&apos;s Gemini model, Cook&apos;s comment about problems with AI should extend to its potential partner, too. Google disabled Gemini&apos;s ability to create images based on user prompts in February <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-ai-image-generation-disabled">following severe backlash</a>. Users discovered that the bot was quite inaccurate when given a prompt regarding historical groups of people.</p><p>Meanwhile, it remains to be seen what more a Google-Apple AI partnership could bring feature-wise. The former introduced its new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a>" capability, which arrived on the Galaxy S24 series earlier this year. Users could utilize an array of touch gestures to highlight specific items in images for a search through Google&apos;s engine.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/unfunyguy/status/1767967529191055505">@unfunyguy writes</a>:</p><p><em><strong>I haven&apos;t updated the Google Partner Setup app since it appeared on the Play Store should I do it?</strong></em></p>
<p>The best and worst part about having a smartphone are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">the apps</a>. The right ones can entertain us, help keep us organized, and do all sorts of useful things that make life a little easier. The bad ones track what we do or worse. Somehow, we have to know the difference.</p><p>It can be tough because sometimes an app is both good and bad. Remember that a free app isn&apos;t free; you&apos;re just not spending money. You&apos;re paying with an alternative currency in the form of data a company finds useful.</p>
<p>That&apos;s the kind of app Google Partner Setup is. It&apos;s part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it">Google Mobile Services</a> suite of software that companies like Samsung use under license from Google and not part of Android itself. It&apos;s not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">open source</a>, so nobody outside of Google can take a peek under the hood to see exactly what it does.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iGsrZ4yTQT8YXCFPJqyoKb" name="Motorola-edge-2022-t-mobile-apps.jpg" alt="Pre-installed T-Mobile apps on the Motorola Edge (2022)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iGsrZ4yTQT8YXCFPJqyoKb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Officially, the Google Partner Setup app is a helper application for proper device functionality. The company that made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a> installed it into the system software. </p><p>It does things like help connect apps to Google services or help vendors troubleshoot software issues. It&apos;s important to realize it&apos;s not the same as Google Partners for ads or Play Games even though they have a similar name. It&apos;s on the Play Store because the app has been broken out of the system for easier updating.</p>
<p>Most say this is a required application, and you can&apos;t uninstall it. The truth is that It may not be required, and while you can&apos;t easily uninstall it, disabling it is simple. But unless you know what you&apos;re doing and are willing to reload the software on your phone, you probably shouldn&apos;t because it (potentially) does so many different things.</p><p>To answer your question, <strong>I recommend you update the app</strong>. I&apos;d never purposefully run an older version of any system application on my phone unless I could be 100% certain of what the app does. But this brings focus to the real issue — there are apps on our phones that we don&apos;t know the purpose of.</p>

<p>Android is like any other operating system and is chock full of executable programs that make it work. The software powering an iPhone, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>, or any other laptop or tablet is the same way.</p><p>It&apos;s tempting to disable or uninstall some of these programs sometimes, privacy and performance being the two biggest reasons. Often, it works, and everything acts normally without all the pieces. Sometimes it doesn&apos;t work. When a new version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-apps-windows-11">Microsoft Windows</a> comes out, you&apos;ll see a lot of talk about this, and it takes a while for folks to determine what&apos;s safe to get rid of and what&apos;s not.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my best advice is to leave things alone. If you&apos;re looking to an article like this for advice, you probably don&apos;t have the means or the background to determine exactly what removing or disabling an app does. Even worse, disabling the wrong app means you&apos;ve borked the software on your phone and won&apos;t be able to undo it.</p><p>If you&apos;re determined, at least spend plenty of time searching to find out what an app is, what it does, and what may happen if you disable or uninstall it. Remember, 99% of the time spent modding the software on your phone should be spent reading and reading.</p>

<hr>
<p>A few leaks have surfaced regarding Vivo&apos;s upcoming X Fold 3 series and its potential launch date later in March.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/03/14/vivo-x-fold-3-series-launch-date-in-china-seemingly-revealed/">Gizmochina</a>, a post on Weibo has seemingly spilled Vivo&apos;s plans to debut the X Fold 3 series on March 26 at 5 PM local time in China. More importantly, the series is expected to feature a Pro model and a standard, which may feature a 6.5-inch cover display and an 8-inch internal screen. The series may also be released with an in-display fingerprint reader.</p><p>Design-wise, rumors suggest the X Fold 3 series will offer a "thin profile and tall exterior display." The circular camera housing on its rear panel is rumored to stay the same by delivering three Zeiss-branded camera lenses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold-2-review">its predecessor</a>.</p><p>A power boost may hit the X Fold 3 series as the leak purports consumers could see Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC. More internal boosts could arrive in the form of a maximum of 16GB RAM and 1TB of internal storage space.</p><p>Speculation suggests the battery is where the series differs, with the X Fold 3 Pro potentially featuring a 5,800mAh battery while the base model contains a 5,500mAh version. Each phone is rumored to support 120W wired and 50W wireless charging.</p>

<p>The recent rumors double down on a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold-3-pro-specs-leak">we&apos;ve heard previously</a> about Vivo&apos;s upcoming foldable series. The X Fold 3 series appears ready to take on some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a>, as past leaks said it would feature LTPO AMOLED panels with a 120Hz refresh rate. The series was also rumored to feature a 50MP main camera, a 50MP ultra-wide lens, and a 64MP periscope lens with 3x zoom.</p><p>The rumored camera strengths would give the X Fold 3 series quite the leg up over its predecessor as that device offered a 50MP, 12MP, and 12MP triple camera setup.</p><p>With Vivo&apos;s next launch rumored to arrive in a week, the device will likely provide OriginOS 4 (Android 14) out of the box. Additionally, it looks like consumers will be treated to a white colorway.</p>

And again, it's $99.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-Smartwatch-Detection-Bluetooth/dp/B096BKVWZZ">Amazon - $153</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch4-Classic-46mm-Smart-Watch-Bluetooth-Stainless-Steel-Black/797596359" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="89b54da8-4204-4c3d-bf38-24ddcf74cf79" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic 42mm: $349.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic 42mm: $349.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you own a Samsung phone; you don&apos;t mind using one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> from 2022; you have a smaller wrist (this deal is for the 42mm watch). </p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>you can afford a newer Samsung smartwatch.</p><p>To put it simply: if you don&apos;t want to spend much more than $100 on a new smartwatch, this is without a doubt the best deal on the web today. Sure, the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic is a bit old at this point, but it still holds its own against a lot of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">best Samsung watches</a> on the market. You still get the physical rotating bezel with a stainless steel casing (similar to the construction of newer Classic models), plus up to 40 hours of battery life, Wear OS, and a comprehensive suite of health tracking features straight out of the box. </p><p>This Walmart deal comes just a few days before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-spring-sale-2024-early-deals-predictions-and-what-to-expect">Amazon&apos;s Big Spring Sale</a>, a major shopping event that&apos;s sure to rival Prime Day and Black Friday when it comes to great tech deals. That Amazon sale event runs from March 20th through the 25th, but if you don&apos;t want to wait to pick up your new watch, this rollback offer is for you. </p>
