<ul><li>Spotify Wrapped 2024 is officially here, providing a recap of everything you listened to this year.</li><li>In addition to the normal stats and curated playlists, Spotify threw a bit of AI into the mix.</li><li>With the help of Google's NotebookLM, there's a new "My Wrapped AI podcast" that provides a "personalized Audio Overview."</li></ul>
<p>Now that Thanksgiving is in the rearview mirror, the year is rapidly coming to an end. And just like clockwork, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-12-04/wrapped-user-experience-2024/" target="_blank">Spotify Wrapped 2024</a> is starting to roll out, letting you know everything you didn't want to know about your listening habits.</p><p>As expected, when accessing your personalized Wrapped landing page, you're presented with a bunch of curated playlists, along with the "Made for you" for music and "Your shows" for podcasts. Tap the "Let's go" button, and the Spotify app gives us an Instagram Stories-like experience, revealing different stats about what you listened to throughout the year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yLcqjj9sQBZ69Dx4JkT3aH" name="spotify-wrapped-2024-official-screenshots" alt="Spotify Wrapped 2024 screenshots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yLcqjj9sQBZ69Dx4JkT3aH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's not all that Spotify Wrapped 2024 includes, as there's a bit of AI thrown into the mix. After being introduced for Premium subscribers earlier this year, AI DJ gets an upgrade as it is now capable of "providing commentary about your year alongside the music that soundtracked it." With AI Playlist, you're now able to prompt the app to create different playlists using information from Wrapped.</p><p>Although we figured AI would be included in some capacity, we didn't expect to see Google involved. There's an all-new "My Wrapped AI Podcast," which Spotify states was "built with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">Google's NotebookLM</a>", via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overview</a> feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.66%;"><img id="jTKNTRAoineZJ2KskuFobH" name="spotify-wrapped-ai-podcast-official-screenshots" alt=""My Spotify Wrapped AI podcast" screenshots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jTKNTRAoineZJ2KskuFobH.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="529" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it might sound odd to listen to an AI-generated podcast just to remind you that Drake lost to Kendrick, there's no denying that this is a unique addition. Plus, the podcast features "two dynamic hosts using generative AI," so it'll be interesting to see if this hangs around.</p><p>Google managed to beat Spotify to the punch, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-recap-2024-arrives-early">YouTube Music Recap 2024</a> began rolling out in the middle of November. While there are some new and unique features, there's actually not as much subscriber-facing AI integration as you might have thought.</p><p>If you want you're a Spotify Premium subscriber and want to check out your Wrapped 2024, make sure the app is updated to the latest version. Then, it can be found amongst the filter buttons at the top of the screen.</p>

I love it because I enjoy breaking down crazy tech talk into a thing anyone can understand. Sometimes, though, I get a question that goes beyond the scope of a simple tech advice piece because there is no easy answer.</p><p>I got one of those recently, and someone was asking about the speed of a phone chip versus how many cores it has and what is more important. I'm going to try and simplify it here and help everyone understand that there is no real answer to which is better, and why.</p>
<h2 id="system-on-chip-2">System on Chip</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="85bNkSFh4ufNuD2fryEWXk" name="Google-tensor-diagram.png" alt="Google Tensor layout" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/85bNkSFh4ufNuD2fryEWXk.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The processor inside your phone isn't just a processor — it's a complete package that offers multiple functions known as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-soc">SoC</a> (System on Chip).</p><p>A SoC is a type of integrated circuit that contains <em>most</em> of the components that power the brains of a device. In a typical phone or tablet, the SoC has the device's processor and GPU cores, other processors for things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-leverage-ai-to-make-weather-forecasting-more-efficient">AI acceleration</a>, reserved space for cached data and memory needed by the system, Digital Signal Processors (DSP) for things like camera capture and audio, external interfaces for various communication protocols, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/verizon-ericsson-and-qualcomm-reach-107-gbps-lte-downloads">wireless modems for connectivity.</a></p><p>There are also devices like timers, voltage regulators, or power management ICs that don't really affect performance. It's also worth noting that some wireless modems and device memory modules can either be in the SoC or external depending on the device.</p><p>In short, there is a lot of stuff going on inside one small chip that needs a lot of power and runs incredibly hot.</p>
<p>Some companies build SoCs tailored for a unique experience while others make SoCs designed to work well across plenty of devices. There are pros and cons to each approach, but chances are your devices have the latter style of SoC inside from a company like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-successor-price-rumors">Qualcomm</a>. These companies work hard to make chips that perform well when used as designed; a chip designed for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> isn't ideal for a phone, and vice-versa. They all use the same basic concept though — build a package of hardware where each component compliments the others and the result also complements the hardware a user interacts with.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-speed-in-numbers-2">There is speed in numbers</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="C5wrVzh2qxxkb6wMmzSomF" name="8-gen.jpg" alt="Snapdragon 8 Gen 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C5wrVzh2qxxkb6wMmzSomF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="451" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you focus on the "processor" portion of the SoC things are a little confusing. You'll see specs that list several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-3-for-galaxy-leak">different cores clocked at different speeds</a>, and the internet is filled with people arguing the merits of all of them. Ignore those arguments for a moment.</p><p><strong>You need balance more than anything else</strong> for the performance you've come to expect from a device like a phone. It would be best to have some cores that aren't extremely fast, some that are, and software designed to distribute the load in a way that offers the right mix of speed and battery life. And that is hard to do on every level.</p>
<p>A CPU (Central Processing Unit, where most computing tasks are done) core can only do one thing at a time. All computer processing is math, and the core inside a CPU can't really think ahead or look backward; it only tackles the one problem in front of it before it moves on to the next one.</p><p>Clock speed — the GHz numbers you see in the spec sheet, determine how fast each thing can be done. It's all done incredibly fast (millions of operations per second) and the higher the speed the faster each operation is performed.</p><p>Cores determine how many things can be done at the same time. If one core can do 100,000 things per second (no CPU core is this slow but it's an easy number) then five cores can do 500,000 things per second. The more cores a CPU has, the more tasks can be run concurrently.</p>
<p>A thread is a set of instructions for the CPU core. They share the same resources as the process that created them but they can be switched so fast it seems like a CPU core is doing more than one thing at a time.</p><p>If you have a CPU with several fast cores, threads work to make multiple things happen so fast that it seems like they happen at the same time because our brains are not nearly as fast as a CPU core.</p><p>You need fast in-order processing calculation performance on a single core, fast out-of-order (using threads) calculation performance on a single core, and ultra-fast in and out-of-order calculation performance on multiple cores for a good user experience. That's where software comes into play.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KHgGvxGtDZKZdQ6n6pkbc4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-gaming-official-01.jpg" alt="An official Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KHgGvxGtDZKZdQ6n6pkbc4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Generally speaking, a fast CPU core means an application will run quickly on a computer like your phone. Fast multiple cores mean more things can be done in the background, including multiple apps running at once. That's why both single-core and multi-core performance matters.</p><p>Some software, like a game or a video editing program, can be written in ways to benefit from multiple CPU cores, spreading processes and threads across cores in a single application.</p><p>The best analogy I've ever heard to describe this, and I wish I remember where I read it to credit the wise person who first said it:</p><p><strong>A highway has multiple lanes and a speed limit.</strong></p><p><strong>On Highway 10 you have a speed limit of 50 and eight lanes.</strong></p><p><strong>On Highway 11 you have a speed limit of 100 and one lane.</strong></p><p><strong>If you have one fast car you're better off using Highway 11. If you have eight slower trucks you are better off using Highway 10. Some software is a fast car and some is a fleet of slower trucks. The best thing to do would be to put Highway 10 beside Highway 11 and use both.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, we're doing multiple things at once but want whatever our eyes are looking at to run well. We're OK with letting the background tasks be a little slower. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">software powering your phone</a> needs to make sure the tasks running on it are prioritized this way.</p><p><strong>Is core clock speed more important than the number of cores?</strong> Yes, No. Sometimes. Maybe.</p><p>There is no answer to this because the right mix of the number of cores, their speed, and the software using them is what's really important.</p>

Xreal, one of our favorite brands for at-home cinematic AR, announced two new devices that inch closer to the field of view (FoV) and smarts necessary to make AR glasses more widely popular.</p><p>The Xreal One and One Pro are both 3DoF spatial glasses, meaning you can place a virtual screen in 3D space and then move or tilt your head freely while the screen remains anchored in place, instead of the screen following and blocking your vision. Its past glasses needed the $199 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreals-new-ar-glass-companion-brings-android-apps-to-life-in-3d">Beam Pro accessory</a> to add spatial support.</p><p>The motion-to-photon latency is only 3ms at 120Hz, meaning if you move your head, no noticeable delay or blur affects the display as it shifts to its proper, anchored place.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-air-2-series-launch">Xreal Air 2 and 2 Pro glasses</a> had a relatively narrow 46-degree FoV that could support a 133-inch virtual display, the Xreal One jumps to 50º/ 146 inches and the Pro to 57º/ 171 inches, dwarfing whatever massive TVs millionaires have in their homes. The excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/rayneo-air-2s-xr-smart-glasses-review">RayNeo Air 2S XR</a> glasses match the Xreal One with a 120Hz, 600-nit display, but those also have a 46-degree limit.</p>

<p>AR glasses today make you feel like you're looking at things through a narrow box, and it's easy to lose track of things. While they're not quite at the level of Meta's 70-degree prototypes, Xreal One has gotten closer to the display <em>width</em> we're waiting for, and it has "three-level temple adjustments" to "find the right vertical IPD setting," so you don't have to tilt your head to keep things in view.</p><p>Many Xreal users have complained about the Air 2's IPD width matching their eyes. The Xreal One uses "software-based adjustable IPD," while the One Pro has two IPD size options: 57–66mm and 66–75mm. Xreal also promises that the One series will be more comfortable than past models, with a 5-star TÜV Rheinland rating for Eye Comfort and certification for High Visibility and Low Blue-Light.</p><p>The brightness and resolution of these AR glasses aren't especially high, but you get the convenience of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-really-saved-my-neck">working or gaming while flying</a>, or playing Steam Deck games in bed with much more screen space than usual. And the Xreal One Pro offers 700 nits of perceived brightness, a 200-nit jump over the last-gen glasses.</p><p>Xreal also intends to improve the audio quality of these glasses with Sound by Bose certification, promising "superior mid-to-high frequencies" compared to the last generation.</p>

<p>While Xreal glasses are primarily designed for at-home use, the Xreal One series also supports a detachable 1MP RGB camera that can take HD photos or record 1080p video at 60FPS. It will support image recognition and voice commands, adding the kind of AI tricks popularized by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses</a>. This update will arrive sometime "after launch."</p><p>If I have one concern about the Xreal One series, it's that they weight 84g and 87g for the standard and Pro models, which is about 10g heavier than previous Xreal Airs and about an ounce heavier than Meta Ray-Bans. You may end up having an issue with them sliding down your nose frequently, unless they're fitted very well.</p><p>The Xreal One costs $499/ £449/ €549 and ships in mid-December, while the Xreal One Pro costs $599/ £549/ €649 and ships in early 2025; you can preorder both from Xreal or on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/XREAL/page/216E0BEB-8279-43B6-B6F4-E8D9063C91FB">Xreal's Amazon page</a>. Both glasses will be available in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Czech, Netherlands, China, Japan, and Korea.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is continuing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-one-ui-6-watch-wear-os-5-official-rollout">gradual rollout of One UI 6 Watch</a>, as the update is starting to reach Galaxy Watch 5 and Galaxy Watch FE models. The update, based on Wear OS 5, first launched on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and Galaxy Watch 7 when they debuted this past summer. Last month, the OTA update arrived for the Galaxy Watch 6 series, and it's now coming for Samsung's older and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">budget smartwatches</a>.</p><p>Multiple users on Reddit have spotted the update appearing for their Galaxy Watch 5 and Galaxy Watch FE in Europe, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/03/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-watch-fe-wear-os-5-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. The availability of the update appears to be inconsistent, though. It may depend on your region, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1h5ns3x/comment/m07jhgh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">one Reddit user in Malaysia</a> reporting the update becoming available on their Galaxy Watch 5 Pro.</p><p>The update is reaching Bluetooth versions of the watches first, with LTE models receiving the update at a later date. Additionally, there are no known reports of One UI 6 Watch rolling out for Galaxy Watch 5 and Galaxy Watch FE users in the US at the time of publishing.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1h5n2kt/finally_for_watch_5_bt_44mm_after_months_of">FINALLY FOR WATCH 5 (BT; 44mm), AFTER MONTHS OF WAITING!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch">r/GalaxyWatch</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The update includes a few key upgrades, all centered around Samsung Health and Galaxy AI. <strong>Energy Score</strong>, <strong>Sleep Analysis</strong>, and <strong>Race/Workout Routine</strong> are just a few fitness and health-oriented features bundled in the One UI 6 Watch update. It is a large download, nearly two gigabytes in size.</p><p>Being that the Galaxy Watch 6 series just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-begins-rolling-out-one-ui-6-watch-for-older-galaxy-watch-models">received the One UI 6 Watch update last week</a>, Samsung may be quickening its rollout pace. Looking ahead, the LTE and North American versions of the Galaxy Watch 5 and Galaxy Watch FE are expected to get the update soon. It's now starting to appear for the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, too, but should become more widely available in the coming days. Additionally, the Galaxy Watch 4 series is still waiting for One UI 6 Watch.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google teased new lock screen features for its AI model Gemini months ago and one of those tools is now arriving — at least, for some.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/02/gemini-call-message-without-unlocking/">9to5Google</a>, the Gemini app on Android is picking up a setting that lets users "make calls and send messages." The publication states this feature is appearing in the recent beta version of the Google app (v15.48).  According to the post, this is tucked within the app's "Gemini on lock screen" settings page via a toggleable button.</p><p>However, the app warns users that the AI cannot function properly if their "calling and messaging" apps are not "turned on" in Gemini.</p><p>Once this is done, users can surface Gemini's small overlay from their lock screen to call someone. It seems that users can type or vocally speak who they would like Gemini to call. All that's required is that you begin your instruction with "call" followed by your contact's name.</p><p>Google states that users can produce Gemini on their lock screen by using the "Hey Google" command.</p><p>More importantly, the post notes that the Gemini on lock screen feature isn't available on every Android device. If your device does not have it, Gemini surfaces when called, but it will not fulfill the call request. Instead, the AI will prompt you to unlock your device <em>before </em>anything else can be done.</p><p>More testers should begin seeing this before the eventual debut for stable app folk.</p>

<p>We've seen glimpses of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-app-beta-gemini-lock-screen-ai-detailed">Gemini's new lock screen usage</a> in July before features started appearing. The early splash page detailed that the AI could "message, find music, get location-based information, and more with extensions." It was suspected that users would get a wide range of Gemini extensions to use on their lock screen. However, despite those tools being confirmed by Google, they've yet to appear for users.</p><p>What <em>has yet </em>to<em> </em>arrive, per Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/14576209?hl=en">support page</a>, is the ability for Gemini on lock screen to control your alarms, timers, flashlight, volume, and media. Once this appears, Google recommends hopping into the <strong>Gemini app > Profile icon > Settings > Gemini on lock screen</strong>. If it's there, toggle it on to begin using such features.</p><p>The company started pushing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-spotify-extension-rollout-detailed">its Spotify extension</a> for the Gemini app late in November. Users can access commands under its "Play & Search" moniker. The extension lets users find songs based on artist, song title, playlist, or lyric. This new ability was listed alongside several more expected extensions for Gemini like Phone, Messages, WhatsApp, and more.</p>

That's why I was shocked to see the Solo Buds on sale for $30 off on Cyber Monday, and even more surprised to see that this deal is sticking around AFTER Cyber Monday.  At a discounted price of $50, I think the Beats Solo Buds are a no-brainer for a stocking stuffer, backup pair of earbuds, or even a budget-friendly daily driver.</p><p>There's no telling how long the Beats Solo Buds will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/beats-solo-buds-true-wireless-earbuds-matte-black/6501050.p?skuId=6501050" target="_blank">$49.99 ($30 off) at Best Buy</a>, so you should jump on this deal now if you're interested. By the way, this matches the lowest price we've ever seen for the Solo Buds.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a lightweight and compact pair of TWS earbuds; you want a pair of earbuds that won't break the bank; you want fast-pairing support on iOS and Android.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need earbuds with a charging case; you want more expensive earbuds with better sound.</p>
<p>I've reviewed all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best earbuds</a>, from the AirPods Pro 2, to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a>. Now, I'm not here to tell you that these earbuds, costing triple the price of the Beats Solo Buds, sound worse than the Solo Buds. That simply isn't true. But the Solo Buds have one advantage over ALL other earbuds on the market, and that's size. The earbuds' carrying case measures 2.6 x 1.4 x 0.9 in., which is so small you have to see it to believe it.</p><p>That means you can take them with you everywhere, whether that's in a small pocket, purse, or bag. As a trade-off, the Solo Buds come with a carrying case, not a charging case. There's no extra battery in the case, but that doesn't really matter, because each earbud gives you an outstanding 18 hours of battery life on a single charge. A five-minute recharge via USB-C gives the earbuds an extra hour of playback.</p><p>And the Solo Buds sound great for an $80 pair of earbuds, let alone a $50 pair of earbuds. The bass could be fuller, but these tiny earbuds are limited by driver size here. Otherwise, the mids and highs sound excellent. On top of that, you get advanced Beats features, like fast pairing with both iOS and Android.</p><p>I don't know how these earbuds are so cheap, but I know I'd buy them if I were you.</p>

<hr>
<p>Having Google Wallet on your wrist is useful for quick payments, but this latest Wear OS update expands its card support.</p><p>As December gets underway, Google is rolling out its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">Play Services update</a> (v24.47), which is heavily focused on Android and Wear OS. The standout portion of this update regards Google Wallet's new expansion of card and country support for users.</p><p>Concerning the former, the company's support page states that Wear OS devices are receiving an update that brings access to cards for hotel rooms, campus IDs, and "corporate badges."</p><p>Additionally, the page details that "more countries" can now use Google Wallet. This involves the app's appearance on Android, as well as Wear OS watches.</p><p>It's worth noting that this expansion joins Wear OS device's support for credit and debit cards. There were also a few choices for transit that users could pop onto their watch, as well as Google Wallet's support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wearos/answer/14260807?hl=en">for passes via QR or barcode</a>.</p><p>The Play Services update is also rolling in a developer feature addition that lets "Google and third-party app developers to support Device Connectivity related processes in their apps."</p><p>The update started rolling out on December 2, so users should give it a few days before Google Wallet's new support hits their devices.</p>

<p>It's good to see Google extending Wallet support on Wear OS devices after it's been occupied with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-will-soon-let-users-create-a-digital-id-in-wallet-from-their-passport">plans to incorporate passports</a> into digital IDs. The company teased such a possibility in September, stating it would begin "beta-testing" U.S. passports in Wallet. A digital ID like this isn't being accepted everywhere as Google stated only "select" Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints domestically will allow it.</p><p>Those discussions started a month <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/california-preapres-google-wallet-id-support">after California prepared</a> to enter the digital ID game for its residents. The state started testing such functionality with DMV employees before reaching out to regular civilians at a later date. It was stated that users could enter "Add to Wallet" and tap "ID Card" to add their state ID. Similar to the passport situation, California only allowed its digital IDs to be used at "select" terminals at San Francisco International Airport, San Jose International Airport, and Los Angeles International Airport.</p><p>California is joined by several more U.S. states that will soon accept digital IDs like Iowa, New Mexico, and Ohio, which have entered testing.</p>

<p>Garmin is rolling out the December 2024 feature update to many of its smartwatches and computers, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www8.garmin.com/wearables/PDF/WearablesSoftwareUpdate/2024/December2024.pdf?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&zebratwo=CJ&cjevent=afdd050fb10b11ef82f0def90a1eba23&utm_source=CJ&utm_medium=Text" target="_blank">PDF breakdown</a> spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Garmin-details-December-2024-Feature-Drop-for-dozens-of-cycling-computers-and-smartwatches.926747.0.html" target="_blank">NotebookCheck</a>. Users of select Garmin models may already be able to download the update, and the rollout will continue "over the coming weeks." Among the most notable improvements are functional threshold power (FTP) auto-detection and lactate threshold auto-detection.</p><p>The update is available for a wide variety of Garmin models, including the Garmin Fenix 7/Pro series, Epix Gen 2/Pro series, Enduro 2, Tactix 7 series, MARQ Gen 2, Quatix 7/Pro, D2 Mach 1/Pro, Fenix E/8 series, Enduro 3, Forerunner 165/255/265/955/956 series, Venu 3, Vivoactive 5, Edge 540/840/1040/1050 series, and Edge Explore 2. However, not every watch and computer will receive every feature.</p><p>The following Garmin models will receive the December 2024 update, and get the following features:</p>

That includes lactate threshold and FTP auto-detection, Garmin Coach strength training plans, workout execution score improvements, and meditation activity. However, it's worth noting that the Fenix 8 and Enduro 3 shipped with Garmin Coach strength training plans out of the box.</p><p>The new functionality will make it possible for wearers to get their lactate threshold heart rate, pace, and power from their Garmin watch, even without doing high-intensity workouts.</p>

<ul><li>A discovery in Android's Google app beta shows the company might roll out NotebookLM's Audio Overviews.</li><li>The feature operates similarly to how it does on the web; however, the early discovery is only delivering a text-based summary, not the audio file.</li><li>What's unclear is if Android will pick up NotebookLM's "Guide" for the AI hosts, which is debuted in October.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is tipped to expand a useful AI-based feature to Android users that might save you time in lengthy documents.</p><p>In conjunction with X tipster AssembleDebug, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-audio-overviews-3504779/">Android Authority</a> reports that Google is seemingly working on bringing NotebookLM's Audio Overviews to Android. The discovery was made through the Google app's recent beta (v15.48.33.sa.arm64). According to the tipster, the Gemini app is preparing to introduce a "create_podcast" function for Android users.</p><p>Essentially, the code describes this as a "query," allowing users to tap on the button to prompt the AI to produce a generated audio file of the submitted document.</p><p>The tipster states the feature isn't working completely; however, a quick dip in shows the basic steps. It seems users will be able to upload a document from the writing field in the Gemini app by hitting the plus icon. After which, an option will supposedly appear above it stating "generative audio overview." Interacting with this will instruct the AI to scour through the given document to produce a more engaging file hosted by two AIs.</p><p>The publication notes a string in the code that mentions an "overview." This basic overview appears to concern the written summary the AI is also able to produce. AssembleDebug highlights that the specific Audio Overview feature isn't working in this early beta preview and that Gemini defaults to a "text-based summary."</p>

<p>Once this feature rolls out, it's likely that there will be a play option alongside the text-based summary. It's worth mentioning that the written summary appears quite brief. The full audio log <em>should </em>go into greater depth, especially if we consider how it works on the web.</p><p>Google launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overviews</a> as part of NotebookLM in September as an auditory alternative to learning. The feature operates like a radio talk show as the two AI hosts discuss the contents of a submitted document for you. The company highlighted that the AI hosts will also "make connections" about subjects, items, and more found within a submitted document.</p><p>When it rolled out, Google stated users on the web could upload slides, charts, and more alongside documents.</p><p>Android users are seemingly in line to receive the same support; however, it's unclear if Audio Overview's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">Guide</a>" will enter, too. Shortly after in October, the company rolled out an additional function that lets users guide the AI in a specific direction when talking about a document. Users can write a detailed description to "guide the conversation."</p><p>The discovery of Android receiving NotebookLM's podcast-like feature shows space to write something extra <em>after </em>attaching a file. So, perhaps we can expect this; but we won't know for sure until it arrives.</p>

When you first set up Wallet, it automatically scans your Gmail and picks up information on passes you might already have in emails. But even if it's not able to detect a certain pass or you don't see the 'Add to Google Wallet' option for a new online pass, there's a simple way to manually do it.</p><p>We'll also walk you through how you can add a new custom pass to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> via an image of a pass that you may have on your phone. Wallet automatically fills in all the pertinent information that would be needed and saves it as a card. The next time you need to scan your subway pass or a membership card at the gym, you can simply fire up the app and tap on the card you need, without worrying about the physical card or jumping through multiple apps. It truly is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">best Android apps</a> from Google, today.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-make-a-custom-pass-in-wallet-via-a-barcode-or-qr-code-2">How to make a custom pass in Wallet via a barcode or QR code</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Google Wallet</strong> app.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Add to Wallet</strong> button with the '+' symbol in the bottom right corner.</p><p>3. Choose the type of card you want to add. We've selected '<strong>Loyalty card</strong>.'</p><p>4. Next, you'll see a list of popular options for your region.</p><p>5. For this example, we've chosen <strong>'Watsons Malaysia.'</strong></p>

<p>6. Now, you can either manually enter your member ID and save it, or use the 'Scan your card' option.</p><p>7. Scanning is always better as it's a lot quicker. Simply point your camera's viewfinder to the barcode or QR code on the card and it should be done in a second.</p><p>9. Your newly added card should show up on Wallet's main page.</p>

<p>1. Follow the instructions above till the second step.</p><p>2. Here, choose the '<strong>Photo</strong>' option which should be separated from others by a wavy line.</p><p>3. If you have a physical card you wish to scan, hold the phone directly above it and <strong>press the capture button</strong>.</p><p>4. You can crop & rotate, add a filter, retake, or delete the photo if needed.</p><p>5. To add a photo of your card from your image gallery, simply press the <strong>symbol on the left</strong> of the shutter button to browse your gallery for the image of your pass.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.33%;"><img id="9mHR2eyrf9Z5YXt3fcJvWT" name="add-custom-pass-google-wallet-2" alt="Google Wallet screenshot showing adding pass by photo method" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mHR2eyrf9Z5YXt3fcJvWT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1200" height="880" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Your card must have a barcode or QR code for it to be successfully added to Wallet.</p><p>Another thing we noticed was that if your pass or card has both a barcode and a QR code, the app gets confused and warns you about there being too many codes. An easy fix is to simply cover one of the codes and then try rescanning.</p>

<p>Google Wallet has had a rocky history, with it first being an exclusive app for Nexus phones for contactless payments to eventually being killed off in favor of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pay">Google Pay</a>. The Wallet app is here to stay though, at least for the foreseeable future as Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-changes-june-shutdown-announced">shuttered the Google Pay app</a> in the U.S. as of June 2024. Apart from peer-to-peer payments, the current Wallet app can do pretty much everything else.</p><p>You can store debit and credit cards in Google Wallet and Google just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-supports-42-additional-banks">added dozens of new banks</a> in 2024 alone. If you do plan on adding your banking cards, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-lock-down-google-wallet-cards">make sure it's secure</a> so it's not misused in the event you lose your phone. Other than adding your loyalty cards and boarding passes, you can also use Wallet to store additional items like digital car keys, corporate office passes, hotel keys, and so on. It's amazing how much use you can get out of a single app.</p>
