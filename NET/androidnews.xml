                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Hardware innovation in the gadgets you buy is dead. Well, it&apos;s not <em>really</em> dead, but it seems that way, and it&apos;s not going to change in the next few years.</p><p>There are important changes in the bits inside things like our phones. Things you probably can&apos;t see or when you hear about them you&apos;ll respond with a shrug if anything. Powerful co-processors and dedicated NPUs just aren&apos;t very sexy to regular folks like us who buy this stuff. </p>
<p>Fancy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tsmc-qualcomm-2nm-chip">new chips from Qualcomm</a> or Apple and faster memory are important though, because they power the big changes we can see; new features and improvements to all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">software that powers our favorite tech toys</a> will be the thing that makes us want to buy them.</p><p>This isn&apos;t anything new. Software changes have long been a big selling point when some executive stands on a stage to tell you why their product is the best. What&apos;s going to change is the pace and scale of these changes, while the devices that provide them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">seem to be unchanged</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VBMaZUZdQBNrGEvpfo2xUC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-6-6.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 (left, black) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (right, silver) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VBMaZUZdQBNrGEvpfo2xUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A lot of folks aren&apos;t going to be happy about this. Expect to see headlines from the tech press saying that the next device from Apple, Samsung, or Google will be just like the last device—especially when some of the software changes will work their way back to the older models.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean a lot, though. The <em><strong>only</strong></em> reason to buy an older model of something like a phone or watch is to save money (it&apos;s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-refurbished-phones">a really good reason</a>). The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> is a big improvement over the Galaxy Watch 6 (for example) in every measurable way, even if it looks mostly the same on the outside. These improvements will show themselves when it comes to those software features designed to make them something we want to buy because they will work better. A lot better.</p>
<p>You already know why. It&apos;s that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">stupid little thing called AI</a> that companies want to cram into everything because they feel like it will make us want gadgets even more than we do now. Even the most mundane things, like your phone&apos;s home screen wallpaper, have AI forcibly injected into them. </p><p>This sort of thing needs better hardware to grow, but it&apos;s not hardware that seems like a showcase feature. Look at the latest processors from Apple or Qualcomm to see what I&apos;m saying. Yes, they are XX% faster and will supposedly get XX% better battery life because those are improvements we see every year, even when a chip isn&apos;t great.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1921px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.12%;"><img id="KmtCxVcApo2b3pcUbqRnKX" name="Google-IO-2023-pixel-emoji-wallpaper.jpg" alt="Emoji wallpaper at Google IO 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KmtCxVcApo2b3pcUbqRnKX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1921" height="1078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The big changes, and what makes these new components important, are the ways they can handle the copious amount of AI processing the devices using them will require. Everything from phones to smart doorbells are now miniature factories of AI software. All of them need better hardware under the hood, working in ways nobody cares about.</p><p>We should probably be excited about all of this. It&apos;s easy to get burnt out by "AI Everywhere" when all the tech companies are using it in all the things. But this will lead to that next big thing when it comes to the features we want. It simply needs a smart team to dream them up and develop them.</p>
<p>This will last for a few years, and then we&apos;ll go back to seeing phones that seem all new and different each year. Until then, expect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-and-pixel-9-pro-xl-leaked-hands-on-video">Pixel 9</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ios-16-features-android">iPhone 16</a> to be a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15</a> on the outside unless you count a different-shaped camera bump or a new color. Give them a few months, though, and we&apos;ll see where the real changes are and why we should (or shouldn&apos;t) want to buy them.</p>

<ul><li>According to The Verge, Google may be looking to partner with EssilorLuxottica to make Gemini-powered smart glasses.</li><li>However, EssilorLuxottica is already the maker of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses, and that's unlikely to change.</li><li>Meta and EssilorLuxottica have found success with their smart glasses, and Meta is reportedly considering an investment in EssilorLuxottica. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>EssilorLuxottica is the eyeglass retailer that you might not know is behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses</a>. To make these spectacles, Meta brought the tech smarts and EssilorLuxottica brought the experience — the company has been making eyewear under some name or another since 1849. Following the overwhelming success of the Meta Ray-Bans, Meta is reportedly interested in continuing its relationship with the eyeglass company, but Google might have something to say about that. </p><p>According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24202244/google-meta-ray-ban-essilorluxottica-partnership" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, Google reached out to EssilorLuxottica about making a new pair of smart glasses with Gemini, its AI assistant. It&apos;s unclear what a partnership between Google and the eyeglass maker might look like; however, The Verge&apos;s sources say it&apos;s “extremely unlikely” that Meta would be dropped in the process. That said, it&apos;s unsurprising that Google is starting to make real preparations for another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-all-different-types-smart-glasses-and-ones-are-best">smart glasses</a> product.</p><p>Of course, Google is known for infamously making Google Glass ahead of its time. More recently, the company has publicly made moves toward returning to the augmented reality space. For example, it briefly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">showed off a prototype version of AR smart glasses</a> with Gemini capabilities at Google I/O earlier this year. It also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">demoed Project Starline and Project Astra</a>, both of which make use of augmented reality and AI to provide new experiences.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JUMGmoxyTpwcMxKj3qkVb5" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wearing-blue-touch-pad.jpg" alt="Using the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses touch pad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JUMGmoxyTpwcMxKj3qkVb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I tried out Project Astra in a demo at Google I/O, and its easy to see how this kind of technology could integrate with a pair of smart glasses. Project Astra is a multimodal AI modal that can process visual input, voice input, and text. While most large language models (LLMs) only have the information stored in their data sets and training materials, multimodal models are more versatile. A model like Project Astra could tap into an LLM, multimodal input for context, and web results for up-to-date information, for example. </p><p>Currently, Project Astra seems to be in its early stages. Google released a pretty convincing pre-recorded video showing its capabilities ahead of its developer conference, but it didn&apos;t back that up in live demos. There also isn&apos;t an official release date for when Project Astra might release. Meanwhile, OpenAI is getting closer to fully debuting its multimodal GPT-4o model with voice. Meta updated its Ray-Ban smart glasses to support multimodal inputs, too. </p><p>A partnership between Google and EssilorLuxottica could result in a smart glasses product with Gemini, which has already started to take over in Android, replacing the Google Assistant in many areas. The version of Gemini that would ship with smart glasses would likely feature many of the experimental functionalities Google has shown off under the Project Astra name. </p><p>However, it seems likely that either Google or Meta would want some level of exclusivity with EssilorLuxottica. The two companies will be strong competitors when and if Google releases a pair of smart glasses. You could argue that they are already competing in the key areas of artificial intelligence, virtual/augmented reality, and social networking. While there is an obvious benefit for EssilorLuxottica to partner with as many companies as makes sense, I&apos;m not sure Meta or Google will go for it. </p>
<h2 id="why-the-meta-and-essilorluxottica-partnership-just-makes-sense-2">Why the Meta and EssilorLuxottica partnership just makes sense</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gfsiwsT4LqFHiCZyWgtB2Y" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Smart-Glasses-on-rocks.jpeg" alt="A side view of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gfsiwsT4LqFHiCZyWgtB2Y.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s reported interest in teaming up with EssilorLuxottica seems like a long shot if, for no other reason, its current partnership with Meta just makes sense. Meta was the first to pull off mainstream smart glasses, and they&apos;re in physical retail stores nationwide. Prior attempts from Google and from other companies — like Snapchat and Amazon — haven&apos;t been nearly as successful. </p><p>There&apos;s also another factor to consider. EssilorLuxottica&apos;s brands have real value, and the company can&apos;t waste its brand power and integrity on a half-baked project from Google. We already know that Google has a propensity to kill off projects before even giving them room to grow, and that creates a risky situation for a traditional retailer like EssilorLuxottica. Ray-Ban, for example, is a valuable brand with instantly-recognizable designs. Partnering with Google for a lesser product could cause more harm to that brand than good. </p><p>Finally, Meta isn&apos;t going to lose that partnership easily. In fact, the company is proactively looking to make a sizable investment in EssilorLuxottica. According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/4da37b6a-b241-4090-9445-467087694ab7" target="_blank">Financial Times</a>, Meta wants to buy 5% of the eyeglass maker in exchange for billions. Meta owning a stake in the company, even a small one, would go a long way in ensuring that their partnership will continue. Unlike the rumored Google talks, the Meta/EssilorLuxottica deal is said to be advanced and likely to be finalized. </p><p>It shouldn&apos;t be surprising that Google is opening up a line of communication with EssilorLuxottica. The company has a recognizable brand and more than a century of experience making eyewear. However, I think Meta and EssilorLuxottica are deeply intertwined at this point, and a new deal would be high risk and low reward for the European eyeglass conglomerate. Google might have to turn elsewhere if it wants to mass-produce a new pair of smart glasses.</p>

<ul><li>Google is adding new curated Collections sections to the Play Store and home screen widgets, helping users find apps and content that they love.</li><li>The Play Store is becoming a "destination" rather than just a place to download apps, including live chats with content creators, full comics, videos, and more.</li><li>Google Play Games for PC is getting several upgrades, including synced cloud saves and the ability to run multiple games at a time on a PC.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google Play Store has millions of apps to choose from, but while that means you have plenty of options, it also means finding the right app can be difficult. Google is announcing a host of new ways it&apos;s improving curation and app discovery on the Play Store, but it&apos;s doing it in a way I didn&apos;t expect: it&apos;ll be using humans to do the job, not AI.</p><p>This seems counter to what the company has been doing lately with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. While there&apos;s a light AI component to the equation, Google&apos;s new Collections feature highlights the importance of having humans at the center of a human-focused policy change.</p><p>I had the opportunity to interview Aurash Mahbod, the General Manager of Games for Google Play, about this new move and other changes being made to the Play Store and to try out the new changes at a special Google Play press event in New York City.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:300px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:178.00%;"><img id="yo4pTkjoZkB9jFmqKvFLAQ" name="google-play-manga.gif" alt="Scrolling through manga on the Google Play Store's new comics section" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yo4pTkjoZkB9jFmqKvFLAQ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="300" height="534" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s new curation changes are starting in Japan with the launch of a new Comics tab today. Comics is a collection of Japanese Play Store users’ favorite things, including traditional page-by-page manga, new vertically-scrolling manga, anime, and even live chats and videos with your favorite creators.</p><p>The inclusion of live tiles, videos, and other personal recommendations based on interests is unique among the many times Google has tried to improve curation over the years. I&apos;m fact, it&apos;s part of a larger move to make the Play Store “a destination” instead of a place users only go to for apps.</p><p>Jumping to the comics section showed me the latest manga releases, including the ability to read the manga right from the Play Store without having to open another app. Some of this builds on the Instant Apps feature Google launched years ago, but bringing YouTube-style live chats and videos to the platform is something new entirely. In other words, you won&apos;t need to go anywhere else to find out what&apos;s new, regardless of your interests.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.12%;"><img id="CHGhqPYcFwq77tF7ubosBX" name="google-play-july-2024-update.jpg" alt="A look at the new Play Store curated collections including shopping, music, and social" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHGhqPYcFwq77tF7ubosBX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1518" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Likewise, Google is expanding this concept to sports, shopping, music, and more with specifically human-curated sections of the store based on your interests. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-im-using-fitness-tech-train-my-marathon">Marathon runners</a>, for example, may find a new section that shows them all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-apps-android">best apps to use to prepare for a marathon</a>, including some obvious picks — like training or dieting apps — but also some less obvious ones, like stopwatches and timers that might not normally be categorized as a “running app,” too.</p><p>There&apos;s even a new hot bar at the bottom of each curated section, which provides quick one-tap access to recommended apps that can run instantly, whether you have the app installed or not.</p><p>Many of these tabs and curated lists are spun off from a new multi-select interests feature that&apos;ll be presented to Play Store users over the coming days and weeks, helping to better personalize content. You can even remove installed apps from the personalize list, ensuring that one-off app installs don&apos;t mess up your beautifully curated store.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:300px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:178.00%;"><img id="wzZTrbrYww8bcaU9w9TQzP" name="google-play-new-collections-widget.gif" alt="Using the new Collections widget for the Google Play Store on a Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wzZTrbrYww8bcaU9w9TQzP.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="300" height="534" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A new resizable widget is also launching to highlight curated Play Store content, giving you quick access to recommendations right from the home screen.</p><p>Mobile gamers are getting a few treats in the update, as well. An expansion of Google Play Games for PC now syncs your saves to the cloud so you can seamlessly move between your favorite platforms without losing progress. This makes it easy to play your favorite games on the go and enjoy them on the TV or monitor once you get back home.</p><p>Google Play Games for PC is also launching the ability to run multiple games at once, so you can enjoy a more active game while your Clash of Clans session continues on the side.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:540px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="GPrzNNSPs8acH87AsY3CiM" name="google-play-games-for-pc-multi-game.gif" alt="Playing two games at once on Google Play Games for PC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GPrzNNSPs8acH87AsY3CiM.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="540" height="304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mahbod told me these moves are in an effort to make Play Games the “ultimate gaming destination” since you can play all your favorite titles on seemingly any device you want. Yes, that likely includes the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung XR headset</a> being co-developed by Samsung and Google.</p><p>These changes also come together to ensure that Google can provide intrinsic value to developers who often struggle to keep users interested in games for the long haul. Curation doesn&apos;t just include new apps but also important app updates, helping to pull users back in if they&apos;ve stopped playing a game for a long period of time.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-all-means-2">What this all means</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MQQWT82oa8HJ46FX29j6ZY" name="google-play-app-release-stats-july-2024.jpg" alt="App release stats for Google Play as of July 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MQQWT82oa8HJ46FX29j6ZY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has tried to usher in better curation in the past and this is the latest attempt to keep users more interested in the Play Store instead of just coming back once in a blue moon for app updates. This latest move has the real potential to work, but there are also some obvious problems with any sort of "personalization." </p><p>At the forefront, Google faces is potential user backlash at becoming yet another ad. Since services like Google and Facebook are free, users are often "the product" as they are served ads in one form or another. While I didn&apos;t see any obvious signs of an "ad" during my hands-on time with the new Google Play updates, there&apos;s little doubt that Google&apos;s curation decisions will be influenced by sponsors along the way.</p><p>Moves like this are mainly designed to appease developers, especially as live service games like Fortnite or the latest iteration of Candy Crush continue to cost lots of money to keep updated. User retention is vital to keeping these games alive, and Google has to be creative in its endeavor to keep users interested.</p><p>But what&apos;s good for developers is also good for users. As consumers, we&apos;re always looking for the next big thing. It&apos;s just the nature of how capitalism works and Google is playing to that with these updates. Giving users what they want — a never-ending stream of great new apps and games — will inevitably keep people happy and coming back for more.</p>

<ul><li>Tipster Digital Chat Station has come up with some interesting details about the next foldable phone from Oppo.</li><li>The upcoming foldable from Oppo will likely be available as OnePlus Open 2 in select markets.</li><li>According to the tipster, we might see a huge battery improvement in the upcoming foldables from OnePlus and Oppo.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus introduced its first foldable, the OnePlus Open, last year. Its successor is one of the company&apos;s most anticipated devices, yet to be released, and until now, very little is known about the handset. However, new information from a prominent tipster reveals what to expect from the OnePlus Open 2.</p><p>Before getting into the leak, one should know that OnePlus and Oppo share the same design elements for most premium devices, especially with foldables. For instance, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-and-n3-flip-global-launch">Oppo Find N3</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> turned out to be the same handsets, including what they pack underneath; however, they were catered to different regions.</p>
<p>According to tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&jsonp=vglnk_172180316594010&key=b8f771eed689587b82c4635131ce08d7&libId=lyygo1k101010l04000UL1i1foghef917h&loc=https%3A%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2024%2F07%2F22%2Foneplus-open-battery-sequel-rumor%2F&ccpaConsent=1---&v=1&out=https%3A%2F%2Fweibo.com%2F6048569942%2FOop291Dik&title=OnePlus%20Open%20sequel%20allegedly%20has%20a%206%2C000%20mAh%20battery%2C%20somehow&txt=Weibo%20from%20%3Cem%3EDigital%20Chat%20Station%3C%2Fem%3E">Digital Chat Station</a> on Weibo (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/22/oneplus-open-battery-sequel-rumor/">9to5Google</a>), Oppo&apos;s next foldable release is aimed for Q1 2025. It is also expected to pack the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>, which will likely be unveiled at Snapdragon Summit later this year. The other interesting element is the massive 6000mAh battery, which is rumored to power the next foldable from Oppo.</p><p>As mentioned, this translates to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> packing the same specs as Oppo&apos;s upcoming foldable. While it&apos;s interesting to have some insights about the forthcoming book-style phones, it is worth noting that Digital Chat Station didn&apos;t specifically mention the aforementioned handset in the Weibo post. </p><p>Instead, it was hinted at amid Huawei&apos;s next triple foldable handset&apos;s discussion on the Weibo post. The tipster mentioned a blue-green phone, presumed to be Oppo&apos;s and hence the Find series, which is presumably the OnePlus Open 2. As 9to5 points out, it is worth considering the speculation mentioned earlier with a grain of salt.</p><p>Nonetheless, if the above rumor is accurate, we might see a promising <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> from the company that can compete with the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-and-magic-vs3-foldables-announced">Honor Magic V3</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Mix Fold 4</a>, and the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-confirms-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-real-in-official-tease">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p>

<ul><li>A report claims that Google is dropping the dongle design and pursuing a "TV Streamer" box to continue the Chromecast lineage.</li><li>The leaked photos show the box features a sloped design on a small pedestal with a redesigned remote that drops the Assistant icon and moves the volume rocker.</li><li>It was rumored earlier this year that Google was working on a Chromecast 4K successor, which pairs with a leaked remote photo from October.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There&apos;s been a lot circulating about the "next generation of Chromecast," but a new report claims that Google isn&apos;t going the dongle route.</p><p>A couple of images shared with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/22/google-tv-streamer/">9to5Google</a> claim to be of the new "Google TV Streamer" box, which is said to replace the Chromecast dongle. The alleged lifestyle photos suggest the table-top designed box will have a slated form. This TV Streamer appears much wider than it is tall, as well. Additional functions, aside from streaming, are unknown.</p><p>The box will reportedly feature a slightly redesigned remote. It seems Google plans to keep the circular directional pad on top with the back option and a colored home button nestled beneath.</p><p>The "Voice" button drops Google Assistant&apos;s icon for a simple microphone symbol and is sat next to the volume rocker. The rocker in itself sees a shift from the side of the remote, which is what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">Chromecast users</a> are currently accustomed to.</p><p>The rest of the remote will supposedly hold a YouTube and Netflix button, a "Star" shortcut icon, and a mute button.</p><p>Smaller rumored details state that the "TV Streamer" box will feature a power cable and an HDMI cable flowing from its rear ports. Moreover, the publication ponders whether or not Google will give this box the rumored Pixel Tablet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-media-handoff-discovered">ultra-wideband handoff feature</a>.</p>

<p>The rumors behind a "new" Chromecast have continued to evolve, but a report from April suggested a refreshed model could sport <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-4k-successor-may-come-soon-new-remote">more RAM and/or storage</a>. Performance issues that are plaguing the almost four-year-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">Chromecast with Google TV 4K</a> could also be solved thanks to a new chip. The rumor stated a new remote could be paired with the streaming device, which we&apos;ve heard before.</p><p>Late last year, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-new-remote-leak">leaked rendering</a> of a tutorial photo for this revamped remote surfaced. The photo showed a button layout similar to what the photos offered to 9to5 look like. The circular D-pad on top with several buttons, the volume rocker, and the new "Star" icon would let users quickly hop into apps they&apos;ve enjoyed most.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when we could hear more about this "TV Streamer" box. However, we are coming up on Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">August 13 hardware event</a> for Pixel devices. Let&apos;s not hold our breath over it.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced that users can no longer purchase new episodes or seasons of shows directly on Google TV. </li><li>The company seems to be transitioning its content to Youtube, considering all new shows can now only be purchase via that app. </li><li>The update is set to roll out in the coming weeks, based on location and will not impact the ability to purchase movies on Google TV. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google announced on Tuesday (July 22) that it is changing how people purchase shows on Google TV.  </p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googletv/thread/286737539/upcoming-changes-to-purchasing-tv-shows-from-google-tv?">blog post</a>, users can no longer buy episodes or seasons of TV shows on the platform from Google TV and Android TV devices. However, this update doesn&apos;t impact the ability to purchase movies on the platform. It looks like the company wants to completely transition to YouTube, keeping all streaming under one roof—as TV shows purchased until Tuesday will now be available through the YouTube app. </p><p>In 2022, YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/stream-full-seasons-tv-free-youtube/">added</a> thousands of TV shows to its platform, which allowed US viewers to watch full seasons of TV shows for free with ads, including "Hell’s Kitchen," "Andromeda," "Heartland," and more. At the same time, about 1,500 movies could also be streamed on the platform, making it easier for users to find the content they need in one place.</p><p>"You can continue to purchase <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9675559?hl=en&ref_topic=9257602&sjid=5906391914651371696-NC&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=1">TV shows from YouTube</a> depending on country availability," the post added. </p><p>Nevertheless, users can still access previously purchased shows on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a>, "including active rentals and entire TV seasons, regardless of where the purchase was made." New shows purchased on YouTube since yesterday can now only be streamed on the same platform.</p><p>Google has not clearly stated the reason behind this transition. However, it does say that this update will roll out in the coming weeks based on your country. This is said to impact Android and iOS users with the Google TV app on their devices.</p><p>The move definitely seems strange since the company seemingly wanted Google TV to be the hub for all things streaming back in December 2023, when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/play-movies-tv-shutters-in-january-2024-for-google-tv">announced</a> that the Google Play Movies & TV app would stop working and transition to the Google TV platform. Now that users can no longer purchase new shows on Google TV, it could cause them to move away from the platform altogether. It remains to be seen if Google will continue to have Google TV as a streaming platform or if it will also be gradually shelved.</p>
