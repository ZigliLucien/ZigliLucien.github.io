<ul><li>Motorola quietly added a new support document for “What’s new in Android 14,” signaling the update’s imminent release.</li><li>Razr Plus 2024 and Razr 2024 users have started to see Android 14 appear on their devices, though not all device owners have received the update.</li><li>Android 14 comes to Motorola’s foldables from 2023 about a year after they were first introduced, and just days after the new Razr phones were revealed.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Motorola recently unveiled its next-generation foldables, which are set to launch this month: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">the Razr Plus 2024 and Razr 2024</a>. Those devices will launch with Android 14, but when Motorola showed them off, the current-gen Razr Plus 2023 and Razr 2023 were still stuck on Android 13. The company is finally changing that, as the Android 14 update is rolling out for some Razr owners about a year after their phones were first released.</p><p>Several users have seen the Android 14 update appear on their Razr Plus or Razr phones over the last few days, but it isn’t hitting all devices right now (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/motorola-razr-2023-finally-received-android-14-update/" target="_blank">YTechB</a> also noticed that Motorola quietly published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.motorola.com/hc/5508/14/global/en-us/?t=CG0608830866" target="_blank">support document</a> explaining what’s new in Android 14 for the Razr 40 Ultra. That’s what the Razr Plus is called outside of North America. </p><p>“Better late than never” is one way to look at Motorola’s slow pace of supporting Android 14 on the Razr Plus and Razr. Another viewpoint might be that the lack of urgency in updating Motorola’s flagship foldable is just another reason why the company’s software support shouldn’t be trusted. Android Central editor Derrek Lee has been using the Razr Plus 2023 as a daily driver for the better part of the last year, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">it has been a bit of a mixed bag</a>. Software support, particularly for Android 14 but also for the Gemini app, is a key negative to using the Razr Plus 2023. </p><p>Now that the Android 14 update is rolling out to the 2023 lineup of Motorola foldables, it feels like a wrong has been righted. But at the same time, I’m not sure this excuses Motorola’s poor rollout pace for the upgrade. For reference, the Moto G Stylus 5G 2023 got the Android 14 update before the Razr Plus 2023, and the former phone is a budget device that retailed for $400. What’s the point of paying for premium Motorola phones if those customers aren’t prioritized? </p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/razr/comments/1duszym/i_finally_got_the_android_14_update_on_my_razr">I finally got the Android 14 update on my RAZR after several months of waiting 🥲🙌🏽</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/razr">r/razr</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Motorola promises that the Razr Plus 2023 will get three years of full OS upgrades and four years of bi-monthly security patches. The company ticks off the first OS upgrade of that promise with Android 14, and it can still uphold its end of the bargain. However, I’m not sure if this is what Razr owners pictured when they purchased their smartphone. </p><p>Razr phones are already in a weird spot since they were introduced in the summer months, and most of us are already looking ahead to the next Android update. The Razr Plus 2023 and Razr 2023 launched with Android 13, and Android 14 came just a few months later. This same scenario will play out for the Razr Plus 2024 and Razr 2024, which will launch with Android 14 a few months before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> debuts. </p><p>The predicament wouldn’t be as much of a problem if Motorola rolled out Android updates quickly. In fact, despite Samsung launching its foldables <em>after</em> Motorola, this release schedule hasn’t been a problem. It’s only an issue because Motorola takes an insanely long time to roll out Android updates. If I were a prospective Razr Plus 2024 buyer, and I thought Motorola might not give that phone Android 15 until July 2025, it would certainly factor into my purchasing decision. </p>

<p>At face value, it’s easy to rag on Motorola for not providing efficient, reliable, and extensive software support for its premium smartphones. But it’s never that simple. In its effort to bring Android 14 to its 2023 lineup of folding phones, Motorola made a lot of good choices. For starters, it decided to bring some of the new software features debuting on the Razr Plus 2024 to the current Razr Plus 2023. These features will actually be available on the current models starting now, and that’s <em>before </em>the new models become available for purchase.</p><p>The list of new features includes improved cover screen software, new panels, and better fonts. Motorola also added an always-on display and the ability to use the camera’s flash to signify unread notifications. That’s without mentioning all of the base Android 14 features that Google added to the Android Open Source Project version that Motorola’s MyUX is based on.</p><p>It’s not a given that companies will bring new software features designed for newer phones to older ones. In fact, Motorola might be better off making features exclusive to the 2024 models to make them a better value or a more appealing upgrade. Of course, the fact that they didn’t do that should be praised. There’s no technical reason why these improvements can’t run on the Razr Plus 2023, and it’s a good thing they’re being ported to that model with Android 14.</p><p>This only makes the software situation more complicated. On one hand, Motorola’s slow rollout of Android 14 should be an immediate red flag for people considering buying one of its newer phones. On the other hand, adding Razr Plus 2024 features to Razr Plus 2023 with an update is a consumer-friendly move for which Motorola deserves credit. At the end of the day, buyers need to decide whether Motorola’s updates are worth the wait because speed and longevity aren’t the company’s strengths. </p>

<ul><li>Meta's Threads reached 175 million users one year after it launched for the public.</li><li>The platform clearly competes with X (formerly Twitter) but takes a vastly different approach to the text-first social media app archetype.</li><li>However, Threads' success must be put in context — Meta isn't sharing daily user figures and is still heavily leveraging Instagram to grow the younger platform. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>About a year ago, it looked like Elon Musk was driving Twitter (now X) into the ground, and rumors swirled about Meta cooking up a competitor of its own. The company seemed to have rushed the release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/threads-gains-trending-topics-in-a-move-making-it-more-like-x">Threads</a> — a text-based social media app built on the back of Instagram — to capitalize on the uncertainty surrounding X. The plan appears to have worked: Threads hit 100 million users after being available for just five days last July.</p><p>Threads launched one year ago as of July 5, and it’s continuing to grow, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says. The platform has 175 million monthly active users, he revealed in a Thread (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191074/meta-threads-users-mark-zuckerberg" target="_blank">The Verge</a>).</p>

<p>Meta’s history of creating or operating great social media platforms certainly helped get Threads off the ground. That’s even more true because Meta decided to make Instagram and Threads accounts one and the same. It pushed Instagram users—of which there are more than two billion globally—to give Threads a try. Instagram users started seeing suggested Threads in their Instagram notifications, a clear push from Meta to get people on the new platform.</p><p>This is a common strategy employed by social media platforms. By leveraging their existing user bases, these companies can skip the excruciating process of building up the first wave of site users. We’re seeing this again with TikTok. There’s a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-notes-app-soft-launch">TikTok Notes app</a> beginning to roll out in limited testing phases for users in some countries. It’s an Instagram rival, and since TikTok is arguably the biggest social media platform on the planet right now, ByteDance is showing Notes teasers in the main TikTok.</p><p>Meta and Threads got a head start by leveraging the success of Instagram, but that shouldn’t discount how impressive the launch of Threads really was. It hit 100 million users in five days, which we’ve never seen before. If you recall, OpenAI’s ChatGPT app became the fastest-growing mobile app after it reached 100 million users in two months. Threads made one of the apps of the year (and perhaps the software of the decade) look like an amateur with its blistering launch. </p>

<p>After the launch of Threads, something interesting happened. Twitter — or X, if you like Musk’s new branding — didn’t die. Advertisers either pulled away from the platform or threatened to, and many came crawling back. Musk, either as the platform’s official CEO or now as its de-facto dictator, continued to make platform-breaking decisions. The verification system was completely destroyed, the X Premium subscriptions were prioritized, and likes were hidden. </p><p>And yet, X looks just as alive as it ever has. Musk hasn’t shared official growth or active user figures for X, so we don’t know for sure how it’s doing. But we don’t really have to. X is still culturally relevant; it’s still the place people go for breaking news in tech or politics, and it’s still the “town square” of the internet. For example, when Sam Altman was fired from OpenAI, hired by Microsoft, and then re-hired by OpenAI, it all happened on X. Threads was barely part of the conversation, and it was just catching up with what had happened an hour earlier on X. </p><p>For context, I’m not a huge fan of Musk or the changes he made to X. I don’t pay for X Premium, nor am I particularly happy about spending a ton of time on X. It’s still my most-used social media platform, both for work-related and personal reasons. X is where breaking news happens, and it’s also where the most interesting conversations happen. </p>

<h2 id="why-is-threads-still-a-thing-2">Why is Threads still a thing?</h2>
<p>So, if Threads has 175 million users, why isn’t it as lively as X? That might have something to do with Zuckerberg’s reporting of <em>monthly</em> active users. I check Threads at least once a month, usually only for a few minutes. A notification comes across my phone or appears on Instagram, so I see what it’s about. By comparison, I’m on X every single day. <em>Daily</em> active users dictate how vibrant a social media platform is, not <em>monthly</em> users. </p><p>Threads’ early success gives me hope that it can build up the number of daily users on the platform, thus increasing its liveliness. To me, the fact that it added 75 million users after an early spurt is more impressive than the quick 100 million it started with last July. Prolonged growth is what social platforms need for long-term success. And when it comes to social networks, don’t bet against Meta.</p><p>The thing is, Threads isn’t trying to be Twitter. It doesn’t really want to be the hub for breaking news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/threads-allows-users-to-limit-quote-posts-on-the-app-and-web">controversy</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-our-approach-to-political-content-on-instagram-and-threads" target="_blank">politics</a>. Without sounding too reductive, Threads is looking for more wholesome content. When I go on Threads, I see cool desk setups, scenic views, and generally uplifting content. When I load up X, I want to pull my hair out due to the engagement bait, awful or misleading takes, and generally negative content on the platform. </p><p>Maybe that’s why Threads is still growing. I may be addicted to using X, but it’s not a generally enjoyable experience. Threads, on the other hand, are mostly positive. People looking for the antithesis of X now have Threads, and 175 million users seem to like the difference in direction.</p>

<hr>
<p>Last week, a massive leak uncovered nearly everything about Samsung’s upcoming foldables — the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 — which will be officially announced at a Galaxy Unpacked event on July 10. The leak featured <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-galaxy-z-flip-6-full-specs-leak">official marketing images and press materials</a>, leaving little to the imagination. One change is so small that you might have missed it, and yet it could have the most impact of any change Samsung is making this year. </p><p>It’s no secret that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">folding phones</a> have had a durability problem since day one. Samsung’s first Galaxy Z Fold device broke into the hands of reviewers before the phone became fully available for consumers. Subsequent versions of the Z Fold 2, Z Fold 3, and Z Flip were better but still had serious durability concerns. It wasn’t until the Galaxy Z Flip 4 and Galaxy Z Fold 4 that Samsung seemed to really perfect the folding phone design. </p><p>In the beginning, foldables were brittle, lacked water resistance, and featured weak screens. Eventually, Samsung added water resistance with an IPX8 certification on more recent models. Those folding phones still lacked dust resistance, making them susceptible to durability problems over time. It’s not an issue exclusive to Samsung, either. Motorola’s foldables are the only ones in North America to feature dust resistance, but they aren’t water-resistant beyond IPX2, so there’s a trade-off. </p><p>If the latest leaks are to be believed, Samsung is about to shake things up by revealing foldables that are both dust-resistant and water-resistant. It reportedly comes with an IP48 rating, which will give it some degree of protection from both dust and water ingress.</p>

<p>IP ratings can be understood by looking at the first and second numbers separately. The first number represents a device’s dust-resistance rating, and the second represents its water-resistance rating. Because prior Galaxy Z Fold and Galaxy Z Flip devices had an IPX8 certification, they didn’t have dust resistance at all. For what it’s worth, the ‘8’ is the highest level of water resistance. This means that a device can withstand being submerged in a few meters of water for at least 30 minutes. </p><p>Water resistance is always important on smartphones since they’re with you pretty much all the time. However, on folding phones, dust resistance is arguably the more important IP rating. There are real points of entry for dust and debris due to the hinge mechanism, as well as more moving parts than a traditional smartphone. All it takes is for one piece of dust to get in the hinge or under the display to cause a whole lot of damage. </p><p>The rumored IP48 rating featured on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 means that large bits of dust won’t interfere with the operation of the phones. It’s not completely dustproof — that would be IP6X — but it’s a considerable improvement. Larger objects, like those 1mm or greater, won’t be able to get into Samsung‘s new folding phones. There is still work to do when it comes to dust resistance, but this IP rating might significantly improve the durability of Samsung foldables.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Y8u5hR93eZWidEUtmuNL4J" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-s-pen-fold-edition-options.jpg" alt="S Pen Fold and Slim S Pen for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y8u5hR93eZWidEUtmuNL4J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’m an early adopter of foldables. I’ve used four different folding phones over the years, and three of those I (foolishly) spent my own money on. That’s how I’ve seen firsthand the ways that dust and debris can considerably affect the experience of using a folding phone.</p><p>My first foldable was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3</a>, and this was the generation where Samsung <em>almost</em> made folding phones durable. This model year didn’t have many crippling issues at launch, but the problem with foldables is that their durability issues might not show up until a year or two after they’re purchased. That was the case with my Galaxy Z Flip 3. It was fine for the first year, but the built-in screen protector and folding display started to crack right down the middle after a tiny spec of dust got underneath it. </p><p>I then upgraded to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>, which was a <em>very</em> expensive foldable. Luckily, that smartphone didn’t suffer from the issues that my Z Flip 3 had. It seems to have held up over time, even though it isn’t my daily driver anymore. The same goes for the Motorola Razr+. It had dust protection, and it’s been mostly fine. </p><p>My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold review</a> unit is the next example of how dust can cause problems for foldables. There was so much talk about the Pixel Fold not unfolding completely flat when it first launched. It has turned into something of a debate among users and foldable enthusiasts. The real answer, based on my experience, is that it <em>does</em> unfold completely flat when you first start using it. But all it takes is a few pieces of dust for the Pixel Fold not to unfold flat anymore. About a year after receiving my review unit, the device clearly does not open up fully. </p><p>So, after many years and four folding phones, I’m excited that Samsung is making a foldable that is both dust and water-resistant. These problems I’ve listed aren’t something you have to think about while using a slab phone. That’s why, for foldables to grow, it’s a problem that companies like Samsung have to solve. </p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing&apos;s sub-brand is back with its second generation of earbuds, the CMS Buds Pro 2. The company launched this pair of earbuds next to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-cmf-phone-1-is-a-customizable-budget-phone-starting-at-dollar199">brand new CMF Phone 1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/cmf-watch-pro-2-launch">Watch Pro 2</a>. These all aim to disrupt the entry-level segment in the industry. Nothing is launching these products in the U.S., U.K., India, and the European region.</p><p>The second generation Buds Pro come in an interesting new blue color alongside the orange, dark grey (read black), and light grey, as seen in the first generation. Interestingly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cmf-by-nothing-buds-pro-watch-pro-announced">last year&apos;s regular CMF Buds</a> came with a charging case featuring a Smart Dial, not the Pro variant. This time around, the Buds Pro 2 come with a charging case with a Smart Dial next to accompanying color options and with a pocket-friendly design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="cowhkMxieaYYggmWBy8iB4" name="CMF-Buds-Pro-2-03.jpg" alt="CMF Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cowhkMxieaYYggmWBy8iB4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Users can rotate the Smart Dial for volume control, and additional options with customizable functions are available, such as the ability to switch noise cancellation modes, play and pause, or skip tracks. </p><p>Besides, it triggers VoiceAssistant, answers or cuts calls, mutes the microphone and turns Low Lag Mode on and off. To avoid accidental presses, the user can permanently turn off the Smart Dial. All these settings can be managed through the Nothing X app.</p><p>For internals, the Buds Pro 2 are powered by dual driver system comprising a 11mm bass driver and a 6mm tweeter. The new buds support hybrid active noise cancellation alongside transparency mode and have Hi-Res audio certification and spatial audio effect. Users can further adjust bass performance on the accompanying Nothing X app. </p><p>The Buds Pro 2 also promises crystal-clear calls, as each Bud incorporates three microphones and is aided by Nothing&apos;s Clear Voice Technology 2.0.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="jStPERDoarTFyBjxukQZf3" name="CMF-Buds-Pro-2-01.jpg" alt="CMF Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jStPERDoarTFyBjxukQZf3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Keeping the power on these buds is a 60mAh battery on each bud, and the case includes a 460mAh battery pack. The Buds Pro 2 comes with the following battery promises:</p>
<p><strong>Calls</strong></p><p>Talk time with ANC off: 25 hours with case and 6 hours with buds only</p><p>Talk time with ANC on (including Transparency Mode): 18.6 hours with</p><p>case and 4.8 hours with buds only</p><p><strong>AAC</strong></p><p>Playback with ANC off: up to 43 hours with case and up to 11 hours with buds only</p><p>Playback with ANC on / Transparency Mode: up to 26 hours with case and up to</p><p>6.5 hours with buds only</p><p><strong>LDAC</strong></p><p>Playback with ANC off: up to 25 hours with case and up to 6.5 hours with buds only</p><p>Playback with ANC on / Transparency Mode: up to 16.6 hours with case and up to</p><p>4.3 hours with buds only</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="QUyXQcEJ9UQBKYFE3oDnD5" name="CMF-Buds-Pro-2-02.jpg" alt="CMF Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUyXQcEJ9UQBKYFE3oDnD5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new set of buds also supports fast charging, involving a quick ten-minute charge that can give buds three hours of battery life, up to seven hours with the case included, and this is with ANC turned off. When enabled, they are promised to give 1.8 hours and six hours, respectively. </p><p>The Buds Pro 2, set to challenge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds">entry-level earbuds</a>, will be available later this month from the cmf.tech website and other retail partners. They cost $59, and £59, in the U.S. and the U.K.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing has been a game-changer in the phone industry. We were impressed with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> last year, and now the company has officially launched its latest device, the CMF Phone 1.</p><p>The headline is that the CMF Phone 1 comes with an attractive starting price of $199 for the 8GB/128GB version, which is the sole option in the US. In North America, you can get your hands on the device exclusively through Nothing&apos;s US Beta Program, where participants receive the phone and are invited to share their experiences.</p><p>In India, the CMF Phone 1 is priced at ₹15,999 (about $192) and only comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. In Europe, you can snag the device for €269 / £239, with an upgraded 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p><p>As you might have guessed, the CMF Phone 1 offers impressive specs at a price usually seen in more modest phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7111px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KxvfreeB8LSWhf4udDPdb" name="CMF-Phone-1-NothingOS.jpg" alt="CMF Phone 1 Nothing OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KxvfreeB8LSWhf4udDPdb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7111" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF by Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The handset impresses with a stellar display for its price. The 6.67-inch Super AMOLED screen, 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+ support, and 2000-nit brightness make for smooth, vibrant visuals, perfect for gamers and everyday users alike.</p><p>Under the hood, the CMF Phone 1 draws its power from MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 7300 5G SoC, paired with 16GB of RAM with RAM Booster for smooth multitasking. A 5,000mAh battery keeps it running, and Nothing claims it can last up to two days between charges.</p><p>The CMF Phone 1 sticks to Nothing&apos;s unique, personality-packed design. Unlike many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">high-end Android phones</a>, it focuses on user customization. The back has a detachable clip, letting you add a carabiner for easy carrying or use it as a kickstand for hands-free viewing. This cool feature not only looks good but also makes the phone super practical and personal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7111px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oTbsst5GgkpUX8s9sUTyt4" name="CMF-Phone-1-detachable-rear-panel.jpg" alt="CMF Phone 1 cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oTbsst5GgkpUX8s9sUTyt4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7111" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF by Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It also comes with a stylish case, and the four screws on the back make the rear panel detachable. This likely means you can easily replace the battery or other parts.</p><p>Now for the camera: The CMF Phone 1 packs a 50MP Sony camera with advanced algorithms like Ultra XDR to brighten under-exposed shots. Up front, there&apos;s a 16MP selfie camera.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7111px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ae3WvgP765FdmE5g68EDi3" name="CMF-Phone-1-camera-official.jpg" alt="CMF Phone 1 camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ae3WvgP765FdmE5g68EDi3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7111" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF by Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The specs show that the CMF Phone 1 isn&apos;t a premium flagship, but it does offer perks you won’t find in other mid-range phones at this price, especially its customizable design.</p><p>The CMF Phone 1 breaks the mold with its customizable attachments and user-removable back panel—features you rarely see nowadays. While this modular approach might not be for everyone, Nothing is tapping into a niche market of users who crave more control and personalization.</p>

<ul><li>CMF by Nothing launches its next-gen Watch Pro 2, which features a circular alloy design and a 1.32-inch AMOLED display with swappable bezels.</li><li>The device's sports mode offers 120 modes, five of which it can automatically recognize for outdoor and indoor exercises.</li><li>Consumers can also make and receive calls from the Watch Pro 2 as it features AI-enhanced noise reduction, a microphone, and a built-in speaker.</li><li>The CMF Watch Pro 2 is available for $69.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>In a flurry of new CMF by Nothing products, one device to watch (no pun intended) is the latest Watch Pro 2.</p><p>The sequel to CMF by Nothing&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cmf-by-nothing-buds-pro-watch-pro-announced">original Watch Pro</a> offers a circular face difference instead of an Apple-reminiscent rectangle. As detailed in its press notes, CMF states consumers will experience a sleek, aluminum alloy case encasing the Watch Pro 2&apos;s new shape. Greeting users is a smaller 1.32-inch AMOLED always-on display with a 466x466 resolution compared to the Watch Pro.</p><p>The company adds users can pick from over 100 watch faces, including static options to compliment its always-on function. Additionally, there is a selection of "dynamic videos" and "interactive designs" for the watch face. Swiping right from the device&apos;s home display opens up the Watch Pro 2&apos;s array of widgets. These customizable additions involve your health and fitness data, the weather, schedule management, music controls, and more.</p><p>Users can hop into the CMF Watch app to customize their widgets.</p><p>Another headliner for the Watch Pro 2 is CMF&apos;s addition of interchangeable bezels. Consumers will have the choice of a few alloy rings that they can pop on or off to alter the look of their device. The interchangeable bezels are offered in curved and flat versions.</p><p>What&apos;s more, pushing the Watch Pro 2&apos;s crown in and rotating it lets users scroll up and down the app list. There are a few gesture controls, as well, such as rotating your wrist to answer calls, skip songs, or check the weather.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="MgafD7LmxTzseFppv57J5o" name="cmf-watch-pro-2-swappable-bezels.jpg" alt="The CMF Watch Pro 2 and a swappable bezel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MgafD7LmxTzseFppv57J5o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF by Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Feature-wise, the Watch Pro 2 offers more than 120 sports modes and it can recognize five sports without manual input. Automatic recognition arrives for outdoor running, indoor running, outdoor walking, indoor walking, and outdoor cycling. CMF adds that the device offers 24/7 heart rate, SpO2, and stress level monitoring.</p><p>Fitness data captured on the Watch Pro 2 can be uploaded to Apple Health, Google Health Connect, and Strava, alongside the watch&apos;s app.</p><p>The Watch Pro 2 includes a "Smart Sleep Algorithm." CMF states this has been upgraded over last year&apos;s, offering data on your sleep, daytime naps, and various sleep stages. Menstrual cycle tracking finds a place on the watch, delivering "smart prompts" and predictions to help users prepare.</p><p>With Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity, CMF states the Watch Pro 2 can receive and make "crystal clear" calls. This is reportedly thanks to the device&apos;s onboard AI noise reduction technology. Users can add up to 30 contacts on the Watch Pro 2 and take advantage of its microphone and speaker to call directly from the device.</p>

<p>Powering the Watch Pro 2&apos;s goodies is a 305mAh battery, which CMF estimates will give users 11 days of use with always-on disabled. If users choose to activate the AOD, the device may last for a shorter 9-day period. The latest Watch Pro 2 is said to charge in 100 minutes through its provided cable.</p><p>The post adds that the device&apos;s aluminum alloy frame is IP68 water-resistant and supports Android 8 (and higher) alongside iOS 13 (and higher).</p><p>Consumers can grab the CMF Watch Pro 2 from cmf.tech or from its partnered retailers.  The device will be available for $69 in the U.S. However, if its additional bezel and watch strap set, that will tack on an additional $19.</p>

A smart ring focuses on health data, sleep tracking, and some workouts, while a smartwatch gives you a display and apps on top of all that. </p><p>Underneath the surface, there are more smart ring vs. smartwatch differences that you won&apos;t find advertised by wearable brands. You&apos;ll notice differences in heart rate accuracy, step accuracy, and other metrics between the two categories the longer you use them. So, it&apos;s better to know these differences upfront. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> is all but guaranteed to arrive at Galaxy Unpacked on July 10, but it&apos;s just the latest in a series of smart rings. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring</a>, in particular, has become quite popular, but the smart ring category is still niche as people figure out whether they need a smartwatch <em>and</em> a smart ring. So, let&apos;s help <strong>you</strong> decide.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RUfrZmsbaB2RyHP6etwFL5" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-on-finger-on-top-of-pillow.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air on the author's index finger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RUfrZmsbaB2RyHP6etwFL5.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although it varies by manufacturer, most smart rings track heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), blood oxygenation (SpO2), skin temperature, breathing, and sleep. Specific to heart rate, many smart rings focus on your resting heart rate or stress levels. And for sleep tracking, they&apos;ll measure your restlessness, time spent in sleep zones like REM, and overall energy recharge.</p><p>Most cheap fitness trackers will measure heart rate, sleep, and SpO2. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> measures stress, breathing rate, and temperature, but that&apos;s fairly rare. Otherwise, you&apos;re still getting the same sleep insights (depending on the brand).</p><p>Upgrade to a smartwatch, and you typically get an ECG to measure for atrial fibrillation (AFib); a few brands like Samsung, Google, Apple, and Fitbit passively measure for AFib as well, something we haven&apos;t seen in any smart rings yet. We hope that changes in the future, but given that most watch ECGs measure through your wrist <em>and</em> finger, they would probably remain more accurate.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch</a> specifically has a body composition sensor to determine body fat and muscle, plus a blood pressure sensor that unfortunately couldn&apos;t pass FDA approval for U.S. use. We&apos;ve seen a few smart ring Kickstarters in 2024 promising features like body composition and blood pressure, but we&apos;ll wait to see if any of these unproven brands can deliver on these promises accurately.</p>

<p>Your typical smartwatch with apps and proper phone integration lasts anywhere from 18 hours (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a>) to 100 hours (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>). A (dumber) fitness watch or tracker with a more efficient CPU typically lasts 6–10 days, while brands like Garmin make bulkier watches that last two weeks or more per charge.</p><p>For smart rings, battery life varies from brand to brand, and sometimes, smaller ring sizes correspond with shorter battery life. Here are the battery life averages for a few popular smart rings:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Oura Ring Gen 3: </strong>Up to 7 days</li><li><strong>Amazfit Helio Ring: </strong>Up to 4 days</li><li><strong>Ultrahuman Ring Air:</strong> 4–6 days</li><li><strong>Circular Ring: </strong>Up to 5 days</li><li><strong>RingConn: </strong>Up to 7 days</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Ring: </strong>Up to 9 days (unconfirmed)</li></ul>
<p>Most smart rings last about as long as a budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness tracker</a>. They use small components with minute power demands, but they also only fit batteries with limited capacity. The Galaxy Ring, for example, reportedly has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-fcc-listing-cradle-specs-confirmed">17.5–22.5mAh capacity</a>, depending on the size, while a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> battery is 300–425mAh.</p><p>In theory, larger ring sizes (10+) may correspond with extra room for battery capacity, depending on the brand. The inverse is that people with smaller fingers may have to charge their rings more often.</p><p>Plus, we&apos;ve confirmed that smart rings generally take measurements less frequently than watches due to their limited capacity. This is less of a concern during sleep tracking but more of an issue during workouts where heart rate changes rapidly.</p><p>Ultrahuman estimates that its ring will maintain its battery life for "500 charging cycles" or about 1–2 years before experiencing "degradation." We assume that most smart rings will be similar, with slightly less than a week of charging out of the box and dipping downwards over time. But a one—or two-day smartwatch will have less leeway than a smart ring.</p>

<p>Is a smartwatch or smart ring more accurate for heart rate data? We spoke to a product manager for the Amazfit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-lands-in-us">Helio Ring</a>, who suggested that "the finger is the better location for PPG measuring because there&apos;s a denser network of blood vessels close to the skin surface, versus the wrist." </p><p>They also mentioned that "fingers are less mobile than the wrist," which could make it easier to keep your health readings consistent, but that it mostly depends on how well-fitted your smart ring or smartwatch is to your finger size or wrist, respectively. </p><p>On the other hand, your finger size can swell during workouts due to increased blood flow; that, in turn, can affect the accuracy of higher heart readings. And since a smart ring can&apos;t fit a GPS antenna, you&apos;re dependent on your phone; a smartwatch with dual-band GPS is more reliable.</p><p>A couple of rings, like the Oura Ring, have automatic workout/activity detection, registering whether you&apos;re running, biking, or completing other activities. Unfortunately, we&apos;ve noticed that smart rings have much more trouble tracking steps than smartwatches do. </p><p>In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">smartwatch step-counting tests</a>, they&apos;ll usually be off by about 50–200 steps after walking 5,000 steps, with a few false steps around the house. But a smart ring can over-count <em>thousands</em> of steps at home when your hands move while you sit or type; then, when you walk, they can sometimes underreport your steps.</p><p>This is why some people may want to wear a smart ring and smartwatch simultaneously. Amazfit says it will "de-dupe" your watch and ring data and then "choose the best data per our algorithms." So, if you have both, maybe your ring would provide the heart and sleep data, while your smartwatch would provide the step and workout data.</p>

<p>We can keep things short here: Smart rings don&apos;t have many traditional "smarts" outside of health, sleep, and fitness tracking. </p><p>You can&apos;t make phone calls or ask Google Assistant/Siri a question because they can&apos;t fit a mic or speaker. You can&apos;t check your notifications because a display on a smart ring would be barely readable (and look tacky as hell). </p><p>One smart ring brand (Circular) has a haptic motor that can buzz your finger as an alarm or to signal a notification; it&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-will-stay-niche-until-missing-features-added">missing smart ring features</a> that we hope becomes more popular.

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-smart-ring-vs-smartwatch-comfort-and-style"><span>Smart ring vs. smartwatch: Comfort and style</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xqh9iSYteNyEm9Sqy79ZYN" name="RingConn-Smart-Ring-review-23.jpg" alt="The RingConn Smart Ring on a hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xqh9iSYteNyEm9Sqy79ZYN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This point is fairly obvious but worth spelling out nonetheless: A smart ring weighs between 2–4 grams depending on the brand. A fitness tracker weighs about 20–30 grams, and the lightest models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-inspire-3-review">Fitbit Inspire 3</a> have tiny displays that are barely readable. Meanwhile, a smartwatch typically weighs about 40–80 grams, varying based on strap weight, materials, thickness, and display size.</p><p>Some people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">hate sleeping with a smartwatch</a> because of the distracting weight or feeling of it pressing into your wrist against your pillow. It can also be tricky finding the right fit, so it&apos;s not too loose for accurate readings or too tight to ignore. If any of that applies to you, a smart ring solves these problems because it&apos;s easy to forget at night and won&apos;t lose the seal around your finger if it&apos;s fitted properly.</p><p>That said, smart rings can be tricky for some,, depending on the fit, because your fingers can swell, and they can be uncomfortable or hard to take off.</p>

<p>In terms of style, smart rings are an acquired taste. Unlike your typical skinny, curved ring band, a smart ring band needs to be thick enough to fit all those sensors and wide enough to have enough contact with your skin for a proper reading. Most smart rings are made of lightweight, sturdy titanium and can come in black, gold, and/or silver.</p><p>Smartwatch designs vary too widely to paint with broad strokes. Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> take a "classic" circular watch design, but you still wouldn&apos;t mistake a smartwatch for a luxury watch unless you bought a simpler hybrid watch. Styles with stainless steel or titanium look classier but can be too heavy for some wrists.</p><p>We&apos;ve heard that some people find smart rings too thick to be attractive, whereas they can find a stylish smartwatch with a decent number of features. Other people prefer the subtlety of a smart ring so they can wear a non-smart watch that makes more of a fashion statement.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3589px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="wGoKZDegpdeQkpNxAwUnFi" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-smartphone-app.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring (Gen 3) and the companion app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGoKZDegpdeQkpNxAwUnFi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3589" height="2019" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart rings are still in their early days, but they all tend to fall into a similar price range of $250–$400. Cheaper rings will lack basic features or reliability. That means they cost about the same as a flagship smartwatch, especially if you splurge for a fancier gold finish.</p><p>Most smart ring brands promise to provide their ring data subscription fee to compensate for the high entry price. The exception is Oura, which charges $5.99/month for most data and insights. That makes Oura slightly more affordable than Fitbit Premium, but it is still costly in the long run.</p><p>Smart rings can&apos;t replace most core smartwatch features. But if you don&apos;t <em>care</em> about notifications and just want health and sleep tracking that&apos;s more comfortable, then a smart ring is the way to go. Otherwise, we&apos;ll see if interconnected rings like the Samsung Galaxy Ring or Amazfit Helio Ring work well enough in tandem for fans of these brands to decide to buy both!</p>

They hinted that the device is lighter (239 grams) and said to have sharper corners, unlike the Galaxy Z Fold 5. The company could be using an "improved Aluminum frame" and will have a bigger 6.3-inch cover screen and the same 7.6-inch foldable screen. For the first time, the phone is said to come with IP48 dust and water resistance. The leak shows that the device will have a triple rear camera setup. Its primary lens will be 50MP, the ultrawide-angle camera will be 12MP, and the telephoto camera will be 10MP with optical zoom. The cover screen is said to have a 10MP selfie camera, and the foldable screen will have a 4MP under-display camera. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>&apos;s marketing images also ended up online in a blue colorway alongside its prominent specs. Design-wise, it looks a lot like its predecessor. According to recently leaked images, the phone&apos;s design includes a 3.4-inch cover screen and a 6.7-inch foldable screen. It could be powered by a larger 4000mAh battery capacity. </p><p>We expect the phone to have a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 camera, a 50MP primary lens, a 12MP secondary camera, and a 10MP selfie lens. Galaxy Z Flip 6 is also rumored to have an IP48 rating, and for the first time, a vapor chamber is expected to debut on this clamshell. </p><p><strong>Galaxy Buds Pro 3:</strong></p><p>If you thought it was just the foldables, another Reddit user who claimed to have bought the new Buds 3 Pro posted images of them on the platform. They sport the new stem design and showcase a Metallic grey finish and a charging case with a similar finish and translucent design at the top. They also sport blue and orange indicators for the left and right earbuds. Regarding performance, the Reddit user who bought the Buds 3 Pro, "Noise cancellation is on par with my AirPods Pro 1st gen. The sound is great, but a little higher on the bass, but I personally love the base. My Z Flip4 and iPhone pick them up, too. It&apos;s crazy how I was able to buy them."</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-cuts-cheapest-ad-free-plan-for-some"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>It looks like Netflix is dropping its least expensive ad-free plan and pushing users to pay more than usual to access the platform without ads. According to several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1dsse4n/cant_finish_netflix_subscription/" target="_blank">Reddit posts</a>, Netflix&apos;s $11.99 ad-free plan will be discontinued for customers on July 13. They must choose between a $6.99 plan that streams ads versus a $15.49 ad-free plan or the $22.99 ad-free 4K. </p><p>The user&apos;s streaming is interrupted by a page that states their "basic plan has been discontinued" and that "you can change your plan at any time." Based on the Reddit complaints, it seems the streaming giant may first be testing out the updated offerings in the UK or Canada before expanding to other regions (including the U.S.).</p><p>This move doesn&apos;t come out of the blue, though.  Earlier this year, during its Q4 earnings call, Netflix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-teases-price-hike-2024-plan">publicly announced </a>that it had begun an effort to push customers to either more expensive or ad-supported plans.  "Scaling our ads business represents an opportunity to tap into significant new revenue and profit pools over the medium to longer term," Netflix said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/NEW-FINAL-Q4-23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf" target="_blank">statement</a>. </p>

The update is available for both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch 1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, and it comes with software version <strong>TWD9.240705.001.A1</strong>.</p><p>Just a day after rolling out the above for its watches, Google dropped its monthly software update for Pixel phones powered by Android 14. The company notes in the blog post that Pixel phones ranging from Pixel 5a (5G) to Pixel 8a, along with the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet, will receive carrier bug fixes and improvements. Additionally, some devices can see general improvements to the camera stability "under certain conditions." The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> are said to get system stability and performance improvements along with an interface bug fix which addresses the back gesture navigation issue that wasn&apos;t working in certain scenarios. </p>

However, the Financial Times reports that YouTube is in talks with other record labels, such as Universal Music Group (UMG), Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Records, about a potential deal that would involve YouTube paying “lump sums of cash” for the right to use the labels’ songs for AI music training. YouTube told the Financial Times in a statement that it was “in conversations with labels about other experiments.” </p><p>And here&apos;s why it&apos;s a bad idea. According to our staff writer Brady Snyder, the record labels should back out since "it&apos;s impossible to put a price tag on creativity."</p><p>Synder adds, "Music generation tools can perform a few tricks, and they’re a great way for people who aren’t musically inclined to dabble with song creation. However, the current crop of tools has nothing to do with professional musicians."</p><p>"Most that are available today either rely on the likeness of popular singers or create something that pales in comparison to that which could be made by a human."</p>

Rumors have been swirling about the devices we&apos;ll likely see, and there will likely be quite a few launches during Unpacked, from yearly upgrades to an entirely new product from Samsung. This may be the most interesting Unpacked launch we&apos;ve seen in years.</p><p>The Unpacked event in January gave us a ring-sized surprise right before it ended and set folks off on a wild goose chase to figure out when the Galaxy Ring would release. After that, Samsung was bold enough to show off the ring at the MWC in Barcelona; however, in terms of specs, we didn&apos;t get a lot. This mid-year event will definitely launch the Galaxy Ring, among other rumored wearables like the Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch Ultra. </p><p>And that&apos;s not all; with the summer Unpacked event usually comes the company&apos;s own line-up of foldables, and this year, we&apos;re hoping to see the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy Z Flip 6. On the accessories side, there have been rumors that Samsung would launch the Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. </p><p>Let&apos;s dive into the leaks and rumors that cropped up about these devices. Here&apos;s a breakdown of what we expect to see and how you can tune into Samsung&apos;s Summer Unpacked. </p>

<p>The launch is set to take place on July 10 at 9 a.m. ET in Paris, France. While the guest list for the Summer Unpacked stays exclusive for the in-person event in Paris, Samsung will also have a livestream of the launch on its official website and YouTube platforms. The company has done this in the past, so it&apos;s really no surprise.</p><p>Samsung has already posted the video invite on the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung" target="_blank">official YouTube channel</a>, although we&apos;re still waiting for a live stream link, which should appear any day now. When it does go up, we&apos;ll be sure to link it here so you can set a reminder or hit on the "notify me" button to give yourself a heads-up before the live stream begins. Meanwhile, anyone interested can also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ca/unpacked/">sign up </a>for updates on the latest devices.</p><p>So what can we expect from this mid-year Unpacked event, and will Samsung&apos;s new offerings be just as exciting as the hype they’ve created around their wearables this year? </p>
<h2 id="the-samsung-galaxy-ring-2">The Samsung Galaxy Ring</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VZV5nxvJyY5oJdrhnP6gML" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-MWC-silver-03.jpg" alt="Eyes on with the Samsung Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VZV5nxvJyY5oJdrhnP6gML.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung will likely fully launch its first smart ring at Unpacked. The company revealed at the MWC that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> will come in black, gold, or silver and could weigh between 2.3g to 3g, depending on your ring size. Leaked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-model-number-sizes-leak">Galaxy Ring ID numbers</a> suggest that it&apos;ll be available in sizes 5–13. </p><p>According to early patents of the device, the Galaxy Ring comes with an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure monitoring. While others show hints that the Galaxy Ring can be used as a controller for other devices, like the smartphone, tablet, or laptop. </p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-lawsuits-samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung&apos;s lawsuit against Oura</a> gave us a good look at some of the ring&apos;s core competencies. The company said that the ring will monitor heart rate, heart rate variability, blood oxygen, movement, and sleep "to provide users valuable insights and offer guidance to improve their health and wellbeing." Documents also note its intention to later include an "Energy score" in the app "based on multiple factors including sleep, activity, heart rate, and heart rate variability."</p><p>Samsung has also revealed that the device should come with up to nine days of battery life. </p><p>One of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-health-tracking-features-leak">most recent leaks</a> comes from an APK teardown that showed features like stress tracking, skin temperature measurement for period detection, and snore detection that were displayed on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-samsung-health-your-galaxy-phone">Samsung Health</a>, presumably after the ring was connected to the phone.</p>

<p>And how will this multifaceted device be charged you ask? A tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/Oji4m2Qqm?pagetype=viewer">Ice Universe</a> posted a supposed rendering of the Ring&apos;s charging case on Weibo and at first glance it looks a lot like a earbuds charging case. However once opened, the case comes with a "cradle" to hold your ring inside it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bd4wth9QeCZTGQzPmNnqtQ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bd4wth9QeCZTGQzPmNnqtQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @OnLeaks / Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We&apos;ve recently been bombarded with leaks of the expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6#section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-wishlist">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6,</a> which gives us a fair picture (pun intended) of what those foldables would look like. There might not be many changes to this year&apos;s edition, but some upgrades are worth checking out. It is obvious that these new foldables will be bolstered with all things <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>. But first, let&apos;s get into the specs.</p><p><strong>Galaxy Z Fold 6:</strong></p><p>A set of marketing images <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-galaxy-z-flip-6-full-specs-leak">leaked</a> on Thursday (July 4), giving us a glimpse of the Galaxy Z Fold 6. They confirmed the device is lighter (239 grams) and said to have sharper corners, which is a bit of a departure from the Galaxy Z Fold 5. The company could be using an "improved Aluminum frame" and will have a bigger 6.3-inch cover screen and the same 7.6-inch foldable screen. For the first time, the phone is said to come with IP48 dust and water resistance.</p><p>Looks like the device will have a triple rear camera setup. Its primary lens will be 50MP, the ultrawide-angle camera will be 12MP, and the telephoto camera will be 10MP with optical zoom. The cover screen is said to have a 10MP selfie camera, and the foldable screen will have a 4MP under-display camera. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 will likely be powered by Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-snapdragon-8-gen-3-for-galaxy">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy</a>. Several other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-s-flip-6-colorways-leak-again">leaks</a> have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6-storage-color-options-leak">spoiled</a> the color options, which are said to be navy, pink, silver shadow, and white.</p><p>However, we have little to no information about the device&apos;s charging speeds; we assume it could come with the same 25W wired charger and 4400mAh battery. We&apos;re also hoping to see some S-pen enhancements and reduced visibility of the crease in the new version.</p><p><strong>Galaxy Z Flip 6: </strong></p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>&apos;s marketing material also reveals the clamshell phone in a blue colorway alongside its prominent specs. Design-wise, it looks a lot like its predecessor. According to recently leaked images, the phone&apos;s design includes a 3.4-inch cover screen and a 6.7-inch foldable screen. It could be powered by a larger 4000mAh battery capacity. </p><p>We expect the phone to have a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> series, and in terms of camera, an upgraded 50MP primary lens, 12MP secondary camera, and 10MP selfie lens. Galaxy Z Flip 6 is also rumored to have an IP48 rating, and for the first time, a vapor chamber is expected to debut on this clamshell. </p><p>With this year&apos;s flip, we hope to see better battery life and displays with higher refresh rates, such as 144Hz or even 165Hz. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WHLsALvxiberxzotozTBg" name="galaxy-watch-7-ultra-render.jpg" alt="Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WHLsALvxiberxzotozTBg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SmartPrix/ OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung is expected to unveil the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">According to several leaks,</a> the Galaxy Watch 7 will likely come in two sizes: 40mm (1.3 inches) and 44mm (1.5 inches), like the previous model. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-watch-7-spec-sheet-leak">Galaxy Watch 7 specs leak</a> states that the Watch 7 will have 1.3- and 1.5-inch display options, while the Watch Ultra will have a single 1.5-inch display with 480x480 resolution. Regarding the performance of  Galaxy Watch 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1748139565133496357" target="_blank">Tipster Roland Quandt</a> said that the watch could be powered by  an internal name of "Exynos 5535," although more recently, the Dealabs leak indicated both the Ultra and Watch 7 would have an "Exynos W1000 chipset with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage."  The Galaxy Watch 7 will launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/first-one-ui-6-watch-beta-hits-us-galaxy-watches">One UI Watch 6</a>.</p><p>Like previous generations, the Watch 7 could sport a BioActive sensor for heart rate, ECG, blood oxygen, temperature, and body composition readings. One feature that we are excited to explore is Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">sleep apnea detection</a>, which could likely show up on the new watch. </p>

<p>When it comes to the Watch Ultra, we&apos;ve come across <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">one major leak</a> from Steve Hemmerstoffer, aka OnLeaks. It shows the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra from all sides, sporting a new design—with rounded-off square corners and a circular display etched into the square chassis. This version could have a display measuring 1.5 inches in diameter and an additional third button on the side, along with the two buttons we saw in previous Samsung smartwatches.</p><p>The leaked images show a circular array of health sensors, including a temperature sensor at the rear and two buttons next to the sensor array, which could help detach the watch bands. One thing that popped up in the images is a new large speaker grill placed at the left pane of the smartwatch— giving major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a> vibes.</p>
<h2 id="xa0-galaxy-buds-3-and-pro-2"> Galaxy Buds 3 and Pro</h2>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1dvg597/galaxy_buds3_pro">Galaxy Buds3 Pro</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds">r/galaxybuds</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Samsung is set to drop the new-gen earbuds—Buds 3 and 3 Pro—at this year&apos;s summer Unpacked. We speculate that they will look a lot like Apple&apos;s AirPods, rocking a long stem, unlike the rounded design in previous generations, with a wingtip for stabilization. Other leaks reveal that the Buds 3 might lack the silicone tip to help it sit comfortably inside an ear. The long stem could help with better call quality with the positioning of the microphone, and new long-pressing gestures are expected to control the music playback, activate noise cancellation, and much more.</p><p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro also sport the new stem design, which is now evident in the real-life images shared by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1dvg597/galaxy_buds3_pro/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a> who purchased them. They showcase the buds in a Metallic grey finish and a charging case with a similar finish and translucent design at the top. The Buds 3 Pro seen in the images look identical to each other and have the usual silicone tip for in-ear use. They also sport blue and orange indicators for the left and right earbuds. </p><p>Not much has been revealed about the sound quality and battery life of these new earbuds. However, according to the Reddit user who bought the Buds 3 Pro, "Noise cancellation is on par with my AirPods Pro 1st gen. The sound is great, but a little higher on the bass, but I personally love the base. My Z Flip4 and iPhone pick them up, too. It&apos;s crazy how I was able to buy them."</p>

<p>With Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked coming up, you already have a chance to save on upcoming devices. When you reserve your preorder, Samsung will give you a $50 credit plus up to $1500 off when you trade in an eligible device.</p>
<p>The best part is that it will cost you nothing to reserve ahead of the launch, and you're not locked in to preorder any devices if you decide you don't want to.

<p>We know the headline is a bit odd, but we thought we should bring your attention to one device that could&apos;ve been released with the usual Samsung foldables this year—<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung XR Headset</a>—currently a nameless product but has been called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses-trademark-approval-spotted">Samsung Glasses</a>. The company was allegedly planning something a bit different for its debut; however, a few setbacks delayed its release.  </p><p>All we know is that Samsung glasses are still in the early development stages and are looking for stable software like Google to power them. According to a Business Insider report on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ar-glasses-problems-behind-scenes">Google&apos;s current XR plans</a>, Google has access to Samsung&apos;s headset in order to develop software for it; it allegedly calls the headset "Project Moohan."</p><p>Another thing to note is that Samsung wants to make its XR device more affordable— <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsungs-apple-vision-pro-competitor-price-rumor">to be one-third the price</a> of the Vision Pro might cost around $1,000. While it may be long before we can get our hands on the company&apos;s XR headset, we hope that Samsung will use a robust XR chip like the Snapdragon X Elite that could go up against Apple Vision Pro. It needs to have a strong battery life that could last longer than 2 hours, and hopefully, it should have motion controllers to go with the headset for an optimal gaming experience.</p>

<hr>
<p>Xiaomi&apos;s Mix Fold 4 is reportedly on the way, and a well-known tipster suggests this new foldable will be hitting global markets, unlike its predecessors.</p><p>Xiaomi&apos;s previous foldable smartphones have been limited to the Chinese market, but that might be changing soon. According to reliable leaker Ice Universe, we could see a global launch for the upcoming Mix Fold 4. There&apos;s also buzz that it might debut alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-teaser-suggests-it-could-shake-things-up-for-foldables">Honor Magic V3</a>, with a potential release date of July 12.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Honor Magic V3 will be released on July 12th. Then, Xiaomi MIX Fold4 will also be released, which is also the narrowest foldable phone in the world, only 9.x mm.It is worth looking forward to that MIX Fold4 will be released in the global market! You have a chance to buy it!<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1808375515608502606">July 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Even if the Mix Fold 3 and the models that came before it were only available in China, it proved to be a strong contender against foldable phones from Samsung, Google, and Motorola. With a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor and up to 1TB of storage, among other premium features, the Mix Fold 3 showed that Xiaomi could compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> worldwide.</p><p>The Mix Fold 4 is expected to be a powerhouse as well, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-mix-fold-4-specs-leak">earlier leaks claiming it will include 16GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor</a>.</p><p>Details about the Mix Fold 4&apos;s design have also leaked. The leaker claims that it will feature an incredibly thin profile, possibly making it the slimmest foldable phone on the market.</p><p>Currently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Honor Magic V2</a> leads the pack with a 9.9mm profile. But rumors hint that the upcoming Magic V3 could be even thinner, possibly dipping below 9mm, according to Ice Universe. However, it&apos;s worth noting that Honor&apos;s foldables have traditionally been exclusive to China.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> is quite chunky at 13.4mm. In comparison, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1775426146185957436" target="_blank">leak</a> from earlier this year suggested that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> would slim down to 12.1mm when folded. However, when unfolded, it might be just 5.6mm thick.</p><p>When it comes to foldable phones, everyone has their own preference, but if you love a sleek design, the Mix Fold 4 might catch your eye. With rumors of it being the thinnest yet, it’s shaping up to be a frontrunner in the ultra-slim foldable market.</p><p>The Mix Fold 4’s supposed ultra-thin design is pretty fascinating. Balancing a sleek look with solid build quality and a great user experience will really show off Xiaomi&apos;s tech skills. The next few months will be exciting to see if Xiaomi can make this foldable a real game-changer in the market.</p>
