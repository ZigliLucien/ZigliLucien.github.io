<hr>
<p>New messaging standards are the talk of the town, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-should-be-ashamed-rcs-ios">from RCS to iMessage</a>. However, you may know that critical infrastructure still relies on SMS messaging, which is decades old and has many security issues. In fact, SMS and MMS text messages are often used as a fallback when better options, like iMessage or RCS, are unavailable. It’s this reliance on aging and insecure messaging infrastructure that allows bad actors to use it to their advantage, committing text message fraud.</p><p>It’s tough to keep up with all the evolving scams and tricks, and Google published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/" target="_blank">security blog post</a> explaining the latest Android text message scam, which exploits 2G networks. It’s called SMS Blaster Fraud, and it tricks your device into what it thinks is a secure cell tower. Instead, you’re actually connecting to a stranger’s device, which will then be used for a smishing attack (SMS phishing). You could think you’re giving information to a trusted source, but actually end up handing it right over to the bad guys. </p><p>Your cell phone is constantly searching for cell towers to ensure it has a constant and fast network connection. However, it could end up connecting to what is known as a cell-site simulator, False Base Station (FBS) or Stingray. Essentially, these are small radio transmitters that mimic a real cell site. Your phone may connect to them unknowingly, perceiving a cell-site simulator as a true and authentic cell tower. According to Google, cellular carriers have reported more frequent instances of SMS Blaster Fraud in recent years.</p><p>The scam is simple. A false base station is small enough to fit into a backpack, so it’s portable. An attacker could go to a high-density area, where there are sure to be many cell phones around. Then, it creates a false <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/5g">5G</a> or LTE network that is actually a trap for cell phones. When a device connects to the false base station, the connection is really downgraded to a 2G connection, which is woefully insecure. The whole point of this attack is merely to get your phone to ditch its secure 4G LTE or 5G connection for a weak 2G one. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RKyH4NqwfGtrAmkYuQ8knR" name="galaxy-s10-5g-test-wide.jpg" alt="5G test on Verizon mmWave" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RKyH4NqwfGtrAmkYuQ8knR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>2G connections lack mutual authentication and encryption, so someone in the middle of your phone and a fake cell site simulator can “blast” SMS phishing attempts with ease. Additionally, the scammer can alter every field of a message sent using a cell site simulator, making it look authentic. This means that unknowing users — and even those with excellent digital literacy — can fall victim to SMS Blaster Fraud.</p><p>In case that wasn’t enough, there’s another aspect of SMS Blaster Fraud that makes it particularly dangerous. Because your phone is connecting directly to a fake cell tower, there are no protections in place to stop SMS phishing attempts from reaching your device. Typically, carriers have protections and filters in place to root out spam and scams. However, by using SMS Blaster Fraud, fraudsters can take things out of carriers’ hands. </p><p>To make matters worse, the technology needed to exploit these security vulnerabilities is cheap, easily accessible, and requires little to no expertise. As such, they are appealing to scammers, and they will likely become more prevalent over time.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6PL6eiQWXSeeQu94W7ZLx3" name="Google-smishing-graphic.jpg" alt="A graphic from Google showing a smishing situation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6PL6eiQWXSeeQu94W7ZLx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2160" height="1215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Being that SMS Blaster Fraud is quite dangerous and could become more common, Google is sharing a few tips to help protect yourself. There have been protections against the attack vector <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12-2g-modem-kill-switch-feature">included in Android since Android 12</a>, the company says. You can turn off 2G at the modem level to block this kind of attack. Moreover, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> added an option to disable null ciphers as a key protection method since SMS blasting requires them to deliver payloads.</p><p>However, a deterrent to disabling 2G altogether is that it could impact your ability to contact emergency services, which still depend on the technology. With that being said, Google notes that emergency calls will always work with 2G, even if the option is disabled. The company also points to its built-in Android spam protection features, which can help you figure out if an SMS is fraudulent before you fall victim to the trap.</p><p>So, is it worth disabling 2G to prevent SMS Blaster Fraud? It might be, but a better option may be to become more aware that SMS messages have a high chance of being scams. If you are being asked to share personal information, one-time passwords, or other types of highly sensitive information, it’s probably not authentic. Keeping a keen eye for fraud and scams and being more vigilant could be more helpful in the long run than disabling 2G and forgetting about it.</p>

<hr>
<p>Leaks continue to surface about the Pixel Watch 3 and the latest one says consumers shouldn&apos;t expect performance upgrades.</p><p>According to information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-watch-3-processor">Android Headlines</a>, Google will reportedly keep the same performance power as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> in its successor. The rumor claims that the next watch will utilize Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 chipset from 2022. While that chip was a notable boost in terms of processing power, it provided a welcome jump over the original Pixel Watch.</p><p>The leak adds that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> may also use the same Cortex M33 co-processor that its soon-to-be predecessor uses. Additionally, RAM/internal storage specs are rumored to remain at a 2GB/32GB configuration.</p><p>With rumors looking bleak, the publication suggests that the Pixel Watch 3 and the supposed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-xl-renders">Watch 3 XL</a>" will receive a 60Hz display boost.</p>

<p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">our review of the Pixel Watch 2</a>, we noted how much snappier the device felt compared to the original model. This was due to Google&apos;s decision to upgrade the device to the Snapdragon W5 chipset alongside the Cortex co-processor. However, the Watch 2 still suffered from the (almost laggy) 30Hz display.</p><p>Some Pixel Watch 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-imagery-google-fitbits-features-leak">imagery leaked late in July</a>, revealing the device&apos;s supposed 2,000 nits of peak brightness. It also leaked Google and Fitbit&apos;s newest feature for the device called "Morning Brief." Materials showed the feature would deliver a user&apos;s daily readiness score and other metrics to help them plan their day.</p><p>The watch&apos;s battery is an object of discussion with a database listing suggesting it could see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-battery-certification-spotted">a minimal upgrade</a>. It seems the Watch 3 is preparing to debut with a 307mAh battery, which is barely an increase over the Watch 2&apos;s 306mAh. However, Google is seemingly putting software into the Pixel Watch 3 to extend its battery to 36 hours with the "Battery Saver" mode.</p><p>Regardless of the rumors, we&apos;re only a week away from Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">August 13 hardware event</a>. There was also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-leaks-again-in-promo-video">a promotional video</a> for the Pixel Watch 3 that leaked just yesterday (August 6).</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;ve been in the dark about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>&apos;s U.S. prices, but that&apos;s finally changed as we&apos;ve got fresh numbers for the Pro and Pro XL models, just days before the big launch.</p><p>A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://new.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1emdw04/tmobile_pixel_9_pro_prices/" target="_blank">Reddit leak</a>, picked up by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-9-series-us-pricing-leak/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>, hints that the Pixel 9 Pro could start at $1,000 with a T-Mobile plan. Since the leak came from T-Mobile, it&apos;s likely we&apos;ll see different prices depending on the carrier.</p><p>Two Pixel 9 Pro models are listed at that price point. Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is priced at $1,200 for both the 256GB and 512GB storage options.</p><p>Interestingly, Google is rumored to offer a storage upgrade and a free year of Gemini Advanced with Pixel 9 Pro preorders in Europe. The leaked U.S. prices hint that American buyers might get a similar preorder bonus.</p>

<p>Though the base Pixel 9 Pro is priced at $999, matching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is actually the true successor to the Pixel 8 Pro. This could mean a price bump for the top-end model in Google’s lineup.</p><p>This leak hints at a $200 price increase over last year’s Pro model. If Google follows the same pricing trend for the base Pixel 9, we might see it debut at $900.</p><p>The leaked U.S. prices for the Pixel 9 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/european-pixel-9-series-prices-leak">line up with the earlier European leaks</a>. Despite regional factors affecting final costs, the trend of a base price for the Pixel 9 Pro and a premium for the Pixel 9 Pro XL stays the same.</p><p>While the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro might see price hikes, there are rumors that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> could keep the same price tag as its predecessor. This could make Google&apos;s foldable phone a more competitive choice in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">high-end foldable</a> market.</p><p>The leaked prices might be a letdown for consumers. While it’s not surprising given Google&apos;s growing focus on high-end hardware, these price hikes make Pixel phones feel more exclusive than before.</p>

<h2 id="plenty-of-space-for-your-favorite-apps-2">Plenty of space for your favorite apps</h2>
<p>Google’s latest TV streaming device, Google TV Streamer, is a compact Android TV device with hardware that’s powerful enough to deliver 4K video and not too much else. This streamer is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/turns-out-the-new-google-tv-streamer-has-a-different-chip-under-the-hood">powered by a MediaTek SoC</a> with 4GB of system RAM and 32GB of total storage. The 8GB of storage found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast-google-tv-review">Chromecast with Google TV</a> was a pain point in our review, with a significant portion being used for the operating system. With 32GB of storage available, you should have no problem loading up the Google TV Streamer with all of your favorite streaming apps.</p><p>While 32GB should be plenty for the vast majority of users, the USB-C port supports data, which <em>9to5Google</em> has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/07/google-tv-streamer-external-storage/" target="_blank">confirmed will support storage expansion</a> with a USB hub and external USB storage drive. However, out of the box, it has plenty of storage to run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> without issue. It’s also nice that, even though it uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/turns-out-the-new-google-tv-streamer-has-a-different-chip-under-the-hood">same chip as the Amazon Fire TV Max</a>, it has improved on some specs like the RAM, storage, and inclusion of gigabit Ethernet. Ethernet is also an improvement over Chromecast devices and can help reduce the time spent buffering 4K HDR content. This is especially important since this device sticks with older 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) for wireless connections.</p><p>Speaking of wireless connections, the device supports Bluetooth 5.1 and can act as a smart home hub with Matter support, as well as work as a Thread border router.</p><p>At $99, the Google TV Streamer isn’t cheap, but it will likely be one of the best streaming devices you can get. Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tv-boxes">best Android TV boxes</a>, the Google TV Streamer has the most storage built-in, making it a great choice for those who download a lot of apps. It&apos;s nice to see external storage support, but for the vast majority of users, this streaming device has plenty of storage.</p>

It replaces the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-announces-chromecast-google-tv-its-first-tv-stick-years">Chromecast with Google TV</a>, which replaced the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast">Chromecast</a> models. Think of it as the successor to the small dongle that started it all with all the software and extras added along the way.</p><p>Google also bumped up the price substantially, charging $100. That&apos;s pretty steep compared to the $30 the previous model cost. However, it could be worth it, as it has better hardware that can support advanced media codecs and integrate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI models</a>. That depends on what you need it to do. </p><p>It&apos;s not for me, though, because I&apos;m not the target market, and Google knows it. This device was made for most people who do not need a "professional" device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="R6gNBNHh4ViaZf5GSX9B9F" name="nvidia-shield-tv-pro-remote-hero.jpg" alt="NVIDIA Shield" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R6gNBNHh4ViaZf5GSX9B9F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="532" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m still using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidias-shield-tv-pro-is-still-the-best-streaming-device-in-2024">Nvidia Shield TV Pro</a> because I want to do more than stream media from online sources. I have 8TB of storage attached to my Shield and use Plex, so I can stream my own media through the Shield. Yes, you can technically plug external storage into the Google TV Streamer, but the Shield was <em>made</em> to do this, and even has Plex built into the device&apos;s software.</p><p>Others do even more with devices like the Shield Pro—there are plenty of different ways to use a good "Pro" TV box, and having one that runs Android means there is plenty of ready-made software to help you do it.</p>
<p>People who use these advanced features aren&apos;t necessarily super-nerds. There is a market for hardware and software that makes setting up your own media streaming device pretty easy.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean very many people do it, though.</p>
<p>That&apos;s the thing with Google. The company does things we think are dumb, like killing off services and products or replacing a product everyone loves with something new and more expensive. It does it because it knows what people do with these services and devices.</p><p>Google decided that people would see the value in a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">Android TV</a> device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/turns-out-the-new-google-tv-streamer-has-a-different-chip-under-the-hood">with better hardware</a> that offers a better experience. It also decided that building a device that does more—and costs <em>much</em> more—is not something that would sell as easily because that market isn&apos;t very big. You could spend more money and try to make the TV Streamer into a home media streamer, but it wasn&apos;t designed to be.  </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7sycMDssfWc8meLrD4r3nU" name="chromecast-with-google-tv-aukey-usb-c-hub.jpg" alt="Chromecast With Google Tv Aukey Usb C Hub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7sycMDssfWc8meLrD4r3nU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And this isn&apos;t just a hunch. When you use any device or service, the companies behind them know what you&apos;re doing, when you&apos;re doing it, and when you stopped. Other metrics, like how you used it, help tell the company what people are really doing. Nodoby at Google is keeping track of what you watch on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> because it doesn&apos;t need to know; data from a single user is useless in this case. Google looks at the overall stats to help decide how to proceed.</p><p>When a company decides to make a new or revised product, it considers what most people want. In this case, I think the company made the right decision because almost nobody reading this will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-plex-media-server-your-nvidia-shield-tv">set up a Plex server</a> or turn a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/you-can-play-retro-games-on-practically-anything">streaming box into a game console</a>. People want something that is easy to use and works well.</p>
<p>Google&apos;s biggest problem was deciding how cheap they could sell it. A "new" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM?th=1">Shield TV Pro is $199.99</a> and that&apos;s a really good price if you have a use for it.  The somewhat new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review" target="_blank">Chromecast with Google TV HD</a> is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/us/product/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US" target="_blank">just $30,</a> and that&apos;s a steal if you want something to plug in, hook up to Wi-Fi, and just watch "stuff." This new Google TV Streamer aims to be the middle ground with better hardware that costs more.</p><p>In addition, Google added some cool stuff, like a home control panel and support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/android-15-matter-thread-netowrk-support-previewed" target="_blank">Thread and Matter</a>. You could say that some of this should have been there from the beginning, and I would agree, but this unifies Google&apos;s ecosystem of home products, and Google <strong>knows</strong> people wanted that to happen.</p>
<p>I can&apos;t decide if the Google TV Streamer is something you should buy without knowing why you want it. I&apos;m thinking about it because the new home control features have me curious about how well it works. It&apos;s not going to replace my Shield TV Pro, though, because it&apos;s already paid for and does exactly what I want it to do.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google details a back-to-school update for parents with kids rocking the Ace LTE smartwatch.</p><p>Kicking off Fitbit&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/fitbit/fitbit-ace-back-to-school-update/">line of updates</a> is support for Greenlight and GoHenry debit cards. The company states parents can add their child&apos;s card to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-launch">Ace LTE</a> for contactless payment where Google Pay is accepted. Fitbit states support for each financial service is deliberate as both help facilitate responsible spending in children. </p><p>The Ace LTE gains transaction alerts, spending limits, and "allowance for chores." This feature is rolling out today (August 7) for all users.</p><p>Additionally, families new to either payment service can enroll through the Fitbit Ace app for a discount.</p>

<p>Healthy habits can seem long-winded for kids, which is why Fitbit is introducing them on the Ace LTE in the form of "Daily Quests." In partnership with Alliance for a Healthier Generation, users will soon find quests for living better lives.</p><p>This next feature, School Time, hits the smartwatch so parents can have peace of mind regarding their child&apos;s focus. The post states that parents can set a specific time frame when the watch&apos;s features are limited to avoid distractions.</p><p>Parents can also set "lunchtime," which lets their child mess around with their device when it&apos;s appropriate, and sit attentively during class.</p>

<p>Fitbit is also working on a way for parents to add their child&apos;s sibling to their Ace LTE as a contact. This will be done through the Ace app and users can add an older child with a phone or a younger one with a smartwatch. Fitbit states this should roll out "later this year."</p><p>Fitbit&apos;s newest games, Spirit Garden and Sproutlings, come into play when school is said and done. The company states it bolstered the gaming experience by implementing haptic feedback and ear-catching sounds while leaning on the Ace LTE&apos;s built-in accelerometer. Sproutlings lets kids raise and nurture pets and grow crops.</p><p>Spirit Garden is a mindful game that aims to help kids relax after a long day with guided practices into spirited lands and shrines. Games are great, but Fitbit says more active kids will rack up more "game time" to reach new heights.</p><p>The post adds that the Fitbit Ace LTE is available for $30 off at the Google Store from August 11 to 25. What&apos;s more, if users grab the annual Ace Pass data plan before August 31, they&apos;ll save 50%.</p><p>If "School Time" sounds familiar it&apos;s because Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-school-time-parental-android-feature-detailed">announced the feature&apos;s arrival on Android</a> last week. The functionality is the same as the Ace LTE, however, parents enabling it on a phone can control what apps their child can use. When active, kids can tap the "Available Apps" button to select which their parent has previously deemed appropriate during school hours.</p>

<p>Fitbit's Ace LTE is an enjoyable, powerful experience for kids just getting into smartwatches. The device has a punch similar to the Pixel Watch 2 with an immersive, colorful display that makes game time even more exciting. Additionally, parents can use a few options to ensure their child's digital wellbeing.</p></p>

Not only are most smartwatches for kids irritatingly thick and chonky, but the software often leaves a lot to be desired.</p><p>That&apos;s where the experts at Fitbit and Google come in. The Fitbit Ace LTE is the latest and (mostly) greatest in a line of kid-focused Fitbit devices that does things completely differently from its predecessors. Not only is it the first LTE-enabled Fitbit Ace wearable, but it&apos;s also an actual smartwatch—not just an activity tracker like previous Fitbit Ace bands.</p><p>But this isn&apos;t just a Pixel Watch 2 inside a more kid-friendly package. Google and Fitbit designed the experience from the ground up so kids not only feel like they have a powerful smartwatch on their wrist but also so that they feel like wearing a smartwatch makes sense.</p><p>From high-quality 3D games that are designed to keep your kids active throughout the day to a Tamagotchi-like virtual pet that can be customized with activity reward tickets, this is easily the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">best smartwatch for kids</a> ever made.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Lm4J9tgT5bYqRxzW4g3JKn" name="fitbit-ace-lte-with-box-02.jpg" alt="The Fitbit Ace LTE with its box and all the contents" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lm4J9tgT5bYqRxzW4g3JKn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Fitbit Ace LTE retails for $229.95 and is sold at the Google Store, various carriers in the U.S., and stores like Best Buy and Amazon.</p><p>The Fitbit Ace LTE connects to the internet via Wi-Fi or LTE. A subscription is not required for basic Wi-Fi use but parents will need to subscribe to a Fitbit Ace Pass in order to activate LTE connectivity. An Ace Pass costs $9.99 per month or $119.99 per year.</p><p>The Fitbit Ace LTE ships with a charging cable, bumper case, and one band. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/us/product/strange_arcade_woven_band_fitbit_ace_lte">sells additional Ace Bands</a> for $34.99. Each band ships with a sticker pack and digital goodies on the watch, including unique Noodles for the watch face, a unique digital character, and unique items that can be unlocked through movement.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fitbit-ace-lte-what-i-love"><span>Fitbit Ace LTE: What I love</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XaVTvPAySzLpDikR82eH8f" name="fitbit-ace-lte-wearing-02.jpg" alt="A child wearing the Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XaVTvPAySzLpDikR82eH8f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>True to the Fitbit brand, the Fitbit Ace LTE is designed entirely around the concept of encouraging movement all day. Instead of boring step tracking or standing notifications, Fitbit Ace LTE gives kids movement points earned through various activities. More intense movement grants more points, so kids who play sports, jump on trampolines, or generally have a lot of active playtime will find they score higher points throughout the day.</p><p>Kids will also get daily quests to complete that will award bonus points, like climbing a certain number of stairs, walking a certain number of steps, or even just moving for a specific length of time.</p><p>What&apos;s fantastic is that these points can be used for several things throughout the day, encouraging kids to keep in touch with their health data while playing fun games or earning cool items. Games are designed to be played for a few minutes at a time—at most, something I&apos;ll cover more in the next section—but each game works a little bit differently.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:540px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="n3P8pEbJcFSCJoyqU2dojR" name="fitbit-ace-lte-fishing.gif" alt="Playing the fishing game on a Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n3P8pEbJcFSCJoyqU2dojR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="540" height="304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some games allow you to spend points you&apos;ve earned throughout the day on activities and turns, while others will only let you play for a few minutes before requiring more movement. The number of points or steps required for the next move is hard-coded into each game, for better or worse, which means your kids know what they&apos;re getting into each time they play.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Each of the six games preloaded onto the phone are active, as well, requiring kids to move around instead of just tap the screen a few times.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Each of the six games preloaded onto the watch is also active, requiring kids to move around instead of just tapping the screen a few times. My son&apos;s favorite game on the watch is a space strategy game where you conquer planets by defeating enemy squadrons. Aside from encouraging basic strategy skills, each round lets players physically aim with their wrists to blow up ships.</p><p>Likewise, the fishing game has players casting their line with their wrist, then reeling it by pulling it toward their body (see GIF above). Another game has kids dancing and wiggling around, while yet another is a kaiju golfing experience. What&apos;s particularly cool is that these six games will be refreshed every few months, providing plenty of entertainment value over the coming months.</p><p>That also helps give the monthly subscription cost a bit more added value since you&apos;ll constantly be getting new things. In fact, the first round of updated games just launched on August 7.</p>

<p>Points can also be spent on customizing your Eejie, a sort of Tamagotchi-meets-Animal Crossing-type virtual pet that lives in Bit Valley. You can play games and buy furniture or outfits that can be used to further customize the Eejie and its space. As you level up, your Eejie&apos;s home gets bigger and you gain access to more items.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I want this virtual pet-meets-Animal Crossing game on my Pixel Watch now.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>My colleague, Michael Hicks, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatches-should-add-virtual-pets-like-tamagotchi-for-fitness-motivation">has wanted this very kind of thing</a> on regular smartwatches for a while now. I also echo those sentiments and want to see Google and Fitbit bring this to the broader Wear OS ecosystem.</p>
<p>Buying additional Ace bands for your watch will also unlock new Eejies and new items and outfits that can be earned. You can even link Eejie&apos;s together if you have more than one child with a Fitbit Ace LTE or if their friends have one.</p><p>The bands themselves are very easy to add and remove with a handy button that you push in and then down. You&apos;ll need to have it off the wrist for this, so there&apos;s no danger of the band accidentally falling off, even during the craziest of times.</p><p>Swapping out a band will automatically change the Noodle on the watch face—that&apos;s the animated snake or worm-like creature that wraps around the time—but the Noodle can always be changed out if your child doesn&apos;t like the one that matches the band.</p>

<p>Kids will also love wearing the Fitbit Ace LTE because the hardware is so darn sleek looking. It&apos;s quite similar looking to some of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">best Fitbit</a> trackers and smartwatches, which says a lot given the way most kids smartwatches look.</p><p>Case in point, my other two favorite smartwatches for kids, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids">Garmin Bounce</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/t-mobile-syncup-kids-watch-review">T-Mobile SyncUP</a>, are both undeniably chunky, especially when compared to the Fitbit Ace LTE. Not only that, but the Ace LTE is lighter and nicer looking overall, helping make it feel cool to wear such a nice-looking gadget.</p><p>The Fitbit Ace LTE is also surprisingly durable. The included bumper case snaps on easily and, thankfully, stays put even during vigorous activity. My son wore it to regular ninja warrior classes and even ran a 2-mile Spartan kids&apos; run with it on, and the watch still looks pristine. The bumper has some obvious scuffs on it, but that&apos;s fine since that&apos;s what it&apos;s made for.</p>

<p>There are only two buttons on the watch: the top one opens contacts, while the bottom one opens the arcade. Swiping down on the watch face brings up quick settings, and swiping up opens notifications. Swiping right shows your daily quests, while swiping left brings up Bit Valley.</p><p>Kids can call, text, or voice message any contacts that parents have input into the Fitbit Ace app on their smartphones. The UI itself is similar to any Wear OS watch, so if you&apos;re already a Wear OS user, you&apos;ll be able to jump in and familiarize yourself quickly.</p><p>You can even use tap-to-pay with the watch with supported debit and credit cards. Google only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-debit-card-school-returns-update">just launched this functionality</a>, though, so I wasn&apos;t able to test it for the review.</p><p>Parents can set up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-school-time-parental-android-feature-detailed">school time</a> on the watch and limit the available activities during those scheduled hours. I didn&apos;t need to use those since it&apos;s summer, but they&apos;re there when you need them.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5LMyo2ZctPAWvjM53HPy8X" name="fitbit-ace-lte-bit-valley.jpg" alt="Customizing the Eejie home on the Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5LMyo2ZctPAWvjM53HPy8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicho)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I gave the Fitbit Ace LTE to my son, I was most excited to see how he liked the games. After all, one of the reasons the T-Mobile SyncUp watch is his previous favorite kids&apos; watch is because it has the famous Dino game on it. To say he was elated with the upgrade in visuals and interactivity in the Fitbit Ace LTE&apos;s games is an understatement.</p><p>That is until he ran up against the first "more activity required" message. My son isn&apos;t a couch potato unless we let him be, but the amount of activity the watch requires for such short sessions takes some of the fun away. His favorite space strategy game typically gives kids one full turn before requiring more movement. This isn&apos;t just a little bit of movement, either. It&apos;s like 20 minutes of running around.</p><p>The ratio feels more like an amusement park ride than anything, making you wait for ages before giving you just a few minutes (or seconds) of playtime. Fitbit calls this "interval-based gaming" and says that game sessions are designed to be 5 minutes or less.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>While the lack of fitness goal control annoyed me, the way points worked downright frustrated my son.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The concept is solid, and I like that there are obvious, "natural" limits to the games told through narrative, as Fitbit describes it, but I felt like the ratio of play-to-work was a bit off. As a parent, I&apos;d love it if Fitbit added a way for me to adjust these ratios and goals to better fit my son&apos;s goals or habits, even if that means keeping them in a range instead of giving me total free reign.</p><p>But while the lack of control annoys me, the way that points work downright frustrates my son. That&apos;s because each game works a bit differently in regard to movement mechanics and points. The space strategy game, for instance, requires you to use your points as you earn them. Most turns take between 12 and 18 movement points to play, which is theoretically fine, but the problem comes in when you&apos;re not looking at the watch constantly.</p><p>That&apos;s because you can&apos;t "bank" or store points. While you&apos;ll earn them throughout the day, you can only use so many at a time. In this game&apos;s case, only one turn may be "bought" at a time. That means if you ran a Spartan race like my son did this past weekend, all those points you earned still only give you one turn. In short, it just doesn&apos;t feel fair.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You can't bank movement points. That means if you ran a Spartan race like my son did this past weekend, all those points you earned still only give you one turn in a game. In short, it just doesn't feel fair.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Some of these limitations are designed with battery life in mind. The watch is rated at 16 hours of battery life per charge, and amazingly, my son never had the watch die on him once over the past several weeks. That certainly means the games are well-designed for this purpose, but it would still be nice to be able to scale things.</p><p>I was also a bit surprised at the lack of detailed health data provided by the watch. The Fitbit Ace LTE is essentially a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Google Pixel Watch 2</a> built for kids. It&apos;s got the same health sensors on the underside, the same powerful processor inside, and it even uses the same charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AFn5Vbhk3kRwQhMKDcM5PL" name="0806.jpg" alt="A message saying you need to move to earn more movements in a Fitbit Ace LTE game" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AFn5Vbhk3kRwQhMKDcM5PL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So why can&apos;t it do sleep tracking or let me see a graph of my son&apos;s heart rate throughout the day? All of the health data is wrapped into the watch&apos;s points system, and while the watch gives me some stats—light and active minutes throughout the day, number of floors climbed, and number of steps taken—I&apos;d love to be able to dial down into these more.</p><p>Likewise, there&apos;s no "workout" mode for kids who want to track their own health metrics during the day. It&apos;s a very set-it-and-forget-it kind of watch, which is both good and bad.</p><p>There are also no apps of any kind, unlike a full-fledged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>. That&apos;s not different from most kid-focused smartwatches, but it is a little surprising to see that Google and Fitbit don&apos;t at least have some kind of curated section of the Play Store for smartwatch apps for kids.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Nce9KSpEPau3bskCsUde6e" name="T-Mobile-SyncUP-KIDS-Watch-home-screen.jpg" alt="The T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nce9KSpEPau3bskCsUde6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/t-mobile-syncup-kids-watch-review">T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch</a> is my recommendation as the best alternative to the Fitbit Ace LTE for one main reason: video calling. There&apos;s something about being able to see your child on the other end of a call that gives you a boost of confidence, knowing you can see they&apos;re secure, not just hear it. Otherwise, lack of Wi-Fi and a requirement to use T-Mobile&apos;s network mean it&apos;s a worse buy for other reasons.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids">Garmin Bounce</a> offers some similar fun activity tracking features but doesn&apos;t feature anywhere near the robust health metrics of the Fitbit Ace LTE. Of course, Fitbit doesn&apos;t give you most of this data, but it&apos;s still tracked via the points system. The Garmin Bounce has much better battery life than the Ace, though, making it a no-brainer for anyone who doesn&apos;t want to charge every day.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a powerful, fun, and easy-to-use smartwatch for kids.</li><li>You want a smartwatch for kids that looks like a grown-up watch.</li><li>Your kids love games and can be motivated by them to move more throughout the day.</li></ul>

<p>The Fitbit Ace LTE is a brilliant smartwatch for kids that is now my new favorite. The past year has delivered some truly excellent kids&apos; smartwatches, and this is the creme de la creme. It&apos;s got brilliant fitness tracking and motivational games to keep your kids moving—something I&apos;d expect from the Fitbit brand—and battery life long enough to work throughout the day.</p><p>My biggest complaint is that the watch is a little too simple on the parental control side of things. There&apos;s no way to adjust how much activity your kids need to unlock reward goals. While I appreciate the doctor-approved defaults, I prefer them to be just that — defaults that can be adjusted, not requirements.</p><p>But I can look past most of that because of the brilliance of the system and the overall polish of this product. This is a smartwatch for kids like no other. Everything from the sleek hardware to the slick software design is a notch above anything else out there. That doesn&apos;t mean there aren&apos;t some other watches that might appeal to you or your kids more for one reason or another, but this one is going to be the best for most people.</p>

Outside of work he loves sports teams that disappoint him (Go Sharks, A's and Golden Bears!), D&D and Star Wars RPG campaigns, SFF novels, long runs, gaming on consoles and PC, and baking. During work, he'll do his best to make sure he doesn't recommend any product unless he'd regularly use it himself.</p>

<p>Harish Jonnalagadda tries to make sense of the befuddling maze that is the Asian smartphone industry. Before switching to phones, he used to write about PC hardware, covering motherboards and video cards. When he's not playing with the latest phones, he's either reading on his Kindle or trying to clear his backlog of games on Steam. He can also be found shouting at the TV over the weekends at Arsenal and McLaren's continued woes.</p>

Andrew drinks way too much coffee, but it's what keeps the motor going on a daily basis.

The wording of this post has been modified to reflect that.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Ready at Dawn Studios, part of Oculus Studios, is closing permanently, effective immediately.</li><li>The studio produced some of the highest-rated VR games ever, including Lone Echo, Lone Echo 2, and Echo VR, as well as some PSP classics like God of War and Daxter.</li><li>Meta says that Ready at Dawn employees are encouraged to apply to other studios within the Oculus Studios umbrella.</li><li>The reduction was made to meet the new Reality Labs budgetary ceiling rather than as a proactive cost-saving initiative.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>One of VR&apos;s greatest development studios is closing its doors permanently today (Aug. 7). Ready at Dawn Studios was behind the famed Echo VR and Lone Echo games, all of which received critical and customer acclaim. But the studio hasn&apos;t launched a new game since Echo VR was ported to Quest in May 2020, and it&apos;s likely sales of Lone Echo 2 could have played a part in the decision since that&apos;s a PCVR-only game.</p><p>Meta first made cuts to the studio <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/your-favorite-oculus-quest-games-are-getting-canceled-heres-why">last February</a> when it announced it would shutter Echo VR despite still having a player count "in the low 10 thousands," as noted by Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth at the time. It&apos;s worth noting that Meta just stated that Quest 3 sales are "exceeding their expectations" in the company&apos;s most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q2-2024-earnings">quarterly earnings call last week</a>.</p><p>One report <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4-leaked-release-date">in mid-July</a> said that Meta was cutting its Reality Labs division&apos;s budget by 20% by 2026, and an internal memo sent to Meta employees by Gio Hunt, VP Oculus Studios — seen by Android Central — supports this reasoning. A Meta spokesperson told Android Central that the cuts weren&apos;t being made to "save money," per se. Rather, these cuts are being made to ensure that Reality Labs stays within the new budgetary constraints and that Oculus Studios can make a "better long-term impact" in VR development.</p><p>Meta also commented that this isn&apos;t a signal of wider cuts to the number of first-party games on Quest and that the company is still committed to VR development.</p>

<p>While Reality Labs has historically spent billions per quarter on development costs of XR hardware like the Meta Quest 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>, VR games, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Meta AI features</a>, the company is starting to put a hard cap on that spending each quarter.</p><p>Ready at Dawn has been a part of Oculus Studios since June 2020, just a few weeks after Echo VR was ported to the original Oculus Quest. Meta says that Ready at Dawn employees are encouraged to apply elsewhere within Oculus Studios and that the company wants to retain as many talented developers as possible.</p><p>Meta also explains that while this move shutters the entire studio, it isn&apos;t enough to trigger the California WARN Act. The WARN Act requires companies to give employees notice ahead of time if more than 50 employees are laid off in a 30-day period. All employees will receive severance pay similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-may-2023-layoffs">previous rounds</a> of Meta layoffs.</p><p>Meta didn&apos;t provide a comment when asked about the possibility of Quest ports for Lone Echo or Lone Echo 2 by other Oculus Studios developers.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s digital wallet is preparing to receive another state&apos;s ID as it continues to build up its support portfolio.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/google-wallet-california-id/">9to5Google</a>, the State of California is working on supporting a legal digital ID in Google Wallet at some point this year. The state has reportedly started testing support for Wallet among DMV employees and will likely extend this to regular civilians in the future. Early information suggests that adding the state&apos;s ID to Wallet will be straightforward.</p><p>Users can soon hop into Wallet&apos;s settings and tap "Add to Wallet." From there, tapping "ID Card" will inform users what&apos;s required to proceed.</p><p>The good news here is that it doesn&apos;t seem as though users will need California&apos;s created app, CA DMV Wallet, to use a digital ID. This should save users time as Wallet is typically available across all Android phones and can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">hold a majority of your bank cards</a>, credit cards, and more.</p><p>The digital state ID variant will let Californians use it at "select" terminals at SFO (San Francisco International Airport), SJC (San Jose International Airport), and LAX (Los Angeles International Airport).</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">Earlier this year</a>, Google&apos;s director of product management for Google Wallet, Dong Min Kim mentioned that "more states" will support digital IDs in the following months. There weren&apos;t any specifics discussed, however, it seems California will be among the new states enabling support. Wallet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-digital-ids-for-three-more-us-states">has supported</a> Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, and Maryland IDs since 2023.</p><p>Digital wallets, specifically Google, have had some maneuvering to do considering support for state IDs requires a close working relationship with the state in question. Additionally, Kim states that Google wants to get Wallet to a point where folks can leave the physical version at home — but that&apos;s a far-off reality.</p><p>While digital IDs are useful for convenience, it&apos;s still recommended that people bring the physical version in case something goes wrong.</p><p>In other news, it was discovered that Google wants Wallet to help users store "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-everything-else-spotted">everything else</a>." An APK teardown showed the company&apos;s work to develop a text-based document scanning feature for student IDs, passports, and resident cards.
